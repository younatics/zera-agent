Nathan Cleverly, celebrating his win back in 2011, says he will beat Tony Bellew again on Saturday . The fighter from Liverpool will be in his hometown to welcome Cleverly for a huge rematch . 'I think the fight will be similar to the first, but more explosive. I believe my stronger fitness will wear him down, and I'll get the late stoppage,' Cleverly told 666BET. 'If I get a repeat win against him, this time at cruiserweight, he should just retire and admit that he's lost to the better man. He's put himself up on a pedestal but I'm going to beat him again.' As well as referencing Huck, Cleverly was also asked about Sergey Kovalev, who knocked Cleverly out last year. He added: 'I would jump at the chance to fight for a second world title in a second division, that is my goal. I'd have no problem going to Germany to fight Marco Huck.

"Stoke boss Mark Hughes believes former Barcelona forward Bojan Krkic has found his feet in England and can be a big hit in the Barclays Premier League this season. Many were surprised when Bojan swapped the Nou Camp for the Britannia in a £3million-move in the summer and the former Barca trainee enjoyed a promising start, scoring three times during pre-season. Bojan struggled to transfer that form into the first few games of the Premier League season but the 24-year-old started and scored a superb opening goal in Stoke's 2-1 victory at Tottenham on Sunday. Stoke striker Bojan Krkic celebrates after scoring in his side's 2-1 win at Tottenham on Sunday . The former Barcelona man opened the scoring for Mark Hughes' side with a fine strike at White Hart Lane . 'We're really pleased he's finally come to the fore,' Hughes said. 'He started like a house on fire in pre-season and I think people got a bit carried away too early - we all felt it was going to take him time to adjust. 'I played him the first two games and he found it difficult to have an impact. 'He's bided his time though and we've reintroduced him now and he's had the benefit of three or four months training at the intensity he needs and he's looking a very accomplished player again.' Bojan was considered one of the most talented strikers in Europe while he was coming through the ranks at Barcelona but the Spaniard was unable to live up to expectations during loan spells at Roma, AC Milan and Ajax. Stoke boss Mark Hughes believes Bojan is starting to find his best form after a difficult start in the league . Bojan came through Barcelona's academy but was allowed to leave for the Premier League last summer . Hughes, however, believes the creative forward has the strengths to be a success in the Premier League. 'We're going to benefit from his ability and his goalscoring because he's a good talent when he gets in good areas of the field,' Hughes added. 'He gets shots off early and its difficult for keepers to react quickly enough. He'll score goals for us this year.'","Stoke beat Tottenham 2-1 on Sunday to go ninth in the Premier League .

"With Bolton in talks over a £40million Thai takeover, Neil Lennon’s side continue to show signs of progress on the pitch following a third win in five games under their new manager. Lennon’s third victory in five games since he replaced Dougie Freedman gives him an identical record to new Cardiff boss Russell Slade, even though it was not enough to lift Bolton out of the Championship relegation zone. ‘It’s the best we’ve played since I came here against a very good side,’ said Lennon. ‘That performance will give the boys a huge lift. We can’t keep going win lose, win lose, we’ve set the standard now.’ Liam Feeney wheels away after scoring his first of the night as Bolton saw off Cardiff . Feeney sticks his boot in to Fabio as Bolton sealed a precious win to boost their hopes of rising up the table . Bolton:  Lonergan 7; Vela 6, Mills 6.5, Dervite 5.5, Ream 7; M Davies 6 (Spearing 52, 6), Danns 7; Feeney 8 (Clayton 71, 6.5), Chung-Yong 7.5, Pratley 7; C Davies 7 (Beckford 84). Subs not used: Moxey, Kenny, Trotter, Threlkeld. Booked: Pratley. Goals: Feeney 9, 36, Mills, 76. Cardiff: Marshall 5; Brayford 6, Manga 5.5, S Morrison 5, Fabio 6; Noone 7, Gunnarsson 6, Whittingham 6, Ralls 5.5 (R Morrison 46, 6); Le Fondre 6 (Maynard 74, 6), Macheda 5.5. Subs not used: Turner, Kim, Connolly, Moore, Ravel Morrison, Gabbidon. Booked: Ravel Morrison. Attendance: 12,961. Referee: Geoff Eltringham. A richly deserved Bolton win was built on Liam Feeney’s first goals for the club. The first came in the ninth minute when Darren Pratley made a run from inside his own half and fed Chung-Yong Lee wide on the right. The South Korean’ s low cross into the box picked out Feeney who swept the ball across goalkeeper David Marshall and into the far corner. Captain Matt Mills had a header cleared off the line by Craig Noone before Feeney grabbed a second goal nine minutes before half-time. Pratley was involved again in a slick move on the left before clipping a cross to the back post where Feeney squeezed another first-time effort past Marshall from a difficult angle. He could have completed a hat-trick in the second half after great work by the impressive Craig Davies but blasted well over. Feeney was replaced by Max Clayton shortly afterwards and it was the substitute who set up a rather fortuitous third goal for Mills in the 76th minute. Matt Mills scores his team's third goal with a crisp shot from inside the penalty area . Skipper Mills celebrates after putting the gloss on a convincing victory for Bolton . Clayton’s low cross from the left picked out his captain 15 yards from goal and his mis-hit shot left Marshall wrong-footed as it bobbled past the keeper and into the far corner. Without their top scorer Kenwyne Jones, who has been given compassionate leave to return home to Trinidad, Cardiff’s best chances fell to Federico Macheda but he failed to convert and then Andy Lonergan produced an outstanding late save to deny substitute Nicky Maynard. It left Cardiff still waiting for their first away win of the season and Slade was furious over the way his team succumbed in the first half. ‘I’m bitterly disappointed,’ he said. ‘It was the most disappointing 45 minutes since I’ve been here and I was raging. Neil Lennon (right) shouts instructions to his team as Cardiff counterpart Russell Slade looks on . ‘We were aware that they are strong starters but we lost too many battles in the first half. Some of our decisions were poor and we allowed the ball to come into our box far too easily and got punished for that. ‘In the second period we tried to get back in the game and perhaps if we had got the next goal it would have been a different outcome. But overall Bolton deserved their win tonight.’ It could not be better timed for Wanderers amid the interest from Thailand. Cardiff, under their colourful Malaysian owner Vincent Tan, know all about the ups and downs that could bring.","Feeney struck twice in the first-half to put the Trotters in the driving seat .

"Virgil van Dijk's last-minute goal earned 10-man Celtic a 2-1 victory over Aberdeen at Pittodrie in a Scottish Premiership contest that was laced with controversy. Celtic captain Scott Brown was sent off in a bad-tempered affair which was preceded by a disrupted Remembrance Sunday silence. Aberdeen went ahead in the 27th minute when Adam Rooney netted from close range following some unconvincing goalkeeping from Lukasz Zaluska, who started after Craig Gordon suffered a neck injury. Virgil van Dijk celebrates after his last-minute goal earned Celtic a 2-1 win against Aberdeen . The Celtic defender was left unmarked to tap home from Stefan Johansen's cross . Stefan Johansen capitalised on some hesitancy between Aberdeen goalkeeper Scott Brown and defender Mark Reynolds to slide home 11 minutes later. Niall McGinn came close on numerous occasions after the break - including a shot against the post - and he drew the foul that earned Brown a second booking with nine minutes left. But van Dijk stunned most of the 19,051 crowd when he tapped home from two yards after the home defence had allowed Johansen's corner to travel all the way to the back post. The build-up to the game was dominated by the ongoing row surrounding Aleksandar Tonev's seven-match ban for using offensive language of a 'racist nature' towards Aberdeen full-back Shay Logan. Celtic submitted their appeal on Wednesday and manager Ronny Deila and skipper Brown upset Dons boss Derek McInnes with the strength of their proclamations protesting Tonev's innocence. Aberdeen's Adam Rooney opened the scoring with a close range finish . Aberdeen teammates pounce on Rooney to celebrate taking the lead . Tonev was left out of the Celtic squad though and the issue then proved peripheral until the second half, when Logan was playing on the side of the stadium holding the Celtic fans, who jeered him when he got the ball. The home fans responded with their vocal backing, just as they had sung his name before the game, moments before the scheduled minute's silence. There was not even a second of silence though as some Celtic fans shouted and sang, both inside and outside Pittodrie, while others tried to shout them down. The controversy continued into the game with a major flashpoint after two minutes. Brown appeared to push Peter Pawlett over on the threshold of the box as he chased the Aberdeen midfielder but referee Alan Muir waved play on. Johansen takes advantage of Aberdeen keeper Scott Brown's hesitation to net the equaliser . Johansen (2L) retrieves the ball and is chased by teammates after bringing Celtic level . Aberdeen lost Willo Flood to a hamstring injury inside nine minutes with Barry Robson coming on. Celtic had made five changes with James Forrest among those coming in for his first appearance for almost two months following a hamstring injury. There were nearly 20 minutes gone before either side had a meaningful effort, Anthony Stokes steering a first-time effort just past the far post following a sharp passing move. The lack of goalmouth action continued until Zaluska failed to claim Andrew Considine's long throw under pressure from Rooney inside his six-yard box. The ball was only half-cleared to Considine who drove it towards goal. Zaluska got down to stop it but could not hold and Rooney was on hand to force the rebound inside the post despite attempts to stop him from the Pole and several defenders. Celtic captain Scott Brown (2R) is sent off after receiving a second caution for a tackle on Niall McGinn . Van Dijk had a header saved and Celtic levelled after Charlie Mulgrew's halfway-line challenge on McGinn sparked a quick break. Stokes slipped a pass through to Johansen and the Norwegian slid to reach the ball and wrapped his foot around it to flick it into the net despite Reynolds and his goalkeeper appearing to have the situation under control. The Norwegian almost emulated his midweek long-range strike in Romania moments later but Brown got down well to stop his powerful first-time effort from 25 yards. The Aberdeen goalkeeper stopped a shot from his namesake early in the second half and McGinn three times came close for the hosts, shooting inches over from 25 yards before hitting the outside of the post from closer in and then heading wide from 12 yards. Celtic fans were in full voice throughout the game, although some disrupted the minute's silence at the start . Van Dijk wheels away to celebrate his late winner at Pittodrie . The game grew increasingly hostile. Stokes received a yellow card following an exchange with the home support after he kicked the ball into the crowd, Emilio Izaguirre and Jonny Hayes were booked after the Celtic left-back reacted angrily to a challenge, and Celtic's Brown was cautioned for the latest in a series of fouls on Pawlett. Logan almost helped silence the visiting crowd when he helped set up Ryan Jack via McGinn but Zaluska stopped the midfielder's header. Brown got his second yellow card for taking down McGinn, who curled the resulting free-kick just over. However, van Dijk stunned the home crowd in the final minute and Zaluska saved from McGinn in injury-time.","Celtic came back to defeat Aberdeen 2-1 in their SPL match at Pittodrie .

"Brentford midfielder Tommy Smith has his eyes on a spot of revenge as well as joint-second place in the Sky Bet Championship ahead of Friday's derby with Fulham. The Bees have won their last three matches to climb to sixth place but Fulham are also in fine form having been revitalised since Kit Symons took over from Felix Magath, whose only win during a disastrous start to the season came at Griffin Park in the Capital One Cup. 'They are a different team now,' Smith said. 'A few of the players under Magath weren't involved then for whatever reason and they have come back in and made a difference and it's showing on the pitch. Tommy Smith (centre), pictured scoring for Brentford in August, is eyeing revenge against Fulham on Friday . Fulham manager Kit Symons (second left) has also been away on international duty this week, as assistant manager with Wales . 'We made a few changes that night as well so it's a completely different game. 'The mood in our camp is very good. It all came together in one week with three good performances back to back which is very pleasing. Now we have one to look forward to on Friday night and we owe them one after the cup game.' Brentford, who were only promoted from League One last season, would move to within a point of leaders Derby with a victory over their west London rivals and Smith insists they are among the front-runners on merit. 'There was always going to be a big transition from League One to the Championship but we've managed it very well and we are delighted to be sitting where we are in the league,' he added. Ross McCormack (second left) scored against Brentford when the two teams met in the Capital One Cup . 'It's getting to that stage of the season where the table is actually a good picture of how well you have done so far, so you are aware of where you are and we want to be near the top. 'It doesn't detract from the game, the big thing is to get the three points and then look at the table and enjoy it after the game. 'Fulham will want to ruffle our feathers, the atmosphere was fantastic last time but we have to resist playing the occasion and not the game.' Cardiff manager Russell Slade is glad to be back on home turf when his side host Reading. City have won all three of their home matches since Slade took over, but have picked up just one point on the road. 'We're not helping ourselves with our away form but we're not doing too much wrong and we're pleased we've scored goals at home,' said Slade. 'Reading are a team that like to go forward, play with a nice intensity and score goals, even if their away form again doesn't marry up with their home form. 'But we'll go into the game with confidence as we've done well at home and we want to continue in the same vein.'","Brentford face Fulham in a London derby on Friday evening .

"Bolton chairman Phil Gartside has flown out to Thailand amid reports that Thai businessmen want to buy the Sky Bet Championship club. Talk of a takeover at Wanderers first emanated from Asia last week when Brian Marcar, managing director of media company BEC-Tero, publicly expressed an interest in the team currently residing in the second tier's bottom three. Gartside had originally cooled such speculation by telling the Bolton News that Marcar's quotes came as a 'complete surprise' to him. Bolton chairman Phil Gartside has flown out to Thailand amid reports that businessmen want to buy the club . However, speaking at a press conference on Monday morning, Wanderers manager Neil Lennon confirmed Gartside had now gone to Thailand for further discussions. 'I don't know about selling it but I know he's away in Thailand to discuss a proposition from some Thai businessmen,' Lennon said. 'What that is, I've no idea. What the ins and outs of it are, I don't know. I'll know more when Phil comes back.' Things have not being going well at the Reebok Stadium with the club's debt reaching £163.8million . Bolton's debt, which reached a staggering £163.8million when the most recent accounts were published in December, has been well-documented, yet Marcar insists such figures would not stand in his way, with the majority of that deficit owed to owner Eddie Davies. BEC-Tero already own a Thai Premier League side which has former Chelsea and West Ham manager Avram Grant as its technical director, a position formerly held by ex-England boss Sven-Goran Eriksson. 'As for the bid to take over Bolton, I must admit I have a close relationship with the club's president,' Marcar told Thailand's The Nation newspaper last week. Bolton manager Neil Lennon confirmed Gartside had now gone to Thailand for further discussions . 'The club has plenty of property, and most importantly, they have their own stadium, hotel and football academy. 'In terms of their financial status, they made profits between 2004 and 2006, but suffered losses since then, with their debt now standing at 150 million pounds. 'However, the club is willing to address this situation. They're quite ready in almost every aspect. That will help us benefit in many ways, especially when it comes to Thai players playing in England.' Earlier this month, Gartside had confirmed he would entertain prospective buyers. 'If you want to go and put a for sale sign outside, do it,' he said in an interview with the Bolton News. 'Every club is for sale. If someone knocks on the door and says they want to buy the club, we'd listen. 'It's not for want of putting that message out that we haven't changed ownership. But you have guard against who you sell it to. 'Hopefully, Eddie is not going to sell it to just anybody. It's the same with me; anyone who walks through the door will get an audience, but having done that it's about due diligence that they do on the football club and that is done on them. 'Eddie would want to sell it to someone who is responsible, who has belief in it. He would want to know it's not a property strip.'","Bolton Wanderers manager Neil Lennon confirmed Phil Gartside had gone to Thailand for further discussions .

"Darren Fletcher may have to consider a move away from Manchester United this January after falling down the pecking order for club and country. The United midfielder has made only three Barclays Premier League starts for his club this season and has made only two substitute appearances totalling 26 minutes since the end of August. Meanwhile the popular Scot has slipped out of his national team, too. Scottish midfielder Darren Fletcher could be set for a January move away from Manchester United . Fletcher, who will be 31 in the New Year, has a chance of playing in Tuesday night’s friendly against England at Celtic Park but, crucially, was not in the starting line-up when Gordon Strachan’s team beat the Republic of Ireland in their Euro 2016 qualifier in Glasgow last Friday. Having recovered from the bowel condition that threatened his career three years ago, Fletcher has been fit all season after United manager Louis van Gaal made him vice-captain in the summer. Indeed Fletcher’s team-mates have praised his efforts in training and his general fitness. 'He doesn't miss a training session,' said United skipper Wayne Rooney on Monday. Fletcher has also fallen down the Scotland pecking order under Gordon Strachan . 'He trains really hard, so I'm really pleased he's managed to come through. 'He's back fit and ready to play.' Fletcher is known as a great professional and character to have round the dressing room at Old Trafford. Indeed he was in good spirits at the Scotland camp at Mar Hall outside Glasgow. Nevertheless he has not been offered the opportunity to impact on United’s season by Van Gaal since the end of summer.

"Bulgaria have sacked coach Luboslav Penev after a poor start to their Euro 2016 qualifying campaign, the Balkan country's football union (BFU) announced on Thursday. 'We terminated Penev's contract,' BFU president Borislav Mihaylov told a news conference. 'The team didn't perform well and we almost lost our chances to qualify for the (Euro 2016) finals, although the top two teams qualify automatically. 'I hope we'll have a new coach by the New Year. I can tell you that the new coach will not be a foreigner.' The Bulgarian national team line up before their match against Malta - Luboslav Penev's last game in charge . Andrej Galabinov (right) celebrates after scoring for Bulgaria against Malta in Sofia last week . Penev, 48, extended his initial two-year deal last November but a disappointing start to their Euro 2016 qualifying campaign triggered his dismissal after three years in charge. Bulgaria, who have failed to reach a major tournament since 2004, are fourth in Group H with four points from as many games, six adrift of leaders Croatia and Italy and five behind Norway. Their poor run continued on Sunday when they drew 1-1 with Malta in their last qualifier with Penev and the players severely criticised by the fans and local media after lacklustre performances over the last two months. Penev (right) in action during his playing days for Celta Vigo, battling with Aston Villa's Gareth Southgate . Former Bulgaria striker Penev, one of the country's soccer icons, has been under the spotlight after Bulgaria were beaten by Croatia and Norway in October but the BFU decided to give him 'a second chance'. Penev was appointed as coach in November, 2011, replacing German Lothar Matthaus whose contract was not renewed following a poor Euro 2012 qualifying campaign. Under Penev, Bulgaria were in second place in their group for most of the 2014 World Cup qualifying campaign but losses to Armenia and the Czech Republic in their final matches meant they missed out on the tournament in Brazil. Penev was the eighth Bulgaria manager to be sacked or leave the post since 2007.","The Bulgarian Football Association have sacked Luboslav Penev .

"Chris Froome admits the 2015 Tour de France may be too big a mountain for him to climb. The 2015 route was unveiled in Paris on Wednesday and Froome said: ‘Next year’s Tour is going to be about the mountains. There’s very little emphasis on time-trialling which means the race will be decided up in the high mountains. ‘With six mountain-top finishes it is going to be an aggressive and massively demanding race.’ VIDEO Scroll down to watch Route announced for the 2015 Giro . Chris Froome was not in Paris for the presentation of the 3,344-kilometre route . A map displays the route of the 2015 Tour De France as it is unveiled in Paris on Wednesday . Froome, 29, won the 2013 Tour, but crashed out of this year’s race, which started in Yorkshire and was won by Astana’s Italian Vincenzo Nibali. Rather than chase a second yellow jersey on the 2015 Tour, which starts in Utrecht on July 4 and finishes in Paris on July 26, Froome may instead focus on May’s Giro d’Italia and August’s Vuelta a Espana. Froome was not in Paris on Wednesday, instead he was sailing in Weymouth with the British Sailing squad on a Team Sky training camp. On seeing the route he made a statement on his website, saying: ‘The team and I will have to give it some careful consideration before we make any commitments to which of the grand tours I will compete in. Froome, riding for Sky, in action during stage 16 of the 2013 Tour de France .

If I did the Giro I may also be able to get myself back in shape for the Vuelta and go there with a realistic chance.’ It was anticipated the 2015 Tour would be a vintage edition, with Froome, Nibali, two-time winner Alberto Contador and Giro d’Italia winner Nairo Quintana all chasing the yellow jersey. The probable absence of Froome, twice runner-up in the Vuelta — including behind Contador in 2014 — would take the gloss off the race. But he added: ‘In the past I’ve only targeted one grand tour each season, but it could be a good opportunity for me to focus seriously on two.’ British cyclist Mark Cavendish attends the 2015 Tour De France Route Presentation in Paris .

"Lukas Podolski has insisted Arsenal's domestic season is not over because Chelsea will not run away with the Premier League like Bayern Munich in the Bundesliga. The 29-year-old striker also said he wants talks with Arsene Wenger as he continues to be left out of the battle to turn the club's season around. Arsenal have dropped 12 points behind Chelsea after only 11 matches but ahead of the visit of Manchester United on Saturday, Podolski believes the competitive nature of the Premier League means the curtain cannot be brought down on the title race just yet. Lukas Podolski said the competitive nature of the Premier League means the title race is far from over . The German forward said that England is not like Spain or Germany where one team can dominate the league . He said: 'You can always speak about problems but the season is not finished. The Premier League is the best league in the world. It is not like in Spain where you have two teams or in Germany where you have just Bayern Munich. 'Here you see it every week that every game is tough. Home and away every team is hard to play and you can never say that the three points are easy to get. In other leagues a team might have only three top games in a season but not here. We lost our last game and it's a big match against Manchester United so we have to win it.' The German forward is yet to start this season in the league and has made only four appearances. His international coach Joachim Low has warned that he needs to be playing regularly next year or face being left out of the squad for Germany's next qualifier against Georgia at the end of March. Podolski has struggled to get in the Arsenal team this season and has made just four appearances so far . Germany manager Joachim Low told Podolski he must play for his club if he wants to play for his country . Podolski said: 'I have to speak to Wenger because the situation at the moment is not good for me. I have to play. I am happy at Arsenal and happy in London but I don't have the chance to play. 'I know that only 11 can play but when you come on for just 10 or 15 minutes and it happens every week then you cannot be happy. I am happy with the team and the coach and the club, but I am not playing and I cannot be happy with that. I have to speak to Wenger because the situation at the moment is not good for me.' Podolski would like an emotional return to Cologne but Arsenal want £4 million for the World Cup winner if he goes in January and the Bundesliga club's sporting director Jorg Schmadkte told Bild this week: 'We don't have that money and we can neither pay the transfer fee nor the salary of a player like Podolski.' Arsenal face United with both teams out of the European places and Podolski said: 'There is always pressure when you are at a big club and you are not in the top four. We know we have to start winning games and picking up points.' Jose Mourinho's Chelsea side are currently four points clear at the top of the Premier League table . Chelsea beat Arsenal 2-0 when the two sides met at Stamford Bridge earlier this season . Asked about Arsenal's ability to put a late run of wins together that always manages to put Wenger's team in the Champions League, Podolski said: 'We are capable of that but it would be better that we don't have that run and we make first place and end up as champions. 'It's a long season and there is a long way to go. So far it is not a bad or a good season. We are still there or thereabouts but we have to win games. We have to focus on our game and if we are ready, and if we fight hard, then we will win this game because Manchester United are not where they want to be at the moment. Our players will not need no motivating for this game.' The arrival of Alexis Sanchez has pushed Podolski further down the pecking order. He is not surprised by the speed at which the former Barcelona forward has adapted to English football. He said: 'The Premier League is good for him. He is a physical player. He is fast and powerful and the Premier League suits him. He is battling in every game and running a lot and he is making the difference at the moment at Arsenal.'","Chelsea are currently four points clear at the top of the Premier League .

"Everton manager Roberto Martinez has said it is vital David Moyes keeps his backroom team at Real Sociedad to help him adapt to an overseas culture. Moyes was criticised by Sir Alex Ferguson among others for making immediate wholesale changes to his staff at Manchester United. Assistant manager Mike Phelan and first-team coach Rene Meulensteen left immediately and Moyes was unable to tap into their knowledge of how the club worked as he chose instead to bring Jimmy Lumsden, Steve Round, Phil Neville and Chris Woods with him from Everton.

Martinez - who succeeded Moyes at Everton and has a good insight into his methods of working - thinks local expertise will be key in San Sebastian if the Scot is to be a success. 'From a football point of view, David knows everything he needs to. The only thing he has to get used to very quickly is that he isn't going to Spain, he is going to the Basque country,' said Martinez, the Premier League's only Spanish manager. 'It is a very special part of Spain – the Basque people use football to represent their culture. They have their own language, and that is huge. 'I think it is impossible for a Spanish person to learn Basque, never mind for a British man. Moyes was criticised for dispensing of the services of Rene Meulensteen (pictured) and Mick Phelan . Everton boss Roberto Martinez was speaking at ""An Audience with Roberto Martinez"" 'Having the amount of staff that David Moyes will have from the country and from the club is going to be very helpful, and it's going to be a perfect bridge for the players straight away. I am sure the staff will help communicate his ideas. 'He will need to embrace the culture, but will be allowed to bring in a really solid footballing philosophy that will give the club exactly what they need. I think that's where the beauty of the challenge lies.'' Martinez feels if Moyes can adapt off-the-field, Sociedad will be a perfect fit in football terms. 'I don't think David will have any problem with the actual football side of the job because he is a very knowledgeable manager,' he said. 'I think the fans will take to David Moyes way of working, his honesty and values as a human being. I can see that as being a very successful partnership. 'Sociedad have a strong core of players and it is the kind of dressing-room that are ready to work, listen and be guided by the manager.

'Tactically, it won't be a big challenge as there are not that many styles in La Liga.

"Wilfried Bony believes Swansea will sell him 'for the right price' and not stand in the way of his dream to play in the Champions League after intense interest in the summer came to nothing. The striker was linked with the likes of Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester City and Liverpool in the summer after a stand-out 2013-14 campaign but despite strong interest after his 27-goal season he remains at the Liberty. While insisting he is happy in the south of Wales, and reports that he is close to signing at least a one-year extension to his contract taking him up to 2018 at the club, Bony is open to a move. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sportsmail Premier League Preview: Swansea vs Arsenal . Wilfried Bony says while he's loving life at Swansea the club will sell him if they can get the right fee . He told the Sunday Mirror: 'I am always honest with the club and they are always honest with me. If they get the right price for me I think they will sell. I'm sure the fans will understand.' Bony scored in the Premier League, Europa League, League and FA Cups for the Swans, and twice for Ivory Coast at the World Cup, but the absence of the Champions League on that list is a frustration he is not shy of noting. 'For sure, I want to play in that,' he  as Swansea prepare to host one of his potential suitors, Arsenal. Bony, shoots under pressure from Everton's Gareth Barry, has four goals from 12 appearances this season . 'Yes, one day I would love to play in the Champions League. That is what I am fighting for in my career.' On the summer speculation Bony says he had to remain professional and focussed on his job at Swansea, and wait to see how things played out. And after no deal eventuated he pledged his allegiance to his club. 'I love it here at Swansea,' he says. 'If you score goals, always the bigger teams will look at you. What I want to do now is to do better than last season.' Bony (right) attracted interest from big clubs including Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester City and Liverpool . Bony hasn't managed last year's form to date for Garry Monk's seventh-placed side, with just four goals in 12 appearances this season, including a double against Leicester last month. It took until his eighth match of the campaign to open his account with the 17th-minute opener in a 2-2 draw with Newcastle. Given their 17-year run in the top flight of European competition, Arsenal would have be an attractive option for the Ivorian before the arrival of in-form Alexis Sanchez and Danny Welbeck from Manchester United.

"Stuart Lancaster has come out fighting on behalf of his embattled England side — denying that they are in crisis mode after a shattering run of five consecutive Test defeats. As the national team returned to their Surrey base to prepare for Saturday’s QBE series encounter with Samoa at Twickenham, the head coach hit back at the intensifying criticism. Asked if the latest loss, to South Africa, leaves England in crisis, Lancaster offered an impassioned riposte. ‘I don’t think that’s true at all,’ he said. England head coach Stuart Lancaster speaks to the assembled media at Pennyhill Park on Monday . Lancaster looks pensive on the Twickenham pitch following his side's 31-28 loss to the Springboks . ‘If you say that, you’re talking about a team that has no belief in what they’re doing, has no sense of direction. A group of players who are not aligned with what you’re trying to do and not agreeing with where you’re going, who have poor discipline on and off the field — that’s a team in crisis. For me at the moment, I don’t see any of those traits in this England team.’ Lancaster called in a 28-man squad on Monday. James Haskell is back and destined to start in the back row. There were also call-ups for Northampton flanker Calum Clark, Saracens scrum-half Richard Wigglesworth and centres Billy Twelvetrees and Luther Burrell. Owen Farrell may earn a selection reprieve, despite his poor form. Lancaster said of his struggling No 10: ‘By his own admission he hasn’t played to the level he would have hoped.’ Northampton Saints centre Luther Burrell has been drafted into the England squad for the clash with Samoa . Gloucester centre Billy Twelvetrees has also been called up by Lancaster ahead of Saturday's Test . Forwards: Joe Marler, Matt Mullan, Kieran Brookes, David Wilson, Dylan Hartley, Rob Webber, Dave Attwood, George Kruis, Courtney Lawes, Calum Clark, James Haskell, Ben Morgan, Chris Robshaw (captain), Billy Vunipola, Tom Wood . Backs: Danny Care, Ben Youngs, Richard Wigglesworth, Brad Barritt, Luther Burrell, Kyle Eastmond, Owen Farrell, George Ford, Billy Twelvetrees, Mike Brown, Jonny May, Anthony Watson, Marland Yarde . Farrell could play at inside centre, with George Ford at fly-half, and Lancaster added: ‘Farrell and his contribution with the way the game has unfolded at 12 is an option.’ Kyle Eastmond is unlikely to feature and Semesa Rokoduguni has been left at Bath. Despite the rotation, Chris Robshaw is expected to stay in the team as captain. Meanwhile, former Argentina captain Agustin Pichot warned that England’s top stars are being worn out. ‘We are killing the players,’ Pichot said. ‘At the moment we are playing far too much rugby.’ Wasps flanker James Haskell (left) and Saints blindside Calum Clark may get a chance to impress .","Pressure has mounted on Stuart Lancaster's team following their fifth successive defeat last Saturday .

"England are less than 12 months away from a home World Cup but have just lost four Tests on the trot to New Zealand and one to South Africa. The game with Australia on Saturday week is now ‘must-win’. But do the southern-hemisphere nations agree that England are in crisis? NIK SIMON asked three legends… . MICHAEL LYNAGH (72-cap Australia fly half, 1991 Rugby World Cup winner) Michael Lynagh won the 1991 World Cup . It’s not time to press the panic button just yet but there was not a lot of creativity in England’s play at the weekend. That played into South Africa’s hands because they’re a physical side that love people running straight at them. Owen Farrell hasn’t played a lot of rugby this season and it’s not an easy task to find your feet against New Zealand and the Springboks. Maybe he wasn’t quite ready. I think there’s an option to have George Ford come in at No 10, with Owen at 12. It gives you more options with kicking and also two ball-players that can stand either side of the ruck. Defensively Owen is very strong at inside centre and he’s used to playing alongside Brad Barritt, who has been at 13. Maybe it’s time for Ben Youngs to have a go at scrum half against Samoa and show us what he’s got, but the most important thing is getting a win over Australia. Owen Farrell has been criticised for his displays against New Zealand and South Africa . The Saracens fly half could be moved to inside centre, but seems unlikely to start the next game at 10 . SEAN FITZPATRICK (92-cap former All Blacks skipper) Sean Fitzpatrick is a legendary All Black . England are going through a building phase but they will be disappointed with the performance against South Africa. They should be a bit harder on themselves but, in the context of where they were three years ago, they have made huge strides. As fans here we want England to win and the nice thing is now people are expecting them to win. Injuries have not helped their cause and South Africa at Twickenham is a game they would have targeted as a win. The fact that southern-hemisphere players are being contracted to their union also certainly helps, especially in the autumn. It makes them almost like a club team. That’s where the northern hemisphere are going to struggle against the southern hemisphere. Perhaps the RFU should look to buy out the clubs. George Ford, who came on in both games, could start for England in the next fixture against Samoa . THINUS DELPORT (Former South Africa and Gloucester full back) Thinus Delport played 18 times for South Africa . The guys all looked very nervous at Twickenham and England must learn to handle the pressure and expectation that will come over the next 12 months. South Africa had less possession and territory in the first half but capitalised on ill-discipline and unforced errors — a lot of that is down to pressure and in particular the decision-making at 9, 10 and 12. Unfortunately pressure is building on the England set-up from all angles. How they handle that will be crucial to their chances of winning the World Cup. They can go out for a beer, but if they get caught out by the media and then the result doesn’t go their way, then it becomes the wrong thing to do. But it can swing both ways and England have to find that balance between focus and relaxation very quickly. England could call on Ben Youngs to help break the malaise in the half-back positions . The Autumn Internationals on Sky Sports are part of an unrivalled schedule of rugby union with over 360 matches from the international, European and domestic game.","England suffered defeats to New Zealand and South Africa .

"Former New Zealand captain Sean Fitzpatrick believes England need to be 'harder on themselves publicly' after suffering five consecutive Test defeats but insists Stuart Lancaster is still leading the side in the right direction. England's hopes of winning the World Cup on home soil next year have been dented after they lost 31-28 to South Africa on Saturday, seven days after being beaten 24-21 by the All Blacks. The three-point margins flattered England in both encounters but after the Springboks defeat, Lancaster insisted his players have 'development to do' and that there was no need to panic. Former All Blacks legend Sean Fitzpatrick believes England 'need to be harder on themselves publicly' New Zealand hooker Fitzpatrick won 92 caps for the All Blacks and retired from the game in 1997 . 'I think they should be a bit harder on themselves in terms of what they're saying publicly,' said Fitzpatrick, who won the 1987 World Cup with the All Blacks and captained the team from 1992 to 1997. 'But in the context of where they were three years ago I think they've made huge strides. 'As fans here we want England to win and the nice thing is now people are expecting them to win - three years ago nobody expected them to win certain games.' Fitzpatrick added: 'It's a good thing the fans are concerned. England are expected to win now and we were under the general belief England were going in the right direction. England captain Chris Robshaw feels the pain after his side's 31-28 loss to the Springboks at Twickenham . 'I still think they are but the fact the fans are upset is a healthy sign.' England's winless run against South Africa now stretches to 12 Test matches and the last time they tasted victory against the Boks at Twickenham was November 2006. Fitzpatrick believes England's losing streak is misleading but admits the recent setbacks do give the southern hemisphere giants a psychological boost ahead of the World Cup. 'I would be concerned in terms of the style of rugby England are playing,' Fitzpatrick said. 'But the five games they have lost are against the two best teams in the world - they need to take that into consideration in terms of what they're doing. Owen Farrell has struggled for form in the recent autumn series and may be replaced by George Ford . 'They'll be hugely disappointed with their performance at the weekend against South Africa. 'They have a huge number of injuries but that was disappointing - of the two teams they just played I think they targeted South Africa as a team they wanted to beat.' Fitzpatrick added: 'I think it is important (beating England). It's important for the All Blacks to know they can win at Twickenham. 'And the flip-side as well is South Africa winning again at Twickenham where they have such a good record."" Fitzpatrick thinks Lancaster (above) and England would benefit from a central contracts system . New Zealand, Australia and South Africa all employ their international stars under central contracts, which allows more control over when and where their players feature for their countries. 'It makes it very difficult for the northern hemisphere sides and even more so in the autumn,' Fitzpatrick said. 'The All Blacks play 12 to 15 Test matches a year which means they're together 20-odd weeks a year which makes them almost like a club team. 'That's where the northern hemisphere teams are going to struggle against the southern hemisphere.'","England have now lost five Tests in a row after recent narrow defeats to New Zealand and South Africa at Twickenham .

"British-based Formula One team Marussia have officially stopped trading with the loss of over 200 jobs. Marussia, absent from the United States Grand Prix and this week’s race in Brazil, had hoped to take part at the season finale in Abu Dhabi. But their administrators FRP confirmed on Friday that the financially-stricken team, whose headquarters are in Banbury, Oxfordshire, will not race again. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Formula One team Marussia officially goes into administration . Max Chilton's Marussia folded after administrators confirmed the British-based outfit have ceased trading . The announcement that Marussia are folding leaves more than 200 employees without a job . Geoff Rowley, one of the administrators at FRP Advisory said: 'It goes without saying that it is deeply regrettable that a business with such a great following in British and world motorsport has had to cease trading and close its doors.' Marussia were placed in administration on October 27 and despite stringent efforts over the last few days to find a buyer and keep the team afloat, they have ultimately come to nothing. Rowley added: 'Whilst the team made significant progress during its relatively short period of operation, operating a F1 team requires significant ongoing investment. 'The group was put into administration last month following a shortfall in on-going funding and the administration process provided a moratorium to allow for attempts to secure a long-term viable solution for the company within a very limited timeframe. Marussia were placed in administration on October 27 and despite stringent efforts over the last few days to find a buyer and keep the team afloat, they have ultimately come to nothing . 'Sadly no solution could be achieved to allow for the business to continue in its current form. 'We would like to thank all the staff for their support during this difficult process. 'As joint administrators our immediate focus will be to assist staff who have lost their jobs and provide them with the necessary support to submit timely claims to the Redundancy Payments Service. 'The team will not be participating in the two further rounds of the 2014 championship in Sao Paulo and Abu Dhabi. The joint administrators will continue with their statutory duties to realise the assets of the business in the best interests of all the creditors.' Marussia joined the grid under the guise of Virgin Racing in 2010, funded primarily by British entrepreneur Sir Richard Branson. They won the first points of their history at the Monaco Grand Prix in May after Jules Bianchi finished the race in ninth. But the team have since been rocked by the Frenchman's horror crash at Suzuka when he ploughed into the back of a tractor during the rain-lashed race. He remains in Japanese hospital in a critical condition. After being taken over by Russian industry magnate Andrey Cheglakov, Marussia's own future was secured, but as it has proven only in the short term. With mounting debts and rising costs, Cheglakov pulled the plug a fortnight ago after his home grand prix. And it now remains to be seen whether struggling Caterham will follow suit as they, too, are currently in administration and fighting for survival.","More than 200 employees have been made redundant as F1 team folds .

"In time, the current storm of unrest raging around the England team may serve a positive purpose. Stuart Lancaster believes that he and his players are finding out what the World Cup will be like — 10 months early. As the tournament hosts trying to satisfy an expectant nation, demands will be sky-high and tolerance of failure extremely limited. There will be no allowances made for the age-profile of the team, or their lack of caps compared to leading rivals. In the harsh glare of the global showpiece in this country, the head coach knows that it is a case of deliver or be damned. England head coach Stuart Lancaster speaks to the assembled media at Pennyhill Park on Monday . Lancaster looks pensive on the Twickenham pitch following his side's 31-28 loss to the Springboks . That equation is already coming to pass during this QBE autumn series. England have been regrouping and developing and learning since Lancaster took charge in the aftermath of the last World Cup, but now the time has come for positive momentum and it is eluding them. Five defeats on the bounce is cause for alarm, no matter who the opposition and no matter how many untimely injuries. Last Saturday’s defeat at the hands of South Africa has acted as a tipping point. Media criticism has been accompanied by sometimes ugly social-media barbs from disgruntled English supporters —with Dylan Hartley particularly targeted on Twitter after being sin-binned during the latest defeat. In the eye of the storm, England are circling the wagons. Lancaster yesterday lifted the lid on his personal torment. The head coach has been the subject of largely positive commentary since replacing Martin Johnson, but he is feeling the heat as progress has stalled. Owen Farrell has not impressed in this autumn's games, and Lancaster could be forced to experiment . The England players are finding out the pressure of playing at home under extreme expectation . ‘It’s hard to take,’ he said. ‘It hurts. It hurts when you lose when you’re England and it should do. It hurts me personally because I’m responsible for the team and it hurts the players. No-one accepts it as part of the job because you don’t want it to happen, but when it does come you’ve just got to accept it for what it is. ‘More importantly, you have to make sure that you and all the other guys keep some perspective about what you’re trying to do and what you’re trying to achieve. It’s when the pressure starts to affect the team that the problems begin. My sense is that we’re disappointed with ourselves but we have to believe in what we’re doing.’ Lancaster has been stung by the criticism and revealed that he finds it hard to escape from it. ‘It’s not nice and it’s not taken lightly,’ he said. ‘It’s not very easy to tune out from it. My way of dealing with it is to look at the areas of the game that we could have controlled and done better and to understand why they happened. Lancaster has defended his team, but he may have to change his half-back combination to Ford and Youngs . ‘Secondly, but probably most important, it’s about thinking about selection and thinking about who deserves an opportunity now and who perhaps doesn’t deserve that opportunity. ‘That over-rides your mind, but also how you deal with the pressure that comes on the team, so that they become resilient to it. Actually, we’re going to have pressure on us when the World Cup comes around, irrespective of the results leading up to it. Lancaster stressed his selction dilemas, and could pick James Haskell (left) or Calum Clark against Samoa . ‘That’s what comes with the expectation of being the home nation, so we better get used to it.’ Once again, Lancaster was at pains to emphasise the context of each defeat. He has been assailed by injuries and fixture clashes and form fluctuations among his leading men, but no Test coach is immune from such trials and tribulations. England have the resources to cope with most adversity. In the past, Test captain Chris Robshaw has had to withstand fierce individual pressure but it is unfamiliar territory for Lancaster. He has understandably shown signs of stress and strain. As ever, he is prepared to face the inquisition head-on, but the occasional terse reply shows how the pressure is affecting a naturally good-natured man. There is a sense of exasperation and indignation among Lancaster and his staff at some aspects of the criticism. Captain Chris Robshaw has been criticised in the past, but Lancaster is feeling the pressure for the first time . On Monday, when he was asked to address the revolving door of England midfield selection since the 2003 World Cup, he quipped: ‘I looked at those 39 centre partnerships but there’s only about three of them that involved me. I don’t see why I’m culpable for the whole centre partnership conundrum.’ This period will serve as a major examination of his composure and man-management skills. The fur is flying and Lancaster must prove that he can initiate a revival. It is a difficult aspect of the role he signed up for but if this is a sign of what the World Cup will be like, the man in charge of the host nation has to seize this awkward opportunity to show he can survive and thrive.","England have lost their last five games in a row .

"Marussia driver Jules Bianchi remains 'critical but stable' in hospital following his horrific accident at the Japanese Grand Prix on October 5, his family said on Thursday. The 25-year-old Frenchman suffered a diffuse axonal injury to his brain, where the damage is more widespread, after crashing into a recovery vehicle at Suzuka almost four weeks ago, and underwent immediate surgery upon his arrival at the Mie General Medical Centre in Yokkaichi. His condition remains unchanged almost a month later, his family revealed in a statement issued on the Marussia F1 Team website. Jules Bianchi remains in a critical but stable condition after  crashing at the Japanese GP, says his family . Bianchi was involved in a horror crash with  a recovery van that caused a diffuse axonal injury to his brain . 'It will be four weeks this coming Sunday since Jules' accident and he remains in the Mie General Medical Center in Yokkaichi,' it read. 'His condition continues to be classified by the medical professionals here as critical but stable. Although we have no new information to give, we recognise that there are a huge number of people all around the world who are supporting Jules and willing him on in his fight. 'We owe it to his many fans to acknowledge the continued outpouring of messages, and to provide some information, however brief it may be.' The driver's father, Philippe Bianchi, two weeks ago labelled his son's situation 'desperate' and said it was 'a miracle' he was still alive. Medical staff attend the scene of  Bianchi's crash during the rain-hit Japanese Grand Prix . There had been suggestions Jules would be moved to Europe, but his family confirmed he will remain in Japan for the time being - and will 'continue to fight'. 'Jules does indeed continue to fight,' the statement added. 'Although there have been some reports suggestive of plans for Jules' treatment, at this time his fight will continue here in Yokkaichi. We are taking things step by step. 'Once again, we would like to offer our sincere appreciation for the patience and understanding being shown towards our family at this very difficult time. 'We also continue to be comforted by the knowledge that Jules is receiving the best possible care at the Mie General Medical Center, with the doctors here remaining in constant contact with the neurosurgeons at the University La Sapienza of Rome, and professor Gerard Saillant, president of the FIA medical commission. Formula One driver Bianchi received urgent medical treatment after the crash but remains in hospital . 'We will provide a further update when it is appropriate to do so. In the meantime, thank you to everyone who continues to keep Jules in their thoughts and prayers.' Following an investigation into the cause of the crash, FIA race director Charlie Whiting concluded there was 'a perfect storm' of conditions. With heavy rain falling and the light fading, Bianchi smashed into the back of a recovery vehicle that at the time was removing the Sauber of Adrian Sutil, who had spun off the track and into a tyre barrier one lap previously. Although the FIA is due to bring in new safety measures following the incident, Whiting further stated with regard to the incident 'nothing could have been done better'. Formula One chiefs are proposing a speed limit to slow down cars during dangerous situations on the track .","Jules Bianchi suffered a diffuse axonal injury to his brain at Suzuka .

"British-based Marussia have said they are ‘shocked’ ‘angered’ and ‘deeply saddened’ by claims they contributed to Jules Bianchi’s life-threatening crash at the Japanese Grand Prix. It was reported that the Frenchman, whose condition remains critical after he ploughed into the back of a tractor  during the rain-lashed race, didn’t slow down under waved yellow flags and was even urged to go faster by his team. But Marussia have issued a response to the claims which they have described as ‘entirely false’. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Alain Prost angry about Bianchi crash .

Whiting told a media briefing at the Russian Grand Prix last week: 'I know what speed he left the track at. We have seen the data from all cars, and everyone slowed down. 'Some didn't slow down much, some a lot. We don't need to go into how much he slowed down compared to others. He did slow down; it is a matter of degree.' Marussia also provided the FIA with a full transcript of its radio communication with Bianchi during the race, and insist that it proved they never made any instruction for him to ignore the yellow flags deployed after Adrian Sutil’s spin minutes before Bianchi's crash. Bianchi remains in a grave condition at Mie University Hospital and on Monday his family said he still faces a 'number of medical challenges'. The 25-year-old’s parents and siblings have been beside his hospital bed since the accident, and his father Philippe said he  fears the worst outcome. ‘Every time the phone rings we know it could be the hospital to say Jules is dead,’ Philippe Bianchi said on Tuesday. ‘The doctors have said that it is already a miracle; that nobody has ever survived such a serious accident, but Jules does not give up. ‘One day he seems a little better, another a bit worse. The doctors don't say. The damage in the impact was great, but they don't know how it will evolve.’ During the course of Tuesday 14th October, a number of media reports emerged suggesting: . 1. That Jules Bianchi did not slow down under the double waved yellow flags shown after Adrian Sutil had spun off in the wet conditions . and . 2. That the team urged Jules to go faster during the double waved yellow flag period in order to keep Marcus Ericsson behind. The Marussia F1 Team is shocked and angered by these allegations. At a time when its driver is critically ill in hospital, and the team has made clear that its highest priority is consideration for Jules and his family, it is distressed to have to respond to deeply upsetting rumours and inaccuracies in respect of the circumstances of Jules’ accident. However, given that these allegations are entirely false, the team has no alternative but to address these. Regarding point 1, Jules did slow down under the double waved yellow flags. That is an irrefutable fact, as proven by the telemetry data, which the team has provided to the FIA. In the FIA press conference which took place in Sochi on Friday 10 October, Charlie Whiting, the FIA’s Race Director, confirmed that the team had provided such data, that he himself had examined this data and that Jules did slow. Regarding point 2, an audio copy of the full radio transmission between Jules and the team, and also a written transcript thereof, were provided to the FIA. It is quite clear from the transmission and the transcript that at no point during the period leading up to Jules’ accident did the team urge Jules to drive faster or make any comments suggesting that he should do so. The team sincerely hopes that, having clarified these facts, it can now avoid any further distractions to its primary focus at this time, which is providing support for Jules and his family.

"Wales star George North has hailed the 'exceptional' ability of New Zealand try machine Julian Savea. Both players are set to be among the major box-office attractions when Wales host the All Blacks next Saturday. Between them, they have scored 48 Test tries, but North’s fellow wing Savea has 29 of those from just 32 international appearances. All Blacks and Wellington Hurricanes winger Julian Savea has scored 29 tries in 32 Test matches . It is a staggering strike-rate, and one that is not lost on North. 'He is exceptional. He is a brilliant example of how to impose yourself on a game,' North said. 'He pops up left, right and centre. You have to watch to work out what to do, but learn from him as well. 'The All Blacks have shown over the past few weeks that they can win Test matches when they are really feeling the heat. Savea is widely regarded as the best winger in the world at present and has been compared to Jonah Lomu . 'They are deservedly number one in the world, and we have to step up our game massively for the weekend.” Wales have not beaten New Zealand since 1953, and given the sub-standard nature of their performance against Fiji two days ago, they will not be widely expected to end that long losing sequence this time around. Although Wales defeated the South Sea Islanders 17-13 - North was among their try-scorers - they did not register a point after half-time despite Fiji having prop Campese Ma’afu sent off. 'You are aware of what’s coming, and you work even harder,' North added. 'There is no bigger challenge than the All Blacks. George North crosses for an early try against Fiji last Saturday but Wales stuttered to a 17-13 victory . 'The All Blacks have a great game-plan. They’ve got players who can get over the gain-line, and they’ve got boys who are very good in the air and have great skills. They won’t bring anything less than that on the weekend. 'The boys are really excited for the next two games (against New Zealand and South Africa). 'It wasn’t ideal to go into this game on the back of that performance against Fiji, but it is better to go in with a win rather than a loss. Warren Gatland's side have a huge fortnight ahead of them when they face the All Blacks and South Africa . 'Everyone has held their hands up and we’ve said that we need to do better. We went out there believing in how we were set up and how we wanted to play, but we just didn’t get into our own rhythm. 'You don’t want to make eye contact with anyone in the debrief after a match like that. 'It’s part of the job. You are flying high on the good days and want to talk to everyone, but when the dark days come and you haven’t been performing, you have to man up and take it on the chin. 'A few boys, myself included, know that we didn’t perform as well as we should have with the space and time we had. You kick yourself when you look back over a lot of things, but you have to take it on the chin and make it right in the next game. 'Everyone involved on the weekend knew that the turnovers came from silly mistakes and they were schoolboy errors. The players are harder than anyone on themselves. 'I am very hard on myself, and those basic skills shouldn’t be a worry at this level. We had 23 turnovers from knock-ons, and you can’t afford to do that at this level with New Zealand and South Africa coming up.'","All Blacks winger Julian Savea has scored 29 tries in 32 Test appearances .

"For David Moyes, the best, most suitable job in football is about to pass by. While Moyes considers taking a sabbatical following his dismal spell at Manchester United, Roy Keane is likely to land the manager’s role at Celtic. That would have been perfect for Moyes, who is still to win a trophy despite 10 fine years in charge at Everton. Missed opportunity: The Celtic job would have been the perfect way for David Moyes to rebuild his reputation . Baggage drop: Roy Keane will resurrect his own stalling managerial career in Glasgow . He could hardly fail as Celtic manager in Scotland, and could then return to England with a record of success, minus the millstone of his brief time at Manchester United. It certainly worked for Martin O’Neill, who did the ‘Double’ twice at Celtic, reached the final of the UEFA Cup — and was installed at Aston Villa in the days when owner Randy Lerner was new and ambitious. If Moyes’s next job is in the Premier League, he arrives with considerable baggage. He could have dumped that in Glasgow, as Keane will do now.

"FIFA’s warring ethics chiefs Michael Garcia and Hans-Joachim Eckert have agreed to meet to sort out their dispute that has sent football’s world governing body into meltdown. Eckert, chairman of the Adjudicatory chamber, said in a brief statement on Friday night: ‘Michael Garcia and I communicated today and decided to meet in the coming days.’ This follows the outcry at Garcia, who led the investigation into World Cup corruption, damning Eckert’s findings from his report and taking his case of misrepresentation to the FIFA appeals committee. Michael Garcia (left) and Hans-Joachim Eckert pictured together in 2012 at FIFA headquarters in Zurich . FIFA will not comment further because Garcia’s appeals process has begun. Meanwhile, two of FIFA’s most influential ExCo committee members have added their names to the growing list of football powerbrokers demanding Garcia’ s report be published in full. Eckert had concluded there was no reason to re-run the 2018 and 2022 bidding and bizarrely criticised England 2018, who gained only two votes, for the way they tried to gain the support of disgraced former FIFA executive member Jack Warner. FIFA vice-president Jeffrey Webb and United States representative Sunil Gulati said in a joint statement: 'Given the disagreement between the two chairmen of the Investigatory and Adjudicatory Chambers of the Ethics Committee and to ensure complete transparency we believe the full report conducted by the FIFA Ethics Committee into the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups should be made public as soon as possible. Former FIFA executive member Jack Warner pictured arriving in his native Trinidad and Tobago in 2011 . 'This can be done with appropriate redaction to protect any confidentiality required by the FIFA Code of Ethics. Providing the entire independent report for inspection is in the best interest of the game and FIFA.' But Eckert said on Friday: 'I don’t think it is possible because I have to respect the rights of confidentiality for Continental law. 'Maybe it’s another thing in the US, but in Continental law I can’t do it and I can’t do it in total even by the FIFA code of ethics. I will not do it.'

"Are Manchester United right to sack David Moyes? It would have boiled down to a simple question by the end. Can we trust this man to spend £200million? The Glazers would have sifted through all the available evidence and decided they could not. David Moyes is no longer  Manchester United manager. The final reckoning would not have taken long. Even Moyes’s staunchest advocates had exhausted their ammunition by the time the final whistle blew at Goodison Park on Sunday. Appointing a manager without experience in the elite pool was a leap of faith and it has not been supported by results. VIDEO Scroll down for  Moyes' despondent post-loss pressers . Shout of order: David Moyes sees United lose at Chelsea earlier this season . Had Moyes . proved he could venture into new territory and thrive, then United’s . owners would have willingly backed him in the transfer market this . summer. Yet he has been unable to dispel the doubts that existed going . into this season. 'He's failed every challenge, so why  would they trust him to spend £200m?' He didn’t have Champions League experience and . Manchester United conducted an inconsistent campaign that ended in the . desperate measure of playing Wayne Rooney, unfit, against Bayern Munich. He . didn’t have title-winning experience and United were seventh within . three matches, not rising higher than fifth since. He had never won a . trophy and the closest Manchester United came under him was a Capital . One Cup semi-final, lost to Sunderland. He was famed for caution at . Everton and United are missing their attacking swagger this season. The . job was, as  predicted by a number of fearful United fans, too big for . him. Writing on the wall: Moyes has seen United fail to qualify for the Champions League this season . Final straw: Moyes watched United crash to their 11th league defeat of the season to former club Everton . And . Moyes throughout his career has never spent anywhere near the sums that . are set aside to revive Manchester United this summer. So why should . the Glazers continue believing in him? Having failed so dismally with . every other new  challenge, why should he be up to this one? Sadly, . Moyes has not added one new skill to his c.v. since leaving Everton, no . fresh learning, nothing to suggest he is at home in the elite. And the . overhaul of United this summer is a task for a high-end coach. Big money . will be spent, big names will be jettisoned. With . no Champions League, or maybe even European, football to entice leading . players, United must show they mean business. The presence of Moyes . does not speak of ambition, not while he still has an L-plate attached . to his jacket. Ed . Woodward, Manchester United’s chief executive, travelled to Paris on . the day of Chelsea’s recent Champions League quarter-final tie. He said . he might not even take in the game with Paris Saint-Germain but knew . that major Champions League fixtures were wonderful occasions for . gathering football’s powerbrokers in one place. Leading . club executives, agents, super-agents, they would all be there. Meetings, meetings,  meetings were what Woodward said he had planned. And maybe he didn’t like what he heard. Perhaps . the super-agents were not happy to place their super-clients with a . club in the doldrums and a lame duck manager who could be gone by . Christmas if results did not improve. Perhaps Woodward  discovered that . with, say, Carlo Ancelotti at the helm, talks would progress more . smoothly. Off the pace: United have failed to mount a decent challenge for the Premier League this season . It . is pointless pretending Moyes carries the same clout as his . contemporaries at the major European clubs. He couldn’t entice Leighton . Baines from Everton and they had worked together for six years.Ancelotti, . or Louis van Gaal,  would bring a contacts book and a gold standard . reputation. Their presence shows a club has intent, their track records . increase  expectation of success. Moyes’s next trophy will be his first. He . no doubt imagined breaking his duck with Manchester United but that has . not happened. He has no profile among players beyond these shores — and . what little he does is now bad. He’s . the guy who stuffed up at Manchester United; just as, over here, it is . Gerardo Martino’s duff season at Barcelona, not his eight titles in . South America, that are known. With the Champions League creating a . semi-permanent elite, football is no longer fluid as it once was. There . is a hierarchy and Moyes is not part of it, no matter the endorsement of . Sir Alex Ferguson. The clock is ticking: Moyes' time at Old Trafford looks to have run out - despite the backing of Sir Alex Ferguson . That . is what will end with Moyes’s departure, too. Manchester United: the . Ferguson years. While the Chosen One occupied his seat, the hope was . that the Ferguson dynasty continued. Here was a manager cast in his . image, with the same values, capable of seamless transition. It . was hoped the old ways would remain, but what now? Ancelotti is a . calming presence, a healer, but Jurgen Klopp is a German heavy metal fan . with a nose for mischief, and Jose Mourinho learned many  of his . confrontational skills from Van Gaal, now believed to be the leading . candidate. Whoever . comes will rip up what remains of the existing blueprint because . paramount importance is a swift return to the Champions League. Adnan . Januzaj aside,  Manchester United next season will largely be . restructured around proven, established internationals or young players . who have already made the Premier League grade, such as Luke Shaw. This . is not a grandiose project, but a pragmatic, quick and expensive fix of . this season’s malaise. Had Mourinho been available, he would have been . perfect for the task.  Some will argue, with justification, that he . should have got the job in the first place. Making the call: Executive vice chairman Ed Woodward speaks to Moyes at the training ground this season . There . will be sympathy for Moyes, stepping into Ferguson’s giant shoes and . falling headlong down the stairs, but the bottom line is he got a . fabulous opportunity and blew it. 'He stepped into Fergie’s giant shoes... and fell headlong down the stairs' He did not inherit a vintage Manchester United team but it still won the title by 11 points, scored . 11 more goals than any rival and had a goal difference superior by . seven. The defence was the most porous of any team in the top four but, . even so, nobody can have expected a  collapse of this magnitude. If they do not move beyond seventh place, Manchester United will . have equalled the worst title defence in Premier League history, . matched only by Blackburn Rovers the season after Kenny  Dalglish . departed. The . most damning numbers, however, concern their performances against the . better teams. In 17 league matches against clubs in the top half of the . table, Moyes has won just three: Stoke City on October 26, Arsenal on . November 10 and Newcastle United on April 5. Backing of the fans: Supporters at Old Trafford hung a banner at the Stretford End in backing of Moyes . Losing the fans: A section of United fans paid for a banner to be flown over Old Trafford calling for Moyes to go . He . is the first Manchester United  manager to lose home and away to . Liverpool and Everton in the same season, the first to lose at home to . Swansea City, the first to fail to qualify for the Champions League . since 1995, the first to concede in the opening minute of a Premier . League match, the first to lose three games in a row since 2001, the . first to lose at home to Newcastle since 1972, the first to lose at home . to West Bromwich Albion since 1978 and to Stoke since 1984. He . went out in the third round of the FA Cup, which Ferguson suffered only . once in his Old Trafford career and, even if Moyes wins all of his four . remaining matches, this will be Manchester United’s lowest points total . in the history of the Premier League. It all started so well: Moyes was all smiles when he was unveiled as United manager in July . As . if this was not bad enough, the rise of Liverpool — and on a  personal . note the improvement at Everton under Roberto Martinez — has put Moyes’s . struggles into sharp relief. While United have plummeted, Liverpool . have risen, from seventh to first in what may represent the greatest . improvement by any championship-winning team in English football since . Everton under Howard Kendall in 1983-84. And . Liverpool’s rebirth is what Manchester United fear most, not just as a . local rival but as a force in the marketplace. Liverpool were a global . brand in 1989 when Michael Knighton was still juggling balls on the . pitch at Old Trafford, and if they take their place among Europe’s elite . again there will be older generations across Asia, in particular, . primed and waiting to influence the next editions of the family. Manchester . United’s revenue streams are those of the market leader, but a well-run . Liverpool with an eye on commercial opportunities abroad could, if not . match them, then at least take a significant slice of that action. Added insult: Seeing Roberto Martinez do so well at Everton is sure to have dented Moyes' pride . If . the Premier League trophy is secured at Anfield on May 11,  its next . destination after the open-top bus parade through the city the following . day will be Dublin for a game against Shamrock Rovers on May 14, . followed by a trip to  Mauritius to play Celtic, provisionally, on May . 18. Then there is the pre-season tour of the United States, taking in . Chicago, New York and Charlotte. These . are all traditional United strongholds, suddenly under threat. Chelsea . have encroached on  United’s territory, too, with Premier League chief . executive Richard Scudamore now listing the London club among those with . a significant following abroad. Woodward, the United chief executive, . has been hailed as a wonder salesman, but he has never had to sell a . club in  seventh place before — to big business, big agents or big . players. On the brink: Liverpool are close to winning their first title for 24 years . Moyes . is the first casualty of that unexpected challenge. Wondering whether . the manager could grow into the job was just another  question United’s . bosses had no time to answer. Ultimately, . Moyes wasn’t the  Chosen One, or even a special one. Instead, he became . the Problem One. And swiftly, that problem has been solved. Clearing . the mess left behind, however, suggests a fresh set of problems for . United are only just beginning.","Glazer family did not trust Moyes with £200m summer transfer kitty .

Medical staff attend the scene of Jules Bianchi's crash during Sunday's rain-hit Japanese Grand Prix . All 21 drivers line up on the grid before the start of the inaugural Russian Grand Prix to show their support . Alain Prost has blasted the safety procedures in Japan, questioning why there was a 'f****** truck on the track' Race director Charlie Whiting has filed a report on the tragic events in Suzuka at the request of FIA president Jean Todt. Double waved yellows were issued at the scene of Sutil’s accident, in favour of a safety car, despite a tractor being dispatched to recover the German’s Sauber - a decision which Prost believes was fundamentally wrong. ‘It is cars and tracks that have been improved and there was only one thing left: it was this f****** truck on the track,' said Prost. ‘I was furious. I was really shocked by the accident.’ The words 'Jules, we are all supporting you' are seen from above on the Russian Grand Prix track . Formula One chiefs are proposing a speed limit to slow down cars during dangerous situations on the track . The Japanese race started under the safety car before the torrid weather conditions saw the race postponed with only two laps completed. The race later re-started behind the pace car once more which then pitted at the end of lap 10. ‘It was safe in the beginning when it started with the safety car, because it was a difficult decision to stop the race after three or four laps and start again,' Prost told Autosport. ‘That is why I was shocked, because you take the right decision at one stage. ‘It is huge bad luck, but you should not judge the cause of the accident, you should judge the consequence. You don’t want to have that. ‘If it was my son, I wouldn’t want this type of accident with a truck on an F1 track.

"Your kitchen towels may be spreading food poisoning bugs and bacteria around your home, researchers have warned. They say that by wiping dishes with dirty tea towels, homeowners are unwittingly smearing them in bacteria. Researchers found almost 90% of tea towels in US kitchens contained bacteria. Scroll down for video . Dr Reynolds said in order to keep kitchen towels clean you should wash them after each use - and that by using them in the kitchen cooks could simply be spreading bacteria . Coliforms can be found in the aquatic environment, in soil and on vegetation; they are universally present in large numbers in the feces of animals. While coliforms themselves are not normally causes of serious illness, they are easy to culture, and their presence is used to indicate that other organisms of fecal origin may be present. Such pathogens include disease-causing bacteria. This could cause major problems, the team say. The study from the University of Arizona has found enteric bacteria in 89 per cent and E. coli in 25.6 per cent of kitchen tea-towels. 'The common occurrence of enteric bacteria in kitchen sponges and dishcloths suggests that they can play a role in the cross-contamination of foods, fomites and hands by foodborne pathogens. 'This study investigated the occurrence of bacteria in kitchen towels often used to dry dishes, hands and other surfaces in the domestic kitchen,' the team wrote. A total of 82 kitchen hand towels were collected from households in five major cities in the United States and Canada. The numbers of heterotrophic bacteria, coliform bacteria, and Escherichia coli in each towel were determined. In addition, identification of the enteric bacteria was performed on selected towels. The study from the University of Arizona has found enteric bacteria in 89 per cent and E. coli in 25.6 per cent of kitchen tea-towels. Coliform bacteria were detected in 89.0% and E. coli in 25.6% of towels. The presence of E. coli was related to the frequency of washing, the team said. 'You may think you are cleaning the counter where food will be placed,' Kelly Reynolds, a researcher at the University of Arizona's Zuckerman College of Public Health told The Huffington Post. 'But if you are using a dirty kitchen rag, you may actually be introducing hundreds of thousands of bacteria.' Dr Reynolds said in order to keep kitchen towels clean you should wash them after each use. If this is not practical, she suggested dipping them in diluted bleach and hanging them up to dry.","Researchers analysed towels from five major cities in the United States and Canada .

"Up until now, it's been a long and arduous journey for Anjali Rao. The high demands of her role as a CNN breakfast anchor based in Hong Kong was wearing her down to the bone - literally. But the 40-year-old is happy to report that she now calls Australia home with a new job, a new outlook on life and new found love. Rao hosts Dateline on SBS and is happy to call Australia home again after a stressful stint abroad . The journalist has not looked back since quitting her high flying job as a CNN news anchor . Anjali Rao is now currently dating the celebrity gardener. They first met at the races in November last year . The journalist was once living the dream. She had a high flying job, interviewing the likes of Bill Clinton and the Dalai Lama, while living very comfortably in Hong Kong and enjoying married life with the exciting prospect of having her first child. 'It's incredibly upsetting when month after month you just fail. That was it. I felt like a failure. Not loving my job any more, feeling like I had all these people relying on me and failing to have a child. I ended up with a very black head space,' she told Sunday Life. But even the birth of her son Izzy, after years of IVF, failed to bring Rao joy. Rao in a dress borrowed from Dannii Minogue at the 2013 Logie Awards in Melbourne, last year 2013 . The journalist divorced her Australian ex-husband Brett Gullan after the birth of their first child Izzy . The stresses of covering traumatic events, such as the 2010 Haiti earthquake, proved to be too much as her health rapidly deteriorated. She developed an eating disorder and lost 30 kilograms in a few months. So the mother-of-one made the call to quit her job and relocate to Melbourne, Australia which was the home of her husband and graphic designer Brett Gullan. But this posed more challenges for the TV presenter. 'The hardest thing I've ever done was to leave my marriage. At the time I thought I needed a completely clean break ... a new country, a new network, to head up a new vein of journalism. But looking back, what I needed was a rest,' she said. The life that she knew was gone. The toll of covering the Haiti earthquake in 2010, proved too much for the journalist and her health rapidly deteriorated . The mother-of-one has interviewed the likes of Bill Clinton, the Dalai Lama and also Roger Federer . But things were slowly starting to fall back into place. A few months into her resettlement, Rao was offered a role as a guest panellist on Channel Ten's The Project which helped her secure a spot as the host of Dateline on SBS. With new found purpose, her health is back on track and so is her love life. The anchor is currently dating celebrity gardener Jamie Durie, after first meeting him at Melbourne's Spring Racing Carnival in November. 'This is not something I've ever experienced before and I was certainly not looking for. We often say to each other, ""Can you believe it's only been this long?"" To us it feels like years. It was an instant connection that I've never felt before,' she said. Rao now divides her time between Melbourne and Sydney, which is where 43-year-old Durie lives. The former cabaret performer has an 18-year-old daughter, Taylor, with Las Vegas showgirl Michelle Gennock.

She said in creating aaroncarterfan, she set out to be as horrible a human being as possible, which meant being 'mean, spoiled, lazy, racist, manipulative and even a gold digger.' Finishing the statement 'I'm really good at,' she wrote 'convincing people im pregnat (sic) lol,' and she ended 'the first things people usually notice about me' with, 'Prolly (sic) the first thing they notice is the drink Im throwing in there (sic) face LOL.' When it came to drinking and taking drugs, she wrote she did both often and said one of her main aims was 'keeping america american.' She also said she was unemployed but couldn't live without '$$$' and cars and went on to say she enjoyed knocking coffee out of homeless people's hands because it was 'sooooooo funny.'

With her goal to be 'so abhorrent that not even men who comment on YouPorn videos' would respond to her, she was shocked when she got more than 150 messages in just 24 hours. Her new goal was to get the men to stop messaging her back, and her first response tactic was to be so 'unforgivably awful' by doing things like pretending to be a 14-year-old on Facebook to make fun of her sister's friends because 'LMAOOOOO bullying is fun.' But one man hit straight back with: 'Lol your so funny. hahaha. you a sexy devil lol :) so dose ur sis know about it? Any plans for the weekend? Btw what's ur number so we can text? To another man, she wrote: 'ya lol i fake bein pregnant so much that im like amazing at it, i deserve a nobel proze for it lol. ppl will give u whatever u want if they think ur pregnant SPECIALLY if they think there the dad, omg lol (sic)' Alas, the being vulgar plan failed and the men kept messaging. So she tried tactic two: She will ruin your life. Model friend: The Los Angeles-based Cracked writer created the fake OKCupid profile, 'aaroncarterfan,' using pictures of her best friend, left and right, who is a model .

However, that didn't work either. 'There are any number of cynical conclusions I could draw from the results of this experiment,' Reed wrote in her column. Awful: She even included horrible comments to make the experiment more believable . 'For example, I could extrapolate from my data that men have been so deeply socialized to value women solely on their appearance that many of them seem unable to take any other aspect of who she is, such as intelligence or capacity for self-reflection or suffocating douchiness, into account.' Or she said she could follow her first instinct and 'invest in a high-quality chastity belt and start collecting cats.' But she decided instead to 'stay optimistic and instead offer an impassioned plea.' 'You don't want someone who will pull out your teeth and then sue you for child support...' she wrote. 'Don't settle. Figure out how to be happy with who you are and then look for someone who makes your great life even better.

"The upset of England’s travelling support at their treatment by the FA led to the chants during the victory in Switzerland concentrating on that controversy rather than the team’s top performance. The hard core fans were furious at the FA for switching their loyalty scheme to award two points, or ‘caps’, for attending home matches and one for away games when previously it had been the reverse. It is claimed the switch could lead to the demand for Euro 2016 tickets being over-subscribed with more fans getting enough ‘caps’ to be considered for priority allocation. The disgruntled supporters sang: ‘Two points for Wembley, you’re having a laugh’, ‘We only get one cap’ and ‘Loyal support, treated like s***’. Unhappy: Loyal England supporters expressed their discontent at the new ticketing policy . Followers: England players celebrate with the travelling supporters after the 2-0 win over Switzerland . The unpopular strategy has been brought in by the FA because filling Wembley for England matches is the priority over the next two years. They claim a lot of fans who travel to England away games do not watch the team at home. The away following claim the first game since the revised credit system was introduced — the Wembley friendly against Norway — attracting the lowest crowd for an England match since the stadium opened showed a botched policy. Fans chief Kevin Miles said: ‘There is no question the FA’s policy is alienating the loyal travelling support. After all the improvements in behaviour, being regarded as surplus to requirements has gone down like a lead balloon.’ The FA say they are monitoring fans’ disquiet but have no plans to make any changes. Another serious concern over the FA falling out with the fans is that it will lead to a churn from the official England supporters club — all of whom are police vetted when they apply for tickets — and bring about unregulated accessing of seats elsewhere. Certainly no extra problems are needed in the build-up to the powderkeg friendly against Scotland at Celtic Park in November. However, the English and Scottish FAs said on Tuesday that they are confident of their security arrangements at a venue used to dealing with high-profile occasions where there is a potential for trouble, such as Old Firm games. Ramping up: The English and Scottish FAs will have similar security arrangements to Old Firm games . The viewing public have yet to re-engage fully with Roy Hodgson’s team, despite the impressive performance in Basle. The average of 5.6million viewers and a peak of 7.7m were less than ITV Sport were expecting for England’s toughest qualifying match on the road to Euro 2016. It does not augur well, ratings-wise, for the next game at home against San Marino, who offer no proper competition. Meanwhile, ITV’s ranking seems to be such that commentator Clive Tyldesley was seated in British Airways economy on the way back from Switzerland while pundit colleagues Glenn Hoddle, Lee Dixon and Ian Wright were travelling business class. Downgraded: ITV presenter Clive Tyldesley flew back from Switzerland in economy class . FA chairman Greg Dyke, who was famously spotted reading the aptly-named erotic thriller A Death in Brazil while watching England training during the World Cup, whiled away some time in Basle in similar cerebral fashion — at an arts and craft store checking out pencils and brushes. A youth football league with more than 10,000 players has returned its FA Charter Standard award in protest at a mandatory rule to award three points for a win across all age groups from under 10 upwards. The South East London and Kent League pride themselves on child friendly principles and want to keep two points for a victory to stop teams running away with the league or being stranded at the bottom. The FA have yet to respond. Bookmaker giants Ladbrokes — who have helped revitalise the St Leger — are not expected to renew their title sponsorship of the fifth Classic after Saturday’s running, following the clash with Irish Champions weekend.

"Former New South Wales premier Barry O'Farrell may have been one of the biggest scalps of the corruption inquiry into property developer donations for the Liberal Party but he insists that he 'is not the big man'. The identity of the so-called 'big man' who was behind a massive donation remains a mystery after Mr O'Farrell not only denied it was him but also said he didn't know who the big man was. Sidelined Police Minister Mike Gallacher and former Energy Minister Chris Hartcher have both told the Independent Commission Against Corruption that Mr O'Farrell was known as the 'big man'. 'Someone will always try and rort the system' Mr O'Farrell said outside the corruption inquiry into property developer donations to the NSW Liberal Party . Sidelined Police Minister Mike Gallacher called the former Premier various names including 'boss' and 'Barry' but never 'the big man' according to Mr O'Farrell . The inquiry has heard differing versions about just who the `big man' is, with some saying it was coal magnate Nathan Tinkler while others have suggested it was Mr O'Farrell . But the one-time leader of Liberal Party, who resigned after denying he'd received a $3000 bottle of win from a lobbyist, said he was called many things by Mr Gallacher but never 'the big man'. 'I don't know who the big man is,' Mr O'Farrell told the ICAC. 'What I do know is that in any meetings with Mr Gallacher, he either called me Barry, he either called me boss in that curious police jargon or if someone else was present, he would call me premier.' The inquiry has heard differing versions about just who the `big man' is, with some saying it was coal magnate Nathan Tinkler while others have suggested it was Mr O'Farrell. The `big man' term shot to prominence as a result of a December 2010 text message from disgraced Newcastle MP Tim Owen's campaign manager to Mr Gallacher asking 'how's our Big Man going with the $120k?' being tendered as evidence. But the identity remains a mystery. 'I don't know who the big man is,' Mr O'Farrell told the ICAC. The corruption inquiry has led to nine Liberal Party MPs stepping down, including the former Premier . Mr Gallacher last week said he couldn't remember receiving the 'big man' text. While giving evidence earlier in the inquiry, Mr Owen's former campaign manager said the `big man' was Mr Tinkler and that Mr Gallacher was 'making' the $120,000 donation happen. Property developers, such as Mr Tinkler, have been banned from making political donations to NSW parties since 2009. However, Mr Gallacher's lawyer has spent hours arguing the 'big man' was the former premier, who as Opposition Leader in late 2010 kept a close eye on campaign funding. Mr Tinkler has also fronted the inquiry and said he knew nothing about the mysterious `big man'. The $120,000 was allegedly being sought to fund 2011 election campaigns in the Hunter Valley. But Mr O'Farrell said he wasn't directly involved in fundraising. 'The only fundraising activities I was engaged in relation to the Hunter was the usual events that I was asked to front up to attend,' he said. Not the big man. Barry O'Farrell (left) says 'what I do know is that in any meetings with Mr Gallacher (right), he either called me Barry, he either called me boss in that curious police jargon or if someone else was present, he would call me premier' Outside the commission, Mr O'Farrell said the record of the NSW Liberal Government since winning the 2011 election had been 'overshadowed by revelations of the actions of a very few people'. 'It's bitterly disappointing for me to see in the lead-up to that 2011 election campaign a small number of people decided to illegally raise funds and therefore detract from the efforts of the state Liberal government,' Mr O'Farrell said. 'That's what galling about this process.' The former Premier said his party colleagues knew the rules. 'Yes the rules change but I would expect people to abide by those rule changes,' he said . He said as Premier he had given the ICAC record powers but added 'that someone will always try and rort the system'.","Former Premier Barry O'Farrell insists he's not 'the big man'

"Cleared: Merritt Landry, 33, of New Orleans, is no longer under investigation over the July shooting . The 33-year-old man who shot a teenage . boy in the head after finding him in his gated driveway at 2am last . July is no longer under investigation. Father-of-two . Merritt Landry, 33, of New Orleans, was facing a second-degree . attempted murder charge after shooting Marshall Coulter, then 14, in the . head, claiming he thought the teenager was going to rob him. However, . Orleans Parish District Attorney will no longer charge Mr Landry as the . teenager has been arrested connection with burglaries in the same . neighbourhood. The incident last July left the now 15-year-old Marshall Coulter in critical condition and doctors feared he would not survive. Mr . Landry claimed he had found Coulter by his care in the gated driveway . and when the teenager made a quick movement 'as if to reach for . something,' so he shot him out of concern for his own safety, according . to an arrest warrant. Coulter was shot from 30 feet away, according to evidence recovered at the scene. At . the time, Coulter’s family members admitted that he had been involved . in petty crimes, but that he would never touch a weapon. 'He would steal - he was a professional thief, sure,' Coulter's 23-year-old brother, David, told the Times-Picayune at the time. 'But . he would never pick up a gun, not in a million years. He was too scared . to aim a gun at the grass, let alone aim it at a person. No way. Before . he'll ever pick up a gun, he'll be your friend first.' 'He's . still a little boy,' the brother added. 'Who pulls a trigger on a . 14-year-old? What if it was your little brother or your sister? How . would you feel?' David Coulter, the brother of injured teen Marshall Coulter, said his brother has been involved in petty crimes but would never been violent . However, . although Coulter was unarmed when he was shot by Mr Landry, he was . recently linked to a crime in 2012 when he is accused of entering a . house where he stole a gun, threatened the homeowner and fled with the . weapon. Earlier this month . Coulter was arrested after a homeowner in the Faubourg Marigny . neighbourhood found him in his house, after which another resident in . the area found that his CCTV system had captured Coulter attempting to . break into his home. ‘Following . Coulter's most recent burglary arrests, any case that this office had . against Landry was irreversibly damaged,’ Orleans Parish District . Attorney Leon Cannizzaro said in statement to NOLA.com . ‘I . am ethically obligated not to charge an individual against whom I do . not possess evidence that proves beyond a reasonable doubt that he . committed a crime. ‘Such evidence does not exist in this case.’ The teen was unarmed and standing near Landry's vehicle, which was parked in the gated driveway in front of Landry's house (pictured) on Mandeville Street, when he was shot . The teen had allegedly climbed over the gate to Landry's driveway, pictured here . It . also appears that Coulter may have exaggerate his medical condition, as . officials had been led to believe that he was still unable to walk . without assistance. The recent burglary arrests indicate otherwise. As for Mr Landry, his legal representatives said he was ‘overjoyed’ by the District Attorney’s decision. ‘Merritt never wanted to be in a position to shoot anyone,’ Mr Landry’s attorney Roger Jordan told NOLA.com . ‘He . never wanted to be in the position where he had to defend his family, . but he did that, and now he's had to live through this ordeal.’","Merritt Landry, 33, will not be charged with attempted murder .

"Gloucester have risked sparking a club versus country row with Wales by naming injured hooker Richard Hibbard in their squad to face Harlequins on Friday night. The 30-year-old front row was seen leaving the Wales camp in a protective boot on Tuesday evening, after being left out of the 23-man group to play Fiji this weekend. Hibbard was pulled off 58 minutes into Saturday’s defeat by Australia and his omission by Warren Gatland - who was under no obligation to release the player back to the Premiership club - was seemingly to boost recovery ahead of next weekend’s Test against New Zealand. Richard Hibbard has been named in Gloucester's squad to face Harlequins on Friday night . While defensive coach Sean Edwards said the Cherry and Whites were within their rights to select the forward, Sportsmail understands that he was not expected to feature on the bench for Friday night’s Kingsholm fixture. ‘He’s been released back and, like a lot of players who are released back, he’s been selected by his club,’ said Edwards. ‘He didn’t get picked by Wales - not that he was dropped. We just rotated the three hookers and he had a bit of a bad foot as well. ‘It’s sometimes a bit misleading when they have those boots on, because they can be for a minor injury. You see a player with a boot on and you think he’s ruptured his ligaments or broken his foot or something. But sometimes they are just on for a couple of days as protective measures. Not being a medical man myself I’m not quite sure how he was.’ Hibbard makes a charge with ball in hand against the Wallabies at the Millennium Stadium last Saturday . Edwards denied claims that it was part of a deal with Gloucester to make Hibbard available for the fourth Test against South Africa; similar to the agreement Gatland made with Racing Metro over second row Luke Charteris. Ospreys hooker Scott Baldwin has filled Hibbard’s place in the starting XV, which has eight new faces for the second Test at the Millennium Stadium. Rhys Priestland is promoted to the line-up following an injury to fly half Dan Biggar - and Edwards has told the minority who booed Priestland last week that such vitriol has no place in the game. As defence coach, Edwards will be keen to eradicate the missed tackles that let the Wallabies in for two of their three tries last weekend. Wales coach Warren Gatland omitted Lions hooker Hibbard from his squad to face Fiji on Saturday . But he has also called on his players to be more aggressive in defence – although Jamie Roberts faces a huge task against 19-stone centre Nemani Nadolo – and highlighted a period of ‘passive’ play that allowed Foley to seal the victory with a late drop goal. ‘We were passive in the build-up to the drop-goal,’ said Edwards. ‘We defended for 22 phases, which in itself is good defence, but we pride ourselves on our attacking style of defence and actually trying to take yardage off the opposition. ‘We probably conceded 18-20 yards in 22 phases, which equates to about a yard every phase, which is something we have definitely been working on more this week. We’ve been working on blasting hard off the line and really dominating those collisions.","Wales and Lions hooker Richard Hibbard was left out of the 23-man group to play Fiji on Saturday .

"The Prime Minister's Chief of Staff, Peter Credlin has been dragged into the Independent Commission Against Corruption inquiry into property developer donations and the Liberal Party. The emails show just how much access a Liberal donor had to powerful figures within the party. ICAC commissioner Megan Latham lifted a suppression order today on the email trail today. Ms Latham ruled there was no reason why emails from March 2011 between big party donor Brickworks, the then chief Liberal party fundraiser Paul Nicolaou and Ms Credlin could not be made public. Peta Credlin (centre) is Tony Abbott's Chief of Staff and Paul Nicolaou (right) was the NSW Liberal Party's senior fundraiser. Their email trail with Brickworks boss Lindsay Partridge (left) has been made public at ICAC . Mr Partridge began by making a supportive statement to Mr Nicolaou in relation to Tony Abbott's push against the carbon tax 'Paul, tell Tony to stick to his guns on no carbon tax'. 'I am running an internal fight with the BCA (Business Council of Australia) who seem to be driven by a few companies who will make bundles out of the tax. 'We want certainty that there is no new tax,' Mr Partridge's email stated. Brickworks reportedly provided donations of up to $384,000 to the Liberal Party from July 2010 to April 2011. ICAC heard how Mr Nicolaou sent the email on to Ms Credlin stating 'please note below from Lindsay Partridge the MD of Brickworks the largest producers of bricks in Australia and a very good supporter of the party'. Her reply read the information 'provides a great line for Question Time'. The email trail continued with Ms Credlin asking: 'Do you have a number that I might be able to contact him on and see if he was happy for us to use it and perhaps, use his sector as an example (if not his actual business)? We wouldn’t do this without his explicit approval but it would be ideal for tomorrow'. 'We want certainty that there is no new tax,' so said the email from Brickworks boss Lindsay Partridge . ICAC also heard that Mr Nicolaou had invited Mr Partridge to a private dinner with Tony Abbott and other business leaders at a cost of $5000 a head. The event was ultimately cancelled. As the donations from Brickworks arrived, Mr Nicolaou reportedly shared the news with Brian Loughnane, the federal director of the Liberal Party. Mr Loughnane is married to Peta Credlin (above), the PM's chief of staff. The email trail between the PM's Chief of Staff and the Liberal Party's senior fundraiser continued with Ms Credlin asking: 'Do you have a number that I might be able to contact him on and see if he was happy for us to use it and perhaps, use his sector as an example (if not his actual business)? We wouldn’t do this without his explicit approval but it would be ideal for tomorrow'. Mr Partridge returned with: 'In Australia most building and construction materials are made locally due to the weight; they (are) expensive to import. Under a carbon tax regime many products including cement production will move offshore'. 'Under a carbon tax regime many products including cement production will move offshore. The others the price will just go up by the tax.' A short time after this communication between the three, then Opposition Leader Tony Abbott visited the Austral Bricks site at Horsley Park in Sydney's outer south-west and remarked that the carbon tax would push up the price of bricks to the tune of 10 per cent and that consumers would wear the increase. Peta Credlin (right) is Tony Abbott's Chief of Staff and Paul Nicolaou (left) was the NSW Liberal Party's senior fundraiser. Their email trail with Brickworks boss Lindsay Partridge has been made public at ICAC . Brickworks Limited is the parent company of Austral Bricks, with investment in building product groups such as Austral Bricks and with significant interests in property sales and waste management. Mr Partridge earlier told the ICAC he regularly donated through the Free Enterprise Foundation because it was more 'discreet' than handing money straight to the Liberal party. 'It kept it out of the press's eyes until after the official declaration was done, which was usually after the election,' he said. The ICAC is investigating allegations the Free Enterprise Foundation was used to disguise back-door donations to the New South Wales Liberal Party in the lead-up to the 2011 election. It's alleged that donors who wanted to contribute to the NSW party - but were prevented under 2009 laws that prohibited property developers - would give to the foundation instead. An email Mr Partridge sent in July 29, 2010 to Mr Nicolaou makes direct reference to a $50,000 donation. The emails had originally been suppressed over claims of a possible breach of parliamentary privilege but that order was lifted today. ICAC also heard that Mr Nicolaou had invited Mr Partridge to a private dinner with Tony Abbott and other business leaders at a cost of $5000 a head. The event was ultimately cancelled. As the donations from Brickworks arrived, Mr Nicolaou reportedly shared the news with Brian Loughnane, the federal director of the Liberal Party. Mr Loughnane is married to Peta Credlin. The current ICAC inquiry is looking at whether prohibited donations were solicited by Liberal members, including former cabinet ministers Chris Hartcher and Mike Gallacher, ahead of the 2011 state election.","Peta Credlin is Tony Abbott's Chief of Staff and is considered one of the party's leading powerbrokers .

"Frankly, I don’t know whether to be mortified or flattered. Returning from a champagne reception hosted by the ship’s captain, I discover my room attendant has lovingly folded my tatty pyjamas into an origami-style dog. It doesn’t stop there. The next morning he knocks on the cabin door and asks if I need anything ironed, which, call me sensitive, I take to mean I look creased. Come sail with me: A small ship is one of the best ways to see a grand sight such as the Sognefjord . It turns out that the always happy crew are one of the highlights of my cruise to the Norwegian fjords. They even smile as they distribute sick bags on an unusually choppy crossing of the North Sea. Discovering the fjords on a cruise that starts and finishes in the UK (in this case, Tilbury, Essex), is simpler and cheaper than an independent exploration of this otherwise expensive country - at the Bergen fish market, among wriggling lobsters and chunks of black whale meat, I spot £20 fish sandwiches and £24 prawn skewers. I scurry back to the ship for afternoon tea which, like other meals, is included in the price. The only extras are excursions, alcohol and a £5-a-day tip. And the 425-cabin Marco Polo, with no children or nightclubs on board, is perfectly suited to the leisurely art of fjord cruising. Built in 1965, the ship sails under the Cruise & Maritime Voyages flag. Her thick hull was designed to maximise stability and smash through ice. In recent years, she has sailed the Amazon, the Yangtze and most of the oceans. Her size - she accommodates just 800 people - means I quickly get to know my fellow passengers. At lunch on the first day I find myself sitting next to a 22-year-old doing a molecular biology degree at Cambridge; the next day it’s a retired speedboat champion. Great glacial remnants: The Naeroyfjord (left) and the Sognefjord (right) are two of Norway's loveliest sights . By day three my boyfriend and I have become friends with our cabin neighbours, Lowri and Justin, and our table tennis matches become a daily staple. The ship generally spends the entire day at one location, setting sail in the early evening. The sun sets around 10pm, making it hard to keep track of time. On several nights I head to the deck to watch the scenery slip by over a post-dinner drink and before I know it, it’s 3am. Stepping ashore, I feel unashamedly smug whenever I glance back at the vessel, which looks positively tiny alongside other ships. Her size allows us to sail deep into the fjords. One stop takes us to the remote village of Fjaerland. Until 1986, when a road tunnel was built, the only way in was by boat along the narrow waterway. Fjaerland is famous for its glacier museum, one of only two in the world. A video shows the calving - where ice breaks off the edge of the flow - of a Norwegian glacier larger than Manhattan. Later we walk to the base of an icy blue arm of the Jostedalsbreen glacier — the largest in continental Europe. In Flam village in Aurland, we slip into a tiny harbour and head for the steepest standard- gauge railway in Europe. In one hour, we whizz through 20 tunnels and past thundering, foamy waterfalls before reaching Myrdal mountain station, 863m above sea level. One of the most surreal moments occurs on the way down, as we pause at a waterfall. Hidden speakers blast an eerie tune, and a woman dressed as a fairy from Norwegian folklore emerges from behind a boulder and starts to dance. A city on the edge: Bergen, with its colourful Bryggen wharf to the fore, is known as the 'gateway to the fjords' We also visit Balestrand, a beautiful village in the mountainous Sognefjord region. The area was a favourite holiday destination of Hitler - and our guide produces a dog-eared, black-and-white photo of the Fuhrer standing on the harbourside in 1937. The majority of land in Norway is privately owned and Balestrand locals have been offered millions by developers desperate to build hotels or ski resorts, but they’re not interested. Vast displays of wealth are considered vulgar, our guide tells us. He introduces us to the cashier at the local co-op - who owns the mountain above us. Our final stop is Bergen, a hilly, historic city that feels like a sprawling metropolis compared to the villages we’ve passed. We wander around crooked wooden Hanseatic houses, once the homes of German traders who arrived in the 14th century. As we sail out of the harbour, we squeeze past a much larger cruise ship and I watch a crew member herd passengers along the gangplank. The best things really do come in small packages. Cruise and Maritime Voyages (www.cruiseandmaritime.com, 0845 430 0274) have an . eight-night Majestic Fjordland cruise on the Marco Polo departing April . 25, 2015, from Tilbury.

"For most of us, a slender waist is the product of a careful diet and plenty of exercise. But not for Michele Kobke, 24. The Berliner has shrunk her waist from 25in (64cm) to just 16in (40cm) by wearing a corset every day for three years - even while sleeping. And despite now having a waist smaller than most catwalk models, the German slimmer says she hopes to whittle her waist down to a shocking 14inches (38cm). Scroll down for video . Shape shifter: 24-year-old Michele Kobke has a tiny 16in waist after wearing a corset every day and night for three years . Change: Michele in 2008, when her waist was 25 inches, and now, with a waist that is ten inches smaller . 'It embraces me and gives me [a] pretty, defined waist,' she revealed. It feels nice and smooth. It's unique.' But Michele's tiny waist could prove to have serious consequences for her health, and already, she struggles to stand up without her corset, thanks to wasted muscles in her back and stomach. Her stomach is so constricted, she can't eat a normal meal and instead eats up to 10 small meals a day. Not that she's concerned: 'My life hasn't changed, just slowed down a little,' she reveals. 'Now my movement is more feminine. 'Right now I'm a little breathless, changing corsets is like a high-performance sport for me' Tiny though Kobke's waist is, the record for the world's tiniest midriff is held by another - American Cathie Jung, whose waist measures just under 15in (38cm). By comparison, the average British woman has a waist that measures 33.43in  (84.9cm)  - equivalent to a dress size 14. However, doctors say that a waist bigger than 31.49in (80cm) could lead to serious problems, including heart disease. Recent figures show that nearly 57 per cent of British women have waists bigger than the healthy limit set by experts. But tests reveal that Michele's tiny waist is also causing problems, among them digestive troubles as her stomach is forced out of its natural postiion. According to Dr Rudiger Langer, specialist in internal medicine, the corset has also resulted in Michele having weaker lungs than is normal for a woman her age. 'In time, it won't be possible to move without the corset, or in the worst case, it won't be possible to move in general,' he warns. Although Kobke's tiny waist is guaranteed to raise a few eyebrows, not least that of her doctor, the German believes she has the perfect feminine figure.

"He was pasty-faced and overweight, with a hacking cough and shabby clothes that smelled of booze, tobacco and worse. Yet Dylan Thomas could get the ladies into bed, all right — even though he wasn’t much good under the covers. Thomas was as faithful as a randy rabbit, but he wooed women with a shower of sensual, shimmering words that fell on the parched earth of their souls. The love of his life was as destructive and damaged as he was, and though others tried to save him from himself, the writer was doomed to die at 39, after a (disputed) mammoth drinking session in New York. Randy rabbit: Dylan Thomas was constantly unfaithful, but wooed women with a shower of sensual, shimmering words . Six decades after his death, Dylan Thomas is creeping back into fashion. But the superb rolling music of his lines isn’t to everybody’s taste; some prefer their poetry crisper, sharper, cooler. The trouble is that there have been many, many accounts of his shambolic, sponging, drunken life — and the more you read, the harder it is to separate the petulant, self-indulgent, overgrown child from the glorious bard, who is surely one of the most interesting voices of the last century. Hilly Janes paints a largely sympathetic portrait of the poet, which is fitting, since her unique ‘way in’ is through the eyes of her own father, the distinguished painter Fred Janes. He completed three portraits of his lifelong friend — and these (pictured on the book jacket) give Hilly Janes her loose structure: the ‘three lives’. What makes this book so readable is the fact that it offers rather more than Dylan Thomas and his insalubrious escapades. Portrait of a poet: Dylan Thomas by his friend, painter Fred Janes . Janes creates an affectionate group-memoir of a creative set of young Welshman — Thomas, Fred Janes, Vernon Watkins, Mervyn Levy and Dan Jones — who left the land of their fathers to make their way in the world, painting, writing and making music. There are some lovely stories. When the painter and the poet were sharing a chaotic flat in London, Fred was in charge of the rent, ‘and while Dylan only had a mattress to sleep on, if he didn’t pay his share, Fred, who was much taller and stronger, would pick him up, turn him upside down and shake him till any loose change fell out of his trouser pockets’. Dylan’s nastier side displayed itself very early. He was used to being molly-coddled by his too-devoted mother Florence and hated having to fend for himself. So he wrote to a Swansea friend ‘complaining about the “little maggots” he was living with and how boring and provincial he found them’. Nowhere in her book does Hilly Janes indicate that her father was anything other than a good friend to the often-disgusting Dylan — and, indeed, after the poet’s premature death, Fred was very caring and attentive to Florence. In 1936, Thomas met Caitlin Macnamara, who had been neglected by appalling parents and raped by the artist Augustus John. She was to match Thomas in alcoholism and promiscuity, and expressed her rage and frustration at his dissolute, irresponsible life by physically attacking him. She was a pretty dreadful mother, by all accounts, and her own children knew the feel of her fists. On the other hand, Hilly Janes comments that it’s hard not to empathise with the hard-pressed woman who said: ‘Had I not gone to the pub with Dylan I would have been left there, sitting like a fool.’ Unlikely lothario: Despite being pasty-faced, overweight and constantly smelling of booze, Thomas (played by Tom Hollander) could get ladies into bed . The author is at pains to remind us of Thomas’s quieter, gentler side, too, and brings us up to date with what happened after his death: the long struggles over his inheritance and what became of children and grandchildren. Her analysis of his literary legacy is deft, but almost the most delightful thing about this book is its tribute to her talented father, who died in 1999 and was clearly a man of integrity. Which, I’m afraid, nobody could say of Dylan Thomas.","Despite being pasty and overweight, the writer was a hit with the ladies .
Unfortunately he wasn't much good under the covers .
New biography offers a different, gentler aspect to Thomas, but also shows his nastier side ."
"The Marietas Islands have been described as the world’s most idyllic bomb site. As I emerge from crystal water onto the much whispered about ‘Hidden Beach’, I’m inclined to agree. Here I am, mere miles away from Puerto Vallarta, on Mexico's west coast - but I could not feel further removed from this all-singing holiday resort. The Islas Marietas, to use their Spanish name, were first formed centuries ago due to volcanic activity and have never been inhabited by man. Taking advantage of their isolation, in the early 1900s the Mexican government used them to conduct military testing. Hidden Beach: This secret crescent, only accessible if you swim through a cave, is an 'idyllic bombsite' A crater bombed into one of the islands has created the pristine Hidden Beach, a secret crescent of sand that you can only access by swimming through a cave. As I breast-stroke through this dark tunnel, my guide tells me to keep my face in the water so the tide does not buoy me up and bash my skull into the rock ceiling. This is not the most relaxing way to start a day of sunbathing. But I am at peace as soon as I’m out of the . cave, with nothing to do except lie on the sand and enjoy the . warm ocean waters lapping at my feet. It really is a private paradise. I . wouldn’t be surprised if Kim and Kanye made it here during their recent . second honeymoon in Punta Mita, an exclusive vacation enclave close by. Thankfully, there is no danger of any bombs whistling overhead nowadays. The islands were declared a national park in the 1960s, thanks to the efforts of Jacques Cousteau, who found them rich in marine life such as sea turtles, humpback whales and dolphins. Colourful: Puerto Vallarta offers a more traditional slice of Mexican life than its rowdier counterparts . Laid back vibe: People walk the streets barefoot and families crowd the Malecon at sunset . Until . recently, Puerto Vallarta, this marvel of Mexico’s Pacific coast, was near inaccessible . for British visitors, found only at the end of various connecting . flights and dreary layovers. But . now, with the long-haul flying range of the Boeing Dreamliner, Puerto . Vallarta is just a 12-hour direct flight from London or Manchester. The town itself is a smart resort long popular with Americans and Canadians. It offers a more traditional slice of Mexican life than its rowdier counterparts on the Yucatán Peninsula (that would be you, Cancun). Celebrity hotspot: Kim and Kanye honeymooned on the Riviera Nayarit in June . Downtown, white-washed houses with terracotta-tiled rooftops are backed by green, palm-packed mountains, their slopes free of development. In front, Banderas Bay is an arc of cerulean sea and golden shoreline, dotted with beachfront hotels. A stroll along the Malecon (seafront promenade) takes me past laid-back scenes of everyday life. Mexico is often portrayed as an anarchic warzone populated by drug lords (thank you, Hollywood). But the sight of two tourist police dressed in crisp-white shorts and T-shirts, relaxedly riding segways, reassures me there’s not much trouble for them to attend to in this town. Young local men walk the streets barefoot, such is the warm, holiday vibe. Families crowd the Malecon at sunset. On Sundays, you can even catch the townspeople dancing to traditional music in the main square, Plaza Principal. Pool crazy: Secrets Vallarta Bay is a new resort with an adults-only policy - and a lot of swimming pools . View from the lobby: You can gaze out onto swaying palms and crashing waves . I’m staying a ten-minute drive from Downtown at the beachfront Secrets Vallarta Bay, a new resort with an adults-only policy. Guests range from twenty- to sixty-somethings, all smooching couples or grinning groups of friends, with as many six-pack-toting, board-short-clad young Americans as there are older, deeply bronzed Brits (they’ve obviously been quick to book those new flights). The hotel lobby lacks a fourth wall, so you can gaze right out onto the swaying palms and crashing waves. Rooms are huge and come with deep baths that turn into hot tubs at the flick of a switch. It seems too slick to be all-inclusive, but it is. Premium drinks flow freely, room service and mini bar carry no extra charge, and you can eat with abandon at any of the eight restaurants (my favourite is the breakfast buffet, where I load up every morning on freshly made guacamole, washed down with a mimosa, naturally). There seems to be a wedding by romantic sunset on the beach every night. It all sounds too luxurious to leave, and many don’t, spending their fortnight in the myriad swimming pools and getting pampered in the spa. There are a few tours I would highly recommend, though, if you can lift yourself from your lounger. One is to the Hidden Beach in the Marietas. Another, run by local operator Vallarta Adventures, promises to show me ‘Hidden Mexico’, and I spend the day walking the cobbled streets of quiet, colourful villages and studying petroglyphs - rock engravings left by the Aztatlán. Trips worth trying: Local operator Vallarta Adventures shows travellers 'hidden Mexico', including rock engravings left by the Aztatlán (right), and a tequila distillery where the size of agave pods (left) surprised Laura . Thirsty: Laura tries a very large Mexican Bloody Mary . At the end of the tour, I visit a tequila distillery, and am surprised at the size of the agave – the plant tequila is made from. They look like enormous pine cones. The man who conducts my tequila tasting is almost certainly drunk, insisting on matching me shot for shot (I am a member of only one of several tour groups to pass through that day). Most Mexicans you meet will extol the virtues of their various types of tequila – some are for sipping, others for mixing – and will probably tell you that Jose Cuervo, the golden-coloured brand that stocks the shelves in the UK, is underwhelming. I also learn that the worm at the bottom of the tequila bottle is fallacy. The ‘worm’ is actually found in mescal – similar to tequila but made from a different type of agave – and is in fact the larva of a moth. Tasty. At the end . of my trip, I decide to head a 45-minute drive north of Puerto Vallarta . to Riviera Nayarit, a 200-mile stretch of coastline that caters to a . rather upmarket clientele. Think ocean-side golf courses, a Four . Seasons, and so on. This is the area where Kim and Kanye holed up in June. I . want to check out the Riviera’s ‘hippy chic’ town Sayulita - once a . sleepy fishing village but now the kind of affluent hipster haven that . draws any number and range of travellers. Boho beach babe: Laura tries her hand at surfing off the 'hippy chic' town of Sayulita . I must admit that I’m won over. There is just the right balance here of easygoing authenticity (cheap taco stands, fresh fish sizzling on streetside grills, studiously tatty beachfront bungalows) and vogue-ish scene (not-cheap souvenir shops, surf schools teaching the sexy and wealthy how to be at one with the Mexican waves). I spend the morning surfing among the tanned totty and seriously consider converting to a life of boho beach babedom for the rest of my days. But if posing with beautiful beach bums isn’t your thing, remember Puerto Vallarta is just around the corner. This is what is so great about this part of the Pacific coast. Whether you’re after adventure or pure repose, tradition or ‘a scene’, they are all within a few minutes of each other in Mexico’s hottest holiday haven. Two weeks at Secrets Vallarta Bay with .

"Students at a Mormon church-owned university have launched a protest against a ban on something its namesake once sported: a beard. About 50 young men at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, stormed the campus on bikes, rollerblades and skateboards sporting real or fake beards calling on the school to end the 'outdated' rule. They were all required to signed a 1940s 'honor code' when they joined the school accepting that 'men are expected to be clean-shaven'. Protest: About 50 students stormed Brigham Young University in protest against the ban on beards . But now, they are revolting - and holding up early Mormon leaders as their inspiration. The organizer of the Bike For Beards demonstration on Friday night, Shane Pittson, said: 'I love BYU. I love being a student here but the rule on beards I find particularly outdated.' The 23-year-old international studies major and other students have launched a petition drive to get the school to lift the ban. University spokeswoman Carri Jenkins said students agree to its grooming standards before their first day of class and the beard ban was set in place by students. 'It's nothing against beards. It's just how we choose to represent ourselves at the university,' she told The Salt Lake Tribune. Brigham Young and many other early leaders of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints grew beards as they aged. A statue of Young in downtown Salt Lake City depicts him with a beard, but another at BYU shows him clean-shaven. Agreement: Students at the Mormon church-run school agreed to be clean shaven when they enrolled . The BYU Honor Code, created in the 1940s, states that 'men are expected to be clean-shaven' and beards are not acceptable. But students can be exempted from the prohibition if they have a medical condition such as scarring. Among other things, the university's mandatory student contract also forbids premarital sex, alcohol consumption and tattoos. In 1971, then-university President Dallin Oaks defended the beard ban as 'contemporary and pragmatic,' but he said he would be surprised if it was not eventually changed. At the time, Oaks said beards and long hair on men were elements of 'slovenly appearance' linked to 'protest, revolution and rebellion against authority. They are also symbols of hippie and drug culture.' Pittson enjoyed growing his own beard this summer, but he shaved before the protest. 'I figured it would make more of an impact to say, ""I respect the university and here I am abiding by the rules but asking for change,"" ' he told The Tribune. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","50 men at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, stormed school .

"I’d write up the opposition team on a flip chart. One to 15. Then I’d write up the England team. Then I’d eyeball my players. ‘OK, what dressing room do you want to be in? What team sheet would you rather be on?’ It was the England rugby dressing room, but it could also be the England football dressing room with Roy Hodgson addressing his players before this opening World Cup fixture against Italy. ‘You want to be in our dressing room, with Steven Gerrard, with Daniel Sturridge, with Wayne Rooney as your team-mates, or would you rather be on their team sheet?’ Make no mistake, this is a very good Italian team who qualified with two games to spare, but England have nothing to fear. Play to win: Skipper Steven Gerrard shows the way England should do it against Poland in qualifying . Fighting spirit: Wayne Rooney is a matchwinner and his talents in front of goal should be utilised . Roy has to convey that to his players in the moments when an international coach takes to his stage. The closer to kick-off, the more important his role becomes. What is his body language in the build-up? The players will be watching him. Is he nervous or confident? Does he believe in his team? Do not create any reason for doubt. None at all. International management is so different to club management. This is the group stages but you must treat it as if it is knockout football and Roy is one-on-one against Cesare Prandelli, the former Roma and Fiorentina coach who is now manager of Italy. My team had a saying: ‘There is no Monday morning if you lose.’ By that we meant there was a finality about defeat. Routine ended, and there would be no Monday morning meeting. That is what Roy should be telling his players. Win this game and England are in control of their group. Even a 0-0 result against Italy would represent failure, a failure to win and a missed opportunity. I hope Roy will be telling them: ‘You play for Liverpool, Manchester United, Chelsea, Arsenal, Manchester City, Everton... but this is England. Some of you may have won titles and Champions League medals, but that was playing for your club. This is the World Cup, this is the whole country. This is England v Italy and this is the biggest game you have ever played in your lives. So let’s prepare and play as if our lives depend on it, let’s really make things happen, go and win it.’ Rallying cry: Sir Clive Woodward has urged Roy Hodgson to go out and attack Italy . The waiting is almost over: England meet Italy in Manaus in a must-not-lose opener . I wouldn’t be playing down this game, I’d be turning it up. Roy should be creating pressure in the team because the greatest athletes love pressure — that is why they do it. The bigger the reward, the greater the fear. The fear of failure is what drives on elite athletes. In British Cycling, they do not aim for the podium. They only want gold. In my England rugby team, I only wanted players who were there to win the World Cup and who would thrive on the fear of failure. It is a big error for an international coach, dealing with elite players, to play down these moments. Ramp it up. Build on the pressure. Do the opposite of what everyone — including your opponents — will expect. It is a fine line and there should not be any illusions. In my dressing room we didn’t have players headbutting the wall or screaming out the national anthem. This might disappoint people outside the dressing room but the reality is far more impressive. Before playing South Africa in the group stages of the 2003 World Cup, a huge crunch game for us, I recall total focus in the dressing room. This game had been in the back of everyone’s mind for months, just like England v Italy, but there was total understanding and control over the emotion and the magnitude of the task at hand — and the players thrived on it. Yes, you need your players to keep their discipline and to make the right decisions under pressure, such as not diving into a tackle. But you can also remind your team that the opposition are under pressure, too, and challenge them to create even more pressure. Putting his body on the line: Lewis Moody makes the crucial charge down on Louis Koen which led to England's only try in the 25-6 win over South Africa . Fully focused: Will Greenwood beams after scoring that crucial try which ensured England topped Pool C . There are many ways you create pressure but the most effective and easiest is to do everything — and I mean everything — faster than they are used to. Can you make them feel uncomfortable? Target their weak areas. We saw the Republic of Ireland’s Shane Long worry the Italian defence with his pace and movement in the recent friendly at Craven Cottage and we should look for more of the same. Test them. Yes, your team will be tested, but test them. One of my favourite expressions in sport is ‘Pressure with Pressure’. No doubt Italy will put us under pressure at times, with the amount of possession they are likely to have and Andrea Pirlo’s ability to pick out a killer pass — but how do we respond when we win the ball back? Turnover is something that we talk about a lot in rugby but it is equally important in football. The reason why football is the world’s No 1 game is because it is simple. Don’t overcomplicate the tactics, even if there is a temptation to show how clever you are. It is the World Cup and we want to look and play smart. But a smart coach is a winning coach. Get your basics absolutely right — which for me in football are the set-pieces — and go from there. England are in good shape. They deserve a ‘well done’ for keeping the focus on the football. All anyone is talking about is the line-up and who should play. There is no distraction from the WAGs, no off-field scandals to be ashamed of. They can focus on the challenge ahead. Hodgson should take great credit for that, as it is not easy. Mercurial talent: Italy boss Cesare Prandelli (left) jokes with Mario Balotelli (centre) and Andrea Pirlo in training . Wily opponents: England must beware Serie A top scorer Ciro Immobile (left) and the gnarled Daniele De Rossi . Now, going into a game of this nature, I would pick a team as if my life depended on it. Not a team to come close to victory but a team that would attack for victory. Just naming this team will set the tone of how England will play. I would look at my rugby team and ask: ‘Do we have the players to score five tries?’ Roy should be  asking: ‘Do we have the players to score three goals?’ If England score three, Italy will have to be very good not to lose. With that in mind, I would play Ross Barkley and Raheem Sterling, both brilliant attacking players who take the ball forwards, ask questions and force mistakes from opponents with their pace and their ability to run at players. That would increase the pressure on Italy’s players. I used to have to name my rugby team on a Thursday, two days before the game. But every team I named, I wanted to wake on the day of the game thinking, ‘Wow... I’m excited to watch this team’. I hope Roy arrives at the stadium in Manaus genuinely excited about how this team are going to attack. I’ve met him a few times and he is great company and someone I can see the players will totally trust. He is experienced and this challenge will not daunt him. Precocious talent: Ross Barkley (right) should be given the nod to frighten Italy in England's opener . Fleet of foot: The pace of Raheem Sterling (right) can give any defence serious problems . A meeting of minds: Sir Clive chats with Hodgson on Sky's Sporting Heroes before the World Cup . I hope he reads this. I hope he banishes any thought of ‘a draw will do’. Take risks, create the mindset: ‘We must win’. Pick a team to score goals. Erase any negative thoughts about the heat and the jungle conditions and playing slowly. Let’s surprise Italy, give them the unexpected, win the game before the opponents realise they are in a game. International football can be slow, so make it fast. Liverpool climbed from seventh place to second by stunning opponents and winning games early. They have top players, so do England. England must keep the ball and hurt the opposition, but above everything play with great pace and energy. Two questions for Roy with the same answer: Has he got the team? Yes. Can England win this? Yes. There is no Monday morning.","This is a very good Italian team who qualified with two games to spare, but England have nothing to fear .

"If you’d taken a trip to Squaw Valley in California last year, you’d have been greeted by a rather more appealing sight to skiers than if you happened to visit on the same day this year. Ski areas in California and Colorado, as well as on the East Coast, are not getting anywhere near the amount of snow forecasters normally expect at this time of the year. So to keep the skiers happy many resorts have made their own snow - but relatively high temperatures in the Northeast have stopped some areas from even doing that. 2011: Squaw Valley, California, is pictured this month with very little snow, as many ski areas are not getting anywhere near the amount of snow forecasters normally expect at this time of the year . 2010: Squaw Valley, California, is pictured in December last year when there was no need for artificial snow . The Sierra Nevada mountain range in California had more than 2ft of snow last December – but many state resorts have only had inches so far this year, reported ESPN. ‘Compared to last year, it's very dry,’ Nevada meteorologist John Mittelstadt told ESPN. ‘Compared to the average, we have had Decembers like this, but it's definitely one of the dry ones.’ Low temperatures in areas such as Tahoe have helped snow-makers continue manufacturing. ‘It snows here every night because we make it snow,’ Heavenly Ski Resort spokesman Russ Pecoraro told ESPN, adding that it has ‘mid-winter conditions’ on its open trails. 'Compared to last year, it's very dry. Compared to the average, we have had Decembers like this, but it's definitely one of the dry ones' John Mittelstadt . Over in Colorado many resorts have had snowfall that is around three-quarters of the normal level but are still getting the income they expected. ‘Christmas is nearly sold out in town,’ Aspen-Snowmass spokesman Jeff Hanley told ESPN, saying that tourists often plan their holidays there up to a year in advance.

Parts of the Northeast may have a White Christmas but most of the rest of the country will be missing a coating of snow for the holiday, forecasters said. The first official day of winter is Thursday of this week and the East Coast is still expected to have relatively mild temperatures of around the mid-50F range for the rest of the week.","Ski areas in California, Colorado and East Coast get less snow than forecast .

"Wales defence coach Shaun Edwards has added his voice to a chorus of disapproval aimed at the Millennium Stadium boo-boys. Fly-half Rhys Priestland will line up against Fiji on Saturday just a week after he was jeered when he replaced an injured Dan Biggar early in the second period during Wales' 33-28 loss to Australia. The booing came from a small minority of home supporters, and their behaviour has subsequently been condemned by Wales head coach Warren Gatland and Priestland's squad colleagues. Wales defence coach Shaun Edwards hit back strongly at the Welsh supporters who booed Rhys Priestland . And Edwards has now told those fans: 'You boo one of us, you boo all of us.' The protest at Priestland has prompted an angry response from within the Wales camp, and Edwards hit back strongly on Thursday. 'With Rhys Priestland, it is important to remember that most of the crowd is behind us, but you boo one of us, you boo all of us,' Edwards said. Priestland (right) replaced Dan Biggar early in the second half of Wales' 33-28 loss to Australia . 'If you boo Rhys Priestland, you boo myself, you boo Warren Gatland, you boo Leigh Halfpenny, you boo the Welsh jersey. Personally, I don't think that is on. 'Over the last number of years we have performed admirably as a Welsh nation, with only 20,000 players and three million people, we've tried to wear that Welsh shirt with a lot of pride. 'For someone to boo that shirt, to be honest, I am not very happy about it.

Reserves: Emyr Philips, Nicky Smith, Rhodri Jones, Alun Wyn Jones, James King, Rhodri Williams, James Hook, Cory Allen . 'If people are around those people in the crowd, and they are silly enough to do it again, I would like to think that the rest of the crowd would let them know what they think about them.' Asked if he felt if rugby crowd behaviour had changed much in recent years, Edwards added: 'We don't want this booing going on. 'What has always been fantastic about rugby is that it has always been a family game. You can take your wife and kids along, and we don't want it to be dragged down at all. 'You can have a vociferous crowd against you, but at the end of the game, both teams are clapped, which I think is very important. The dignity of rugby must be upheld. Priestland (left), at training with Leigh Halfpenny during the week, will start at fly-half against Fiji on Saturday . 'The thing about rugby is that it is a dignified game. All the aggression comes out on the pitch, not from the crowd. 'The crowd are there to enjoy and have a fantastic day. You go to a game of rugby, you can have a pint, you can take your children and feel that you are absolutely safe, and long may that continue.' Priestland will be part of a much-changed Wales team from the Walllabies clash, but one that should still be good enough to win comfortably ahead of next week's Millennium Stadium appointment with world champions New Zealand.","Fly-half Rhys Priestland was jeered by sections of the crowd at the Millennium Stadium after he replaced Dan Biggar early in the second half of Wales' 33-28 loss to Australia .

Championship side Leeds United have had their problems both on and off the pitch this season . The Leeds United pantomime has now seen wacky owner Massimo Cellino re-employ club secretary Alison Royston on a consultancy. This is despite Cellino having sacked her when he arrived at Elland Road.

The Football League, meanwhile, are expected to decide at next month’s board meeting whether to charge Leeds with misconduct after Cellino and advisers withheld from them a fraud judgment by an Italian court that could result in Cellino failing the owners’ and directors’ test. A second court case in Sardinia about Cellino’s alleged tax evasion on his boat Lucky 23 has been delayed. FA general secretary Alex Horne is leaving his £580,000-a-year job without a new post in mind. It is understood Horne believes his football c.v. after 11 years at the FA wouldn’t look much different if he spent another four years in the post — and most of those would have been spent alongside high-maintenance chairman Greg Dyke. Labour's combative Shadow Minister for Sport Clive Efford called it a ‘bit rich’ that Tory incumbent Helen Grant is claiming their supporter ownership and engagement expert group announced this week was in the offing long before the Opposition’s manifesto pledge to put fans on football club boards. Efford said Labour had been calling for the Government to form such a group since it was first mooted by the Arsenal Supporters’ Trust in 2011. And Efford called it ‘ridiculous’ that Grant had no concrete supporter proposals, unlike Labour. Time up for FIFA gifts . The farce over the £16,400 Parmigiani watches handed out to delegates at the FIFA Congress in Sao Paulo last June continued right up to Friday's deadline to return them to Zurich. FIFA have shamelessly passed the buck on to their ethics committee run by lawyer Michael Garcia, who was in New York while his watch spokeswoman was in Chicago. But FA chairman Greg Dyke, who had notified Garcia that he intended to auction his Parmigiani for charity, has been informed he must return the watch. FA councillors are concerned that minutes from FA inclusion advisory board meetings are not disclosed. So there has been no transparency about how Edward Lord, chairman of the Amateur Swimming Association, was axed from the group for breaking ranks over the FA’s chronic lack of action in discrimination cases. It is expected Chelsea will not appoint a chief executive to replace the departed Ron Gourlay but instead look for a commercial-focused chief operating officer, which was effectively the role Gourlay had been carrying out at Stamford Bridge.","Former United boss Alex Ferguson to follow in footsteps of Tony Blair .

"A report has revealed that one in five crimes goes unrecorded due to failures by police . One in five crimes goes unrecorded because of  failures by police. Up to 740,000 victims of  violence, burglary and other offences are being denied justice, a report revealed yesterday. One rape was not logged because the officer thought it would be too much work. An attack on a boy with autism was written off as ‘sexual experimentation’. The report by Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector of Constabulary piles pressure on forces already under fire for Plebgate, Hillsborough and the abuse of stop and search powers. It said the sheer number of unresolved crimes meant some officers had to be guilty of ‘discreditable or unethical behaviour’. And the investigation reinforces warnings from statisticians and MPs that crime figures cannot be trusted. Spelling out the human cost, the report said: ‘Victims are failed because the crimes against them are not investigated, they have no hope of justice according to the law.’ The unrecorded rape case led to accusations of laziness from campaigners. ‘This is about much more than inaccurate statistics or poor number-crunching,’ said Adam Pemberton of Victim Support. ‘Each mistake represents a victim losing their chance to get justice and to access support services. ‘It is completely unacceptable that victims of any crimes – let alone serious sexual offences such as rape – should have their complaints go unrecorded or downgraded because of police incompetence or even laziness. ‘Most victims want more than anything for their offender not to commit another crime, but if the police can’t reliably recognise and record when and where a crime has been committed, their efforts to cut crime may well be misdirected.’ Police ignored a complaint made on behalf of a female rape victim by a doctor who had examined her injuries. A report of several assaults by a member of staff at a care home on teenage victims went similarly unrecorded. Home Secretary Theresa May said: ‘I commissioned HMIC to carry out this investigation in order to get a detailed assessment of how the police are treating recorded crime statistics. HMIC’s interim report exposes unacceptable failings by the police. Home Secretary and Minister for Women Theresa May says the report has exposed 'unacceptable failings' by police . ‘It is quite possible, once HMIC has completed its work on recorded crime statistics and made recommendations on how the police need to improve, that we will see an increase in recorded crime.’ She pointed out however that offending was at its lowest level since 1981. Inspectors carried out checks on 13 police forces and listened to phone calls made by members of the public. These were checked against police records to see if the incidents had been properly logged. Out of a sample of 3,102 incidents, HMIC found 2,551 crimes should have been recorded, but 523 were not, including sexual offences, crimes of violence, robbery and burglary and even 14 rapes. HM chief inspector of constabulary, Tom Winsor, says the consequences of under-recording of crime are 'serious' The watchdog said the figures suggested 20 per cent of crimes may be going unrecorded. Last year, police recorded 3.7million offences. The inspectors said: ‘In the light of what we have so far found it is difficult to conclude that none of these failures was the result of discreditable or unethical behaviour. The failure rate is too high.’ HM chief inspector of constabulary Tom Winsor said: ‘The consequences of under-recording of crime are serious, and may mean victims and the community are failed.’ The report comes after serious concerns were raised over the integrity of crime figures, sparked by claims made by former Metropolitan Police officer James Patrick last year. Mr Patrick told MPs that massaging crime figures to hit performance targets had become ‘an ingrained part of policing culture’. Police forces inspected so far are Cheshire, City of London, Devon and Cornwall, Essex, Gloucestershire, Greater Manchester, Gwent, Hertfordshire, Metropolitan, Norfolk, North Wales, North Yorkshire and South Yorkshire. The remainder will be checked ahead of a final report in the autumn. POLICE wrongly allowed more than 50,000 hardened criminals to dodge court last year, the report reveals. In around 400,000 cases, offenders guilty of violence, drug use, yobbery and other offences escaped with a caution, penalty notice, cannabis warning or ‘community resolution’. But inspectors found that in one in every seven cases this had been a mistake. Out-of-court disposals are supposed to be used for low-level crimes committed by first- or second-time offenders. But police were doling them out to convicts with long histories of law-breaking. It is yet another example of victims of crime being failed, Her Majesty’s Inspector of Constabulary found. In many cases, victims were not consulted or told how their attacker would be  punished. The report said offenders ‘were given out-of-court disposals when their offending histories ought to have precluded the imposition of such a disposal’. It went on: ‘In some of these cases, the offender ought to have been charged or summonsed to court.’ Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said ministers should stop community resolutions being used for serious crimes.","Report finds a fifth of crimes go unrecorded due to police failures .

"A former Navy SEAL who quit the army to become a woman took the stand today at a conference to discuss whether the U.S. military could one day allow openly transgender personnel. Kristin Beck - formerly Chris Beck - was a senior chief in the SEALs with more than 20 years' service when she retired in 2011 to pursue her life as a woman. And today, having completely transformed from her old self, she was a guest at a conference where  attendees gathered from 18 countries whose armed forces do allow transgender soldiers. Former SEAL: Kristin Beck - who used to be called Chris - spoke at a conference for transgender soldiers in Washington, D.C. today . 'Females are strong': Beck, pictured left at the conference and right before her gender change, said that she is no less capable of serving her country now than when she was a man . It is estimated that there are some 15,500 transgender people in the U.S. military already, who conceal the fact in order to keep their careers. At present it is Pentagon policy to discharge transgender people who are discovered. Speaking to the event today, Beck said: 'I was in the middle of the toughest of the tough as a Navy SEAL. And I could still do that today, as a female. 'Females are strong. Females chew tobacco and smoke cigars. They lift weights' After a pause, she added: 'I still have the ability to kick ass,' according to the Daily Beast. Military man: Kristin - seen as Chris in her military days - would not be allowed to serve today because of Pentagon policy banning transgender people from the military . Transgender military personnel from 18 nations had gathered for the Perspectives on Transgender Military Service event in Washington, DC. today to talk about their experiences and discuss whether the U.S. military could join them. The conference attendees, who are all from militaries that allow transgender service, gathered in Washington, DC. The gathering, Perspectives on Transgender Military Service from Around the Globe, is the first-ever and largest international conference of transgender military service members on U.S. soil. The conference included currently serving transgender personnel from the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Sweden. Back-up: US Army Reserve Captain Safe Fox also spoke at the event Monday. Fox served in the Army as a man, and was invited to join the reserves after switching genders . Transgender Major Alexandra Larsson of the Swedish Armed Forces speaks during a conference entitled 'Perspectives on Transgender Military Service from Around the Globe' The conference was organized by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the Palm Center in Washington . An estimated 15,500 transgender individuals currently serve in the U.S. military, but they are banned by Pentagon rules from serving. If they are discovered, the military is required to discharge them. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi supports the elimination of rules that ban transgender people from openly serving in the military, her office told the Washington Blade. Drew Hammill, a Pelosi spokesperson, told the Blade on Friday she believes gender identity should not be a factor in prohibiting Americans from serving in the military. 'Leader Pelosi believes there is no place for discrimination in the U.S. Armed Forces, including on the basis of gender identity,' Hammill said. Earlier this year a report found there is 'no compelling medical reason' for U.S. armed forced to ban transgender Americans from serving. Transgender Major Donna Harding of the Australian Army Nursing Corps speaks alongside Sergeant Lucy Jordan (left) of the Royal New Zealand Air Force . Transgender military personnel from 18 countries who allow them to serve openly, gathered to talk about their experiences . The independent commission, led by a former U.S. surgeon general, also concluded that President Obama could lift the decades-old ban without approval from Congress. About 15,500 transgender personnel are currently serving, nearly all under their birth genders and not transitioning in an appearance-altering way, according to the Williams Institute think tank. Dr Joycelyn Elders, who served as surgeon general during Bill Clinton's first term as president, and Rear Adm. Alan Steinman, a former chief health and safety director for the Coast Guard, led the report that was released on Thursday. 'We determined not only that there is no compelling medical reason for the ban, but also that the ban itself is an expensive, damaging and unfair barrier to health care access for the approximately 15,450 transgender personnel who serve currently in the active, Guard and reserve components,' it said. They also discussed at the conference whether the U.S. military could join them . Earlier this year a report found there is 'no compelling medical reason' for U.S. armed forced to ban transgender Americans from serving . The panel, convened by a think tank at San Francisco State University, said the ban has existed for several decades and apparently was derived in part from the psychiatric establishment's consensus, since revised, that gender identity issues amounted to a mental disorder. The ban also appears based on the assumption that providing hormone treatment and sex reassignment surgeries would be too difficult, disruptive and expensive. But the commission rejected those notions as inconsistent with modern medical practice and the scope of health care services routinely provided to non-transgender military personnel. 'I hope their takeaway will be we should evaluate every one of our people on the basis of their ability and what they can do, and if they have a condition we can treat we would treat it like we would treat anyone else,' Elders said in an interview. About 15,500 transgender personnel are currently serving, nearly all under their birth genders and not transitioning in an appearance-altering way, according to the Williams Institute, a think tank . The ban has existed for several decades and apparently was derived in part from the psychiatric establishment's consensus, since revised, that gender identity issues amounted to a mental disorder . The ban also appears based on the assumption that providing hormone treatment and sex reassignment surgeries would be too difficult, disruptive and expensive . At least a dozen nations, including Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom and Israel, allow military service by transgender individuals. Transgender rights advocates have been lobbying the Pentagon to revisit the blanket ban in the U.S. since Congress in 2010 repealed the law that barred gay, lesbian and bisexual individuals from openly serving in the military. The commission argued that facilitating gender transitions 'would place almost no burden on the military,' adding that a relatively small number of active and reserve service members would elect to undergo transition-related surgeries and that only a fraction might suffer complications that would prevent them from serving. It estimated that 230 transgender people a year would seek such surgery at an average cost of about $30,000. Transgender Major Alexandra Larsson of the Swedish Armed Forces speaks at the conference . Retired Brigadier General Thomas Kolditz, a former Army commander and West Point professor on the commission, said he thinks allowing transgender people to serve openly would reduce gender-based harassment, assaults and suicides while enhancing national security. But Center for Military Readiness President Elaine Donnelly, whose group opposed the repeal of the ban on openly gay troops, predicted that putting transgender people in barracks, showers and other sex-segregated could cause sexual assaults to increase and infringe on the privacy of non-transgender personnel. 'This is putting an extra burden on men and women in the military that they certainly don't need and they don't deserve,' Donnelly said.","Kristin Beck - formerly Chris - addressed a conference in D.C.

"'Vivacious and beautiful': Anni Dewani always put the needs of others above her own . Honeymoon murder victim Anni Dewani decided to call off her wedding hours before it was due to happen but was convinced by her cousin to reconsider. Speaking for the first time, Sneha Hindocha said she deeply regrets talking Anni into staying and will always live with the burden that she might have been able to save her life. Days before her lavish £200,000 wedding in India the 28-year-old murder victim frantically called Sneha and announced the ceremony was off. She had thrown her engagement ring at Shrien Dewani and told him she wanted to return to London. But, . trying to be level-headed, Sneha told Anni it would be best to talk . things through with the millionaire Bristol businessman before making such a big . decision. Soon after the call, Anni was putting on her sari and getting ready to make a life-long commitment to her future husband. 'I wish I had just told her to come home, then she would still be here today.' Sneha told the Sunday Mirror. 'That's my regret and I'm going to have to carry it with me for the rest of my life.' Two . weeks later, Anni was dead. She was killed when the car she was . travelling in with her new husband was hijacked in a township in Cape . Town, South Africa, while the couple were on honeymoon. Pedantic: Shrien Dewani on his wedding day with Anni. He allegedly complained about her sari and said it did not sit right . Dewani . is accused of organising the murder and is due to appear in court next . month where he will appeal a judge's decision to return to the African . country, to face further questioning. Sneha . said Anni was a popular young woman because of her vivacious . personality and striking beauty and would always put the needs of others . above her own. Devastated: Sneha Hindocha has deep regrets over her cousin's death . After university the qualified Engineer put her career plans on hold so she could be there for her mother Nilam Hindocha, who was diagnosed with cancer. Later . she landed a position with mobile phone giant Ericsson and in May 2009, . during a trip to London with Sneha, she was introduced to Mr Dewani. According . to her cousin, it was not love at first sight but he is said to have . won Anni over with his charms and respectful behaviour. Less than a year later, in March, Anni and Sneha decided to move to the UK where they shared a flat in Luton. Things moved quickly between Anni and her new boyfriend and soon the Hindocha family were introduced to the Dewanis. Months later Dewani proposed to Anni and presented her with a £25,000 engagement ring,  while the couple were having dinner at the Ritz in Paris. But Sneha said the doubts soon started to surface and Anni complained that Dewani was controlling and pedantic. He . would fold his dirty laundry before putting it in the washing basket . and according to Sneha, complained that Anni's sari was not sitting . right when he first saw her on their wedding day. The last time Sneha saw Anni was before the couple left for their honeymoon. Anni was later shot on November 13 and Dewani escaped, without injury. Dewani, 32, said he and the driver Zola Tonga, were forced out of the taxi before Anni was driven away. Unsure: Anni started to have regrets about her relationship with Shrien who she claimed was controlling . Tonga has since been jailed for 18 years and has claimed that Dewani paid him to £1,200 to arrange the killing. A . year after her death, thousands of people will be paying tribute to . Anni in a candlelight vigil which will take place in Bristol, London, . Cape Town and her home town of Mariestad, Sweden later today.

"We all noticed Kelly Brook's assets making a guest appearance when she strode onto the red carpet wearing no bra beneath her black dress at the National Television Awards on Tuesday. But rather than being an anomaly, such public ditching of one's support act has become a recent trend among tars including Kim Kardashian, Miranda Kerr and Gwyneth Paltrow. And while we've all heard horror stories of what will happen if we plump for bralessness - breasts that swing down below our knees, back pain that could land us in hospital - new research suggests that wearing a bra could actually contribute to these problems. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . TV presenter and actress Kelly Brook went braless at the National Television Awards this week . Contrary to popular belief, wearing a bra . doesn't prevent sagging or relieve back pain at all, according to a study carried out over fifteen . years in France. Researchers at the University of Besançon found that not wearing a bra increases the strength of the breast muscles, which results in them sagging less over time. Professor Rouillon, who led the study, said he believed the 'absence of a bra could keep breasts in shape' and prevent back ache. He explained: 'The decision not to a wear a bra appeals to women in terms of comfort and aesthetics. Contrary to popular belief, the breast does not fall, but tightens and lifts, and the quality of the skin improves.’' Professor Rouillon said 42 per cent of the women 'felt discomfort' for the first three months of not wearing a bra, but then it disappeared. None were in pain, however, nor were they hampered from doing daily activities, including sport. But don't set your bra alight just yet. Despite his findings, Professor Rouillon said women should not get rid of their bras. His study only involved a small number of women, and the long-term effects of not wearing a bra are unknown. Kim Kardashian ditched her supporting act for Paris Fashion Week last year . Indeed, previous research has shown that women who do not wear a sports bra while exercising could be damaging their breasts. The ligaments which support the breasts are not elastic, and can be irreversibly stretched when the breasts bounce during repetitive or high impact sports. (Luckily, high-energy activity at award ceremonies is kept to a minimum, so celebrities remain safe when they go braless for the red carpet.) And aside from health effects, a lack of support can do damage to your career: research carried out by the Centre for Talent Innovation discovered that those who go braless at work are less likely to be promoted to high executive levels. (Unless, of course, said role is as a presenter on Ground Force.)","Celebrities including Miranda Kerr and Gwyneth Paltrow have gone braless .

"Police found the body of an eight-months-pregnant teen dead in the back of her suspected killer's car, after the man committed suicide at the end of a high-speed chase Thursday night. The body of 18-year-old Brooke Slocum, who was carrying unborn daughter Audi Lynn, was discovered just one day after cops found her 25-year-old boyfriend Charlie Oppenneer murdered in a Wyoming, Michigan park. On Friday, Wyoming Police Chief James Carmody identified the dead suspect as Brady Oestrike, 31, also of Wyoming and said he connected with Slocum on Craigslist.

He led police on a high-speed chase Thursday night before crashing the car and then allegedly shooting himself dead . Police were keeping watch at Oestrike's home Thursday night, waiting on a warrant to search the house, when they saw him drive away at around 9:15pm. A SWAT team had been called in to aid in the search sine they suspected Oestrike had 'assault-style' weapons on the premises. Oestrike then led police on a high-speed chase through the town. At one point he briefly pulled over, but then fled again and eventually crashed his car near the entrance ramp for US-131. When police went up to the car to make an arrest, they found Oestrike dead of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound. They found Slocum's body in the back of the crashed car, just one day after her boyfriend was discovered murdered. Police say Slocum met Oestrike on Craigslist the previous weekend. Pictured above, Oestrike's crashed car . Police found Oppenneer's body in a wooded area in south Wyoming around noon on Wednesday. Slocum was reported missing after Oppenneer's body was discovered, since she was the last person believed to have contact with him. Friends and family said they hadn't heard from Slocum since Saturday night. At the press conference on Friday, police revealed that Slocum met her suspected killer online. Oestrike and Slocum had contact on Craigslist Saturday night going into early Sunday, around the time friends last heard from her. However, police have not announced a motive in the crime and will not say how either Slocum or her boyfriend Oppenneer died.

"A former police officer forced out of the job 27 years ago because he wanted a sex change is set to return to frontline duties as a woman. Karen Gale, whose two-a-half-hour operation was controversially broadcast on television last year, has applied to be a special constable and return to the Metropolitan Police. The 53-year-old, previously known as Keith, worked as a PC with the Met between 1981 and 1985 before being forced to resign when he told his inspector he wanted to start treatment for gender change. Life-changing: Karen Gale, left, formerly known as Keith,  pictured as a PC, right, is set to return to the Met 27 years after being forced out for wanting a sex change . Karen, from Purfleet, Essex, said: 'Back then things were different. My inspector told me there was no way I could stay in the job. 'I was absolutely gutted. I loved my job and I had spent two years passing all my exams to become a constable.' But now Karen, who underwent the sex-change operation at Charing Cross Hospital in London in August 2011, is hopeful her application to become a special constable will be successful. She said: 'I can’t wait to get back on the street doing the job I love. It’s been a long time and I know the force will have changed, but I’m looking forward to it. 'It’s not like it was in the ‘80s anymore. The police are actively trying to recruit more transgender and openly gay officers.' Wish: 'I couldn't go on any longer living as a bloke,' Karen says, adding she can't wait to get back to the job she loved . Karen, who found work as an HGV driver after being forced out of the police, said her life had been transformed since becoming a woman. She said: 'I’m the happiest I’ve ever been. It’s difficult to explain - I just finally feel like me. I feel complete. 'It’s such a relief that I no longer have to put on this act, pretending to be someone I’m not.' Karen, then Keith, first knew he was 'different' to other boys when aged nine, he used to lock himself in the bathroom and try on his sister’s dresses. His cross-dressing continued in secret even after he married his first-ever girlfriend, Meryl, at the age of 21, and fathered their daughter, Laura, now 27. But then Meryl returned home unexpectedly one day and found Keith in full make-up, stockings, skirt and a top. Karen said: “I couldn’t go on any longer living as a bloke and made the decision to start living openly as a woman. 'I lost everything - the job I loved, my wife, my daughter, my house. I haven’t seen Laura now for 22 years - it breaks my heart. 'I managed to find her through Facebook back in March and we’ve exchanged a few messages. 'She doesn’t know yet whether she wants to see me. She says she doesn’t know whether she could cope with it. I’m just praying that she will come to terms with it.' Today the Met would not discuss the case. But told MailOnline: 'The Metropolitan Police Service is an equal opportunities employer, regardless of a person's age, race, sexual orientation, religion or belief, disability, sex or gender reassignment. 'We are continually looking to improve and are seen as employers of choice for many under represented groups and we have robust policies around work life balance and diversity.' Karen appeared on Channel 4 last year because she wanted her life-changing operation to 'inspire' other men with a desire to become a woman. The series, called Girls Will Be Boys And Boys Will Be Girls, followed seven sex change patients aged between 22 and 55. 'It has been a long journey since I began hormone replacement therapy and I hope my story will inspire others,' she said. 'They are going to show some parts of the operation after the watershed, some will be edited out.' But campaign group Mediawatch warned that many viewers might find the footage upsetting. Spokeswoman Vivienne Pattison said: 'A lot of people will avoid watching this type of surgery and some of the scenes may not be appropriate for broadcasting.'","Karen Gale, 53, formerly known as Keith, says she was forced out of the Met Police because she wanted to change gender .

"Senator Nova Peris has denied using taxpayer money to facilitate a ten day extra-marital sexual liaison with Trinidad and Tobago sprinter Ato Boldon in 2010. The NT News allegedly obtained emails from 2010 showing that Ms Peris sourced funding from Athletics Australia to fly Mr Boldon to Australia for a ten-day trip for the 'Jump Start to London' program for young athletes. The NT News claims the emails also detail an affair between the couple, with Ms Peris referring to their relations as being 'just like a tim-tam… black on black' and boasting that 'white men can't control black women'. At the time, Ms Peris was married to former Australian Olympic athlete, Daniel Batman. Scroll down for video . Senator Nova Peris is accused of being involved in an extra-marital affair with Olympian Ato Boldon in 2010 . In 2013 Ms Peris became Australia's first indigenous woman to be elected to federal parliament . Mr Batman, who had two children with Ms Peris before they split in 2010, died in a car crash in Darwin in 2012. Ms Peris said she would not comment on private matters. 'I categorically reject any wrongdoing,' she said in a statement. 'Nova Peris is a former training partner of mine, and has been a friend for almost 20 years. 'My trip to Australia almost five years ago was for the purpose of holding several youth clinics, and it was a successful undertaking. 'The trip was co-organized by one of my now-deceased colleagues at Athletics Australia. 'The article recently written by the Northern Territory News, includes gross fabrications. 'I will be following the senator’s lead, including, but not limited to, pursuing all legal action possible for this malicious misrepresentation of the details surrounding my presence in Australia in 2010.' 'Documents provided to the NT News are private. It appears they were not lawfully obtained by a third party.' Ms Peris told the NT News: 'The highs and lows of my private life are matters for me and my family.' Mr Boldon said the article included 'gross fabrications'. 'Nova Peris is a former training partner of mine, and has been a friend for almost 20 years,' he said in a statement. 'My trip to Australia almost five years ago was for the purpose of holding several youth clinics, and it was a successful undertaking.' Athletics Australia confirmed that Mr Boldon was the athlete selected by Ms Peris to conduct the program. Ms Peris was working as an ambassador for the organisation and as communications officer with the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies. NT News claim leaked documents reveal Peris allegedly organised the trip and sent sexually explicit emails. '...You should be compensated for you long haul travels across the pacfic.. sexually of course,' Ms Peris allegedly wrote in an email, according to the NT News. It is claimed Ms Peris abused her position as an ambassador for Athletics Australia to channel taxpayer funds to facilitate a ten-day sexual affair with Ato Boldon . Ato Boldon (right) travelled to Australia for 'Jump Start to London' from April 9 to 19 in 2010 after being selected by Ms Peris (left, pictured in 2003) In another email it is claimed she wrote: 'Ok now I have to give a talk to 200 kids and all I am going to be thinking about is f****** you now lol.' It is reported that when Mr Boldon requested naked photos, Ms Peris replied: . 'Really, u want me to send some!!!! That is some freaky stuff Mr B…u like freaky??' It's also claimed that Ms Peris organised for Mr Boldon to receive his payment tax-free, organising a waiver form so he would get all expenses paid, according to NT News. '...It was not in the budget to bring any profile athletes out but…I am goin through the indigenous grants mob….they can do was I have suggested…but I am not sure what they can do …' In an email, Ms Peris allegedly tells Mr Boldon she has managed to organise $22,000 worth of extra work, in addition to the fee Athletics Australia paid.

Athletics Australia confirm they paid for Mr Boldon's flights, accommodation and other extra expenses . Ms Peris says that it appears the emails detailing her conversations with Mr Boldon 'were not lawfully obtained by a third party' 'Mr Boldon capably fulfilled his role as mentor and ambassador, and from our perspective upheld the bargain we had for him to come out and be an ambassador for the 'Jump Start to London' program for young athletes,' a spokesperson for Athletics Australia told Daily Mail Australia. 'We also have a relationship with Senator Peris who is a reputable former athlete and someone who we want to maintain a relationship with.' Opposition leader Bill Shorten said Ms Peris  had his 'full support' and the support of the Labor caucus. 'I take her at her word, she's rejected any wrongdoing,' Mr Shorten said on Wednesday morning. 'Let me just say about Nova Peris, she is a great Australian, she's done remarkable things in her athletics career, but I think even more significantly for the Northern Territory and for Indigenous Australians.' 'These are matters which are deeply personal to Senator Peris and pre-date her time in parliament.' Labor frontbencher Tony Burke said he had the highest regard for Senator Peris. 'Nova Peris is an extraordinary person,' he told reporters in Canberra. 'We are a better parliament because Nova Peris is in it.'

"Many thought Real Madrid would rest on their Champions League laurels this summer having just won the European Cup but instead they added three big-name signings to their squad. Toni Kroos was one of the pass-masters of the World Cup and ended up with a winner's medal; James Rodriguez scored the tournament's best goal, and quite possibly its second best goal too; and in a tournament full of good goalkeeping performances Keylor Navas was the pick of the bunch. So, how have Madrid's three World Cup wonders performed in their first three months at the Bernabeu? VIDEO Scroll down to watch Real ready for tough week - Ancelotti . James Rodriquez is all set to become a big hit for Real Madrid after signing on the back of a great World Cup . Carlo Ancelotti is deploying former Bayern Munich man Toni Kroos in a deeper role for the La Liga giants . Rodriguez celebrates scoring against rivals Atletico Madrid at the Bernabeu back in August . Kroos looked as if he had been in Real Madrid's midfield for the last five years when he made his debut in the European Super Cup against Sevilla at the Cardiff City Stadium back in September and he was outstanding again on Saturday with an almost 100 per cent pass accuracy in the 5-0 win over Levante. No-one at Real doubts his ability to play the position in the Spanish league – the test will come when the opponent is of a slightly higher quality. Levante gave Kroos time to pick his passes at the weekend and he took full advantage, none more so than when his long pass forward set up Rodriguez's goal. The other doubt is whether it is the best use of Kroos' talents. At Bayern Munich, Pep Guardiola used him in that position when he turned up but soon decided that he preferred him further forward and turned Philipp Lahm into his midfield holder. There are times when Kroos, not unlike Jack Wilshere for England, can't resist a natural tendency to carry the ball forward as opposed to give the quick pass most teams want from their sitting midfielder. Kroos is becoming a sturdy constant in the middle of the mark but still has attacking tendencies . Colombia forward Rodriguez knocks a ball beyond Levante's Ruben Garcia during Saturday's 5-0 win . Real Madrid do have Asier Illarramendi and Sami Khedira who can play in the middle of the midfield three and that would certainly release Kroos, but Carlo Ancelotti said in midweek: 'I am sure Kroos can play in Xabi's position' so for the time being he looks set to continue there. On Saturday he faces any holding midfielder's biggest test with Lionel Messi wandering back from his centre forward starting point to play in the space in front of Real Madrid's back four. We learn a lot about Kroos during those 90 minutes. Rodriguez has certainly done his job off the pitch. If Real wanted a new pin-up boy then they have hit the jackpot as their £63million star has female fans swooning in the aisles at the Bernabeu as well as in the aisles of the club's superstore next to the stadium where his shirt sales have put him behind only Cristiano Ronaldo in terms of popularity. On the pitch he has shown the flashes of brilliance that he displayed at the World Cup and that ultimately convinced president Florentino Perez that it would make excellent business sense to move on Angel di Maria (who was now, with some justification, asking to be moved up the club's wage structure) and bring in someone who would accept his salary and, in effect, be paid for by the Argentine's big money switch to Old Trafford. All that was left to do was to make it work on the pitch. Goalkeeper Keylor Navas has seen his opportunities to play limited thanks to Iker Casillas . Rodriguez has had to do more running back than he would have liked. But he has done it without complaint and there are signs that it now comes a little easier to him than it did in the first few games. He still can't give those long-busting road-runner performances that Di Maria gave, so Ancelotti has instructed Gareth Bale to track back to make a bank of four when Real don't have the ball. When Bale didn't play on Saturday and Real lined up with Kroos, Isco, Luka Modric and Rodriguez in midfield the Colombian had greater licence to get forward and gave one of his best performances of the season so far. Navas hit the jackpot this summer when a wonderful World Cup topped off a stunning season and earned him a move to Real Madrid. A devout Christian, Madrid television captured images of him reading from his bible in the car to the stadium as he turned up for his medical and presentation. At the moment, however, the man they called San Iker (Saint Iker) stands between Navas and complete nirvana. The captain is clinging on to his first team spot and has looked in excellent domestic form this season - limiting Navas to just one La Liga opportunity. Navas made three saves and conceded one goal in a 5-1 win against Elche. Most of the action was down the other end of the pitch and when he was tested there was not chance to do anything out of the ordinary. Life for a keeper at Madrid can be tough with so little to gain and so much to lose in so many of the games. He will be Real Madrid's Copa del Rey keeper with a last-16 tie against Cornella on December 3 - his first match in the domestic cup competition. That will give him the chance to win a trophy and to start pushing Casillas, who it seems he will probably replace as No 1 in all competitions at the start of next season. Barring any Spain vs Slovakia lapses for Casillas in a Madrid shirt though, he will have to be patient.

"She can more than afford a grand entrance and could have had her own chauffeur-driven car if she chose. But the new Dutch Queen decided to keep her visit to a park opening low key - by arriving on a bicycle. And Maxima Zorreguieta, who became Queen of the Netherlands when her mother-in-law Beatrix abdicated the throne to her son in April, didn't let her basic form of transport get in the way of style. Scroll down for video . Economical and stylish: Dutch Queen Maxima, pictured right in a colourful dress and strappy beige sandals, arrives for the opening of a park being named in her honour in Utrecht on a bicycle . Leading the way: Queen Maxima, pictured, stunned locals as she cycled through the neighbourhood of Leidsche Rijn to get the unveiling of the new park name . The 40-year-old, whose looks have previously been compared to Britney Spears, wore a brightly-coloured but elegant dress matched with a pair of beige strappy sandals. She happily cycled through the Leidsche Rijn neighbourhood in Utrecht, The Netherlands, to the opening of a park being named in her honour. Her relaxed approach to official events may be down to the fact that Maxima was not born Royalty - but has become Queen through her marriage to King William IV. Maxima was born a commoner in Argentina and is the daughter of a minister who served in the military junta in the late 1970s. The royal couple have three daughters, Amalia, nine, Alexia, seven, and Ariane, five. A fun day out: Dutch Queen Maxima was accompanied by other cyclists on the summer bike ride . Drawing quite a crowd: Scores of locals stood at the roadside to wave at the Queen as she cycled past . Her 45-year-old husband became King in April after his mother Beatrix abdicated the throne shortly after a 75th birthday. Queen Beatrix said she was stepping down because she believed ‘the responsibility should now lie in the hands of a new generation’. King William is the first male to accede to the Dutch throne since 1890. His mother has ruled the Netherlands since April 30, 1980.

"Locked up: Algerian Kaci Saoudi was imprisoned on murder charges in 1933 and spent 20 years inside a notorious prison . A British-based scientist is seeking a pardon for his late father who spent 20 years imprisoned on infamous Devil’s Island for a crime he says he didn’t commit. Bashir Saoudi, who has lived in Britain since his teens, said his father Kaci died in 1990 with a murder conviction still to his name, and wants the French government to overturn it. Mr Saoudi was imprisoned in 1933 in a French penal colony on the notorious island, off the coast of South America, and stayed until the prison was closed in 1953. The Algerian-born man was thrown behind bars alongside his two cousins after he was accused of shooting dead his own boss. In fact one of his cousins was guilty of the crime - but Mr Saoudi refused to tell the truth because he didn’t want to see one of his own family face the guillotine. As a result of his silence he was condemned to incarceration and spent 20 years battling starvation, yellow fever and hard labour before he was freed in 1953 when the French were forced to close the prison. He returned to Algeria and held a respected position in public office before dying at the age of 83 in 1990. His son, aged 58, has now called for him to be officially pardoned after vowing to prevent his father’s name going down in history as a convicted killer. Mr Saoudi Jnr, a computer scientists from Cambridge, has provided all the information for a book about his father written by Scottish crime writer Michael J Malone called The Guillotine Choice. He said: 'My father did not want to point the finger at his cousin. 'In those days the French would have chopped off his cousin’s head, and my father could not stand that. He did not want his cousin guillotined so he kept quiet. 'My father was an incredible man and he is an inspiration to all of us - he managed to survive the most unimaginably horrific conditions. Notorious: The dangerous island prison, off the coast of French Guinea, operated until 1953 . Notorious: Mr Saoudi was held on Devil's Island, in the Atlantic Ocean not far from South America . 'Not only did he survive, but he kept his dignity, and I am so proud of him for this. 'But he should never have been convicted in the first place. The French government convicted my father purely because he would not reveal who the real guilty man was. 'The French had no proof whatsoever that he was guilty and this is a terrible miscarriage of justice. 'In honour of my father’s name, I am now asking that the French government does the right thing and overturns his conviction, preferably while my mother is still alive. 'He was innocent, and I want to get the French people to reconsider.' Mr Saoudi had the number 51240 tattooed on his arm and survived an horrific transportation on a packed prison ship before arriving on Devil’s Island off French Guiana. Free man: Mr Saoudi left the prison when it was closed in 1953, but still had the conviction hanging over him . France imprisoned more than 80,000 men there and the odds of survival were massively stacked against them. The island prison was the setting for the book Papillon by Henri Charrière. It is, supposedly, a true account of how he and a friend escaped the prison by jumping into the sea holding sacks of coconuts for floatation. Story: Bashir Saoudi, pictured, is now calling on the French government to overturn the conviction for his father, who died in 1990 . Mr Saoudi Jnr added: 'Devil’s Island is Hell on Earth. It’s a place where 90 per cent of prisoners died in their first year. 'They were thrown in the jungle to make roads, and they worked under some incredible conditions. If they weren’t killed by yellow fever, they were killed by starvation. 'There were many ways you could die, and only the very, very strongest survived. The reason why he survived is because he was young, and he was sharp. 'He survived because he was destined to survive. I really believe that, because to come back from yellow fever is not easy.' Mr Saoudi Jnr arrived in England from Algeria when he was just 17 and began to study computer science in Huddersfield, Yorkshire. He married here and had three children before divorcing and moving to Scotland. Ten years ago Michael J Malone came to his café in the Scottish town of Ayr and snapped up an opportunity to pitch his father’s story. The novel, called The Guillotine Choice, will be published on 13 March. The notorious prison, just off the coast of French Guiana, held prisoners from 1852 and was not completely closed until 1953. Political prisoner: Alfred Dreyfus was held on Devil's Island in the late 19th Century . The 34-acre island was one of several in the area used for different classes of prisoner. Devil's Island was for political prisoners. The bleak, rocky outcrop is covered in dense jungle. More than 80,000 prisoners were sent there, with hardly any successful escapes. Henri Charrière, the author of Papillon who is sometimes known by that name himself, claimed to have escaped when the waves carried him away as he clung to coconuts for floatation. However, the authorities have contradicted his version of events, claiming he was never held on the island, but a mainstream prison. One famous prisoner who was certainly held on the island was Alfred Dreyfus, a Jewish officer in the French army who was convicted of treason in 1895. He was held on the island in gruelling conditions for more than four years until he was allowed to return home after a public outcry - which centred on the lack of evidence used to convict him. Dreyfus, who was accused of passing military secrets to Germany, was kept in especially bleak conditions. As well as the struggles of impossible heat and tropical disease, he was kept in solitary confinement, with his five prison guards forbidden to speak to him. His legs were chained and special measures were taken to block his views of the sea and the outside world. French authorities announced plans to close the prisons in 1938 after the depraved conditions were revealed, but the outbreak of the Second World War, in which French Guiana too fell under Nazi control, delayed the process severely. According to his son's tale, Mr Saoudi would have been held there throughout this time.","Kaci Saoudi was held on the French penal colony from 1933 to 1953 .

"Questions: Bernard Hogan-Howe, the commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, will face questions tomorrow over why the information was shredded . Scroll down for video . A secret memo has revealed the shocking truth behind a ‘lorry load’ of anti-corruption files shredded by Scotland Yard. A summary of the files says investigators gathered evidence of wholesale criminal behaviour by trusted police officers during an undercover three-year probe.The memo, written by Detective Superindent David Hurley, said corrupt officers: . But the so-called ‘lorry load’ of information which contained the findings – including documents, photographs and videos – was  mysteriously shredded during a two-day operation in 2003. The extraordinary details in Mr Hurley’s internal ‘restricted’ briefing note – uncovered by QC Mark Ellison during his review into the Stephen Lawrence murder – ramp up the pressure on the Met to find out why a hoard of such sensitive and valuable material was destroyed. Tomorrow, Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe will be asked by MPs to explain why the goldmine of sensitive information was dumped. No one at the force has come up with a convincing explanation for why the files were destroyed. It has merely said it has ‘little detail’ on what led up to the shredding. Sir Bernard’s force already faces a potentially explosive inquiry into undercover policing that could yet draw together two of the darkest chapters in its modern history. Dark chapters: Questions remain over whether a web of corrupt officers undermined investigations into the deaths of Stephen Lawrence, left, and Daniel Morgan, right . Questions remain over whether a web of corrupt  officers undermined the inquiries into the death of Stephen Lawrence and private eye  Daniel Morgan. The vast majority of papers from the Met’s top secret Operation Othona, a multi-million-pound anti-corruption inquiry, cannot be found. Some computer files relating to the Othona operation were found on a hard drive in a cardboard box in the Met’s professional standards department in November 2013. But paper copies of the intelligence were missing. The Ellison review was told there had been a ‘mass shredding’ of them in 2003. Roy Clark, who lead anti-corruption at the time of Othona,  said: ‘I’d be shocked if it doesn’t exist. It was gold-dust stuff.’ The officer, who retired in 2001, added that it was important the information was used to keep up the pressure on corrupt officers. He said: ‘How you can go to those lengths and spend all that money and it is not there, I am just amazed.’ Fears: The shredded files may have contained crucial clues over alleged corruption . Stephen’s parents Doreen and Neville have long feared that corruption played a part in the years of police failings over his racist murder in 1993. Gary Dobson and David Norris were convicted of his murder in 2012 and Sir Bernard has vowed to keep fighting to bring others to justice. Potential link: Suspected 'bent' Met detective John Davidson, who was slammed in the Ellison report . It is feared the files may also have contained crucial clues over alleged corruption in the investigation into the murder of Mr Morgan in 1987. The private investigator was struck with an axe in the car park of a South-East London pub. One potential link between the cases is suspect ‘bent’ ex-Met detectives John Davidson, who was slammed in the Ellison report for his work on the Lawrence case. Davidson is suspected of working on the Morgan inquiry in its early stages, something the Met have repeatedly denied. He is also suspected of having links with the gangland father of Stephen’s killer, Norris. Mr Morgan’s brother Alistair, 65, said he believed a corrupt ‘firm within a firm’ at the Met covered up both murders. He said: ‘We want it all out in the open – everything. We won’t stop until it is.’ Mr Morgan said the mass shredding of  documents could jeopardise the work of an  independent review into his brother’s death. ‘The revelation of the shredding of the Othona files, I find very worrying,’ he added. Operation Othona found criminal gangs were working closely with a ‘small but dedicated network of corrupt police officers’. Earlier this month Scotland Yard said: ‘At this time the Met has little detail on the circumstances that led to the shredding.’ Two men have been arrested for criminal . damage after an attack on a memorial to Stephen Lawrence. Police, who were called to the plaque in Eltham, South London shortly before 1pm yesterday, believe a vase full of flowers was knocked over, and that somebody spat on a commemorative plaque. Both men, aged 18 and 19, were taken into custody and have now been bailed. The memorial plaque was laid on the spot where Lawrence, who was stabbed to death 21 years ago, collapsed and died against a tree. Criminal damage: The plaque in Eltham, South London, which commemorates Stephen Lawrence . It is monitored 24 hours a day by a police CCTV camera across the road. A police van was parked by the spot for the whole of Sunday. The stone has been the subject of attacks before and had to be replaced after one incident by vandals. The memorial has acted as a focal point for family and friends and supporters to lay flowers and tributes to the youngster. A marked police van was parked by the side of the memorial all day.","Memo says shredded files had details of crimes by Met police officers .

Less than a decade ago, Han Seo-hee . was a member of an elite, secret music troupe for Kim Jong-il, the . iron-fisted late leader of North Korea. 'I still feel uncomfortable when I have to make people laugh, or perform. I am still wedded to North Korea's stiff style,' said Han, 30, who for four years from 2002 played a stringed instrument as part of Kim Jong-il's troupe. 'I was worried that a lot of malicious comments might be posted (on the show's Internet site)... But when I actually look there, there are a lot of supportive messages, so I think I was right to appear on this show,' she added. Centre stage: North Korean defector living in South Korea, Han Seo-hee, 30, sings a song while Shin Eun-ha, 25, dances . Hit show: Now on My Way to Meet You, is a hybrid talk and talent show in which roughly a dozen North Korean women who fled from their communist homeland appear . Though the show does not skirt heavy topics altogether, gossip and lighter fare dominate. On one recent show, the women discussed how widespread plastic surgery is in the North -- particularly double-eyelid surgery to make the eyes look rounder, often carried out by eye doctors or unlicensed people -- and how Southern men really know how to sweet-talk a woman who has caught their eye, unlike their serious Northern counterparts. A debate on the most desirable occupations for a prospective bridegroom concluded that cooks and barbers are most popular, because these are high-salary jobs. By contrast, women in the South generally favour doctors or lawyers. Each woman also entertains, some by singing and dancing. Others perform comedy skits, including several who mimic North Korea's iconic, stern-faced female TV newsreader. But the ending takes on a more sombre tone as the women send video messages to family members back in the North. Everyone in the studio sobs as one woman tells her father, held in a North Korean jail, how she can't forget the way he smiled when she visited. Success: The show's producer says that not only does it draw attention to little-known aspects of life in the North, it helps connect North and South Koreans, many of whom find it difficult to bridge social and cultural gaps . The show's producer says that not only does it draw attention to little-known aspects of life in the North, it helps connect North and South Koreans, many of whom find it difficult to bridge social and cultural gaps. Though more than 23,000 North Koreans have made their way south since the 1990s, they find it hard to settle in, ending up in menial jobs and often shunned by their southern brethren. 'We were focusing on families separated by the Korean War 60 years ago and thought we should see about finding other families split for political reasons,' said producer Lee Jin-min about the show, which began in December and started featuring the women from April. 'That led us to the North Korean defectors.' Freedom: North Korean defector living in South Korea, Han Seo-hee, 30, poses during a media interview . With family still left in the North, many of the women were wary about appearing on the show, citing safety concerns. But the show's writers and producers persuaded them that it was an unprecedented chance to change public opinion in their favor. The emotional public response has taken them by surprise. One guest, Shin Eun-ha, even has her own fan club. 'I wept for the first time in 10 years, along with my husband,' wrote one female viewer. Another said the show had persuaded her and her husband not to divorce. 'Cheerful and animated' The show also appears to be achieving its goal. 'I thought North Korean women might look gaunt because all of North Korea has been struggling with famine, but when I see them, they are cheerful and animated,' said Park Dong-hoon, a 52-year-old man who watched the show on a television at Seoul's main train station. 'I think South and North Korea must be reunited as soon as possible.'","Now on My Way to Meet You, is a hybrid talk and talent show shot in Goyang, a city northwest of Seoul .

"The Premier League are ready to tighten the rules on English player quotas to ensure that players like Chelsea midfielder Cesc Fabregas and Arsenal goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny would not in future qualify as ‘homegrown’. In a bid to boost the England team, the Premier League will look at reforming its quota system, which currently states that eight of the Premier League’s 25-man squad have to be homegrown. The rules are so lax that any players who have completed three years at an English club before the age of 21 are deemed homegrown — regardless of nationality. Cesc Fabregas is deemed 'homegrown' because he spent over three years at Arsenal before turning 21 . That has led to the farcical situation of Chelsea and Arsenal having Fabregas and Szcezsny listed among their homegrown players and Manchester City having Gael Clichy. Had City signed Paul Pogba from Juventus in January, he would also have qualified as homegrown within a few months as he had spent more than two years at Manchester United. Increasingly, clubs have copied Arsenal’s model by poaching the best young European talent at 16 to bring them to their academies and ensure they qualify as homegrown under current rules. Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore acknowledges that the rules, implemented as part of the Premier League’s Elite Players’ Performance Plan (EPPP) for youth football, need a fresh look. ‘It will get looked at,’ said Scudamore. ‘We welcome foreign players, we welcome the best of foreign talent if we can get hold of it and therefore clubs don’t want to go down a route that restricts their ability to recruit that talent. On the other hand, clubs recognise they’re making a huge investment in these youth systems and they have to produce results. Poland goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny also came through the ranks at Arsenal . Gael Clichy moved from Cannes to Arsenal at 16 and is now one of the few 'homegrown' players at Man City . ‘Clearly EPPP has gone through what I call its development phase; it’s gone through its hardware phase, with its facilities and its pitches. Now it’s in its software phase, which is concentrating on outcomes. And outcomes must be getting players through the system and through into the first team. There will be a point in the next number of months where we will say, “Is it now time to have a look at that?” ’ Scudamore concedes that the idea of homegrown quotas was not implemented so major clubs could simply bypass young English players to bring through the best players from the rest of Europe, but he cannot promise what rule changes will be implemented. ‘You’ve asked me a question: do I think it will be looked at? Do I have any view as to what the outcome will be on any details of that? No I don’t. ‘We’ll sit with 24 academy managers in a room and talk it through and make sure the whole thing is done with their expertise and knowledge.’ France midfielder Paul Pogba joined Italian side Juventus a few months before he would have qualified as 'homegrown' as he had spent more than two years at Manchester United (below) If the Premier League were to change rules so a young player has to spend three years at a club before 18 to qualify as homegrown rather than before 21, it would almost immediately eliminate the ‘Fabregas issue’. Players would then have to be at a club from 15 — and young players are not allowed to move across national boundaries, even European Union boundaries, before 16 unless there are exceptional circumstances, such as their parents moving country for work. Clubs cannot be told to employ only English players as that would be a breach of EU competition law.","Premier League teams must have eight homegrown players in squad of 25 .

"Our ‘Hands Off In The Box’ campaign has won a major victory, with Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore confirming the issue of penalty-area grappling and shirt pulling will be addressed next month, at a meeting of players, referees and managers. With the issue of manhandling players in the box reaching a nadir in Manchester United’s clash with Chelsea, when Marcos Rojo and Chris Smalling held John Terry and Branislav Ivanovic with impunity, Sportsmail led the way for referees to punish players more consistently. Acknowledging our campaign was one of the ways in which football authorities were held to account, Scudamore said: ‘Clearly there have been a number of incidents highlighted in the past few weeks regarding this and, under close scrutiny by television and everything else, some of them don’t look great. 'We have had a meeting with the team captains and what the players are saying is that they don’t necessarily think there needs to be any crackdown or clampdown but what they really want is some clarification.

'There will be a meeting of the Premier League, the FA, the Football League, the referees’ body, the PGMO, the League Managers’ Association and players. The Mail’s campaign is one of the ways things are held to account. 'A couple of seasons ago there was a spate of what people called two-footed tackles and people didn’t quite know what the law was. ‘What happened then was that everyone got together and came up with a clarification which went round to all the players and teams. It wasn’t a change of law and it wasn’t a change of emphasis. ‘Because there had been some inconsistency, people were saying we don’t know what the rules are any more. That is about to happen on this topic.’","Sportsmail started it 'Hands off in the box campaign' last month .

"John McEnroe has urged Andy Murray to take a break from tennis rather than get straight back onto the practice court. The Scot’s instinct when times are tough is to throw himself into hard work, and it was no different after his mauling by Roger Federer at the ATP World Tour Finals. This would normally be the point in the season when Murray would take a short holiday before beginning his preparations for the new season at a training camp in Miami. Andy Murray was beaten 6-0 6-1 by Roger Federer at the ATP World Tour Finals on Thursday in London . The Scot took to Twitter to apologise to his fans after being thrashed by the 33-year-old Swiss . Tennis legend John McEnroe (right) has urged Murray not to rush back to the court following the defeat . He already has a busier schedule than usual, with best-man duties next weekend at the wedding of Ross Hutchins before a trip to Manila to play in the inaugural International Premier Tennis League. Following the 6-0 6-1 defeat by Federer, Murray took to Twitter to apologise to his fans, and he said: 'I’m not going to try and forget it. 'When I think about what happened, I’m not saying I’m ever going to look at that match positively, but I need to use it as whatever. If it’s motivation for the off-season, to make some changes to things. 'I would normally take a break just now. But I also need time to work on some things in my game and make improvements. So if I was to take a two-week break just now, that’s 14 days where I can’t work on my game, make any changes in that period. 'I’ll try to get back on the practice court probably sooner than I would have done.' Murray arrived at the O2 Arena after playing for six successive weeks in order to qualify for the tournament and on the back of one of the most challenging seasons of his career. He did not have a break last winter because of the long process of recovering from back surgery, which lasted well into this season. McEnroe said: 'If he learns anything from Roger it should be that Roger’s magnificent in forgetting devastating matches. That’s not a tape you want to look at. 'There’s clearly a gap there, and part of it’s what happened leading up to it. He’s played too much and he seems to have not much left in the tank. 'He looked tired, his legs looked heavy. If I was his coach, I would definitely tell him to take a break. He needs a break.' Federer came out firing and won the opening six games in just 24 minutes on Thursday night . The spotlight will shine intensely on all parts of Murray’s game as well as his partnership with coach Amelie Mauresmo. The pair linked up ahead of Wimbledon following Ivan Lendl’s departure from Murray’s team in March. Mauresmo’s impact has inevitably been compared to that of Lendl, who within nine months helped Murray win Olympic gold and his first grand slam title at the US Open. Murray said in New York the success of his ground-breaking relationship with Mauresmo could not be judged until at least the Australian Open because of the need to spend time working together away from the tour. McEnroe said: 'I don’t know how much time something like that needs. I would not call it a roaring success but that doesn’t mean it should not be given more time. 'I was speaking to Ivan and he said, for anything, it needs a year or two. If that’s true, you’ve got to give it more time.' Murray's coaches Dani Vallverdu (left) and Amelie Mauresmo watch on during his defeat . His partnership with Mauresmo in particular will come under the spotlight after a disappointing season . Murray has had some success late in the season, winning three titles and getting back to beating top-10 players on a regular basis, which helped him climb from a low of number 12 in the rankings back to six. But victories over Federer, Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal have proved elusive, with Murray winning just three sets in nine defeats to his biggest rivals during 2014. Asked how far away he feels from the trio, he said: “Well, after (losing to Federer), that’s quite clear. Quite a long way from that level. 'But a lot can change in a matter of weeks and months in tennis. Roger is a good example of that. Obviously last year he was having some struggles and some tough times with his body. 'A lot of questions were asked about him. He’s responded and gone into the last tournament of the year with an opportunity to get to number one. 'I’m not happy to finish the year with that record, obviously. But hopefully next year, if I get the right work done now, I can get myself off to a good start. 'Over five sets, I’ve tended to play, I would say, better tennis in my career. I hope that, come Australia, I’ll be a much better player.'","John McEnroe urges Andy Murray not to return straight to the court .

"More of the recorded call between Donald Sterling and a longtime friend has revealed that he claims to have made the racist comments in an effort to try to bed his much younger assistant. 'I’m talking to a girl. I’m trying to have sex with her. I’m trying to play with her. If you were trying to have sex with a girl and you’re talking to her privately and you don’t think anybody’s there, you may say anything in the world!' Sterling claims in the recording. The woman in question is V. Stiviano, who has long been described as Sterling's mistress but that has now been denied by both parties. This latest recording was released just . hours before the NBA announced that they have chosen Dick Parsons, a . former Citigroup chairman and former Time Warner chairman and CEO, as . the interim CEO of the Clippers. Keeping tabs: Donald Sterling has claimed that he didn't want V. Stiviano bringing any other men- including black men- to Clippers games because he wanted to sleep with her . 'Silly rabbit': Stiviano has previously claimed that they did not have a sexual relationship but she considers herself his 'silly rabbit' NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said in a statement Friday that Parsons 'will bring extraordinary leadership . and immediate stability to the Clippers organization.' With . Sterling banned from anything to do with the team or league, and team . President Andy Roeser on an indefinite leave of absence, the league and . Clippers worked together to find a CEO. Parsons, . who has also been on President Barack Obama's economic advisory team, . says he has been 'deeply troubled' by the Clippers' situation. In the latest recording obtained by Radar Online, Sterling tells his friend- who is only identified as being a longtime confidante- that he and Stiviano have never had sex but he hoped to change that. 'The girl is black. I like her. I’m jealous that she’s with other black guys. I want her. So what the hell. Can’t I in private tell her, ""I don’t want you to be with anybody?""' Sterling said. 'Am I a person? Do I have freedom of speech?!' The recording between Sterling and Stiviano that prompted his permanent ban from the NBA surrounded his problem with her posting a picture with Magic Johnson on her Instagram feed. Now he claims that his problems weren't with the people in the photo but the fact that they might be obstacles for Sterling's own romanitic plans. Woman at the center of it all: Stiviano has long been described as Sterling's mistress but they both claim they never slept together . Accessorizing: Stiviano has not shied from the media spotlight- with the exception of her visor- since her recording with Sterling was released . Her image: The original racist recording stemmed from a photo that she put on her Instagram feed with Magic Johnson, and this was another photo she had on her feed . 'The picture is not (the issue). I wish Magic Johnson was talking to a girl and you trying to play with her, and you might say anything. You might say you have the biggest penis in the world! I would have said I could fly over a high rise building if I had to!' he is heard saying on the latest recording. 'I didn't want her to bring anybody to my games because I was jealous, I mean I'm being honest. No one's going to hear it but you and me so.' The first portion of this latest tape was released on Thursday and the anonymous friend reportedly signed an affidavit swearing that Sterling is the other man on the line. He did not, however, say anything about whether or not Sterling was aware that the tape would be released or if he was aware that the call was being recorded. 'I have a girl here who has black kids and is partly black I think herself. I love the girl,' Sterling said. 'So they should take away for life your team (if) you say the wrong thing to a girl? I know what I said was wrong. But I never thought the private conversation would go anywhere, out to the public.' Scandal: Sterling's problems started when a secretly-recorded phone call with his girlfriend V. Stiviano (left) was released and he was heard complaining that she wanted to post photos of herself with Magic Johnson . Under investigation: Donald Sterling and his estranged wife Shelly (pictured in 2011) have both previously been cited in old discrimination lawsuits from former tenants and now she is reportedly being investigated by the NBA . He also implied that the original taped conversation with Stiviano happened three months before it was released last weekend, but that has not been verified. The NBA made their announcement about Parsons Friday afternoon. He will oversee the franchise while the league tries to force owner Donald Sterling to sell it following his lifetime ban for making racist remarks. Today is the first time the 80-year-old's plot to somehow woo 31-year-old Stiviano has been used as an attempted justification for his statements, as he was heard using his Jewish heritage and desire to win basketball games in the portion of the tape released yesterday. 'How can you be in this business and . be a racist? Do you think I tell the coach to get white players? Or to . get the best player he can get?' he said at one point. 'I . grew up in East L.A.... I was the president of the high school there. I . mean, and I’m a Jew! And 50 per cent of the people there were black and . 40 per cent were Hispanic. 'So I mean, people must have a good feeling for me.' Sterling talked about the scandal and specifically references the Instagram photo of his girlfriend V. Stiviano and Magic Johnson that reportedly prompted his backlash during a recorded call with her. 'It breaks my heart that Magic Johnson, a guy that I respect so much, wouldn’t stand up and say, ""Well let’s get the facts. Let’s get him and talk to him."" Nobody tried. Nobody!' If the recording is real, it would be the first time that Sterling has been heard from since he was banned from the NBA for life following the first recording of his conversation with V. Stiviano. NBA commissioner Adam Silver has made it clear that he hopes that the league's board of governors will vote to force Sterling to sell the LA basketball team that he has owned since 1981, but in this latest recording, Sterling made it clear that he does not intend to go without a fight. Ban: In April NBA Commissioner Adam Silver (pictured) announced a lifetime suspension and a $2.5million fine for Donald Sterling after audio recordings of him making racist comments came to light . 'You can’t force someone to sell property in America! I’m a lawyer, that’s my opinion,' Sterling said. In spite of his beliefs, the NBA is going ahead with their own process, as the advisory and finance committee held their second conference call in as many weeks in order to discuss their options and the timetable of a possible forced sale. Sterling has been banned from the NBA for life, is not allowed to have any role in the running of the Clippers nor attend any games or practices. The 'death sentence' came after tapes were released where Sterling was heard saying that he didn't want his mixed-race girlfriend to post photos showing that she was spending time with African Americans. The punishment, which also included a $2.5million fine, came after the NBA investigated and met with Sterling, but there are reports that his estranged wife Shelly Sterling is also being investigated because of some old discrimination lawsuits from former tenants who accused her of using racial slurs.","Sterling claims that he has never had a sexual relationship with V.

"Mark Molesley netted a late winner as Conference side Aldershot dumped 2008 winners Portsmouth out of the FA Cup with a 1-0 victory at the Recreation Ground. Sky Bet League Two outfit Pompey, who also reached the FA Cup final in 2010, were the victims of a giant-killing as the home side's battling performance was rewarded when Molesley scrambled the ball home after 81 minutes.

"Fight: Tennessee family is fighting to get back their 9-year-old adopted daughter Sonya, pictured, after a judge ordered her to be returned to her biological father following his release from prison . A Tennessee family is fighting to get back the 9-year-old girl they adopted after a judge ordered her to be returned to her biological father following his release from prison. Sonya was adopted by Dickson County couple Kim and David Hodgin in 2006, when she was just 3 years old. But she's now been taken back to her native Nebraska with Josh McCaul, the father she doesn't know, after a Tennessee appeals court overturned the adoption. The distraught Hodgins said they were given just two hours' notice before the young girl was taken from them. McCaul claims his parental rights were illegally terminated when he was in prison. The father was awarded custody of his . infant daughter in 2004 after Sonya's mother gave up her rights, . according to Tennessee Court of Appeals documents cited by the Tennessean. Due . to a 'busy work schedule,' he hired someone to watch his daughter in . July 2005 and when the woman asked if she could take Sonya to visit her . family in Tennessee in September that year, he agreed. However, Sonya never returned. By the end of the month, McCaul went to Tennessee to collect his daughter. But . the carer's parents contacted Dickson County sheriff's department and . told them they believed the father 'had a violent history' and was . coming to Tennessee to take the child back. It's unclear whether McCaul did in fact have a violent history at that point and it is also unknown whether he had harmed the infant in the past. But Detective Amy Longtin stopped McCaul from taking Sonya back and called the Department of Children's Services. The . next month, the Dickson County Juvenile Court placed Sonya in the carer's parents' home but soon after she went to live with Kim . Hodgin, a co-worker of the carer's mother, and her husband. Family: Sonya, front right with her adopted brother, was adopted by Dickson County couple Kim and David Hodgin, pictured back row, in 2006, when she was just 3 years old . In October 2005, McCaul was arrested for possession of firearms and the following April he was indicted of federal charges, remaining in custody. Later that year, the Hodgins petitioned Dickson County Chancery Court to adopt Sonya, claiming both her biological parents had abandoned her - McCaul, because he was in prison - and therefore their parental rights should be terminated. The court agreed, citing McCaul's 15-year sentence. In 2009, McCaul won an appeal claiming he did not voluntarily give up his rights and the court did not follow due process in the adoption proceedings. The Hodgins have tried to have Sonya, who has been in Nebraska two weeks now, returned to them but on Wednesday Juvenile Court Judge Andrew Jackson refused. 'This is not a best interest determination,' he said. 'If the child has not been neglected, I have to return the child to the parent.' DCS spokesman Rob Johnson told the Tennessean that while foster parents often come to love the children in their care, the law is clear, 'Birth parents have the right to raise their children.' The Hodgins created a 'Bring Sonya Home' Facebook page on February 4 and are begging friends, family and willing strangers to sign an online petition demanding Sonya be returned. It had garnered more than 7,200 signatures by Tuesday and the Facebook page has more than 6,900 'Likes.'","Tennessee couple Kim and David Hodgin are fighting to get back their adopted daughter Sonya, who has lived with them since 2006, when she was just 3 years old .

"FIFA’s warring ethics chiefs effectively passed the buck over World Cup bid corruption onto another Zurich official on Thursday to complicate the long-running controversy yet further. Michael Garcia and Hans-Joachim Eckert met at FIFA’s Zurich headquarters on Thursday to sort out their differences. This followed the unprecedented situation of investigator Garcia disowning the summary of his report made by judge Eckert that cleared Russia and Qatar to stage the next two World Cups and apportioned most blame for violating bid integrity on the England 2018 campaign. The only common ground that the pair could find was that Swiss financier Domenico Scala, chairman of FIFA’s audit and compliance committee should receive full copies of all reports before determining how much of that information should be made available to the FIFA ExCo.

"Caterham have confirmed that Will Stevens will complete their driver line-up for this weekend's Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. The 23-year-old Briton teams up with Kamui Kobayashi for the season-ending double pointer for which cash-strapped Caterham announced they would race a week ago after going into administration last month. Earlier this month, Caterham launched a crowd-funding project in a bid to raise the £2.35million needed to get the team on the grid for the final race of the season. Administrators Smith & Williamson announced last Friday that they were just under £500,000 short and that they would race at the Yas Marina. British racer Will Stevens will make his debut for Caterham at the season finale in Abu Dhabi this weekend . Stevens, 23, was part of the Caterham Academy and has tested for the F1 team, pictured here in 2013 . Stevens was part of the Caterham Racing Academy and has been involved in Formula One testing for the Leafield-based marque in 2013 and this year, clocking up 1,100kilometres in the process and gaining his FIA Super licence. He is delighted to be given the chance at Caterham for the final race on the 2014 calendar and said: 'I'm absolutely thrilled to be getting this opportunity and am very grateful to everyone involved at Caterham F1 Team for giving it to me. 'I feel ready for the challenge of my F1 debut and look forward to working as part of the Team in a race environment after all the work we've done together previously in the tests I've completed and back at Leafield in the sim (simulator). 'Hopefully this will be something we will be able to carry through to the 2015 season together.' Caterham head of engineering operations Gianluca Pisanello was pleased to have Stevens on board in Abu Dhabi as the team return to the track after missing out in the last two races in the United States and Brazil. He said: 'We know Will very well through his involvement in the Caterham Racing Academy. 'More importantly he has done a vast amount of time in our simulator, completing around 10,000km, which has built his experience both of this year's car and with the engineering team that are going to Abu Dhabi. 'In addition, his 2014 test at Silverstone in our current car, where he completed over 500km, was very successful and his race pace was very good. 'As a result, he was one of our best candidates for this race weekend and we are delighted to have secured his services for our return to the F1 grid.'

"Nigeria won't get the chance to defend its title at the Africa Cup of Nations next year after drawing 2-2 at home to South Africa on Wednesday to miss out on the finals on the last day of qualifying. Nigeria scored two late goals to claim a frantic draw in front of a desperate home crowd. But Republic of Congo's 1-0 win in Sudan in Group A's other game saw it spring the big surprise in qualifying and take the other automatic place behind the already-qualified South Africans. The Nigerians also failed to secure a place at the 2015 Cup of Nations as the best third-place team across the seven groups. Nigeria's Jon Mikel Obi (left) takes on South Africa  midfielder Dean Furman at Akwa Ibom stadium . Ivory Coast and Ghana left it late, but managed to qualify for the tournament in Equatorial Guinea in January and February, as did Guinea and Mali. The Ivorians secured the point they needed with a 0-0 draw at home to Cameroon to finish second to the Cameroonians in Group D. Ghana won 3-1 win at home against Togo to ensure they will be at the finals. Needing a win to get the chance to defend a title it won last year in South Africa, Nigeria fell 2-0 behind in Uyo to a brace from Tokelo Rantie in six minutes either side of halftime. The African champions gave themselves a glimmer of hope when Sone Aluko side-footed home in the 69th minute after a shot rebounded off the South African post. Aluko made it 2-2 deep into injury time with his second, but Nigeria couldn't find a winner. Nigeria forward Ikechukwu Uche (left) gets tangled up with with South Africa goalkeeper Darren Keet . Ivory Coast overcame any last-day nerves it may have had to draw with Cameroon and just do enough. That result meant Congo's 3-1 win over Sierra Leone in the group's other game wasn't enough for the Congolese to qualify automatically. Congo could still go through as the best third-place team, though. Ghana made sure of its passage with goals by Majeed Warris, Wakaso Mubarak and Emmanuel Agyemang-Badu against Togo in Tamale. Guinea qualified second behind Ghana in Group E after a 2-0 win over Uganda at an empty stadium in Casablanca in neutral Morocco. Guinea has been banned from hosting qualifying games because of the Ebola virus outbreak back home. Mali, a semi-finalist at the last two Cup of Nations tournaments, also avoided a surprise elimination in qualifying when it ended Algeria's five-game winning run in Group B with a 2-0 victory in Bamako. Mali joined the Algerians at the Cup of Nations with the victory and ensured minnow Malawi missed out after its 0-0 draw in Ethiopia. Host Equatorial Guinea, top-ranked African team Algeria, Cape Verde, Tunisia, South Africa, Zambia, Cameroon, Burkina Faso, Gabon and Senegal had already qualified for the continental championship before Wednesday's finale. One more place is available for the best third-place team, with Congo in place to claim that. Egypt or Angola could still steal that from the Congolese with wins in Wednesday's late games.","Title holders Nigeria fail to qualify from Group A .

"The Pentagon broke the law when it swapped Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, a prisoner in Afghanistan for five years, for five Taliban leaders, congressional investigators said Thursday. The nonpartisan Government Accountability Office said the Defense Department failed to notify the relevant congressional committees at least 30 days in advance of the exchange – a clear violation of the law – and used $988,400 of a wartime account to make the transfer. The GAO also said the Pentagon's use of funds that hadn't been expressly appropriated violated the Anti-deficiency Act. 'In our view, the meaning of the [law] is clear and unambiguous,' the GAO wrote to nine Republican senators, including Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and various committees. Scroll down for video . FILE - This August 2014 file photo provided by Eugene R. Fidell shows Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl preparing to be interviewed by Army investigators.  The attorney for Bergdahl, who was held as a prisoner of war in Afghanistan for five years before his release, says the soldier wants to go to college once the investigation of how he was captured by the Taliban is finished. (AP Photo/Eugene R. Fidell, File) MANDATORY CREDIT . Rach of the five Taliban prisoners send home in exchange for Bergdahl was categorized as 'high' risk to the United States, its interests and its allies, but the Pentagon released them anyway . 'Section 8111 prohibits the use of ""funds . appropriated or otherwise made available"" in the Department of Defense . Appropriations Act, 2014, to transfer any individual detained at . Guantanamo Bay to the custody or control of a foreign entity"" except in . accordance' with the law. The GAO said the relevant committees received phone calls from May 31 – the day of the transfer – to June 1, with written notification coming on June 2. Five senior Taliban were released from detention at the U.S. prison at Guantanamo in exchange for Bergdahl, who had disappeared from his post in Paktika province in eastern Afghanistan on June 30, 2009. The five Taliban are to remain in Qatar for a year. Lawmakers, especially Republicans, were furious with President Barack Obama and members of the administration for failing to notify them about the swap. Some in Congress have said Bergdahl was a deserter and the United States gave up too much for his freedom. Several lawmakers have cited intelligence suggesting the high-level Taliban officials could return to the Afghanistan battlefield. The administration has defended the swap and its decision to keep Congress in the dark, saying concern about Bergdahl's health and safety required speedy action. The Joint Chiefs of Staff has unanimously supported the exchange, insisting that the United States has a sacred commitment to men and women who serve that it will never leave anyone behind on the battlefield. Army Gen. Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, said the swap in May was 'likely our last, best opportunity' to free Bergdahl. Bergdahl is doing administrative duties at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio while an investigation into how he was captured by the Taliban is conducted. A more gaunt Bowe Bergdahl was seen in a Taliban video before the Obama administration traded five high-value Taliban prisoners to ensure his safe return . Last month, a bitterly divided House Armed Services Committee voted to condemn Obama for the swap. The Republican-led panel backed a nonbinding resolution that disapproves of the exchange and faults Obama for failing to notify Congress 30 days in advance of the swap, as required by law. The bipartisan resolution raised national security concerns about the transfer of the five Taliban, who had been held at the prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, for more than a decade, and the 'repercussions of negotiating with terrorists.' The measure also expresses relief that Bergdahl has returned safely to the United States. The full House is expected to consider the measure in the fall, just a few weeks before the midterm elections.","Pentagon failed to tell Congress before releasing five 'high risk' Taliban prisoners from the Guantanamo Bay detention facility .

"In the dock: Teacher Stephen Bowers (outside Leeds Crown Court) has been accused of raping a 15-year-old pupil after he discovered she had a crush on him . A teacher allegedly raped a 15-year-old pupil he knew had a crush on him by reading her diary, a court heard yesterday. Stephen Bowers, 35, started a sexual relationship with the girl, kissing her in the school store cupboard and later taking her virginity at his house, a court was told. The illicit affair ended abruptly when he allegedly had sex with her against her will, again at his home. The girl claims Bowers forced himself upon her in his bedroom even though she told him she didn’t feel well. She did not tell the police until eight years later, following a confession to a counsellor. The sexual relationship began in 2004 when she was a year 9 pupil at the secondary school in West Yorkshire where Bowers taught English. He was popular and regarded as ‘cool’ – singing in a student band and taking pupils to concerts. Bowers became aware of the girl’s feelings for him when she left her diary in class and he found it. He went on to a website used by pupils and wrote a poem called ‘Star Girl’ in which he referred to the diary and admitted his feelings for her. The girl replied by sending him an internet message. He later replied saying he loved her, she claimed. The alleged store cupboard encounter came in April 2004 – ‘the first time we touched each other’, she said. On another occasion he is said to have rescued her from town centre bullies and taken her to his parents’ empty house. She said he took off her bra and they kissed passionately. Although they were disturbed by a relative of Bowers, the girl, who is now in her 20s, said the sex sessions continued at his home in Leeds. Popular: A jury at Leeds Crown Court (above) was told that Bowers was regarded as 'cool' by pupils as he allowed them to call him Steve, was in a band with three other students and took pupils to see gigs . ‘I don’t particularly remember being . pressured into it because I believed I was totally in love with this guy . and he was amazing,’ she said. ‘He was an English teacher and he kind . of had a way with words. To me we were in love and it was going to last . forever.’ Describing their first time together, she said: ‘He had never . had sex with a virgin before and he told me he was quite excited. ‘It was totally consensual at that point. Even though I knew it was wrong in the eyes of the law I thought the law was wrong.’ The alleged rape happened in autumn . 2004 at Bowers’ house. She said they watched a film and ate a pizza . before having consensual sex. Later when Bowers wanted sex again she told him she wasn’t feeling well, she said. The court heard that Bowers told her: ‘You really don’t want this do you?’ Adrian Strong, for the Crown, said of . the rape allegation: ‘The prosecution say Stephen Bowers took advantage . of that vulnerability and forced sex upon her.’ Bowers was arrested in March last year but did not comment in police interview. Mr Strong said the defendant’s case . was likely to be that there was no intimate contact with the girl, that . he was aware of a crush on her part but nothing happened between them. Bowers, of Ackworth, West Yorkshire, denies rape and three charges of sexual activity with a child. The trial, at Leeds Crown Court, continues.

Mr Bowers was found not guilty of all charges.  In May 2014, the Disclosure & Barring Service (DBS) decided that it was not appropriate to include Mr Bowers in the Children’s Barred List or the Adults’ Barred List. However, on 19 September 2014 the Secretary of State for Education barred Mr Bowers for life from teaching children after the Professional Conduct Panel of the National College for Teaching found on 17 September on a balance of probabilities that he was guilty of professional misconduct, including having sex with Pupil A “on one or more occasions while she was under the legal consensual age”."
"Cesc Fabregas is set to return from a thigh injury in time to feature in Chelsea’s Barclays Premier League clash with West Bromwich Albion on Saturday. It was initially feared the Spanish midfielder would miss three weeks of action with a minor thigh tear that ruled him out of his country’s games against Belarus and Germany during the international break. But Fabregas trained on Thursday at Chelsea’s Cobham training base and looks likely to feature for the league leaders at Stamford Bridge on Saturday, returning to the side a week ahead of schedule. Cesc Fabregas is due to return to action in Saturday's clash with West Brom at Stamford Bridge . Fabregas trained at Chelsea's Cobham headquarters on Thursday after a minor thigh tear . The former Arsenal skipper has started every league game this season alongside Nemanja Matic in the centre of midfield – and that trend now looks set to continue. The news could further fuel suspicions in Spain over the commitment of Fabregas and team-mate Diego Costa, after both played through the pain barrier in Chelsea’s 2-1 win over Liverpool at Anfield but pulled out of Vicente del Bosque’s squad. Costa had been struggling with injuries to his hamstring and his groin, while manager Jose Mourinho spoke regularly about the need for his top scorer to be rested – a request eventually granted by Del Bosque. Diego Costa and Fabregas were both absent from the Spain squad for the last round of internationals . Spain team-mate Sergio Ramos appeared to question the commitment of the Chelsea duo last week – although he later claimed that his comments relating to wanting ‘players to show the same commitment to the national team as they do to their club’ were not about the pair. A win against the Baggies on Saturday would extend Chelsea’s at the top of the Premier League to seven points, with second-placed Southampton not playing until Monday night.","Midfielder has recovered from a minor thigh tear to face the Baggies .

"A New York couple has asked a judge to void the adoption of their two Russian-born children because they suffer from serious mental disorders. The parents, whose names have not been revealed, adopted the youngsters, then aged six and eight, via Spence-Chapin in New York and Cradle of Hope in Maryland in 2008. Although the children were reportedly described by the agencies as 'healthy and socially well-adjusted' siblings, it soon became clear they suffered from  medical and psychiatric problems. Case: A Long Island couple has asked a judge to void the adoption of their Russian-born children because they suffer from serious mental disorders. Above, a file picture of Russian orphans in Rostov-on-Don . In subsequent years, they allegedly repeatedly threatened to kill their parents, before being placed in state mental health facilities, where they remain. During this time, the couple, from Long Island, also allegedly discovered that the children were not related and had been sexually abused. The parents are now asking Nassau County Surrogate's Judge Edward McCarty III to dissolve their adoption of the youngsters, dubbed Child A and Child C, who are now aged 12 and 14 respectively. And in an unusual move, Judge McCarty III has agreed to keep the courtroom open, citing public interest in the 'disturbing facts' surrounding the adoption, according to the New York Post. The case was first reported by the New York Law Journal. He said an estimated 20 per cent of Russian children adopted in the U.S. suffer from developmental issues, while 18 have died through violence by their new American parents in the past 20 years. If this particular adoption is dissolved, the children would become wards of the state, which could see them either remain in mental facilities or be eligible for ­foster care.

Orphans: Judge McCarty III said around 20 per cent of Russian children adopted in the U.S. suffer from developmental problems, while 18 have died through violence by their new parents (file picture) Speaking in court, attorney Irene Steffas said: 'If agencies had to warranty that children are in good health, agencies would shut down.' But she added that adoptive parents should be entitled to 'every doctor’s report, every shred of evidence about the child’s health and background.' Adam Pertman, president of the National Center on Adoption and Permanency, agreed that parents must receive accurate records so they are prepared for the challenges their children will face. 'They don’t get sufficient training. And they don’t get the support and services they need,' he said. Home: The parents, who are from Long Island (pictured), New York, adopted the youngsters, then aged six and eight, in 2008. The children, now aged 12 and 14, are currently living in state mental health facilities . Over the past two decades, more than 60,000 Russian children have been adopted by Americans, at a total cost of around $330million. In 2013, Russia banned U.S. couples from adopting its children in a move that was widely seen as retaliation for a controversial bill that President Barack Obama signed into law in December 2012. The American action imposed travel and financial restrictions on human rights violators in Russia. President Vladimir Putin's bill angered millions of Americans and Russians, who argued it victimised children to make a political point, preventing many from growing up in loving families. The couple's attorney and the two agencies involved declined to comment to the newspaper.","Couple, from Long Island, adopted children, then six and eight, in 2008 .

"A cafe has found itself at the centre of a social media row after owners barred a customer from their  shop for leaving a negative comment online. Shopper Helen Forsyth took to Facebook concerned over the way cakes are put on open display at The Shed in Bathford, Somerset. But the cafe responded online by calling her a 'stupid woman' and has now apparently barred Ms Forsyth from coming back. The Shed also took to Facebook to label her comments 'b******s.' The online argument has since gone viral. A cafe has found itself at the centre of a social media row after owners barred a customer from their shop for leaving a negative comment about their cake stand shop online . Shopper Helen Forsyth took to Facebook concerned over the way cakes are put on open display at The Shed in Bathford, Somerset . It is believed the cakes were displayed in accordance with hygiene standards on a traditional cake stand. The exchange escalated onto Twitter with the cafe threatening her with legal action for making 'defamatory and potentially libellous' comments. One reply read: 'Please don’t come back - your feedback is b******s! You would need to be a midget with the neck of a giraffe to be able to breathe over them - stupid woman!' Speaking to BBC Radio Bristol yesterday, Ms Forsyth, from Bradford on Avon, Wiltshire, said the response she received had left her shocked. 'I think if businesses use social medial and invite reviews they have to expect them,' she said. 'I was very careful because I realise it was a review and someone’s business, so I was very tempered in my response. It is believed the cakes were displayed in accordance with hygiene standards on a traditional cake stand . 'I was not that damning, I gave them three out of five. 'There are other reviews lower than mine that got the same response. I didn’t really know whether to be quite upset or just laugh, it was just so ridiculous. 'It was shocking, from an allegedly professional business, it was really shocking.' Ms Forsyth posted the review on The Shed’s Facebook page after visiting the cafe on Friday. In a section entitled ‘reviews’ she wrote: 'The cakes looked amazing and I wanted to try every single one BUT the cakes were on very open display with every customer essentially leaning over them to order. 'So all the cakes were getting breathed on (or worse) by every single passing person, plus the staff. 'Which is a crying shame as they really did look extremely good. But due to the above, we just had coffee.' The remarks provoked a swift reaction from the business, and the row continued throughout the weekend, with Ms Forsyth responding: 'Customers are entitled to have an opinion and if you set up a FB page and invite reviews, you can’t expect every single one to be a 5. 'It’s unprofessional to resort to attempted bullying in these situations.' The Shed is run by Fred Cobb and his wife Helen, who also have a boutique guest house at Beach, near Bath.

The Shed hit back hours later, saying: 'Don’t accuse a business of something potentially damaging as their food being ‘unhygienic’ and expect the establishment to lie down and have their ""tummy tickled""- what you said was defamatory and potentially libellous - you have to be more responsible for your comments - so stop hiding behind this ""bullying"" nonsense - we are allowed to defend our brand - or would you prefer to go legal.' The Shed is run by Fred Cobb and his wife Helen, who also have a boutique guest house at Beach, near Bath. It is not clear who was in charge of the business's social media sites. Nigel Morgan, a Wiltshire-based PR firm owner, said on behalf of The Shed that the remarks had reflected the passion of the business for its products and venue. He said: 'It certainly wasn’t pleasant to see it unfold yesterday. But it was a great venue being passionate about what it does. 'It is passionate about cakes and passionate about food hygiene, but it was a bit too passionate on social media. 'If you question a food business’s hygiene, they are bound to see red.' Mr Morgan said the business had apologised for calling Ms Forsyth stupid, and said it would like to talk properly to her. He stressed that cakes were displayed in total accordance with food hygiene rules. Following the social media storm bookings increased at The Shed and they described Sunday as people 'were coming to see what all the fuss was about'.","Helen Forsyth posted hygiene concerns on Facebook over cake display .

"Ever wondered what it would be like to gaze across the surface of Mars? Thanks to one photographer, you can - with only a click of the mouse. Andrew Bodrov spent two weeks creating the interactive image using 407 pictures from the narrow angle and medium angle cameras on the head of Nasa's Curiosity rover and a bit of digital retouching. '[The camera] is only two megapixels, which by today's standards is not huge,' he told Popular Science. 'Of course, flying these electronic components from Earth to Mars, and having them survive the radiation and other hazards, means that they were not able to just use off-the-shelf cameras.'

Bodrov added the sky and a previous picture of Curiosity to the 90,000 x 45,000 pixel panorama with Photoshop. Earlier this week, Nasa chiefs were relieved when a computer glitch that had stopped operations for a week was solved, meaning they could get back to examining rock powder found on the planet. From April 4, radio communications between Earth and Mars will be blocked by the sun, meaning work will be halted again until May 1. For now, the £2billion six-wheel rover, which landed on the planet in August to begin its two-year mission, will continue to analyse the rock sample, which contains all the chemical ingredients necessary for life. Andrew Bodrov's panorama uses 407 pictures from the Mars Curiosity rover's cameras . Scientists identified sulphur, nitrogen, . hydrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and carbon in the powder Curiosity drilled out of a . sedimentary rock near an ancient stream bed in an area known as Yellowknife Bay within Gale Crater. They believe that billions of . years ago water poured down the rim of the crater and formed streams . that might have been up to three feet deep. At the time of the discovery project scientist John Grotzinger said: 'We have found a habitable environment that is so benign and supportive of life, that probably if this water was around and you had been there, you would have been able to drink it. The £2billion six-wheel rover, right, is analysing rock powder found on Mars which has been shown to contain all the necessary elements for life . Michael Meyer, lead scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program at the agency's headquarters in Washington, added: 'A fundamental question for this mission is whether Mars could have supported a habitable environment. 'From what we know now, the answer is yes.' Scientists eventually plan to drive the rover to a three-mile-high mound of what appears to be layered sediment rising from the floor of Gale Crater.",Photographer Andrew Bodrov used 407 pictures from two Curiosity cameras to make the interactive image .
"It is Arsenal versus Manchester United on Saturday evening, a match that has in every season since the Premier League began featured at least one team with genuine title credentials. Not so this time. Where once, Arsene Wenger and Sir Alex Ferguson knew the result would likely shape the destination of that over-sized silverware, now the clubs are in a modest battle for the final Champions League spot. Neither side is in the top four currently and you have to trawl back to September 1998 for the last occasion that was the case heading into this fixture. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Roy Keane and Patrick Vieira reliving key battles . Manchester United players (from left to right) Juan Mata, Robin van Persie and Wayne Rooney celebrate . Managers Arsene Wenger (left) and Louis van Gaal (right) will go head-to-head at the Emirates on Saturday . Arsenal players including Alexis Sanchez (left) look dejected after conceding in their defeat by Swansea . Both entered the final day of that season capable of lifting the trophy following an epic struggle over many months. United beat Tottenham to edge their rivals by a point and went on to claim the Treble. It seems improbable in the extreme that a similar story could unfold this year. Before and after that match at Highbury in September 1998, when Arsenal were eighth and United 10th, the fixture was a premium one in the top-flight calendar. For nine consecutive seasons from 1995-96 to 2003-04, United and Arsenal shared the crown between them, many times finishing one and two in the table. The matches where they faced off directly would often define each of those seasons. Marc Overmars did for Gary Neville in March 1998 to get Wenger a win that would see his side claw back an 11-point gap on route to the double. Manchester United's players spray champagne as they celebrate winning the Premier League title in May 2000 . Marc Overmars (left) scores past Peter Schmeichel at Old Trafford to give Arsenal a 1-0 win in 1998 . Wenger's men celebrate being crowned Premier League champions at Highbury back in May 1998 . In April 2003 United clinched a 2-2 draw at Highbury from behind that invigorated their charge and had Ferguson running across the pitch to celebrate. Had Ruud van Nistelrooy converted a last-minute penalty at Old Trafford in September 2003, The Invicibles would never have happened. The reaction from Martin Keown et al following the 0-0 draw painted a picture of its importance. Fast-forward 13 months and to the 2-0 defeat in Manchester that stopped Arsenal's unbeaten run at 49 games and triggered a food fight in the tunnel which left Ferguson with pizza on his lapel and a Battle of the Buffet nickname coined. Roy Keane's fury at Patrick Vieira in the Highbury tunnel in February 2005 was fuelled because he was aware of the overall significance of the game. Gunners defender Martin Keown shouts in the face of Ruud van Nistelrooy during a feisty encounter in 2003 . Patrick Vieira (left) and Roy Keane (right) had to be calmed down in the Highbury tunnel in 2005 . Keane (left) and Vieira also came to blows during United's away win during the 1999-2000 season . Chelsea, under Jose Mourinho, would finally end the dominance of the two clubs that season but back then Arsenal versus United was still the fixture to watch. It was a Clasico for the Premier League, pitching a side from the nation's capital against another from far outside, with all the cultural differences that brings; and two clubs steeped in success. In Keane's latest autobiography, his index requires 20 separate page references for all mentions of Arsenal, such was their impact on his career. 'Which of us was the better team?' he asks at one point. 'You couldn't call it. We were like two heavyweights battering each other.' Saturday's bout might push cruiserweight, if you're being generous; an undercard contest when once it was the main event.

"Former Arsenal full back Bacary Sagna has revealed he left the club in search of trophies, not money. The 31-year-old spent seven years with the Gunners, but only won one trophy - the 2014 FA Cup - during his time there. Much to the dismay of Arsenal fans, the France international then made the well-worn route from the Emirates Stadium to the Etihad on a free transfer. Former Arsenal man Bacary Sagna claims he moved to Manchester City in search of trophies, not money . Sagna spent seven years in north London with the Gunners but only won one trophy during that time . Supporters accused Sagna of being a mercenary after he failed to sign a new deal with Arsene Wenger's side, but the former Auxerre man said he had been attracted to the Premier League champions for other reasons. 'At Arsenal we lost our way every season in March or April,' Sagna told The Sun. 'We would lose our grip on titles with the squad decimated by injuries. What was missing was trophies. 'Talks dragged on for a year and a half. Arsenal fans said I went to City for the money. But my contract was unchanged for six years.'

"Former Football Association chairman Lord Triesman has backed calls for a World Cup boycott to force FIFA to introduce more reforms and admitted that some of England's tactics in pursuing votes for its 2018 bid were 'unwise'. Triesman, England 2018's first bid chairman until he was forced to resign after being taped making derogatory remarks about rival bids, also said he was now prepared to meet World Cup ethics investigator Michael Garcia about the 2018 and 2022 bids. His successor at the FA, David Bernstein, who stepped down from the post in 2013, has called for UEFA to lead a boycott of the 2018 World Cup in Russia. Lord Triesman (left) backed the call for a boycott of the 2018 World Cup in Russia . David Bernstein called for the boycott, saying FIFA need to be forced to introduce reforms . Lord Triesman (right) supported the idea of UEFA leading the boycott of the 2018 World Cup . Triesman told Sky Sports News: 'David Bernstein has been saying Europe should get its act together and preferably do it together and I think he's got an extremely strong point and I support it. 'Michel Platini and UEFA should be saying 'if you want the Europeans involved in this world sport then it's got to be a clean sport run in a transparent way and to standards that are exacting'. 'Russia will of course resist it but the fact of the matter is the most powerful of all the continental football groups is in a position to influence it, as are the major sponsors and I think until FIFA is confronted by that it will never change.' Ethics judge Hans-Joachim Eckert last week made a number of criticisms of England 2018's tactics in trying to win the vote of now-disgraced former FIFA vice-president Jack Warner, including securing a job for an associate of his and picking up the bill for a £35,000 gala dinner. Triesman added: 'I think the pursuit of some people and their votes was probably done in a way that was unwise. Maybe I would say that. 'People used to complain because I and Jack Warner couldn't bear to be in the same room as one another so the idea that we were cosy with each other never occurred and there were no exchanges of promises or gifts in that period. 'In my view it would have been much more sensible for England to have been at greater arm's lengths of someone like Jack Warner. I said that at the time so I'm not saying anything new today.' Triesman said he had wanted to speak to Garcia but had been prevented from doing so as he was being sued at the time - unsuccessfully, by Thailand's FIFA member Worawi Makudi - and had been advised not to do so as the case was sub judice.","Former FA chairman Lord Triesman backed a World Cup boycott call .

"An extremely enthusiastic seven-year-old made an unforgettable TV debut last week when he was given the chance to deliver his local weather forecast – and hilariously stole the show from the station’s veteran weatherman. Appearing alongside Chicago’s WGN-TV’s resident meteorologist Paul Konrad, charismatic second-grader Charlie Hale offered a unique take on the day’s weather report, bringing a bit of sunshine to an otherwise dreary forecast with his impressive repertoire of jazz hands and dance moves.

"South Africa paceman Morne Morkel thrived on a fast WACA pitch to capture five wickets but the tourists made hard work of a three-wicket victory over Australia in the second one-day international. Morkel's return of 5-21 was his best in one-day cricket and helped skittle Australia for a paltry 154 runs from only 41.4 overs on a day of brilliant sunshine in Perth. Although losing both openers cheaply in reply and stumbling to 153-7, captain AB De Villiers (48) and David Miller (22 not out) ensured a regulation victory with more than 22 overs to spare, levelling the five-match series 1-1. South Africa paceman Morne Morkel thrived on a fast WACA pitch to capture five Australian wickets . Australia's innings began disastrously, with Morkel having the dangerous David Warner caught behind for a duck before the same bowler caught Aaron Finch for eight at mid-on off the bowling of Dale Steyn (3-31). Shane Watson (11) and Steven Smith (10) also went cheaply before George Bailey (25) and Australia's top scorer Mitchell Marsh (67) steadied the innings with a 58-run partnership. Vernon Philander broke the stand, however, with Faf Du Plessis taking a fine catch low at mid-on to remove Bailey, before Morkel had wicketkeeper Matthew Wade caught behind for 19 and Glenn Maxwell bowled for a duck in the same over. Batsman Shane Watson (11) went cheaply as Australia lost by three wickets in Perth . Morkel captured his fifth wicket when Mitchell Johnson edged behind for three, leaving the hosts reeling at 129-8 and their hopes of building a solid total in tatters. Australia quicks Josh Hazlewood and Johnson struck early to remove openers Quinton de Kock (4) and Hashim Amla (10) before Rilee Rossouw contributed a valuable 30 before swiping a nick behind off part-time spinner Maxwell. Du Plessis and De Villiers drove South Africa to a comfortable 113-3 before Hazlewood struck to remove Du Plessis for 19 and Farhaan Behardien for a duck in successive balls. Michael Clarke, seen here losing his wicket in the first ODI, has been ruled out of the series through injury . David Miller survived the hat-trick ball and an onslaught of short-pitched bowling from left-armer Johnson, but Hazlewood struck again to remove De Villiers and Vernon Philander for a duck for another chance at a hat-trick. Steyn defied Hazlewood, however, and slogged his third delivery over the bowler to the fence to bring up the winning runs. Hazlewood was the pick of the Australian bowlers with 5-31.

"The former Beautiful South singer Paul Heaton has resigned as a charity patron of Sheffield United over the club's decision to allow convicted rapist Ched Evans to return to training. The singer, who said he made the decision with 'great regret', said the club needed 'to lift its reputation out of the gutter'. He joins TV presenter Charlie Webster, sixties pop star Dave Berry and Sheffield businesswoman Lindsay Graham, who have all resigned as patrons of the club since the decision was made. Scroll down for video . Singer Paul Heaton (left) has joined four other charity patrons of Sheffield United in resigning over the return of convicted rapist Ched Evans (right) to the club . He made the statement today via his Facebook page where he told fans he saluted the bravery of his fellow patrons. He added: 'I firmly believe that Ched Evans has the right to rebuild his career in football but rebuilding a career should not involve walking straight out of prison and into the shirt of the club he so badly let down. 'I believe he needs to move away and move on, and the club itself needs to lift its reputation out of the gutter.' Last week the 25-year-old footballer was offered the chance to train with his former club Sheffield United after he was released from jail last month, having served half his five-year rape sentence. But the decision sparked a backlash from a series of high-profile supporters, including Jessica Ennis-Hill, who said she would ask for her name to removed from  the club's ground if he returns full-time. He was expected to start playing football again  last Tuesday, but is yet to turn up. Support: The father of Natasha Massey,left,  Ched Evans' fiancee, will offer him a job if his football comeback fails, it has emerged . It has since been reported that the club may not offer the Welsh international a new contract because he is considered 'toxic'. However, it emerged today that if his return to football is blocked, he will be offered a day job by his fiancee's millionaire father. Natasha Massey's father is likely to give him a role at his empire, which includes high-end jewellers and a staff rewards ­business, if his football comeback fails, the Mirror said. A source told the paper that Karl Massey said there would always be a job for Evans at one of his firms. They added: 'He believes 100 per cent in Ched's ­innocence, otherwise he wouldn't ­sanction him still dating his daughter or have given them his blessing to marry.' It has been reported that Mr Massey, 50, has paid for a PR campaign which protests Evans' innocence. He is also said to have hired lawyers to present new evidence to the Criminal Cases Review ­Commission in a bid to overturn his conviction. The statement by Paul Heaton was posted on his Facebook page today where he announced his resignation . Meanwhile Sheffield United have admitted they are 'appalled' by the abuse being aimed at people who have criticised the club's decision to allow convicted rapist Evans back to training. Twitter abuse was aimed at Olympic heptathlon champion and local hero Jessica Ennis-Hill, who said that to allow Evans back into the Blades squad would 'completely contradict' her beliefs of being a role model to young people. She asked for her name to removed from a stand at Sheffield United's Bramall Lane ground if the club takes back Evans. 'I believe being a role model to young people is a huge honour and those in positions of influence in communities should respect the role they play in young people's lives and set a good example,' she said. 'If Evans was to be re-signed by the club, it would completely contradict these beliefs.' Within hours she was taunted with several sick tweets including one saying: 'I hope he (Evans) rapes her.' The League One club have pledged to work with South Yorkshire Police who are investigating the abuse. People who send this kind of abuse on social media or when chanting at grounds should not feel safe to make these personal attacks, the club said. Jessica Ennis-Hill, 27, has received rape threats on Twitter after she said she wanted her name removed from a stand at Sheffield United if Ched Evans is re-signed by the club . Last week the 25-year-old returned to training with his former club Sheffield United after he was released from jail last month, having served half his five-year rape sentence . He was released from prison last month after serving half of the five-year sentence. An appeal against his conviction was rejected by three judges at the Court of Appeal in 2012. His case is due to be looked at by the Criminal Cases Review Commission. After his release, Evans put a video on his website protesting his innocence and vowing to clear his name. South Yorkshire Police said on Friday: 'South Yorkshire Police can confirm they are investigating reports of abusive tweets. Officers are making efforts to contact the individual concerned, but have launched an investigation into the posts.' Ennis-Hill, a United fan, had a stand at Bramall Lane named in her honour after she won gold at the London 2012 Olympics. TV presenter Charlie Webster, left , has resigned from her role as Sheffield United patron, followed by Lindsay Graham, right, after the club decided to allow convicted rapist Ched Evans to train . Backlash: There has been huge support for a campaign to stop Evans returning to his former club, and other believe as he has only served half his five-year sentence a ban should last for at least that period . Campaigners against sexual violence have criticised the club's decision to allow Evans, 25, to train with the team. Wales international Evans was jailed in April 2012 for raping a 19-year-old woman in a hotel room in Rhyl, North Wales. The striker denied raping the woman, saying the sex was consensual, but he was found guilty by a jury at Caernarfon Crown Court.","Paul Heaton resigned as patron of Sheffield United over club's decision .

"Samoa captain David Lemi claims the off-field controversy surrounding his players has galvanised the dressing room ahead of Saturday's match against England. The tourists had threatened to boycott the clash at Twickenham in protest against their treatment at the hands of the Samoa Rugby Union but it was confirmed this week that the strike had been called off. England will be desperate to end a miserable run of five consecutive defeats against the Samoans but Lemi insists the off-field row has been a help not a hindrance to his team's preparations. Samoa's David Lemi says his side have grown tighter in their preparation for Saturday after boycott threats . 'It has brought us together and given us more tightness in our preparation and focus for Saturday,' Lemi said. 'It's a massive opportunity for us - it has been a while since we played England so we are grateful to have this chance going into the World Cup. 'It is a good test for us - we play the tier two nations but to play against a top five side in the world is a test for us and will tell us where we are ahead of the World Cup.' Team manager Sami Leota insisted he was not aware of any plans for the players to stage a visual protest during the game. World Rugby (formerly known as the International Rugby Board) and the International Rugby Players' Association have been involved in discussions but the Samoa Rugby Union has so far refused to attend talks. Samoa threatened to boycott their match vs England due to a dispute over their pay with their Rugby Union . Leota also claimed to be unaware of a cancelled meeting between players and Union officials that was reportedly due to go ahead on Thursday morning. 'Any meeting that was meant to be held this morning - we are not able to answer about that,' Leota said. Samoa have made six changes to the starting XV that beat Canada 23-13 last Friday. Ken Pisi is selected at full-back, John Leota comes into inside centre and Tusiata Pisi starts at fly-half, while a new-look forward line includes Jack Lam, Kane Thompson and Ti'i Paulo.

"For years, ramblers had treasured the wildflower meadows as the perfect spot for a walk. The 29-acre site was also popular with joggers, dog walkers and schools’ nature studies lessons. But now the idyll has been shattered after the new landowner put up a 6ft-high 300ft-long spiked steel fence enclosing the footpath to keep walkers – and dogs – off his land. The owner of a meadow in Frome, Somerset, erected this 300ft-long fence around a pathway after wildlife campaigners asked him to keep the unofficial walkway clear . Before the fence was erected, campaigners attempted to block Mr Brunt's purchase of the land amid fears development of the area would damage the landscape . Campaigners had tried to block haulage boss Alan Brunt’s attempt to buy Rodden Lake Stream Meadows in Frome, Somerset, amid fears that development would damage the landscape. But after successfully buying the land for £210,000, Mr Brunt has put up the fence which locals say makes walkers feel like they are in a top security prison. Ecologist Sue Everett said: ‘Anyone thinking they will enjoy a nice country walk along the public footpath is now hemmed in by a horrific steel palisade fence.’ Ruth Knaggs, a member of the action . group, said: 'We went to Mr Brunt to ask him if maybe there was . something we could do to still access the field but he refused. 'The path is used as a nice green walking route, that’s all we wanted. 'He said he wanted to use it for hay growing and obviously dogs mess is not good for that at all. 'We did suggest that we could campaign for awareness to stop people doing that but he just wasn’t having it. But Mr Brunt bought the land after Mendip District Council rejected a bid to protect the area by action group Save Open Spaces. The group attempted to register the land as a community asset, which also failed . 'He put a fence in at the cut through to town before Christmas, that was the first stand he took.' The community projects manager at Frome Town Council added: 'Now he’s put a fence around the only footpath we are allowed to use. 'It is the sort of fence you put around some kind of industrial site that you are worried about vandals attacking. 'It is completely over the top, it is really shocking.' When the fields were put up for sale last September following the death of the owner, some residents began a campaign to raise funds to buy and preserve the land. They tried to block the sale by registering the site as a community asset. After the group approached Mr Brunt asking for him to keep the walkway clear, he erected the fence - insisting walkers stick to the designated path . When they approached Mr Brunt, who is also a farmer, to keep a well-used unofficial short cut across the field towards the town centre, he refused. Mrs Knaggs said he fenced off the short cut before turning his attention to the official footpath. Yesterday Mr Brunt, 64, said he had built the fence to protect his livestock from the risk of disease posed by dog mess – and to protect dogs and walkers from his cattle. Councillor Pippa Goldfinger today said the new fencing would not look out of place 'in a high security prison' He said: 'What other option did I have? If I'd have used a barbed wire fence people would have complained that their dogs and children were getting caught and the cattle wouldn't have liked it much either. 'Yes it probably doesn't look that nice at the moment but it will dim down over time. I had to put it there for agricultural purposes, that was all I was doing. 'The dogs mess was ridiculous and it had to be controlled otherwise it would have harmed my cattle. 'The dog mess creates germs which get into cattle and abort the calves, I don't want that happening. 'I need to get the land clean for six months at least before the disease goes out the land and before I can graze cattle so it needs to happen sooner rather than later. 'I went to the footpath people and asked if I could put a fence up and they said it was my right so, so I did. 'I did it so it is safe for both parties, people can walk through safely, dogs can walk through next to the cattle safely, I've seen lots of instances where cattle have chased dogs. 'It's avoiding injury, it's health and safety.' He built the 6ft fence because barbed wire would have been a danger. ‘It probably doesn’t look that nice at the moment but it will dim down over time,’ he added. One neighbour, Brian Dredge, 72, welcomed the fence. The community projects manager at Frome Town Council said of the fence: 'It is completely over the top, it is really shocking' ‘We were getting three dog-walking agencies parking on our road so they could use the field,’ he said. ‘From about 6am there were about 15 to 20 cars a day with barking dogs, slamming doors and shouting to each other. ‘And the dog mess was unbelievable. Sometimes it would be so bad we couldn’t even sit in the garden because of the smell.’ But one local said Mr Brunt was a saint for putting up the fence - as noisy dog walkers were making his life hell by letting their animals mess around his home . 'Mr Brunt is in my opinion a saint, and I speak for everyone who lives on the road. 'Since the fence has gone up we haven't had any cars parking on the street, the volume of people have gone from our road, the dogs mess has gone, the noise at 6am has gone. 'It's great. Everyone you speak to now is like, ""it's quiet isn't it?"" 'All the people complaining about the beautiful meadow being ruined are wrong, in my opinion it was not beautiful at all, it was a nasty, smelly dogs park.' Mr Dredge added that Mr Brunt had left wire up for a small section of the foothpath but within days the wire was broken so people could get into the field once more.","Alan Brunt bought picturesque meadow in Frome, Somerset for £210,000 .

"Refusal: Tim Bannister, 35, had offered to carry a tray of drinks at a waterside restaurant to help out a busy waitress . A customer was stunned to be told that he was not allowed to carry a tray of soft drinks in a restaurant because he needed special training. Tim Bannister, 35, had offered to carry a tray of drinks at a waterside restaurant called Nautical Nellies in Southampton to help out a busy waitress. But he was told he could not carry them because of 'health and safety'. Mr Bannister, a technical adviser at chemicals firm AkzoNobel, told The Sun: 'It was embarrassing but also laughable. The incident happened in November when Mr Bannister was dining with friends at the restaurant. He offered to carry the four drinks a few yards to the table because it was busy. But when his offer was turned down, he was so incensed that he contacted  the Health and Safety Executive.

"Horseracing Authority have suffered more embarrassment with the admission four of the 12 starts at Wetherby have been wrong for the past five years. The problem, which came to light following the recent bet365 Charlie Hall Chase meeting, comes hard on the heels of the blunder which allowed The Young Master to win last Saturday’s Badger Ales Trophy despite the sevenlength winner being ineligible. The BHA disqualified The Young Master on Thursday and fined trainer Neil Mulholland £250 under Rule (C) 37 which states it is a trainer’s responsibility that a horse is eligible. Champagne Fever (middle) after winning the William Hill Supreme Novices' Hurdle in 2013 . Trainer Willie Mullins will be aiming for Boxing Day success for Champagne Fever at the William Hill King George at Kempton . However, the sport’s ruling body have accepted the blame for the accuracy of Wetherby distances which were first called into question by Timeform following racing on November 1. The north Yorkshire venue was re-measured on Monday and the 3m 1f chase distance, used for the Charlie Hall, was 78 yards short of the minimum 3m 166yds required for a jumps race to be officially classified as three miles about one furlong. Neil Mulholland was fined £250 after his horse The Young Master was deemed ineligible to compete in the Badger Ales Trophy last Saturday . Among the others to be found incorrect were the 3m 1f hurdle of the West Yorkshire Hurdle, won in style by Cole Harden a fortnight ago, while the 1m 5f bumper course will become 1m 4½f and the 2m 4f hurdle track will change to 2m 4½f. Trainer Willie Mullins will target the William Hill King George at Kempton on Boxing Day with Champagne Fever after watching the classy grey make all to win the Clonmel Oil Chase. Mullins said: ‘We will look at the John Durkan next and he could run in the King George. He is entitled to go there. A flat righthanded track will suit and I expect his jumping to improve.’","The Young Master won last Saturday's Badger Ales Trophy despite being ineligible to compete .

"Anthony Joshua has warned his heavyweight rivals to concentrate on their own careers rather than cling to his coat tails. The Olympic champion has won his first nine professional fights by knockout and faces veteran Michael Sprott in Liverpool on Saturday. And the 25 year old urged the likes of Eddie Chambers, Tyson Fury and David Price to plot their own route to the top. Anthony Joshua (left) raises his fist with opponent Michael Sprott ahead of their fight on Saturday night . Joshua has won his first nine professional fights, and is pictured (right) in action against Hrvoije Kisicek . ‘Chambers, since he fought the other week, has gone silent,’ Joshua said. ‘His performance didn’t live up to what he spoke about. ‘Tyson should concentrate on his fight on November 29 and Price should concentrate on his fight on December 6. ‘They should concentrate on getting titles so they have something to lose by the time I’m at their heels. ‘As for me it’s one step at a time, this is my tenth fight.’ Joshua has yet to hear the bell for the start of the fourth round but expects a tough test against 39-year-old Sprott. Joshua poses for the cameras during a public work-out in London last month . Joshua lands a blow on Denis Bakhtov during their bout at the O2 Arena on October 11 . ‘You can never look past anyone, especially at heavyweight,’ he added. ‘I’ve watched videos of some of his fights, he’s experienced and he was a contender. ‘He’s mixed it at a high level with the likes of Kubrat Pulev who fought Wladimir Klitschko the other night. ‘I’m sure he’s training hard. I can’t say I’ve had the greatest camp ever or the worst camp, I’ve just been ticking over because I haven’t left the gym. ‘I’m feeling confident because being active, not only am I getting rounds under my belt, but I’ve experienced the pressure and the spotlight.’ Liverpool’s Echo Arena has witnessed its fair share of heavyweight shocks after Price twice lost to Tony Thompson last year. The 25-year-old is also an Olympic champion, having won gold at London 2012 . Joshua celebrates his win when he fought on the undercard of Carl Froch vs George Groves at Wembley . And Sprott insists he can derail the Joshua hype train. ‘I’ve boxed a lot of big men and I always do better with big men than ones my own size,’ he said. ‘This is my 55th professional fight and I’ve been fighting for 20 years so there’s nothing he can show me. I’ve been in with some good opponents, I’ve been stopped, I’ve been knocked out. ‘I don’t turn anyone down and it’s a great opportunity. I beat him and a lot of doors open. ‘He’s done well, they’re bringing him on slowly But look what happened to David Price. ‘He’s a world-class puncher but they got carried away and put him in with Tony Thompson. I said that was a big mistake and I was right. ‘They’ve got to be careful who they put him [Joshua] in with and shouldn’t get carried away. ‘When I take fights I feel I can cause an upset.’","Anthony Joshua faces Michael Sprott in Liverpool on Saturday .

"Robbie Henshaw will have his first tangible crack at Ireland's vacant 13 shirt on Saturday after being paired alongside Gordon D'Arcy in midfield to face Australia. The post-Brian O'Driscoll era remains yet to launch at full-tilt however, as boss Joe Schmidt still cannot select from midfield strength. So with Jared Payne sidelined through foot trouble, the wait to decipher head coach Schmidt's first-choice centre pairing goes on. Robbie Henshaw (pictured) will start alongside Gordon D'Arcy for Ireland against Australia on Saturday . Mike Ross and Simon Zebo are the only two starters retained from last weekend's 49-7 victory over Georgia, with Ireland back to full strength to face Michael Cheika's Wallabies. Fit-again hooker Rory Best returns to the front-row, while Rhys Ruddock returns at flanker given Chris Henry could be recuperating from his brain injury for some time. Leinster stalwart D'Arcy missed the autumn's opening clash against the Springboks with calf trouble, with Ulster's Payne limping out of that 29-15 victory in the closing stages. The net result of the various midfield injuries and chopping and changing for the visit of Georgia mean the jury could still be out on Ireland's first-choice centre pairing. Connacht battering ram Henshaw slotted into 12 against South Africa, but now has his chance in his more natural outside-centre berth. Henshaw will get a chance in his natural position after starting at 12 against South Africa . Ireland boss Schmidt can keep his cards close to his chest until the Six Nations then, on just who will be anointed as the now-retired O'Driscoll's long-term successor. Henshaw produced a gritty defensive display in his first cap on Irish soil against the Springboks, leaving Schmidt to ask for more of the same against Australia. 'I don't know if you can ask too much more of Robbie,' said Schmidt. 'I thought he delivered a really solid performance against South Africa. 'It was very seamless, him moving into 12. 'At 13 there will be some different challenges: Israel Folau will be coming into that area, there will be some traffic for Johnny (Jonathan Sexton), Gordon and Robbie to cope with. Ireland head coach Joe Schmidt was impressed with Henshaw's performance against South Africa . 'Robbie must also link with the wingers and that will be another challenge for him. 'Robbie and Gordon spent a bit of time together when D'Arcy got back fully fit. 'They've had a little bit of time together, they've enjoyed two training sessions together this week, that's pretty much all we've had time to do. 'I'm just hoping they can feed off each other, connect and link really well, and make sure there's no space for some of those big Australian runners to come through. 'If they do that really well they'll have had a pretty good day at the office.' Ireland star Jonathan Sexton plays a pass during his country's training session in Kildare . Former Leinster boss Schmidt has warned Ireland they must fight for the right foundations before trying to launch their offloading game. 'I hope we get more ball than against South Africa: when you are struggling to win the ball and win collisions it's hard to get the offloading game going,' said Schmidt. 'Offloading only works when you're going forward. 'We've seen Robbie and Gordon get good balls away through the contact, so if that's something we can manufacture, get that front foot ball, then I'd be delighted if that allowed them to open up the game a little bit.'","Robbie Henshaw will start alongside Gordon D'Arcy against Australia .

"QPR owner Tony Fernandes  said moving to a bigger stadium is vital for QPR to sustain top-flight football . QPR owner Tony Fernandes has stressed the need to move away from their Loftus Road home if the west London club are to continue to thrive in the Barclays Premier League. However the club look set for a drawn-out legal planning process, with motor dealership Car Giant also determined to redevelop the site QPR have proposed for a new football stadium. Loftus Road has been the club's base for over a century, but the stadium holds just 18,439 spectators, currently the lowest capacity in the English top flight. Fernandes believes relocating to a new 40,000 seat, multi-purpose stadium approximately three miles away at Old Oak Common would allow the club to fully develop its potential and presents the 'only realistic place for us to move.' According to QPR, the project, which is in its first stage of consultation, would also create 24,000 homes, 55,000 jobs and community facilities as part of a regeneration of the area, which the club says is, at present, a 'patch of unsightly and under-used land'. However, car dealership Car Giant also has its own plans for redevelopment of an area which has been earmarked for a new Crossrail and HS2 'superstation' hub. The car dealership already owns the majority of land, some 47 acres, on Old Oak Common where it has been established for more than 30 years and is a major employer with some 700 jobs. Negotiations between the two groups have hit an impasse, although the Greater London Authority remains hopeful an amicable agreement over the future of the site can eventually be reached. Car Giant intends to commence a public consultation on its 'Old Oak Park' regeneration proposal for early in the new year, with a planning application supporting the Mayor of London's proposal to build a total of 24,000 new homes set for autumn 2015. QPR, though, remain totally committed to their own relocation proposals. The club look set for a drawn-out legal process, with car dealership Car Giant vying for the same site . Fernandes said: 'We need to move on from Loftus Road if we are to sustain a top-flight football club and Old Oak Common is the only realistic place for us to move. '(It is) close to our fans and our roots, with great transport links, and the opportunity to be at the heart of the most exciting new development in west London for years.' The club have conducted their own research into the project which involved a six-day public exhibition, meetings with local groups, 50,000 newsletters and a project website. QPR say their findings have been favourable, with 88 per cent supporting Old Oak as the location for the Hoops' new stadium. Loftus Road has a capacity of less than 19,000 and Fernandes want to move to 40,000 seater stadium . 'We are delighted that so many of our fans and members of the local community share our vision for the future of both QPR and Old Oak,' Fernandes added. 'This is only the first stage of consultation and we will continue to work with the community as we develop our plans in more detail. 'Old Oak is the biggest regeneration since the Olympics and we have a responsibility to future generations to get it right. 'We need a comprehensive planned approach with a stadium as its beating heart, led by a football club with a stronger interest in the local community than any other kind of business.' The managing director of Car Giant, Tony Mendes, meanwhile, believes his company's own proposals are best suited to the site. Martin Demichelis scores an own goal as QPR hold Manchester City to a 2-2 draw at Loftus Road . The QPR owner was to build a new stadium at Old Oak Common, three miles from the club's current home .

'We are making good progress and our public consultation will begin soon asking for community input to assure the regeneration can bring what the residents would like within this exciting new development. 'Our design plans will be based around quality and sustainable open spaces and buildings, and will include an upgrade of the rundown Grand Union Canal.

"Kevin Phillips scored 130 times for Sunderland – but says even he would struggle for goals in Gus Poyet’s side. The Leicester City coach remains the only Englishman to win the European Golden Boot following his 30 Premier League goals in red and white in 2000. Phillips takes on his old club this weekend – a match he admits is a meeting of relegation rivals – but says he has sympathy with the likes of Steven Fletcher and Connor Wickham. Kevin Phillips scored 130 times for Sunderland but says  he would struggle for goals in Gus Poyet’s side . The Black Cats haven't found the net nearly enough this season and are struggling at the foot of the table . Black Cats boss Poyet is one of a number of top-flight coaches who prefer to deploy a lone striker - his side, however, have failed to score in five of 11 league games this season. Phillips, meanwhile, had Niall Quinn as a foil during his time at the Stadium of Light and told Sportsmail he would not enjoy operating by himself in the current team. ‘Sunderland are no different to a lot of teams in using the system but it would have been interesting to see how I might have fared in it,’ said the 41-year-old, who is now one of Nigel Pearson’s trusted lieutenants at the King Power Stadium. ‘I’ve always backed myself to score goals but I’m glad that so much of my career was spent as one of a pair of strikers. ‘I did play one up front towards the end of my time at Sunderland but I don’t think it was a system which suited us at the time and I didn’t really enjoy it.’ Phillips helped Sunderland to successive seventh-placed finishes under Peter Reid at the turn of the Millennium and won eight England caps during that period. Phillips was the epitome of a fox in the box while playing at the Stadium of Light . His partnership with Quinn remains one of the last examples of a devastating duo in the Premier League era, and he added: ‘They were fantastic times for the club and we seemed to score for fun, but I had big Niall alongside me and I think almost every striker prefers to play in a two up front. ‘He created a lot of chances for me, took a lot of the pressure off me and that was one of the secrets to our success.’ Leicester, for the large part, have played two up front this season with Leonardo Ulloa supported by either Jamie Vardy or David Nugent. But Phillips accepts they are in the minority. ‘It (one up front) is the modern way,’ he said. ‘But it requires a specialist striker to really make it work. ‘And the key to it is that your midfield has got to be very effective at attacking and getting forward to support the frontman.’ Leicester, meanwhile, have lost their last four and have slipped into the bottom three, which is where Sunderland resided until the win at Crystal Palace earlier this month. And Phillips reflected: ‘We haven’t done badly so far but the key to us staying up is doing well against the teams in and around us - and Sunderland come into that category.’","Leicester coach scored 130 times for former club Sunderland .

"Ashley Williams believes Swansea are thriving with a flexible, grittier style after admitting their sleek passing game was found out last season. Garry Monk’s side are up to fifth in the table after fighting their way to a stunning 2-1 win over Arsenal on Sunday. In collecting five bookings they also showed a more rough and ready side than has been the norm in three attractive Premier League seasons - a performance which followed comments that came across as criticism from Roberto Martinez a week earlier when he lamented Swansea’s approach in the 0-0 draw at Everton. Captain Ashley Williams salutes the Swansea City fans after Sunday's 2-1 victory over Arsenal . Williams receives treatment on the pitch after picking up an injury during the win . But far from being concerned, Williams says the changes are born out of necessity and have been vindicated by the superb results in Garry Monk’s first campaign as permanent manager. Williams said: ‘I think the gaffer’s plan has been to work on the defensive side for a period until he felt we got it and now are starting on the attacking side. ‘The Everton game was one where everyone understood their role. We did what we needed to do to get that point. Probably we made a conscious effort (this season) that instead of people saying, “This is Swansea, same old Swansea”, because people definitely figured out how to play against us, we tried to change it up a bit. Garry Monk's Swansea side are sitting fifth in Premier League after 11 games . ‘The next step is to beat the top teams. We have done really well this season. We really feel this is a season where we can make a mark and have a successful season.’ Williams added: ‘I don’t want to put a target on what we can do. We just want a good season. I’m 30, I don’t want to waste one. Last season felt like we wasted one. I loved the Europa League and I always remember it. But apart from that we were trying to stay up. That’s not what we are used to here. It is not what the club is about. ‘We have been here a number of years, we feel we have the quality and work ethic to be in the top half at least.’ Williams says Swansea are determined to avoid another relegation battle this season .","Swansea City fifth in Premier League after 2-1 win over Arsenal on Sunday .

"Victor Anichebe has warned West Brom team-mate Saido Berahino to ignore the hype surrounding his stellar season. Berahino could make his England debut in their friendly with Scotland at Celtic Park on Tuesday but Anichebe believes his fellow Hawthorns striker could be quickly shot down if his performance levels drop. Anichebe burst onto the scene at Everton in 2006, scoring his first Toffees goal against the Baggies in his third game, and knows the scrutiny young stars come under. West Brom striker Saido Berahino could make his senior England debut against Scotland on Tuesday . Victor Anichebe (centre) believes Berahino must ignore the hype around his performances this season . He said: 'I told him about that. I came through with James Vaughan, who was a big deal, as it always is when a young guy comes through. 'It is very difficult and you can get caught up in the hype but as long as you have good people around you then you should be okay. 'As much as they're building him up now, if he starts playing badly people will bring him down again. 'As soon as you don't have the level of performances you should have you will find it difficult, but he's a good kid and is positive and really believes in himself so I'm sure he'll continue to fulfil his potential. 'I always sing his praises because he's a quality player and he will be a quality player for years to come if he can keep his head right. Berahino, pictured in action against Newcastle, has already bagged eight goals for West Brom this season . 'He is young and there is a lot of pressure and expectation on him right now, but as long as he can keep doing exactly what he's been doing, not listen too much to the media and things on the outside and keep his feet on the ground, he will be fine.' Berahino has eight goals this season and is the top-scoring Englishman in the Barclays Premier League. He has helped the England Under-21s reach next year's European Championships and Anichebe believes the 21-year-old, who was an unused substitute in Saturday's 3-1 Euro 2016 qualifying win over Slovenia, will revel in being with the senior side. 'I think anyone would enjoy playing with the quality of players England have,' said the 26-year-old. Berahino, pictured with Danny Welbeck (right), is the top-scoring Englishman in the top-flight this season . 'They have a lot of quality players and Saido has only just had his first call-up, so we need to take it easy. 'Just the fact he's been called up is an achievement in itself. 'It's a great achievement for the club and for Saido and his family. 'We're just happy he's involved. If he plays I'm sure he'll do well and the media and everyone else just need to keep him grounded.'","Saido Berahino could make his senior England debut against Scotland .

"MATT LAWTON: Malky Mackay and Iain Moody investigated by FA over 'sexist, racist and homophobic' text messages during time at Cardiff . Everton manager Roberto Martinez believes Malky Mackay deserves the chance to atone for his errors after being appointed as Wigan boss. Mackay, who is the subject of an ongoing Football Association investigation into racist, sexist and homophobic text messages sent during his time at Cardiff, was installed as new Latics boss on Wednesday. The Scot is the third manager to take the reins at the DW Stadium since Martinez left for Everton after overseeing the club's stunning FA Cup success in 2013. Former Wigan boss Roberto Martinez wished Malky Mackay the very best of luck in his new role . Martinez, who spent four seasons with the Latics, said: 'If there is an investigation, until it is concluded, whatever the talk is, it is unnecessary. 'We all make mistakes and the opportunity now is for Wigan to get back into trying to win football games. 'Malky Mackay has a really good record on getting teams out of the Championship and finding success very quickly and I wish them the very best of luck.' Mackay's appointment by the Sky Bet Championship strugglers has caused controversy with former Wigan striker and now anti-racism campaigner Jason Roberts among the most vocal critics. Mackay, pictured with Dave Whelan, was appointed the new manager of Wigan Athletic on Wednesday . 'I would ask people to judge me when they see me. I've apologised for my mistakes I've studied diversity and that's something that's ongoing. 'It has been a difficult period and I have made mistakes. I hope that in my time at Wigan, the people of Wigan and the supporters see who I am and see that I'm someone that desperately wants the club to do well.' Wigan MP Lisa Nandy also wrote to club chairman Dave Whelan last week urging him not to appoint Mackay when it became apparent the 42-year-old was in contention. Mackay has expressed remorse for his actions, which Sportsmail brought to light in August and cost him the chance of taking over at Crystal Place, and promised to cooperate with the FA's probe. West Ham manager Sam Allardyce has no issues with the appointment. The Scotsman took charge of his first training session on Thursday morning . Mackay keeps a close eye on training as he takes charge of first session since his appointment . Allardyce said: 'It's all around Dave Whelan and him speaking with Malky Mackay and thinking that he is the man for the job - full stop. 'If Dave Whelan thinks that he is the man given his track record as a football manager, then I don't see there should be a problem with that.' Cardiff have not commented since Mackay's appointment by Wigan and do not intend to while he remains the subject of an investigation. Current manager Russell Slade stuck to that line when asked about the matter at his latest press conference. Slade said: 'The club are making no comment on that in view of the investigations that are ongoing. That's our take on that matter at the minute and I really don't want to make any comment on it. 'I knew I would get asked the question, of course I understand that. But it's not the club's business anyway, other than there are ongoing investigations.' Cardiff are due to visit Wigan in the Championship on February 24. 'I will do things professionally, as I always do,' Slade said. 'Fkn chinkys. Fk it.

"Roberto Di Matteo faces his first real test at home since becoming Schalke coach this weekend when the Royal Blues host second-placed Wolfsburg this Saturday. The Italian has so far won all three of his games at home, but his side's form has been quite the opposite away from the Arena AufSchalke with three defeats out of three. As a result, the Gelsenkirchen club remain three points behind the top six and five off the top four and a place in the Champions League next season, while they trail Wolfsburg by nine points. Roberto Di Matteo has won all three of his home games since taking over as manager of Schalke . Di Matteo led Chelsea to their first ever Champions League victory when he was interim manager in 2012 . Di Matteo celebrates with his Chelsea players as they won the 2012 FA Cup final against Liverpool . 'I don't know if there's a favourite for this game, but for sure we're the home team and we've got to take the initiative,' said Di Matteo, who insists he is 'totally focused' on Saturday's game and not the reunion with former club Chelsea in the Champions League next week. 'The Arena AufSchalke has an amazing atmosphere and I'm positively surprised by practically everything, although I would have preferred a few more points.' Defeat would leave Schalke in no better state than they were when Di Matteo took charge, although he appealed back then for patience. He has renewed that appeal, saying he needs time to get the side playing how he wants them to be and he can only see himself getting that time during the winter break. 'Hopefully then we will have most of our long-term injured players back,' he added. By then, the state of the affairs in the Bundesliga will be a lot clearer too with the sight of Schalke and Borussia Dortmund in the bottom half of the table something of an anomaly.

Gladbach, meanwhile, will be desperate to bounce back from that, their very first defeat of the season in all competitions, when they play host to Thomas Schaaf's Eintracht Frankfurt. A seven-point deficit has already grown on league leaders Bayern Munich, who host faltering Hoffenheim, while the gap to sixth-placed Bayer Leverkusen has been cut to just three points with Roger Schmidt's men in action at Hannover this Saturday. The focus shifts to the bottom of the table on Sunday when Hamburg and Werder Bremen meet in a northern Germany derby with both sides currently residing inside the bottom three before bottom-placed Stuttgart host Augsburg.

The Welshman won a tight majority decision victory in 2011 and will return to the Echo Arena on either November 22 or 29. And this time, Cleverly wants to leave no doubt with a concussive victory.

"Malky Mackay has been appointed as Wigan Athletic's new manager, despite currently being the subject of an FA investigation into racist, sexist, homophobic and anti-Semitic texts exchanged with his former head of recruitment while at Cardiff City - as exclusively revealed by Sportsmail. Latics chairman Dave Whelan admits Mackay has done a 'little wrong' but is adamant he will be good for Wigan going forward, while Mackay says he has 'studied diversity' and has learned from his mistakes. Here, Sportsmail takes you through the transcript of Mackay's first press conference as Latics boss, starting with Whelan's comments and moving on to the new Wigan manager's quotes. Wigan Athletic chairman Whelan said he believes Mackay is 'the man to lead us back to the Premier League' DAVE WHELAN, WIGAN ATHLETIC CHAIRMAN . 'All the fans in Wigan, they all have total trust in me. Because I have one thing in my heart, that is Wigan Athletic. So they have trust in me and I would say to them all, you can trust me on this one. 'I have investigated every single aspect I can, I think Malky has been so unlucky. He has done a little bit wrong and has apologised for it. 'But to all fans, I want them to trust me. This gentleman is in my opinion exactly the man we are looking for. 'It is awful when you have to sack a manager, I had a terrible week last week, it hurt me a lot because he (Rosler) is such a nice guy. 'Football is a cruel game, I am sure Malky has found the little thing he did wrong, he has had plenty of stick for it. 'Appointing new managers is not something I enjoy. The last manager had some really good qualities, I rate him. But when Malky applied, he has got a repuation of being a first-class players. Amongst others who applied, they were good lads. 'When I met Malky, it's football, you ask the same questions, you get certain answers. But he came and he was so honest and up front with every question I asked him. And I did ask him questions about the problems he's had on the racist thing. 'Everybody in football knows I am totally and utterly against racism of any description, I have friends all over the world and I have a very good approach to football. For me, football is everything in the world. 'When Malky applied, I interviewed him, impressed with his answers, how he wants the football club to be run. I think he is going to be a brilliant manager for Wigan Athletic. 'While we are a small club, we are still Wigan Athletic. We are from the old fourth division, we have won the cup, we are and always be one, happy club. That will remain . 'Malky was absolutely up front (about the texts). He told me the absolute truth, I totally and utterly believed what he said. The first thing he did was to say I did this wrong. We have all done things wrong in our lives. It's not like we are all saints. 'He impressed me immediately because he was so open about it. He apologised for anything he did he knows was wrong. What he did was absolutely private and it was put out in public. He was so honest about it. I took it all on board, accepted it and he deserves another chance to do what he does so well. 'The ongoing investigation, we have spoken to The FA, I don't there is anything in the pipeline. I don't think there is anything really to investigate but that is in the contract, we have to protect the football club. Malky has been warned, he has been open about it all. 'He admits what he did and apologised for what he said. I accept that fully and totally. So I just want to get on with the great game.' Malky Mackay (above) has been named as the new Wigan Athletic manager and says he has 'studied diversity' MALKY MACKAY, NEW WIGAN ATHLETIC MANAGER . 'I would ask people to judge me when they see me. I've apologised for my mistakes I've studied diversity and that's something that's ongoing. 'It has been a difficult period and I have made mistakes. I hope that in my time at Wigan, the people of Wigan and the supporters see who I am and see that I'm someone that desperately wants the club to do well. 'I am very proud the chairman has given me the opportunity of managing this club. I can see the pride and passion he has. I want success as a football manager. 'I am very proud the chairman has given me the opportunity of managing this club. I can see the pride and passion he has. I want success as a football manager. 'I have been without a club for 11 months. It has been tough for me and my family at times. My life is around football and I am very passionate about the game. I was fortunate enough to be at the FA Cup final, it was my boy's Callum first FA Cup final, I took him to Wigan and Manchester City. 'I have been in football for 18 years, I have never had an issue with one of them (players). My door is open, I am close to the players day to day and every one of them will be able to come and chat with me. I have a close knit group period in terms of my last five years track record. 'I made mistakes and I am absolutely not racist. I am taking on an educational programme and that is ongoing. I have apologised for the mistakes.

"Arsenal legend Ray Parlour is adamant that Premier League referees must be more willing to give penalties when there is an excessive amount of pushing and shoving in the box. Although Parlour believes that football is a contact sport and therefore coming togethers are inevitable, he does not believe officials are being stringent enough with penalising offenders who overstep the mark. The 41-year-old former England midfielder is just the latest high-profile sportsman to show support for Sportsmail's Hands Off In The Box campaign. Ray Parlour shows his support to Sportmail's Hands Off In The Box campaign at the World Trade Market event in association with Europcar on Monday . A member of Arsenal's 'Invincibles' side who went the whole season unbeaten in 2003-04 on the way to the Premier League title, Parlour knows what it takes to win tight football matches but he believes players such as Stoke City's Ryan Shawcross have overstepped the mark. Parlour, who was helping to launch Europcar's new Golf Buggy Travel Service at the World Travel Market, told Sportsmail: 'It's a contact sport and really you've got to be tight to your man when defending in the box but sometimes it can go too far. You're told in training don't let him score – it's as simple as that. 'I think the referee has got to go into the dressing room before the game and say: 'Look, I'm expecting contact but as soon as that ball's kicked I'll be looking around and seeing who's holding who'. Then if people do hold each other that should be a penalty. 'We saw Shawcross give one away and he's not the only one but he's done it before.' Stoke's Ryan Shawcross (right) conceded a penalty for this grapple with Swansea's Wilfried Bony last week . However, Parlour believes football must remain a contact sport and that officials need to be careful with how they do decide to punish offenders. Join Sportsmail's Hands Off In The Box campaign by parading the logo at matches... you could also win an England shirt signed by Jamie Redknapp, Jamie Carragher and Martin Keown by tweeting your support . Parlour - who won three Premier League titles, four FA Cups, a League Cup and European Cup Winners' Cup during his time at Arsenal - believes the majority of those successes were built on a strong defensive unit, and that sometimes they got away with using the dark arts to prevent goals. He continued: 'It is a contact sport though so we have to be careful not to remove all of that. 'If you say that you can't touch someone at a corner, he's going to run straight across you, you don't know when he's going to run and then he's going to get ahead of you. As a defender you're taught to be tight and don't let them move. 'But it's when they're holding someone back with the obvious ones that they've got to clamp down on.'

"As Sportsmail continues it's 'HANDS OFF IN THE BOX' campaign in an attempt to rid the game of grappling defenders and shirt-pulling in the area, we highlight Tuesday night's offenders in which there were incidents in both the Champions League and the Championship. ARSENAL 3-3 ANDERLECHT . Nacho Monreal was punished for pulling in the box, the offence that prompted Sportsmail’s campaign after grappling excesses in the Premier League. The Spanish defender hauled down substitute Aleksandar Mitrovic and French referee Clement Turpin awarded the penalty to put life into Anderlecht. Former Portsmouth man Anthony Vanden Borre duly converted from the spot. ............................................................................. LEEDS 2-2 CHARLTON . At a time when officials are looking out for shirt-pulling following the Mail's 'Hands off in the Box campaign' Leeds United became the latest club to pay for grappling in the penalty area when Guiseppe Bellusci foolishly conceded a crucial late spot-kick at Elland Road. Bellusci grabbed Charlton defender Tal Ben Haim and pulled him to the floor to stop him reaching a Johnnie Jackson corner. And when his indiscretion was spotted by referee Graham Salisbury, Johann Gudmundsson scored an 81st minute equaliser from the resulting penalty.

"Pick Jack Wilshere and Co for a dash at European U21 glory next summer . Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain says he would welcome a place in the England Under 21 squad for next summer’s European Championship. There has been much debate over whether full internationals such as Oxlade-Chamberlain, Arsenal team-mates Jack Wilshere and Calum Chambers, Manchester United’s Luke Shaw, Everton’s Ross Barkley and Liverpool’s Raheem Sterling should ‘drop down’ to Gareth Southgate’s team. The Young Lions booked their place at the finals following a 4-2 aggregate victory over Croatia in a play-off this week and it immediately triggered talk of taking several senior stars to the Czech Republic in June. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain said he would play in the European Under 21 Championship if selected . England's U21 side qualified for next year's tournament in the Czech Republic by beating Croatia in a play-off . Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger is against players reverting to the Under 21s but Oxlade-Chamberlain insists he would not turn down a call-up. ‘Yes (I’d play at the Euros if I was asked), you’d never turn your nose up at something like that,’ said the 21-year-old, who has 18 England caps. ‘But there’s a lot that goes into that because the national team have two games around the same time as the tournament. So it’s up to Roy Hodgson to decide what he wants. ‘There’s a lot of players in the England squad at the moment that could drop back down and play for the Under 21s so it’s up to the manager to decide. Oxlade-Chamberlain (left) and Raheem Sterling are among the England players who are eligible for the U21s . The Arsenal forward has played 18 times for England already at the age of just 21 . ‘When that time comes around I’ll have to think about it. Gareth (Southgate, England U21 manager) might not even want me. It’s a discussion that will be had closer to the time with the England manager, someone at Arsenal and Gareth Southgate.’ And Oxlade-Chamberlain, speaking on the Clare Balding Show on BT Sport, added: ‘It’s a good thing that people aren’t being held back to play in the senior side if the manager thinks they’re ready. At the same time I do think we take our Under 21s seriously.’ Wenger, though, believes graduation to the senior ranks means a player should stay there. ‘Once a guy has moved up to the full national team, it's never good to move him down to the Under 21s,’ he said. The line-up in red is the one that beat Croatia in the play-off, but the blue team is what England could field .

"Daniel Sturridge has been ruled out until the new year after sustaining yet another injury setback in training on Tuesday. The England international is expected to miss Liverpool's next 12 matches - leaving Brendan Rodgers short of forward options.Mario Balotelli, Fabio Borini and Rickie Lambert are yet to hit the back of the net in the Premier League so far this season while Rodgers will have to pay a hefty fee if he wants to recall Divock Origi from Lille. We asked live4Liverpool fansite's David Tyrer about Sturridge's latest injury. Another international break, another Daniel Sturridge injury. It's all getting very predictable now, only Brendan Rodgers can't blame Roy Hodgson for this one. As England made easy work of beating the Auld Enemy all Liverpool fans could do was despair, as the saviour of our season had again limped out of training. Surely this couldn't be happening to us again? But while Hodgson wasn't at fault, surely somebody now has to shoulder the blame for the fact that our season's success - or failure - has hinged for so long on the fitness of a player who, historically, has often missed as many games as he's played in a season. Daniel Sturridge is expected to miss Liverpool's next 12 games after sustaining yet another injury . Sturridge's only goal of the season came against Southampton on the opening day of the league campaign . If Daniel Sturridge is out for the next 12 matches, he will miss the following fixtures for Liverpool: . Crystal Palace (A) - November 23 . Ludogorets (A) - November 26 . Stoke (H) - November 29 . Leicester (A) - December 2 . Sunderland (H) - December 6 . Basle (H) - December 9 . Manchester United (A) - December 14 . Bournemouth (A) - December 17 . Arsenal (H) - December 21 . Burnley (A) - December 26 . Swansea (H) - December 29 . Leicester (H) - January 1 . After his form of the past two years, Sturridge has become integral to Liverpool's game plan but during that time we had the world's third best player to cover his absence and there have been a lot: 13 since January 2013. Four in his first six months, four last season, two over the summer and three thigh injuries this season. From a fan’s perspective, it's becoming more than frustrating; do the coaching/fitness staff not know how to manage him properly, are they not up to the task? Having known his injury record is extensive though means the bigger issue at this stage is why had the club not prepared suitably over the summer? Mario Balotelli hasn't done it. His Premier League goals ratio is appalling and his work rate is awful. The concern with Balotelli is that, like Joey Barton said, he's the greatest myth in football. I was against his signing initially but got caught up in the hype, I admit, but what did Mario ever do to show he can become a top class striker? On what we've seen so far, his signing goes down as one of a long list of transfer failures in the past three years. Sturridge arrives at the side entrance of Liverpool's Spire Hospital on Wednesday . Mario Balotelli (left) and Fabio Borini (right) are yet to score a Premier League goal this season . On the other hand, Rickie Lambert has been thrown to the wolves, in how he's been used, suggesting he wasn't wanted in the first place. While Fabio Borini was all but being forced to move to Sunderland. Are we to believe the club were happy to start the season with Sturridge and Balotelli as our only first team strikers? If that's the case, you've got to wonder what went on during those transfer committee meetings. Of course, it's unfair for us to simply blame Rodgers. We all know he doesn't have sole responsibility for identifying and signing players. But he is the face of the committee, as he is the club’s manager, which means when something goes wrong all eyes turn to him. My biggest concern now is that our season could be over by the time we finally get to see Sturridge in a Liverpool shirt once again. But, of course, that also means that January will be a pivotal point for the club. Summer mistakes must be rectified and we need to bring in not one, but two, top class, proven scorers. Above-average simply won't do. The question is, with only a handful of Rodgers’ signings proven to be good acquisitions, how much further will FSG be prepared to back him? Will he simply be told to make do? It's sad to say, but the next couple of months could very well define the rise or fall of Brendan Rodgers.

"England's Under 16s replicated the seniors by beating Scotland - but it wasn't enough to claim the Sky Sports Victory Shield as Wales lifted the trophy. The Young Lions entered the match at Huish Park in Yeovil knowing their slender chances of winning the competition had been ended by Wales, who beat Northern Ireland 2-0 earlier in the evening to end a 66-year wait to win the Victory Shield outright. And so coach Steve Cooper urged his players to savour the opportunity of taking on the Auld Enemy and they certainly did, with goals from Arsenal's Joe Willock and Chelsea's Martell Taylor-Crossdale earning a 2-1 win either side of Jack Thomson's equaliser for the Scots.

Wales won the Victory Shield outright for the first time in 66 years with a 2-0 win over Northern Ireland in Ballymena. West Brom striker Tyler Roberts opened the scoring with a 27th-minute header and Swansea's Liam Cullen sealed victory with 17 minutes to play. Wales have won all three of their matches in this season's competition. England had lost 1-0 to Wales and beaten Northern Ireland 1-0 earlier in the competition but will have to wait until next year to claim the famous old trophy for a 36th time. In front of a crowd of over 4,700 in Somerset, Scotland, who are coached by former Nottingham Forest midfielder Scot Gemmill, started the brighter. England goalkeeper Taye Ashby-Hammond denied Zak Rudden by diving bravely at his feet in the opening minutes and he showed good reflexes to get down and parry away Liam Burt's shot. But slightly against the run of play, England took the lead after 27 minutes. West Brom's Jonathan Leko drove forward and played it to Willock whose first touch took him past a defender's challenge before he smashed the ball into the bottom corner. Scotland drew level just five minutes into the second-half. Jack Adamson's free-kick from 20 yards out rattled the crossbar and half-time substitute Thomson gobbled up the rebound.

And Taylor-Crossdale could have extended England's lead following a quick-fire one-two with Vashon Neufville but McAdams blocked his effort from six yards out.

Footballers going into acting isn't exactly unheard of - who can forget Vinnie Jones' performance in Mean Machine? But no-one can quite compare to 'The King'. A tortured genius on the pitch, as famous for his kung-fu kick on a fan as his sublime goals for Manchester United, Cantona is the master of French suave. Since retiring from football the Manchester United legend has had a reasonably successful film career . Cantona is famous not only for his sublime skills, but also for the occasion when he kicked a fan . Since appearing alongside Cate Blanchett and Geoffrey Rush in Elizabeth in 1998, Cantona has gone on to star in English and French films, as well as some wonderful adverts for Nike and Kronenbourg. He also captained France's beach football team on the side. A true polymath. David Icke - Writer . Despite retiring from football in 1973 at the age of 21, when a knee injury cut his career short, Icke continued in sport until 1990 as cohost of the BBC's Grandstand. However, after his broadcast career was cut short following his public objections to Margaret Thatcher's poll tax, the former goalkeeper changed direction, getting in touch with his spirituality and becoming a writer. David Icke was a goalkeeper with Coventry and then Hereford before a career-ending knee injury . Icke had a long career as a sports broadcaster before moving on to more controversial jobs . A conspiracy theorist who is never one to shy away from speaking his mind in a controversial manner, his website claims he is a 'British author [who] exposes the reptilian bloodline that rules the world.' Ray Wilson - Undertaker . The oldest member of England's 1966 World Cup winning squad, Wilson is often regarded as one of the greatest full backs the country has ever produced. He played in all six games during England's World Cup winning campaign and the semi-final against Portugal marked Wilson's 50th international cap.

Wilson, one of England's greatest ever full-backs, tackles France forwrad Philippe Gondet at Wembley . His career continued until the early 1970s, but despite a brief spell in management, Wilson decided to leave the game completely, building a successful undertaker's business in Huddersfield. He retired from this career in 1997, and five years later sold his World Cup winners medal for £80,000. Jose Manuel Pinto - Musician . Plenty of footballers love their music - Petr Cech and Wayne Rooney have shown off their talent in the last few weeks alone. But former Barcelona keeper Pinto does more than the odd open-mic night that gets uploaded to youtube - Barca's long-term No 2, who goes by the stage name Wahin, is now a professional music producer, and the founder of a charity. Jose Manuel Pinto was never a first-team regular at Barca, but he was an important squad member . Pinto (back, centre) won two Champions League titles as Barcelona's back-up goalkeeper . Ve A Por Tus Suenos, or Go for your dreams, seeks to 'inspire, motivate, teach values and spread optimisim to the world through music'. With four La Liga titles, two Champions League winners medals, and two World Club Cup successes to his name, you wouldn't bet against him succeeding in music as well. Gaizka Mendieta - DJ . A decade at Valencia, where he was twice a Champions League runner up - and both times voted the competitions best midfielder - a season at Barcelona, 40 caps for Spain. And of course four seasons with Middlesbrough. Gaizka Mendieta was a genuine star of the late 1990s and early 2000s, but off the pitch he also had a secret life as a DJ. Gaizka Mendieta was a world class player in his time at Valencia, before moving to Middlesbrough . The Spanish midfielder used to DJ in secret after games while he was playing in Sapin . Sportsmail met Gaizka Mendieta last month. Read what he has to say on football, music, and life after retirement. 'If I played on Saturday I would then sneak into the club, but it was always off the record, I would wear a hat and go in disguise,' Mendieta told Sportsmail earlier this year. 'I would then DJ and no-one would know it was me. I loved it. It was an escape.’ Andriy Shevchenko - Politician . In England, Shevchenko is mostly remembered as the expensive flop who failed to live up to his reputation on the continent. But in Ukraine, the striker is a national hero. After leading Dynamo Kiev to the Champions League semi-final in 1999, Shevchenko departed for Milan where he scored 127 goals in 208 Serie A games. On the international stage he is Ukraine's leading ever goalscorer, and was offered the chance to coach the national team, but turned it down. Since retiring from football Andriy Shevchenko has tried to break into politics in his native Ukraine . Shevchenko had little success after his big-money move to Chelsea, but is a legend in his home country . The former Milan and Kiev striker is Ukraine's leading goalscorer, having netted 48 times for his country . Instead, the striker decided to turn his hand to politics, standing in the 2012 Parliamentary elections for the Ukraine - Forward! party. However, his political career, thus far at least, is more like his time at Chelsea than Milan - Shevchenko's party secured just 1.58% of the votes, and he was not elected. Thomas Gravesen - Poker player . There are countless stories of professional footballers who lose all their money after their careers, and end up have to work just to get by. Gravesen is not one of those players. The former Everton hard-man, who was a cult figure even before his surprise move to Real Madrid, has does remarkably well since retiring from football. Gravesen was known for his tough-tackling - now he has a rather more gentle lifestyle . Retired Everton midfielder Thomas Gravesen has built up a net worth of more than £80million . Gravesen has moved to Las Vegas with his partner Kamila Persse after making his fortune . The Danish ex-midfielder invested his career earnings in a number of businesses, and cashed out at just the right time. Now living in Las Vegas, with a personal fortune of over £80m, Gravesen is in a relationship with a Czech model and plays poker in his spare time. It's a hard life. Kevin Kyle - Storeman on a ship . Once a Premier League striker and a Scotland international, Kevin Kyle now works on a 'floating hotel' for workers in the oil industry in the Shetland Islands. Kyle has not officially retired but has been without a club since leaving Ayr United, and now works 12-hour shifts on the ship where he cleans floors, makes beds and replenishes stocks. Kevin Kyle played top-flight football in England and Scotland, but now works on a ship . The Stranraer-born Scot is a reformed gambler who once admitted to spending £7,000-a-week on betting. He has since given up time to warn young footballers about the dangers of gambling. At the peak of his career Kyle was earning £10,000-a-week - equating to more money per day than he is now earning each fortnight. Tomas Brolin - Ecclectic businessman and Poker player . Best remembered in this country for a stunning goal against England, and a dire three years at Leeds United, Tomas Brolin was an exceptional talent. A genuine star for Parma and Sweden in the early and mid-1990s, his career fizzled out somewhat after his move to Elland Road. Tomas Brolin celebrates his magnificent finish against England at the 1992 European Championships . After moving to England Brolin's career took a turn for the worse, and he retired at the age of 29 . But Brolin was to have renewed success after retiring at just 29 years old. After returning to Sweden, he ran several businesses, in various fields: catering, shoes, vacuum cleaner nozzles and skin care, to name a few. He owned four race horses, and even opened a restaurant. Then, in 2006, the Swede turned his attention to professional poker, and though he has never reached the same heights at the table as he did on the pitch, he has placed highly at a few big tournaments. Bixente Lizarazu - Brazilian Jiujitsu fighter . Very few men can say they have completed the World and European championship doubles. Even fewer can say they've done it across two sports. Lizarazu is one of those men. A World Cup winner with France in 1998, and European Champion two years later, the full-back was part of one of international football's most successful teams ever. Then, after retiring in 2006, the defender turned to Brazilian Jiujitsu, where he showed an incredible natural aptitude. Bixente Lizarazu kisses the World Cup trophy after France won the competition at home in 1998 . The full-back celebrates with Zinedine Zidane during a superb career at international and club level . Just eighteen months after taking up the sport, the Frenchman became blue belt European Champion in the senior lightweight division - the first competition he had entered. 'It's a beautiful experience,' says Lizarazu. 'It's one against one. You haven't got your friends behind your back to support you like in soccer.'","Former Germany goalkeeper Tim Wiese made WWE debut on Saturday .

"The cost of David Moyes' disastrous year at Manchester United became clear when the club revealed the financial repercussions of not playing European football this season. United released their financial quarterly results for the three months ending on September 30 at lunchtime on Tuesday, revealing a £9.8million drop in income due to the fact they are not participating in the Champions League or even the Europa League this season. Commercial, broadcasting and matchday revenue came to £98.5million for the same period last year. This time that figure is down 9.9 per cent to £88.7m. United's financial results lay bare the implications of David Moyes' disastrous season in charge . Ed Woodward insisted United's new sponsorship deals will still stand the club in good stead . United splashed out £60m on Angel di Maria in a bid to regain their place in the Premier League top four . United's debt is also seen to be up slightly from £361m to £362.2m although the club has been quick to point out that the last quarter has also seen them sign the largest kit manufacturer deal in sport - £750m over 10 years – amid five other sponsorship deals across the globe. United also boosted their playing squad with the signing of Daley Blind, Angel di Maria, Marcos Rojo and Radamel Falcao in the closing days of the summer transfer window. Chief executive Ed Woodward said: 'While we recognize that the 2014-15 fiscal year financial results will reflect our absence from the Champions League, we signed the largest kit sponsorship deal in the history of sport in the first quarter and, with that concluded, we are excited to focus our efforts on the meaningful growth opportunities in sponsorship, digital media and retail and merchandising.' Wayne Rooney and Co's failure to qualify for the Champions League has hit the club's revenue . Louis van Gaal is having to re-tune his playing squad after last season's failure . In the literature accompanying their results, United revealed that they expect their overall revenues for the whole financial year 2015 to be between £385m and £395m, a drop of about £40m. United finished seventh in the Barclays Premier League last season, with Moyes being sacked in April less than a year in to a six-year contract. A breakdown of the last quarter’s revenue falls show that commercial income fell £3.1m (5.2 per cent), broadcasting £2.5m (13 per cent) and matchday £4.2m (21.8 per cent). Meanwhile, net player expenditure over the three month period was £55.9m, an increase of £29.1m and indicative of the amount of rebuilding current manager Louis van Gaal is having to make to his playing squad.","Manchester United finished the Premier League season in seventh place .

"Roger Federer described it as 'good fun', his brutal demolition of Andy Murray on Thursday night in front of nearly 18,000 people at the 02 Arena. This seemed like Federer's idea of a great evening out, showing no mercy as he ended the British player's season and so nearly provided him with the embarassment of tasting tennis's dreaded 'double bagel' defeat. Four minutes after Murray had drawn riotous cheers by breaking his duck after losing the first eleven games, Federer formally went through to the semi-finals of the Barclays ATP World Finals, courtesy of a 6-0, 6-1 victory that took less than an hour. VIDEO Scroll down for Andy Murray: I'm a long way off the top but a lot can change . Andy Murray had to win in straight sets to progress but he failed to win a single game in the first set . Murray looked as bemused as the crowd as he suffered crushing defeat against Federer . Roger Federer came out firing and won the opening six games in just 24 minutes on Thursday night . By then everyone had forgotten the evening's original proposition, which was that the 27 year-old Scot needed an unlikely straight sets win to accompany the great Swiss through to the semi-finals. It had taken just 24 minutes for that to become irrelevant, and soon the question was, numbingly, more whether Murray would win a game. Britain's Wimbledon champion has not suffered a worse beating since losing as a 16 year-old to someone called Jan Masik at an obscure tournament on Gran Canaria in 2003. He put in such a valiant effort to qualify for this elite field from his post US Open standing, but might have wished he had not bothered. The abiding image will not be so much of Murray's bemusment but of Federer's relentless pursuit of his quarry, and for all his ageless brilliance it was painful to watch. At 33 he is not sated, although he claimed later to have felt 'uncomfortable' at the end. 'I was happy I didn't win the second to last game to be quite honest,' said Federer. It did not look that way – it looked like he was enjoying himself. The British No 1 could not find his range and rhythm at London's O2 Arena . Federer cruised into the last four of the ATP World Tour Finals in London . VIDEO Federer happy to spare Murray double bagel . For Murray it was chastening, this ninth and heaviest loss without reply to the three players with whom he used to make up the so-called Big Four. 'It was a tough night, and I have lost Grand Slam finals which have been very tough,' he reflected afterwards. 'He played exceptionally well, I was disdappointed with my level tonight but even if I had played better I would still have lost. 'He was extremely loose tonight after knowing he was through the group and was able to try shots that might not in other situations, everything came off. 'I'm not going to try and forget this, I'll try and use it as motivation for the off season to change some things. It's clear I need to make some adjustments to my game. Pippa Middleton (left) and Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho (right) watch Murray take on Federer . Murray was given the runaround by Federer at London's O2 Arena . The chastening defeat brought the curtain down on Murray's 2014 campaign . 'There are some matches when you might have behaved badly or felt like you didn't give it your best and maybe embarrassed about that, but I was trying tonight, there was nothing wrong with me.' Such commendable honesty will serve him well as he heads into the off season, in which his first duty will be to serve as best man at recently retired British player Ross Hutchins's wedding. After that he has a lot to do clear the scar tissue from this, and a year which was never likely to be easy following the recovery from back surgery twelve months ago. It is no bad thing that there are two months to regroup before the 2015 Australian Open. There is no such thing as home advantage when playing Federer in London and, not unexpectedly, the clapometer registered at least as loudly for the Swiss as it did for Murray when they made their customary rockstar entrances. Jose Mourinho was among those in the house to see the player of the Millennium at the former Millennium Dome, and it was not long before Federer was sealing Murray's fate. After an even start it was a run of 14 points in the Swiss's favour that settled the first set, Murray powerless to resist his net rushes and panic gradually seeping in. Winning that twelfth game might have felt like winning the clincher against Novak Djokovic in the 2013 Wimbledon final. Federer has probably succeeded in avoiding Djokovic in the semi-finals, and will likely play him in Sunday's climax. As for Murray, he has to figure out how to bridge the yawning gulf that has opened between himself and the very top players .","Andy Murray had to win in straight sets to reach last four but he failed to win a single game in first set .

"Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho was one of a host of stars in attendance at the ATP World Tour Finals on Thursday night to see Andy Murray given a straight-sets humbling by Roger Federer at the 02. The World No 2 took just 55 minutes to secure a 6-0 6-1 over the Scot and book his place in the next round, at the same time eliminating Murray from the competition. After the first set, which ruled out Murray progressing from Group B regardless of the final result, Mourinho - who was met with a chorus of boos from the crowd - was asked in an interview with Sky Sports for his verdict on the game so far, giving some words of encouragement to the 2013 Wimbledon winner.

Unfortunately for Murray he was unable to recover from the first set thrashing from Federer, with little changing in the final set, bar the Scot at least managing to hold one of his service games. As well as Mourinho, avid tennis fan Pippa Middleton and Murray's girlfriend Kim Sears cheered on the 27-year-old, as he looked to end the season in positive manner. But there would be no happy ending for Murray this time around, as he fell to his worst defeat since losing 6-1, 6-0 to Novak Djokovic in Miami 2007.

"Sportsmail takes a look at 10 things we have learned from an entertaining weekend of Premier League fixtures, as well as intriguing statistics from up and down the country. 1. Mario Balotelli appears to drift through games but he's actually working harder than you'd think. He covered 5.2 miles in his 79 minutes against Chelsea. That is equivalent to 5.8 miles across 90 minutes – which just happens to be the average distance covered by Luis Suarez in games against the top four last season. Mario Balotelli may not be finding the net with the same regularity as Luis Suarez did at Liverpool, but he is running the same as the Uruguayan did against the top four teams last season . 2. Geordie Paul Dummett's emergence has been a huge bonus for Alan Pardew this season - and the left back, who made his Wales debut in the summer, has now also proved he can play as a central defender. The 23-year-old product of the club's youth system performed brilliantly alongside Fabricio Coloccini in the 2-0 win at West Brom, keeping new England star Saido Berahino to just one shot on goal. His 13 clearances were more than the rest of Newcastle's defenders put together. Geordie Paul Dummett's emergence has been a huge bonus for Alan Pardew this season . 3. Gareth Barry's nasty injury at Sunderland gave Darron Gibson a chance to return to Premier League action – and the former Manchester United midfielder seized the opportunity. The 26-year-old, out for 11 months after cruciate ligament surgery, had played just eight minutes of League football so far. But after replacing Barry at Sunderland with just 13 minutes gone he performed like he'd not been away. No Premier League player all weekend hit more accurate passes in the attacking half than the 52 that Gibson produced – just a shame none of them got turned into a goal in the 1-1 draw. After replacing Gareth Barry at Sunderland after just 13 minutes, Darron Gibson played like he'd not been away . 4. Joey Barton's appearance as a second half sub to replace the injured Sandro against Manchester City was his first action since getting injured in mid-September, and he made a compelling case to get back in QPR's starting line-up. He won tackles to break up Manchester City's play, and got on the ball enough to hit 23 accurate passes in his 45 minutes compared to just nine achieved by former Spurs star Sandro in the first half. He also covered more ground – 3.8 miles of running compared to Sandro's 3.3. Joey Barton put on a compelling case to return to QPR's starting line-up on Saturday evening . 5. Nathaniel Clyne's elevation to the England squad is encouraging fellow Southampton full back Ryan Bertrand to match his standards. Bertrand, on loan from Chelsea but likely to make his move to St Mary's permanent in January, has made sure the attacking flair of Luke Shaw hasn't been missed since his £30million move to Manchester United. Against Leicester he played 73 passes compared to Clyne's 68, was accurate with 83.6 per cent of them against 77.9, and also covered a fraction more ground at 6.9 miles versus 6.8. Ryan Bertrand is performing well, and could be the next Saints player called up to the England team . 6. Steve Bruce said it was a tough decision to sell Scotland winger George Boyd to Burnley during the summer, describing the 29-year-old as 'the sort of lad you'd be glad if your daughter brought home.' Boyd was clearly eager to make Bruce regret the £3million transfer even more, playing a starring role as his new club recorded their first Premier League win of the season. He ran 8.1 miles in the game – the most ground covered by any player in all the weekend's Premier League fixtures. George Boyd was clearly eager to make Steve Bruce regret the £3million transfer from Hull . 7. Middlesbrough's fans are warming to the progress being made by Aitor Karanka who on Thursday will celebrate a year in charge at The Riverside. The crowd of 22,930 who watched their 0-0 draw with Bournemouth was the highest attendance since 23,679 saw them play Bolton shortly after the Spaniard took over. Boro's average gates, which hit 28,428 in their last Premier League campaign in 2008-09, had fallen to 16,794 by last season. A crowd of 22,930 watched Middlesbrough's goalless top fo the table clash with Bournemouth . 8. Uwe Rosler is another Championship manager who will shortly celebrate his first anniversary in charge – but things are less happy for the Wigan boss. In the relegation zone after the 3-1 collapse at Bolton, even if he wins his next two games at home to Middlesbrough and at Sheffield Wednesday he will only have the same 22 points from 19 games for which Owen Coyle was sacked last year. Uwe Rosler is another Championship manager who will shortly celebrate his first anniversary in charge . 9. Experienced Micky Adams has had an instant impact since taking over at Tranmere after they had slumped to 92nd place in the football pyramid. After losing his first match in charge he is unbeaten in four now – and scored his first victory by knocking in-form Bristol Rovers out of the FA Cup despite playing the last half an hour with ten men. One of his key decisions was to restore Welsh squad man Owain Fon Williams as first choice goalkeeper, and the 27-year-old was in outstanding form on Saturday. Micky Adams has had an instant impact since at Tranmere after being bottom of the Football League . 10. After a week of doom and gloom in Europe for Liverpool, Manchester City, Arsenal and to a lesser extent Chelsea, at least one English side enjoyed a Champions League triumph. Bristol's women's team – now run under the same umbrella management as current League One leaders Bristol City – have got one foot in the quarter-finals after going to Barcelona and winning 1-0. A Marta Corredera own goal, and some brilliant work by Bristol keeper Mary Earps, gave them a lead to take into Thursday's second leg at Ashton Gate.","Mario Balotelli may not be finding the net at the same rate as Luis Suarez .

"Former Stoke defender Danny Higginbotham has given his backing to Peter Coates after the Potters chairman was handed a misconduct charge by the Football Association. Coates was quoted by The Sentinel earlier this month as saying 'there does seem to be a bias towards other teams' regarding referees' decisions in Stoke matches. The FA released a statement on Thursday which said: 'Peter Coates has been charged by The FA for misconduct in relation to media comments. Peter Coates has been charged with misconduct over comments he made regarding referee Chris Foy . Coates (right), pictured watching Stoke City at the Britannia Stadium with chief executive Tony Scholes . 'It is alleged the Stoke City chairman made comments which constitute improper conduct in that they allege and/or imply bias on the part of referees and/or bring the game into disrepute. 'He has until 6pm on 24 November 2014 to respond to the charge.' The chairman's comments had come just a few days after Stoke boss Mark Hughes' angry complaint that a challenge by Alex Song on Potters forward Mame Biram Diouf had not resulted in play being stopped during West Ham's 2-2 Barclays Premier League draw at the Britannia Stadium. The unpunished, rash-looking tackle from on-loan Barcelona midfielder Song came in the build up to the Hammers' first goal. Stoke's previous two home games had seen their striker Peter Crouch being sent off and captain Ryan Shawcross have a penalty awarded against him for grappling at a corner. Former Stoke City defender Danny Higginbotham has leapt to the defence of his former chairman . Coates was quoted as saying on November 4: 'We feel we don't always get fair treatment and that is all we are asking for. 'There does seem to be a bias towards other teams. You always feel that because we have a good crowd that gets behind the team, referees seem to think ""I will show them who's in charge here."" Perhaps it's a macho thing. 'You do get a bit fed up getting fouls against us and decisions having an effect on games, such as a two-footed challenge that doesn't even get a booking or a foul. I do feel that we get treated more harshly than the opposition.' Higginbotham, who was with the Staffordshire outfit for the 2006-07 season and then from 2008 to 2013, says he has ""all the sympathy in the world"" for Coates. He added in The Sentinel: 'You can see why owners, chairmen, managers and players are getting so frustrated, because referees are not answerable for their decisions. 'Referees should be made to come out and explain their decisions after a game, then people like Peter Coates wouldn't have to come out and say things like that.'","Peter Coates handed misconduct charge by the Football Association .

"Kei Nishikori fought back from a set down to beat alternate David Ferrer in his final Group B match at the ATP World Tour Finals in London. Nishikori’s 4-6, 6-4, 6-1 victory over Ferrer means that Andy Murray has to beat Roger Federer in straight sets at the O2 Arena on Thursday night to qualify for the semi-finals. Federer, meanwhile, is already guaranteed progression to the last four by virtue of Ferrer winning a set. Kei Nishikori celebrates after beating David Ferrer 4-6, 6-4, 6-1 at the O2 Arena in Group B . David Ferrer hangs his head after he misses Nishikori's return on the way to losing the match . 1. If Roger Federer defeats Andy Murray, then Federer wins the group and Kei Nishikori qualifies in second place. 2. If Andy Murray defeats Roger Federer in straight sets, then Murray wins the group and Federer qualifies in second place. 3. If Andy Murray defeats Roger Federer in three sets, then Federer wins the group and Kei Nishikori qualifies in second place. But the Swiss will no doubt go all out for the win against Murray to avoid a likely semi-final clash with world No 1 Novak Djokovic. Nishikori had ironically eliminated Ferrer from the Race to London two weeks ago by beating him in the quarter-finals of the Paris Masters. But the pair faced off again here after world No 10 Ferrer replaced Milos Raonic, who pulled out on Thursday morning with a muscle tear in his thigh. Although Ferrer could not qualify, there was plenty at stake with 200 ranking points and an extra £98,500 in prize money if he could win. Ferrer winning a set means that Roger Federer is already guaranteed progression out of Group B . Ferrer had two chances to break in the fifth game but could not convert and Nishikori made him pay in the next game with a clean forehand cross-court winner for the break. Nishikori faltered when trying to consolidate and Ferrer broke back before later breaking for the set as the nervy Japanese dumped a smash into the net. However, world No 5 Nishikori instantly mounted a comeback as he broke in the opening game of the second set. Nishikori's victory put a dent in Andy Murray's hopes, with the Scot having to beat Federer in straight sets . Ferrer stayed within touch and forced Nishikori to serve the second set out which he duly did to level the match. This was the first three-set match of the week and Nishikori would have felt confident heading into the decider with an impressive 20-2 record in matches that have gone the distance this year. And he cruised to victory as an immediate break proved demoralising for Ferrer and Nishikori won five of the next six games to seal victory in one hour and 56 minutes.","Nishikori came from a set down to beat Ferrer 4-6, 6-4, 6-1 .

"Kevin Nolan has a right to feel more than a touch aggrieved. No other Englishman has played more Premier League games than he has without winning an international cap. It's 375 and counting for the West Ham skipper who - at the age of 32 - must feel his race has been run in the hunt for a call from Roy Hodgson. A stalwart of the top flight since Bolton's promotion in 2001, Nolan has been overlooked by four England managers - Sven-Goran Eriksson, Steve McClaren, Fabio Capello and Hodgson. Kevin Nolan is the Englishman with the most Premier League appearances without an international cap . Nolan (pictured here playing for Bolton Wanderers) has played 375 games in the top flight to date . Tony Hibbert (pictured playing against Lille last week) has never been called up by England . Joey Barton (right, shaking Frank Lampard's hand) made one substitute appearance against Spain in 2007 . Everton midfielder Leon Osman has also played for the Three Lions over in Stockholm against Sweden . Kevin Nolan (Bolton, Newcastle, West Ham) - 375 Premier League games . Chris Perry (Wimbledon, Tottenham, Charlton) - 363 games . Steve Watson (Newcastle, Everton, Aston Villa, West Brom) - 351 games . Jason Dodd (Southampton) - 329 games . Kevin Campbell (Arsenal, Everton, Nottingham Forest, West Brom) - 325 games . Matt Taylor (Portsmouth, Bolton, West Ham, Burnley) - 318 games . Peter Atherton (Coventry, Sheffield Wed, Bradford) - 318 games . Alan Wright (Blackburn, Aston Villa, Middlesbrough, Sheffield United) - 305 games . Garry Flitcroft (Manchester City, Blackburn) - 301 games . Tony Hibbert (Everton) - 262 games . In that time he's watch Joey Barton, David Dunn and Leon Osman all get the nod. And there is quite a number of English players - researched bybwin - who have spent the majority of their careers in the top division but never earned any recognition. With the malaise that constantly surrounds England, that takes quite some doing. Unsurprisingly, Tony Hibbert makes the top 10 for Premier League appearances without a cap. The Everton right back has played 262 times for the Toffees, while Steve Watson - who was at Goodison Park for five years - made 351 overall. Chris Perry, a former central defender for Tottenham, Wimbledon and Charlton, is second in the list behind Nolan on 363. Perhaps the unluckiest man on the list is Kevin Campbell. The former Arsenal and Everton striker appeared to have been born in the wrong era - one in which England were blessed with real quality up front. Despite scoring more than 100 top flight goals he never got a look in with Alan Shearer, Teddy Sheringham, Ian Wright and Co all ahead of him. Kevin Campbell (beating Colin Calderwood to a header in 1995) never won an England cap . Chris Perry (right, tussling with Michael Ricketts) played for Tottenham, Wimbledon and Charlton . Jason Dodd (left, battling with Andy Cole) spent a total of 16 years at Southampton . Burnley's Matt Taylor (celebrating while at West Ham in February) is another to make the list . Peter Atherton (left, for Bradford City) and Blackburn Rovers'  Garry Flitcroft played more than 300 games .

"Former Manchester City boss Roberto Mancini looked rejuvenated as he began his second stint in charge of Inter Milan. Mancini left Galatasaray by mutual consent in June, and has been out of work since.

'I never thought I would return... but I think it can be another nice story,' Mancini said. 'I believe in this project. 'It's up to us to find that spark again, bring the fans back to the stadium and return to winning ways. I'm really happy to be here. If I've come back it must mean that I've done something right elsewhere, that's all that matters.' Conversation moved to his previous experience in the Nerazzurri dugout, and Mancini admitted that it is nice to be back. 'It's hard to make comparisons. It's nice to be welcomed back in an atmosphere like this though, because that's fundamental in this job. 'They laid out all their plans and I think we can write another success story. I believe in this club's plans. We have to knuckle down because if we work hard we can achieve great things.' Before the press conference Mancini held up an Inter shirt with his name on and the number 226 - the number of matches he was in charge of between 2004-2008.

"Mansfield boss Paul Cox knows his side will be in the cross-hairs of a Concord Rangers side chasing an FA Cup giant-killing on Tuesday night. The non-league outfit, currently 15th in the Conference South, travel to Field Mill for their rearranged first-round clash after the original tie was postponed nine days ago.

League One Doncaster will also be aiming to avoid a shock when they make the journey to Weston-Super-Mare, also of the Conference South.

'We have to be realistic and expect to win,' he said. 'We know what we have to do. Doncaster Rovers boss Paul Dickov exits the pitch after their match was postponed at Weston-super-Mare .

"After Google accidentally leaked shots of a new handset last month, images of its rumoured Nexus 5 phone have now made a brief appearance on the firm's official Play store. The new handset was shown alongside Google's current Nexus 7 and Nexus 10 models with a price tag of $349. Product shots discovered by fan site Android Police confirm the device will be called Nexus 5, hinted at how Android's new operating system KitKat will look, and showed an updated camera. Scroll down for video . After Google accidentally leaked shots of a new handset last month, images of the rumoured Nexus 5, pictured, have appeared on the Play store. The product shots hint at what Google's Android KitKat operating system may look like, and feature an updated camera lens . Google teamed up with Nestle last month to launch the next version of its Android operating system, called Android 4.4 KitKat. There had been speculation that the latest version would be named Android Key Lime Pie because each release begins with the letter of the alphabet that follows the previous. To mark the announcement, the KitKat homepage was redesigned as a parody of Google software releases. The images and brief details were only visible for a short time before being taken down, but websites including The Next Web managed to take screenshots. The device was shown alongside Google's Nexus 7 and Nexus 10 devices. This leak is the latest in a line of leaks that have dogged the new handset. A mysterious device that some believed was the new Nexus handset, was spotted in a promotional video . for Google's new KitKat Android 4.4 operating system last month.

"For Mark Cooper, the best phone call of Saturday night was one he made to his dad Terry. Not because he could tell him how his Swindon team had ended Bristol City’s unbeaten record. But because he could make it at all. Mark had spent the last international break at the hospital bedside in Tenerife where Terry, England’s swashbuckling left back in the 1970 World Cup, was in intensive care following a life-or-death bowel cancer operation. It was a personal trauma he had done his best to keep to himself while handling the problems of helping the Football League’s youngest team to recover from a 5-0 FA Cup hammering at Cheltenham. Mark Cooper saw his Swindon side beat Bristol City to end their unbeaten run in League One . Michael Smith scored the only goal of the game in the 78th minute at the County Ground . Cooper had been in Tenerife with his father . But on Saturday night the 45-year-old could enjoy calling to share the details of a successful day and how his side, with an average age of 21 and three quarters, had moved into League One’s automatic promotion places. They had some help when City captain Wade Elliott got sent off after barely three minutes, but then passed the ball relentlessly to exploit their extra man before striker Michael Smith (right) finally picked his way through a packed defence to get the winner 12 minutes from time. ‘I couldn’t wait to speak to dad,’ admitted Mark. ‘He’s back home and just about on a level now where he can focus and talk. He was in intensive care for 10 days and has had that many drugs. ‘It was fortunate that when he was at his most critical it was the international break. We had three players called up then, so we had the weekend off and I managed to get out there for four days. ‘The doctors said it was touch and go. I had to get there. He was in intensive care the whole time, it wasn’t nice. ‘Thankfully they say the operations have been successful and he’s clear now and will keep recovering. He loves Bristol City and has such fond memories of his time there — as I do because that’s where I started as a player — but for once he’s probably happy they’ve been beaten.’ When the fixtures came out, this was the first his father had booked flights for from his Canary Island home, where he was based as Southampton’s chief European scout. Mark’s own playing career was far less stellar than his old man, who was a stalwart in Don Revie’s all-conquering Leeds United teams of the 1960s — but after scrapping through non-League jobs at Tamworth, Kettering, Darlington and Telford he’s fallen on his feet. Cooper's dad Terry was in intensive care after a make-or-break bowel cancer operation . Swindon is a club where chairman Lee Power, himself an ex-player, is building a strategy based on youth and a belief in passing football. The budget is a measly £1.5million a year, a fraction of that spent by League One leaders City. But the faith in youth is both developing their own kids and making the club a favoured destination for Premier League sides to send their young talent on loan. Last season some of Tottenham’s best youngsters, including Ryan Mason, progressed at the County Ground. This time Southampton’s impressive England defender Jack Stephens, just 20, looked the pick of the potential. Terry Cooper (right) in action for England against Brazil's Jairzinho during the 1970 World Cup in Mexico . ‘The chairman has been brilliant. He’s an ex-player so he understands,’ Cooper said. ‘He put this club on a sound financial footing and insisted that we try and play real good football. He wants to do that so we can bring young players through.’ Cooper knows it will take a miracle to keep his young side in the promotion hunt. It’s a long season and a trip to Peterborough next week will be a more immediate challenge. But on Saturday night he could enjoy a small success. And more important, so could his dad. PERFORMANCE OF THE WEEKEND . Bradford have taken time to adjust to League One since promotion through the play-offs in 2013 — but clicked to end Preston’s unbeaten run at Deepdale which went back to December. They dominated after leading through Rory McArdle’s first-half header — and even when Joe Garner scrambled an equaliser five minutes from time, it took just 60 seconds for Mark Yeates to curl in a 20-yard winner. Bradford ended Preston's unbeaten run at Deepdale which had stretched back to December with a 2-1 win . WHAT'S CAUGHT MY EYE... More like what my eye couldn’t see — more than 117,000 people watched the 19 games in League One and Two on Saturday, yet the BBC don’t think it’s worth running The Football League Show on international weekends. Derek Asamoah had not played English football since walking out of Shrewsbury in 2007. That’s until Carlisle gave him a shot — and the 33-year-old got his fourth goal in five in a 1-0 win over Accrington.

"Manchester United have made no move to register goalkeeper Victor Valdes with the Barclays Premier League this week, effectively ruling him out of Saturday’s game at Arsenal. United are in the grip of a deepening injury crisis with midfielders Daley Blind and Michael Carrick and goalkeeper David de Gea returning from the international break with injuries. De Gea’s finger dislocation makes him a doubt for the weekend – although that hasn’t been confirmed yet – and there has been speculation that United manager Louis van Gaal may overlook regular No 2 Anders Lindegaard at the Emirates this weekend and try and push the experienced former Barcelona keeper Valdes in to emergency service. Man United goalkeeper David de Gea leaves Spain training on Friday to get a dislocated finger looked at . The 32-year-old is a free agent and has been training at United while he recovers from a knee injury. Valdes is close to fitness now but United would have to officially add him to their Premier League squad in order for him to play and it is understood that has not happened. There is room in United’s official list for Valdes as they are not currently up to their 25-man maximum permitted by the league. However, an application to add the 32-year-old would take a number of days and the fact United have not even started the process would appear to suggest Lindegaard will play this weekend if De Gea is not fit.

"Manchester United are stepping up their interest in West Ham’s teenage defender Reece Oxford. The 15-year-old is already a target for Arsenal and Chelsea but United staff consider him the best young defender in the country and are keen to strike a deal. West Ham have offered a lucrative contract to Oxford but he is yet to commit.

Oxford was at The Emirates for Arsenal’s Champions League tie with Galatasaray on Wednesday and Arsene Wenger sees the prospect as someone who could progress quickly into their first team set-up. United, though, are prepared to fight all the way for Oxford. Although they have had to blood Paddy McNair, Tom Thorpe and Tyler Blackett, Oxford has the potential to overtake them. Despite spending £165million on their first team, United are determined to improve the quality of young players they have coming through. They signed Ajax defender Timothy Fosu-Mensah, 16, last month and have given trials to Feyenoord’ s Tahith Chong while maintaining an interest in 15-year-old Norway international and Liverpool target Martin Odegaard. They also came close to signing another West Ham prospect, left-back Oscar Borg, 16, but that deal fell through. Losing Oxford at this stage would be a blow to West Ham from both football and financial perspectives with the club likely to receive just £250,000 in compensation should he go.

"Seeing any professional athlete up close and personal always makes you feel that bit more insignificant. And pudgier. But seeing 20-odd American soccer players in the flesh makes you wonder if you are in fact a part of the same species. They are, quite simply, awesome-looking. Kyle Beckerman, the Real Salt Lake star, is 32 but looks 10 years younger and more like a surfer dude than a defensive midfielder thanks to a fine head of dreadlocks. Think Cobi Jones at Coventry City circa 1994. Goalkeeper Brad Guzan has come a long way from his first club, South Carolina Gamecocks . You were expecting Beckerman to finish each sentence with ‘narly’ but this is a player who can boast three appearances at last summer’s World Cup so he is to be respected. Some of the younger members of Jurgen Klinsmann’s experimental squad resembled Hollister models just as much as strikers or defenders. But Brad Guzan, well, he definitely looks like a goalkeeper. Big bald head. Big mushy nose. Big, big hands. The Illinois native has come a long way from his first club, South Carolina Gamecocks, to reach the point where he is now first-choice with Aston Villa. Not that he feels like a true No 1. ‘I don’t know, I don’t know if I’ll ever feel like one,’ the 30-year-old said pitchside at Aviva Stadium. ‘Being in the Premier League, being with the national team, you are constantly trying to prove yourself. When you get complacent, that’s when you lose the spring in your step. It’s always about moving on. 'For me, it’s trying to prove week in week out that I am justifying the manager’s selection. So for me, I don’t necessarily look at myself as a No 1. I want to improve my own play and then justify the manager’s selection. And you do that by playing well, making saves in any way you can.’ Focused Guzan refuses to take it for granted being No 1 for club and country . He dislodged Shay Given at Villa Park and with his club-mate likely to feature in a much-changed Republic of Ireland starting XI, they will be on opposing sides. The competition for places hasn’t soured the feeling between the two men. ‘You’re fighting for playing time but our relationship has been very good, both on and off the pitch,’ Guzan insisted. ‘For me, I’ve been very fortunate to work with him for so long now, his resume speaks for itself, what he’s done, not only at club level but at international level. ‘It speaks volumes for him as a professional.’ And Roy (there was always going to be a question about Roy), what’s it like working with him? ‘Obviously he’s a passionate guy who wants to win so for the past couple of months now, working with him at Villa, he brings that intensity, brings that passion to training and into matches and that’s what you want within a training ground.’ Goalkeeper Guzan and United States head coach Jurgen Klinsmann, left, speak to the media . Guzan has certainly impressed his assistant manager at club level, so much so that Keane described the American as a ‘real man’ and one of the few ‘personalties’ left in the game. ‘Yeah! I mean, listen, football is a man’s game, you have to be able to take the good with the bad and the bad with the good,’ he continued. ‘I’ve always said I’m very fortunate to be in the position I’m at, coming from America, starting in MLS and now being able to play in the Premier League, week in and week out. ‘I’m very lucky and you don’t take any of that for granted. Today is an another example of that, being able to represent your country is an honour. ‘So it’s always nice when you hear kind words but at the same time you’re always looking to get better and improve, and to help your team.’ Spoken like a true pro.","Brad Guzan unsure whether he'll ever feel like a No 1 .

"Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge has suffered a fresh thigh injury which threatens to rule him out for another month. Sturridge pulled out of a training session at Melwood on Monday with a strain to the same thigh he injured on September 5 while on international duty with England. Liverpool will assess the damage over the next 48 hours with a scan planned for Tuesday. The results are expected on Wednesday but they will now be forced to plan to face Crystal Palace in the Barclays Premier League on Sunday without him.

Sturridge hasn't played since featuring for 89 minutes in England's 1-0 friendly win over Norway in September . Sturridge had been upbeat after returning to training last week and took time on Tuesday to post a message on Instagram saying: ‘Can’t wait to be back playing. Wish I was with England though not gonna lie but my body is ready now and that’s all that matters.’ However, his body has let him down once again with Liverpool staff inevitably concerned how it has happened after taking so much care in his recuperation. Manager Brendan Rodgers also has concerns over Mario Balotelli’s fitness after the mis-firing striker returned early from international duty with Italy nursing groin and hamstring strains. Sturridge’s initial injury came from a training session that Liverpool claim the striker told Roy Hodgson he did not want to take part in. He was out for almost six weeks before injuring his calf in the warm-up to his first session back with the senior squad ahead of the visit to QPR last month. It had taken Sturridge, whose last Liverpool appearance was in the 3-0 win over Tottenham on August 31, another month to return after that setback.

Apart from Palace, Liverpool face Ludogorets in Sofia next Wednesday needing to win to keep their hopes of qualifying for the knockout stages of the Champions League alive. Meanwhile Liverpool have offered defender Glen Johnson a new two-year contract - but the deal is worth half his current wage. The England right back has been offered in the region of £60,000 a week, a big reduction on his current £120,000-per-week salary. Johnson is reluctant to accept the offer, leaving his future at Anfield in doubt. The 30-year-old can hold pre-contract talks with foreign clubs in January, and it is very likely that he will leave Anfield at the end of the season. Roma have already shown interest.

"When FIFA’s corruption buster Michael Garcia denounced the report on his own findings, football’s world governing body must have known they were in trouble. And when the day ended with the news that the FBI were re-doubling their efforts to investigate FIFA, it would be fair to say that Thursday’s much-heralded publication of the report into the 2018/2022 bidding process had not gone as FIFA president Sepp Blatter had anticipated. What was so wrong about the report? The 42-page summary of an exhaustive year-long investigation alludes to several instances of potential corruption, before concluding on every single bid that they did not ‘compromise the integrity of the 2018/2022 bidding process’. It also gives FIFA a clean bill of health. Michael Garcia (left) and Hans-Joachim Eckert shake hands outside FIFA HQ in 2012 . England bid team could be punished over 2018 World Cup efforts... but Qatar are cleared to host 2022 event! Russia 2018 bid's computers and emails 'destroyed', say FIFA . Who is Michael Garcia? Sportmail's lowdown on FIFA investigator . FIFA investigator Michael Garcia to appeal against HIS OWN body's interpretation of his report into Qatar and England bids . Yet even this report cites several occasions when that appears not to be the case. The Qatar bid sponsored the African Confederation’s (CAF) conference for £1.15million. ‘No bidding rule prohibited sponsorship agreements like the one between Qatar 2022 and CAF.’ Which implies the same rules, which have been pronounced ‘fair and thorough’, were hugely deficient. Is it right to clear Qatar? It is impossible to tell. Even Garcia’s fuller investigation was limited in the scope of its inquiry to the point of being almost redundant. Most FIFA watchers have always said that Qatar’s Aspire Academy, which hands out grants to developing nations around the world, was the key to currying favour with FIFA executive committee members. And yet the Aspire Academy merits just one short paragraph. Qatar were named as the host nation for the 2022 World Cup back in 2010 . Were there other examples of potential corruption? Argentina and Brazil played a friendly in Qatar in November 2010, two weeks before the vote, and ‘an entity wholly owned by a Qatari business conglomerate financed the event. According to (Qatar) bid officials, the entity was unaffiliated with Qatar 2022 . . . Nevertheless . . . the financing of the event . . . raises concerns . . . in particular in relation to certain arrangements concerning payments for the Argentina Football Association.’ The Argentina federation president at the time was the late Julio Grondona, who had a vote on 2022 and who was hugely influential as a senior FIFA vice-president. Fans in Qatar celebrate on the streets as their country are awarded the 2022 World Cup back in 2010 . An artist's impression of how the 45,330 capacity Al Khor stadium located in the north east of Qatar will look . So, did every bidding team cooperate? No. Garcia was subjected to a travel ban by the Russian government, which meant he couldn’t visit the country from April 2013. And the Russians could provide only ‘limited’ documents to the inquiry as the computers they used were ‘leased’ and their owner claims he had destroyed them. What about the FA? The report makes excruciating reading with regard to the FA’s treatment of CONCACAF president Jack Warner. England ‘often accommodated Mr Warner in apparent violation of bidding rules’ and ‘appeared willing to provide benefits and favours’ to Warner’s own football team, Joe Public FC, and ‘even sought to find employment in the UK for a person of interest to Warner’. FA chairman Greg Dyke called the probe ‘a joke, a shambles and a complete farce from start to finish’ England were criticised for trying to woo former FIFA vice-president Jack Warner . Will we ever discover what really went on? Probably not. Even this summary hints that Garcia’s inquiry has been frustrated by the limited powers and scope of his investigation. It points out frequently that he could not compel witnesses to testify unless they were football officials. A persistent theme is that any dirty work is outsourced to individuals, consultants or companies who are not subject to FIFA regulations. ‘To assume that envelopes full of cash are given in exchange for votes on a FIFA World Cup host is naive. Corruption . . . is executed in much more sophisticated ways.’ This document seems to indicate that, if the report were published in full, there are several football officials who could be charged and perhaps suspended by FIFA’s ethics commission. But you can be sure that FIFA will never uncover the whole truth. We can only hope the FBI fare better.","FIFA ethics judge Hans-Joachim Eckert slammed England's 2018 bid .

"England may have claimed the bragging rights in Tuesday night's friendly at Celtic Park but the seniors are by no means the only Three Lions side taking on Scotland this week. The Under 16s face the Auld Enemy on Thursday evening in their final Sky Sports Victory Shield contest of the season - and they have a chance of lifting the trophy at Yeovil's Huish Park. So far, Steve Cooper's young charges have lost 1-0 to Wales in Bangor and beaten Northern Ireland 1-0 thanks to a goal from Ipswich Town midfielder Andre Dozzell. Andre Dozzell celebrates scoring England's winning goal in their Victory Shield win over Northern Ireland . England coach Steve Cooper is keen to give his young charges plenty of experience of international football . Those results have left them third in the standings ahead of the final round but a win, coupled with a favourable result in the Northern Ireland vs Wales match, will deliver England the trophy for the 36th time since its inception in 1946. However, the greatest concern for coach Cooper is to give his schoolboy team valuable exposure to international football and put on an entertaining display for what is expected to be a large crowd in Somerset. He said: 'The players were really looking forward to meeting up for this game and relationships have already started to form which is great. 'Development is about individual talent but it is also about playing in a team. To do that we need to make sure the players bond - and they certainly are. England's Jonathan Leko attempts an overhead kick during the 1-0 Victory Shield defeat to Wales . England's Ayotomiwa Bashiru (left) tries to break through the Northern Ireland defence . 'We are working with 16-year-olds who are on the start of an international journey and we need to be mindful of that. 'Our expectations need to be high but they need to be appropriate. We need to concentrate on the now but have an eye on the future as well.' With that in mind, Cooper has recalled many of the squad members for the Wales and Northern Ireland matches, but there are first call-ups for Manchester City defender Diego Lattie and Arsenal forward Reiss Nelson. Followers of youth football will notice some familiar surnames in the squad, including Trevoh Chalobah of Chelsea, the brother of Nathaniel, who is currently out on loan at Burnley. Joe Willock, who plays for Arsenal, is the younger brother of Chris Willock, also on the Gunners' books. It certainly won't have escaped the notice of these 15 and 16-year-olds that England captain Wayne Rooney earned his 100th international cap in the Euro 2016 qualifier against Slovenia at the weekend. But it will also be of great encouragement that Rooney was once like them, playing for England in the 2001 Victory Shield campaign and he netted his first goal in a Three Lions shirt - the first of many to come. Dujon Sterling vies for the ball with Liam Cullen of Wales during England's slender defeat at Bangor . England's Okera Simmonds tries to escape the clutches of two Northern Ireland defenders . Rooney stands alongside the likes of Bobby Charlton, Peter Shilton, Duncan Edwards, Michael Owen and Trevor Brooking as England players who have benefited from a footballing education in this competition. Manchester United star Rooney recalled: 'The first game we played was against Wales. I was on the bench and came on as a sub. I was disappointed because I wanted to start, I wanted to play up front, and I always remember the coach saying that I wasn’t a centre-forward – he said I was a winger. The next game he played me as centre-forward from the start and I scored against Scotland. That was a nice moment. 'I was a young lad, 15, the game was on television and was something different to what I’d been used to. All my family and friends were watching the game, so it was a big moment. Once I’d tasted that, being on TV playing football and everyone seeing what I could do, I just wanted more of it.'

"Force India and Sauber have vowed to resist what they believe is the 'game plan' for Formula One over the years to come. This weekend's Abu Dhabi Grand Prix may represent the title decider between Mercedes duo Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg, but off track there is far more at stake. For the third successive race weekend, F1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone is to sit down with the trio of smaller marques pleading for change within the sport. Force India and Sauber will speak to F1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone this week about their future in the sport . Ecclestone has already rejected out of hand their demands for a more equitable distribution of income, with the 'big four' - Ferrari, Red Bull, Mercedes and McLaren - claiming half of last year's £530million revenues. Sauber team principal Monisha Kaltenborn and Force India deputy team principal Bob Fernley have already suggested 'an agenda' is being set whereby the smaller teams are to be driven out of the sport. Fernley, however, insists his team are ready to dig their heels in and fight tooth and nail against the potential introduction of third cars, and eventually customer cars. 'You've got to interpret from the evidence that (an agenda) is a given,' Fernley said. 'Clearly it's indicating in that direction. We know what the desired outcome is. It doesn't necessarily mean getting rid of us - it could mean converting us to customer teams. Mercedes are one of four teams to have claimed half of last year's £530million in revenues made by F1 . 'But one way or another it is probably trying not to keep the status quo. Where we have the full constructors' series, it is to break us up. 'The clear direction we are getting is there is a desire to have five constructor teams and five customer teams, which will be the best way they feel to go.' But a resolute Fernley added: 'From our point of view, we can now focus on strengthening our status as a constructor, and we will do. 'Now we know what the game plan is, and the last few weeks have exposed it, we can work with it. 'We just want to make sure we stay a constructor, and we will work hard to do that and stay competitive. 'What has happened certainly makes Vijay (Mallya, co-owner) very, very strong.' Sauber have been racing in the sport since 1993 but could be forced out due to the financial spat . Kaltenborn, whose team are poised to the end the season without a point to their name for the first time in their history, is also of the same firm mind as Fernley. 'We have been in this sport since 1993,' she said. 'Force India have been around a while, Lotus as well. How can you just drive out people like this? It's just not right. 'The big teams use F1 as a simple sporting, marketing platform. It's nothing more for them. 'They talk of it as being a sport, of fairness and all that stuff, but where is that now? 'Years ago we had a situation with another team that now is the world champion, and all the teams got together. 'We are not out here with, as they are saying, a begging bowl, but we are part of the show. 'It's very disrespectful to behave this way towards other teams within the sport, and even more disrespectful towards the fans.' Lotus is another of those teams who's future is uncertain at the moment in F1 .","Abu Dhabi Grand Prix is the season-finale that takes place on Sunday .

"Fernando Alonso is to leave Ferrari after Sunday's season-ending race in Abu Dhabi. Ferrari announced the news in a statement on Thursday following weeks of speculation over the Spaniard's future. Ever since Sebastian Vettel - who on Thursday signed a three-year deal with Ferrari - revealed seven weeks ago he was leaving Red Bull, Alonso has been earmarked to bring an end to his five-year association with the Maranello marque. Fernando Alonso will leave Ferrari after Sunday's season-ending grand prix in Abu Dhabi . Alonso, pictured driving during the Brazilian grand prix in Sao Paulo, has spent five years with Ferrari . There remains no information as to his destination for 2015, although it is understood he has already agreed terms on a return to McLaren. The announcement brings to an end Alonso's five-year relationship with the team which has failed to yield the third world title he long believed would be his in switching allegiance to the Maranello marque. Alonso did finish runner-up on three occasions, missing out by four points in 2010 and just three in 2012, whilst he was a long way adrift last season, with Vettel champion on each occasion. Instead, Alonso leaves with only 11 victories to his name, the last of which was on home soil in Spain last season, as well as another 33 podiums. Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel has signed a three-year contract to join Ferrari from next season . Alonso (right) is expected to return to McLaren, where he raced with Lewis Hamilton back in 2007 . Since Red Bull's announcement of Vettel's departure shortly before the Japanese Grand Prix, Alonso has since played games with the media when quizzed on his future plans. Although apparently knowing where he is heading, the 33-year-old still conceded leaving Ferrari was tough. Alonso said: 'Today is not an easy one for me, because even if I always look to the future with great enthusiasm and determination, at the end of this season my journey as a Ferrari driver will come to an end. 'It was a difficult decision to take, but a carefully considered one, and from start to finish, my love for Ferrari was a prime consideration. 'I have always been lucky enough to make my own decisions about my future and I have that possibility now too. 'I must thank the team for that, as it understood my position. Alonso celebrates winning the Spanish grand prix in Montmelo in May 2013 - his last victory for Ferrari . Alonso has admitted that it was a tough decision to leave Ferrari but that he is proud of his achievements . 'I leave Scuderia Ferrari after five years, during which I reached my very best level professionally, tackling major challenges that pushed me to find new limits. I also proved to be a true team-player, putting the interests of the Scuderia before my own. 'When I had to take important decisions about my future, I did so with Ferrari in my heart, driven by my love for the team. 'I am very proud of what we have achieved together. 'Thanks to the efforts of the men and women of Maranello, on three occasions we came second in the Formula One world championship, two of them fighting for the title right up to and including the final race, running in a championship winning position for many laps. 'Without a shadow of a doubt, these five years produced some of the best moments of my career. 'I also feel that, in leaving the team, it is family rather than friends I am leaving behind. 'Now I look to the future with great enthusiasm, knowing that part of my heart will always belong to the Prancing Horse.

"Almost 12 years and 122 Tests have passed since Keven Mealamu made his All Blacks debut in Cardiff but the hooker still relishes the fiery reception. The battle-hardened front-row has learned to blank out any crude remarks and, with a 100 per cent win rate over Wales, has a habit of silencing the sledgers. New Zealand’s unbeaten run stands at 25 games and Mealamu will set out to extend that record on Saturday, when he returns to the ground where he first played in 2002 alongside Jonah Lomu, Andrew Mehrtens and Tana Umaga. ‘I’ve got amazing memories from that day,’ said Mealamu, 35. Keven Mealamu warms up alongside head coach Steve Hansen as New Zealand prepare for Wales . Mealamu tackles Wales' Robert Sidoli during his debut at the Millennium Stadium in 2002 . ‘Being able to hear the Welsh inside the closed stadium was something I had never experienced before. You can hear vividly what they’re saying. It’s not just advice on throwing the ball in; I’ve had some comments about my mother, too. ‘You’ve just got to stay cool. There’s no time to tell them to sort it out. Being in a closed stadium you can feel the energy. There’s nowhere for the sound to escape and it’s bouncing off each wall.’ A noisy home crowd will be hoping to inspire Wales to an unlikely victory at the Millennium Stadium. But the odds are stacked against Warren Gatland’s side, with New Zealand plotting to end their season with a resounding scoreline before the squad take a long break. The All Blacks hooker says he has to ignore the shouts from the crowd, which are not always complimentary . The 35-year-old has won every time he has faced Wales, and will want that to continue this weekend . Head coach Steve Hansen is expected to name a fully loaded starting XV for the Test in Cardiff, having rested some first-choice players for the narrow victory over Scotland, who frustrated the tourists at the contact area. ‘That’s a constant work-on area,’ said Mealamu. ‘It’s something we want to keep improving because it’s a vital part of our game. If we can nail it then it really sets us up.’","All Blacks hooker made his first appearance in Cardiff in 2002 .

"Alone but for a bottle of wine, a master of motor racing will sit down on his sofa to watch Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg’s final duel for the Formula One drivers’ championship of the world. In the Italian commune of Masera, 80 miles northeast of Turin, Dino Chiesa will be content whoever emerges victorious from the desert finale in Abu Dhabi. ‘Being on my own I can scream, cry, be happy,’ says Chiesa, a legend of the karting world, who offers a unique perspective having managed Hamilton and Rosberg as young karters in Team MBM, Mercedes-Benz McLaren, in 2000-2001. Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg formed a deep bond during their days racing karts . ‘I don’t want to be with someone who is actively supporting either Lewis or Nico. I’ll be happy regardless of the result. I can even start the wine on the formation lap, and maybe have another bottle, champagne perhaps, after the race.’ Chiesa knows the two combatants by their old nicknames: Nico, being white and rich and from Monaco, was known as The Prince; Lewis, being darker, was called The Sheik. He talks about the boys-turned-men as personalities and performers. They were 15 and 16 at the time and firm friends as well as karting rivals when they came under Chiesa’s aegis. And he believes that, despite the pair’s jousting, an essential bond remains between them. ‘We built the team specifically for them both — a gentleman’s agreement with Ron Dennis, who was in charge of the McLaren young driver programme that Lewis was on, and Keke Rosberg, Nico’s dad, who was looking after his son’s career,’ says Chiesa. Hamilton and Rosberg were friends long before this year’s thrilling title race . ‘Lewis and Nico were meant to be together for three years but they were so quick they stepped up to cars after two years. Nico went to BMW and Lewis to Renault. ‘I remember them as young boys. Friendly boys. A karting team is small, just five or six of us including the drivers. It is a little family. The boys usually slept together. ‘Karting at that age is professional to a degree but not the way it is in Formula One. There were funny moments too. One night I remember reception at the hotel we were staying ringing me up to say that the bedding was being thrown out of their room. It started with a pillow and ended up with a mattress. ‘Even Anthony (Lewis’s father) and Keke got on well. There was a joke among the others that Anthony was not a very good driver, unlike the rest of them. He was always the one driving the rental car though. One time Keke pulled the handbrake as Anthony was driving. The car spun in the middle of the road and went into the water hole at the side. ‘Nico was laughing in the back and saying, “My dad pulled the handbrake”. Keke was famous for not spending much money — very Scottish, as you say in Britain. One time in Canada, you had to pay $2 to get on a bridge over a stream to take you to the car park. Keke did not want to pay it and instead drove the pick-up into the stream. This time Lewis was laughing. Hamilton leads the championship by 17 points but scores count double in Abu Dhabi . ‘Lewis was more mature. Nico had to learn from him. I believe they are still friends. I remember the Australian Grand Prix in 2008. They had their first podium together in Formula One. Lewis called me early in the morning because of the time difference. ‘He was so happy. He said it was like their go-karting days: he and Nico together on the podium. That’s why I believe there is still friendship there. It is impossible to be enemies after all that.’ The maths favours Hamilton going into the last race at Abu Dhabi’s Yas Marina track. He leads the championship by 17 points but with the scores counting double at the final round that is not as commanding a lead as it might sound. A victory would be the most direct way for Hamilton to win his second title. But if Rosberg won the race, Hamilton would need to come second. If Rosberg were second, Hamilton would need to come fifth. If Rosberg were third, Hamilton would need to come sixth. Given the sheer dominance of their Mercedes cars, any other permutation is surely no more than theoretical. Many observers were surprised by Rosberg beating Hamilton to another landmark this season: he leads 10 poles to seven. Chiesa is not. ‘I predicted before the season that this is how I thought it would go, with Nico having more poles and Lewis being faster in races,’ he says. ‘Nico needs to build up to his limit, which is why qualifying suits him. Lewis can go to the limit immediately without build-up, and that helps when they race. He is more aggressive and better at knowing when to overtake. He makes it look easy. It is not so easy for Nico, who is more smooth, safe and consistent.’ It is a statement on the lifestyle of his two former charges that Chiesa expects to speak only to Rosberg before next Sunday. That is because Hamilton is out of reach — the sport’s global superstar, a status that has won him Bernie Ecclestone’s support. He believes a Hamilton championship would do more to promote his billion-pound circus. Chiesa says: ‘I’ll talk to Nico for sure. He is polite, calmer. When he is home, he is home. He has a wife. He is settled. Lewis is very busy. He has less time to spend with people — I don’t mean that in a bad way; it is normal when you become more of a VIP. I think he wants to spend time with his friends and girlfriend. I am not part of his family. ‘Lewis has changed his phone number many times and it isn’t always easy to get hold of him. But he has my number if he wants me.’ Chiesa, guiding the next track stars of the future after more than 30 years in the business, still has equal time for his Prince and his Sheik.

"Jonathan Davies will make his first Wales start of the autumn series on Saturday after being declared fit to face New Zealand. The Clermont Auvergne centre missed the opening Tests against Australia and Fiji with a shoulder injury but will return this weekend to take on the All Blacks. Leigh Halfpenny, Dan Biggar and Rhys Webb also return to the back-line after being ruled out of Saturday’s narrow 17-13 victory over Fiji. Jonathan Davies will start Wales' clash against New Zealand on Saturday at the Millennium Stadium . Davies has missed all of Wales' autumn series so far after sustaining a shoulder injury . George North keeps his place in the Wales starting XV after scoring the opening try in their win vs Fiji . Alex Cuthbert has also kept his place on the other wing for Wales after scoring also against Fiji . Wales XV: Leigh Halfpenny (Toulon), Alex Cuthbert (Cardiff Blues), Jonathan Davies (Clermont Auvergne), Jamie Roberts (Racing Metro), George North (Northampton Saints), Dan Biggar (Ospreys), Rhys Webb (Ospreys); Paul James (Bath), Richard Hibbard (Gloucester), Samson Lee (Scarlets), Jake Ball (Scarlets), Alun Wyn Jones (Ospreys), Dan Lydiate (Unattached), Sam Warburton (Cardiff Blues, CAPT), Taulupe Faletau (Newport Gwent Dragons). Replacements: Scott Baldwin (Ospreys), Nicky Smith (Ospreys), Rhodri Jones (Scarlets), Luke Charteris (Racing Metro), Justin Tipuric (Ospreys), Mike Phillips (Racing Metro), James Hook (Gloucester), Liam Williams (Scarlets). ‘It’s pretty much the same side that played against Australia and it’s a boost to have a few players back from injury,’ said head coach Warren Gatland. ‘It’s one of the most experienced teams we have put out. We are expecting another clinical performance from the All Blacks. We need to match their intensity and aggression.’ Liam Williams misses out on a place in the starting XV following his impressive performance against the South Sea Islanders and he is joined on the bench by utility back James Hook, who gets the nod ahead of misfiring Rhys Priestland. Alex Cuthbert, George North and Jamie Roberts all keep their place in the starting XV, while there are five changes in the forwards. No 8 Taulupe Faletau, flanker Dan Lydiate and prop Samson Lee have all been handed their third start of the series, while Paul James, Jake Ball, Alun Wyn Jones and Sam Warburton all return to the pack. Gloucester hooker Richard Hibbard - who has been caught in the crossfire of a club versus country row after ignoring advice from the Welsh medical team to play against Harlequins - also starts after holding clear-the-air talks with Gatland. ‘A couple of decisions have been forced upon us. Gethin Jenkins has a hamstring strain, Bradley Davies hasn’t trained for the first couple of days and Liam Williams had a bit of ankle knock at the weekend and it was a big call on him but he will start on the bench. ‘The players are obviously excited about the opportunity to face the number one side at a packed Millennium Stadium. We have named an experienced team and we are really looking forward to it.’ Taulupe Faletau will also start against New Zealand - making it his third of the autumn series at No 8 .","Wales host New Zealand as part of their autumn series on Saturday .

"Bill Kenwright has criticised Roy Keane for saying ‘some stupid things’ after the Republic of Ireland assistant manager questioned the pressure applied by Everton on James McCarthy and Seamus Coleman over playing for their country. McCarthy wanted to play against Scotland last Friday but was left out after Everton continued to request updates on his hamstring injury. The midfielder has missed the Republic’s last three Euro 2016 qualifiers and Coleman sat out last month’s game in Germany. Both played for Everton four days later. Roy Keane is concerned that Everton are putting pressure on players to pull out of international duty . Keane, who believes manager Martin O’Neill should hold talks with Everton counterpart Roberto Martinez to resolve the issue, said: ‘You always get the impression from Everton that Seamus and James are both barely able to walk. ‘So when they actually turn up and they are walking through the reception, you think “Praise the Lord, it’s a miracle”. ‘I worry that McCarthy is under lots of pressure, particularly from Everton’s point of view,’ continued Keane. ‘There has to be some sort of sit-down conversation. I don’t think Roberto has ever played at senior international level and maybe he doesn’t appreciate how big the games are for us.’ Everton chairman Bill Kenwright countered: ‘I’m a big fan of Roy Keane but he does say some stupid things. Bill Kenwright (left) said that Everton never stand in the way of their players' international committments . Seamus Coleman (right) missed Ireland's match against Germany last month, but was deemed fit for Everton . ‘That is just totally, totally unfair. We absolutely love our players going on international duty and we never ever get in the way of them and Roberto Martinez will be as shocked as everyone at Everton.’ O’Neill said: ‘From my own perspective, I think the situation was this: way back the two lads were not fit for the games against Gibraltar and Germany (in October), and played for Everton a couple of days later. That is understandable. ‘I had spoken to Seamus and Seamus just wasn’t right. I didn’t speak to James at the time, but there was a thought that he might have played against Manchester United then, but didn’t do so. ‘I hadn’t really a problem with that at all, it was just that this particular time, James does have a muscle injury. He came here, he was wanting to try it and really wanted to give it a go. ‘We always thought that time would be against us and I think he will be perfectly all right to play at the weekend for his club, and really there isn’t much more I can say about it.’ Like MailOnline Sport's Facebook page.

"Stoke paid a nice tribute to Newcastle’s cancer-suffering winger Jonas Gutierrez in their matchday programme. But they also had a little bit of mischievous fun, bizarrely quoting Newcastle’s odds to win the Premier League – an outlandish 5,000-1. They did not, however, mention that they themselves are 2,500-1! It’s fair to say that quoting the odds on relegation would have been a little more relevant.

"Greg Dyke has gone on the offensive over the FIFA World Cup corruption whitewash by urging world football’s high command to insist on investigator Michael Garcia’s report being published in full. The FA chairman says FIFA cannot go on in their present state and full transparency on all bids is ‘a matter of urgency.’ Dyke’s letter to 26 members of the FIFA ExCo follows ethics judge Hans-Joachim Eckert’s findings being rubbished by Garcia himself, causing a meltdown in Zurich. FA chairman Greg Dyke has written to every FIFA executive committee member about the corruption report . Dyke has every reason to go on the attack as Eckert’s conclusions, which cleared Qatar and Russia to stage the World Cups in 2018 and 2022, attached most blame for damaging the integrity of the bidding process to England 2018. Other countries — notably Russia and Spain — who failed to co-operate with Garcia were let off almost scot-free. Dyke, who described Eckert’s judgement as a joke, says in his letter: ‘I am writing to each member of the FIFA ExCo to urge you to insist on the publication of Mr Garcia’s full report as a matter of some urgency. ‘As you probably know the reputation of FIFA was already low in England and much of Europe before the events of last week. The failure to publish Mr Garcia’s report and his statement that the summary report contained “numerous materially incomplete and erroneous representations” has resulted in further decline in public confidence of FIFA. There have been calls for UEFA to boycott the 2018 World Cup, but it will be hosted by a UEFA member . FIFA president Sepp Blatter previously said criticisms of the organisation were motivated by racism . ‘Complete transparency is required if the actions of all those who bid, including England 2018, are to be judged fairly.’ Dyke, who led the attack against FIFA president Sepp Blatter before the FIFA Congress last summer when he accused the English press of being racist, continued: ‘I know some of you believe FIFA’s reputation in England is the result of an obsession amongst the English media with FIFA, and I know Mr Blatter sees their reports as an unfair attack on the organisation he leads. ‘However, if you read a whole range of English newspaper reports about FIFA, they do provide compelling evidence of wrongdoing. They cannot be simply dismissed as “racist” or “an attack on FIFA”, as Mr Blatter described them. ‘Urgent action is needed if confidence in FIFA is to be rebuilt in England.’ David Bernstein said the decision to give the 2022 World Cup to Qatar was 'ludicrous' There was no reaction at FIFA to Dyke’s broadside. They are in unchartered territory with the civil war between their two ethics chambers — investigatory and adjudicatory. And FIFA can hide behind their lack of comment as Garcia has started his appeal process of Eckert’s alleged misrepresentation of his report, though the pair will meet later this week to sort out their major differences. Meanwhile, Dyke’s predecessor David Bernstein has urged European nations to boycott the 2018 World Cup unless FIFA undergoes serious reform. He said: ‘If I was at the FA now, I would do everything to encourage other nations within UEFA to take this line. ‘At some stage you have to do something. It sounds drastic but choosing Qatar was clearly one of the most ludicrous decisions in the history of sport.’ To add to the FIFA fiasco, two minor whistleblowers, Australia’s Bonita Mersiades and Qatar’s Phaedra Al Majid, have made a formal complaint to FIFA that their promises of confidentiality have been breached by Eckert’s judgement, claiming it makes them easily identifiable.","FA chairman Greg Dyke has reiterated his desire for Michael Garcia's report into corruption in FIFA to be published in full .

A FIFA executive committee member has been reported for asking for 'hard cash' for World Cup votes . Les Murray (right) reported the demand of the FIFA executive committee member to his superiors . Murray has now questioned why his report of the incident was not mentioned in ethics judge Hans-Joachim Eckert's findings on the investigation into World Cup bidding. Murray wrote on his blog on the website of Australia broadcaster SBS: 'Three years ago, when I was still on the FIFA ethics committee, I was informed by sources inside the Australian bid team that a member of the FIFA executive committee was asking the Australians for hard cash in return for votes. 'I reported this information up the chain of the ethics committee at the time, as was my duty, but I see no mention of it in Eckert's report.' Eckert and ethics investigator Michael Garcia were due to meet on Thursday after disagreements between the two on the outcome of the investigation. Investigator Michael Garcia is unhappy with FIFA after publication of his report into corruption . The German judge last week cleared Russia and Qatar to host the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, saying rule breaches by the bidding countries were 'of very limited scope' Garcia responded by notifying FIFA that he intends to lodge an appeal against the decision due to 'numerous materially incomplete and erroneous representations of the facts'. Meanwhile, a broad survey of English fans has found 73 per cent would support an England boycott of future World Cups if it was backed by all UEFA countries. The survey by market research firm Northstar of 420 people interested in football also showed 43.5 per cent backed a boycott if some other European countries took part.

"Former Football Association chairman David Bernstein has urged European nations to boycott the 2018 World Cup unless world governing body FIFA undergoes serious reform. FIFA is firmly under the spotlight again following the release of a report on Thursday by the chairman of the adjudicatory chamber of their ethics committee which cleared Russia and Qatar to host the 2018 and 2022 tournaments, having found no serious breaches of bidding rules by either nation. Michael Garcia, who conducted the investigation on which Thursday's report was based but whose full report has not been made public, has appealed against the version released by FIFA. Ex-FA chairman David Bernstein has called on European nations including England to skip the 2018 World Cup . Bernstein (pictured) believes boycotting the tournament could help force FIFA into much-needed reform . Allegations of corruption - strenuously denied - continue to be levelled against the Qatar 2022 and Russia 2018 bid teams. According to Bernstein, who retired from his post with the FA last year, boycotting football's biggest tournament should be a real possibility but only if other countries support England in doing so. 'England on its own cannot influence this - one country can't do it,' he told BBC Sport. 'If we tried to do something like that we'd be laughed at. I think England within UEFA undoubtedly have the power to influence FIFA, but to do so they would have to consider withdrawing from the World Cup, the next World Cup, unless proper reform - including (FIFA president Sepp) Blatter not standing (for a fifth term) - is carried out at FIFA. Bernstein wants European nations such as World Cup holders Germany to stand up against FIFA . Michael Garcia has appealed against the version of his report into the bidding process released by FIFA . 'If I was at the FA now, I would do everything I could to encourage other nations within UEFA - and there are some who would definitely be on side, others maybe not - to take this line. At some stage you have to walk the talk, stop talking and do something. 'It sounds drastic but frankly this has gone on for years now, it's not improving, it's going from bad to worse to worse. There are 54 countries within UEFA. There's Germany, Spain, Italy, France and Holland - all powerful. You can't hold a serious World Cup without them. They have the power to influence if they have the will.' Bernstein, who gave way to Greg Dyke as the head of the FA, says the events surrounding the report into 2018 and 2022 bidding went 'beyond ridicule' and said he had stepped down from his role on FIFA's anti-discrimination task force as a consequence.

You might as well have chosen Iceland in the winter. It was like an Alice in Wonderland sort of decision. 'I've resigned for two reasons - firstly, the body has been pretty ineffectual. I've been on it for more than a year and we only had one meeting; secondly because frankly I don't wish to be personally associated with FIFA any further.'","Russia and Qatar have been cleared to hold the 2018 and 2022 World Cups .

Ref: Serdar Gozubuyuk (Leeuwarden) Kane struck first after 20 minutes of a rain-soaked contest in Brest, running on to an incisive pass from Tom Ince before dinking the ball over the goalkeeper with his left foot. And the same combination struck again, with Ince — currently on loan at Forest from Hull — producing a brilliant turn before crossing for Kane to tap home from two yards. An assistant failed to spot Sanogo was offside as he touched home Antoine Conte’s effort to reduce the arrears. Then on the stroke of half-time Sanogo levelled with another smart piece of poaching. It was the first defeat for Gareth Southgate's Young Lions and England Under-21s' first since the last European tournament in Israel in 2013 - a run of 15 games. The only blip in the meantime was a draw in Finland in September 2013. England beat Portugal 3-1 in Burnley last Thursday for an 11th straight win and Southgate made five changes, with Kane among those coming in. There was torrential rain in western France and England had to withstand wave after wave of Les Bleus attacks as their impressive winning record faced a fierce test.

England showed their pedigree with with their first glimpse of goal. Ince dropped deep and fed Kane in the left channel and the Tottenham striker showed composure to lift the ball over the on-rushing France goalkeeper Alphonse Areola. A second followed swiftly when Ince turned brilliantly on receiving Nathaniel Chalobah's pass inside the edge of the area and then fired across goal with Kane applying the finishing touch on the line. France halved their deficit with a deserved goal when Benjamin Mendy clipped the ball to the back post and Antoine Conte's cross was tucked in by Sanogo. Chalobah departed injured soon afterwards with Jake Forster-Caskey of Brighton coming on in his place and another premature change was required when Ben Gibson went off, with Carl Jenkinson coming on.

"James DeGale has revealed the origins of his rivalry with George Groves as the two continue to snipe over who is chief support for next week’s fight between Nathan Cleverly and Tony Bellew. DeGale faces Mexican Marco Antonio Periban while Groves is preparing for America’s Denis Douglin. Groves is confident he will be given the more high-profile slot at Liverpool’s Echo Arena – ‘James I’m sure has been told an awful lot of stuff throughout his career, and he’s waiting for someone to start telling him the truth...Sky’s telling me he’s not gonna be (chief support)’ – leaving DeGale to respond that Groves has felt ‘in his shadow’ since they first met. VIDEO Scroll down to watch James DeGale: World Title fight with Groves could be huge . James DeGale believes George Groves has always been in his shadow - calling him the 'ugly kid' DeGale said he had never been friends with Groves, despite them coming up through the same gym . ‘We've had this conversation and I've asked Eddie Hearn “What the f*** is happening?”’ said DeGale. “I go on Ringside, I'm a Matchroom fighter and this guy is sitting beside me telling me he is chief support? What the f***? ‘Basically we were going back and forth and the ugly kid was moaning but I don't care. All I care about is what I'm getting paid that night and getting the win. ‘He has never liked me because he has always been in my shadow. It started the day he came in the club. I'll tell you the truth, I was basically the main boy at the club – the golden boy really – I was there before him and then he was always chasing behind me. Groves insists his fight against Denis Douglan will be afforded the chief support slot next week . ‘Obviously I won national titles and all that and then he beat me on a majority decision as an amateur. He shouldn't have won but it doesn't matter and then me going to the Olympics killed him. ‘I used to batter him (in sparring). He was a couple of years younger than me. We have never been friends really. You know when you go to the gym you have a couple of mates and that? Well I used to go in there, do my work and come out. We've never ever been friends.’ Both fighters have benefited from their rivalry. Their fight for the British super middleweight title, when Groves narrowly outpointed DeGale in May 2011, was among the most hyped domestic fights in recent years but DeGale believes that was his making and that Groves owes him as a consequence. Both Groves and DeGale are on the undercard to Tony Bellew's (left, in 2011) bout with Nathan Cleverly . ‘He should be grateful to me, 100 per cent,’ he said. ‘Why should I be grateful to him? He should be grateful to me because I made him. ‘When we turned professional, I came back as Olympic gold medallist and all of a sudden the talk straight away was 'Groves beat him as an amateur' all stuff like that. ‘I was the hyped-up Olympic gold medallist and then they just brought him in to build a rivalry. I have made him.’","Both DeGale and Groves are on the undercard for Cleverly vs Bellew .

"Everton manager Roberto Martinez admits he may have to take a closer a look at James McCarthy's workload to solve the midfielder's fitness issues. The 24-year-old was sent home by the Republic of Ireland last week after complaining of a hamstring problem and is a doubt for Saturday's visit of West Ham. It is the latest in a series of niggles McCarthy has had this season and Martinez is keen to find the source of the issue. Everton midfielder James McCarthy is a major doubt for the Toffees' next match against West Ham . McCarthy clutches his hamstring during Everton's draw with Sunderland before the international break . Everton midfielder Darron Gibson helps the injured McCarthy during the match at the Stadium of Light . 'We need to assess it. Maybe it's managing the work he does in training,' Martinez told the Liverpool Echo. 'We need to find the right formula because we need to make sure we don't get these sort of injuries on a regular basis. 'James has played a huge amount of games and is still a very young man. 'He's a super fit boy and he shouldn't be picking up these sort of knocks. He's had this same injury before but not in the same leg. 'It's partly normal phases of development and growing into the physical demands of your role.' Ireland assistant manager Roy Keane claimed the Toffees overstate injuries when McCarthy and team-mate Seamus Coleman are sent on international duty, saying: 'You always get the impression from Everton that Seamus and James are both barely able to walk.' But Martinez rejected that accusation. 'James was desperate to be involved with his national team but he couldn't make it,' he added.

"Nathan Cleverly's hotly-anticipated rematch with Tony Bellew at Liverpool's Echo Arena has sold out in under a record-breaking 48 hours. The bout, which takes place on November 22, sees the bitter rivals fight at crusierweight - three years after Cleverly won the original fight via majority decision in the same city in October 2011 at light-heavyweight. The Arena confirmed that not only has the event broken the record as the fastest selling sporting event held at the huge Merseyside venue, but that it is one of the quickest selling spectacles they have staged since opening in January 2008. Nathan Cleverly's (left) rematch with Tony Bellew (right) at Liverpool's Echo Arena sold out in under 48 hours . 'It is huge news Cleverly vs Bellew is 48-hour box office sell out, making it the fastest selling sporting event in the Echo Arena's history,' said promoter and Sportsmail columnist Eddie Hearn. 'We had a little taste of the action this week and with same major announcements coming next week, those lucky enough to have grabbed a ticket and those watching at home are in for a wonderful night of British boxing. 'The atmosphere in the Echo Arena on November 22 will be breathtaking.' The bitter rivals originally fought in October 2011 at light-heavyweight at Liverpool's Echo Arena . Cleverly (centre right) won the original bout via majority decision to hold the WBO light-heavyweight belt . Speaking at the press conference promoting the fight Welshman Cleverly, who lost his WBO light-heavyweight title in a knockout defeat to Sergey Kovalev last year, is adamant he will beat Bellew again but this time by knockout. He said: 'Many people have asked me why I am going back to Liverpool to fight Tony Bellew again and the answer is simple - I don't like him. 'He talks too much and although I've beaten him before in front of his home fans, I am going to KO him this time around. He will not hear the final bell, I can guarantee you that. 'I will deal with him all over again and become a two-weight world champion.' Cleverly (left) and Bellew (right) have both started a war of words against each other leading up to their fight . Bellew, who suffered a jolting loss at the hands of Adonis Stevenson in Quebec last November, insists he will claim a victory comprehensive enough to send his nemesis into retirement. The home favourite, who has bounced back with two low-key stoppage wins over Valery Brudov in March and Julio Cesar Dos Santos in July since losing to Stevenson, said: 'I have been waiting for this fight for three years and now it is here revenge is the only thing on my mind. 'This is a chapter in my life that I need to close and I will do that by ending Nathan Cleverly's career on November 22. 'I am in the sport to be successful and win titles but this fight means more to me than any of that - this is personal, and he will not want to enter a boxing ring after I have finished with him.'

"Outlaw Rebels bikies have been accused of drugging and raping underage girls at a clubhouse on Queensland's Fraser Coast, north of Brisbane. Police are investigating multiple reports alleging gang members sexually assaulted girls under 16 years old at the Rebels Hervey Bay clubhouse before it was destroyed in a fire last year. It is believed some of the girls were paid for sex in drugs, while others were drugged before they unknowingly had sex with the bikies, said Detective Inspector Bruce McNab. Members of a Queensland branch of the Rebels bikie gang are accused of taking underage girls to their clubhouse and drugging and raping them . 'The information we have is that the attacks were very traumatic for the young girls,' he told AAP. 'It would have been extremely traumatic and degrading for them,' he said. 'Members of that criminal organisation were taking underage girls back to the clubhouse for the purposes of having sex with them.' Police fear the girls may have been too scared to report the assaults to authorities because of the bikes' standover tactics. It is alleged the Rebels Hervey Bay clubhouse was where the assaults took place, before it was destroyed in a fire last year . The alleged attacks became known to police following the introduction of Queensland's anti-gang laws. The legislation offers incentives to the public for dobbing in outlaw bikies. Police have received reports from multiple sources, but urge anyone with information to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.

"Jan Vertonghen believes success in the Capital One Cup this season can instil a belief in Tottenham's players that can see them go on and add further silverware in the coming years. Spurs advanced to a quarter-final tie at home to Newcastle after overcoming a valiant Brighton side 2-0 on Wednesday evening and they are now targeting a first trophy since winning the same competition in 2008. The club have also started their Europa League campaign in fine fettle but have struggled for consistent league form under new head coach Mauricio Pochettino, with last Sunday's 2-1 home defeat to Newcastle leaving them down in 11th place. Jan Vertonghen fights for the ball during Tottenham's Capital One Cup game against Brighton . But Vertonghen, who was the only survivor from the starting line-up against the Magpies to retain his place for the cup tie, thinks all competitions will seem more within their reach if Spurs can go all the way and lift the Capital One Cup at Wembley in March. '100 per cent,' he said when asked if League Cup success would breed a winning mentality. 'It gives a bit of belief that we can do big things with the team and I think it would help us. We have got a lot of good players. 'Sometimes you just need a click and I hope we find it now - hopefully in the Capital One Cup. We are in the quarter-final now and hopefully we can force something. 'You have Chelsea, Liverpool, us, Southampton and Newcastle so we play one of the Premier League teams now and hopefully we can go through. Chelsea and Liverpool both have away games but obviously we have to look at ourselves. Vertonghen in action during Tottenham's game against Newcastle at White Hart Lane last week . 'We wanted a home game, Newcastle is a strong opponent but everyone is happy and we can get back at them for last weekend.' Vertonghen moved to White Hart Lane in 2012 after a successful spell with Ajax - although he had to wait three years to collect his first winners' medal at the Amsterdam Arena. 'At Ajax the problem was after six or seven years you lose a bit of the belief of winning trophies,' said the Belgium international. 'The first one there for me was the FA Cup of Holland and I think we won a couple of leagues in a row and then you start believing in yourself that you are able to do it.' Aaron Hughes hopes Brighton can build on their encouraging display at Tottenham in the Championship . Meanwhile, experienced defender Aaron Hughes is hoping a credible display by the Seagulls can galvanise their league form as Sami Hyypia's side look for their first Sky Bet Championship victory since August when they travel to in-form Bournemouth on Saturday. 'We always knew it was going to be a tough game but we just wanted to come here and make sure we put in a good solid performance, and knew if we did that we gave ourselves a better chance of maybe getting something from the game,' he told www.seagulls.co.uk. 'As it turned out it didn't go for us but when we look back we can be pleased with the performance we put in. Hopefully that gives us confidence to go into the rest of the league games from now up until Christmas. 'It is going to be a busy time and probably a time where we have a good opportunity to put some points on the board if we can get a run going. We put in a good shift so on the whole that should give us confidence.'","Tottenham advanced to the quarter-finals of the Capital One Cup after beating Brighton 2-0 at White Hart Lane on Wednesday .

"It was condemned as blasphemous upon its release, and caused outrage among Christians. But three decades later, a leading churchman has declared that Monty Python film The Life Of Brian is in fact a ‘remarkable  tribute to the life of Jesus’. The Rev Professor Richard Burridge, who sits on the General Synod of the Church of England, said Christians who opposed the satirical film were ‘embarrassingly’ ill-informed. All change: Monty Python's 1979 film Life of Brian satirised the life of Christ and a senior clergyman has said the Church of England was wrong to try to get it banned because he believes it is an 'extraordinary tribute to Jesus' The 1979 film follows a hapless . fictional character called Brian, who is born at the same time as Jesus . and is inadvertently  proclaimed to be the Messiah. Jesus’s . only appearance is during the Sermon on the Mount, when Brian is . standing at the back of the crowd and struggling to hear his words. Professor . Burridge, Dean of King’s College London, said the film’s depiction of . 1st century Judea was probably more  accurate than in many Hollywood . films about Jesus. And he said the fact that the comedians had set out . to write a satire about Jesus but had to resort to using a  fictional . failed messiah instead was a tribute to the uniqueness of Christ. Church backing: Reverend Professor Richard Burridge, pictured with the Pope, says Life of Brian 'is a wonderful satire on the way that Jesus¿s own teaching has been used to persecute others' Classic: A scene from the 1979 Monty Python film, which starred Michael Palin, John Cleese, Terry Jones, Eric Idle, Terry Gilliam and the late Graham Chapman. It was wildly popular but was also widely criticised . He . said: ‘I think it is an extraordinary tribute to the life and work and . teaching of Jesus – that they couldn’t actually blaspheme or make a joke . out of it. ‘They were . satirising closed minds, they were satirising fundamentalism and . persecution of others and at the same time  saying the one person who . rises above all this was Jesus … and I think that the Church missed . that.’ Fresh start: The Pythons have reformed but member Michael Palin says if they tried to make the film today they would face an army of 'heavily armed' fanatics, making it impossible to do . Many Christians at . the time, led by campaigner Mary Whitehouse, considered the film an . outrage for supposedly poking fun at Christianity, and picketed cinemas . to have it banned. It was outlawed by 11 councils, and the ban in . Torbay, Devon, was only lifted in 2008. Professor Burridge made the comments on BBC Radio 4’s Today show, which was being guest-edited by Python Michael Palin.","Rev Richard Burridge says Church was 'embarrassingly' ill-informed .

"Mauricio Pochettino insists his struggling Tottenham side are being inhibited by the size of the White Hart Lane pitch, and that it is partly to blame for the team losing three of their five home league games this season. The Spurs boss, who watched his side lose at home to Newcastle on Sunday, believes the narrow pitch is making it easier for opposing teams to sit deep and soak up pressure. According to Premier League figures quoted in the Telegraph, Spurs' pitch is one of the smallest in the Premier League, with only QPR and Stoke playing on smaller surfaces. Pochettino's former club Southampton  play on the joint-largest  pitch in the division. Mauricio Pochettino believes the small size of the White Hart Lane pitch is counting against his team .

Stoke City - 100m x 66m . 20. Queens Park Rangers - 100m x 65.85m . Rankings by total pitch area according to official Premier League figures . Prior to Tottenham's Capital One Cup fourth-round clash against Brighton on Wednesday, Pochettino explained why he feels his team are being handicapped by the White Hart Lane pitch. The former Saints boss said: 'Our style means we need a bigger place to play because we play a positional game and it's true that White Hart Lane is a little bit tight. 'It's better for the opponent. For example, on Sunday Newcastle play deep, same with West Brom and Liverpool, and it was difficult for us. We need time to adapt in our new set-up and understand better our position on the pitch.' Pochettino's argument might carry a bit more weight if his side had fared better on their travels, but Spurs have been equally limp away from home. They have one win from four fixtures on the road, and that was at West Ham, who play on the seventh-smallest pitch in the division. Tottenham's other away days have included a disappointing 2-2 draw with Sunderland (joint-biggest) and a 4-1 loss at Manchester City (also joint-biggest). The only result that really bears out Pochettino's claim that his side operate better on a a bigger pitch is the commendable 1-1 stalemate at Arsenal, whose Emirates Stadium pitch is one of the joint-largest in the Premier League. But even that outcome could be seen to contradict the Argentine's argument as the large Emirates surface was designed to make it harder for visiting teams to sit deep and deny the Gunners space - precisely what Tottenham did in the match. Arsenal moved their home Champions League games to Wembley in 1998 and played on a bigger pitch . Arsenal's large playing surface is a far cry from the compactness of their old  Highbury ground, which was part of the reason they  took  the extraordinary step of moving their Champions League home games to Wembley for the 1998-99 and 1999-00 seasons. Although the decision was primarily financially motivated, the Gunners felt their expansive game was undermined by Highbury's relatively small dimensions, offering a precedent to Pochettino's complaints. The Highbury pitch had  measurements of 100m long x 67m wide (the same as White Hart Lane) compared to Wembley's 105m x 69m. Stadium:mk, where Spurs may temporarily move to while their new ground is being built, is larger than White Hart Lane, at 105x68m. Pochettino did not attribute his team's indifferent form solely to the size of the White Hart Lane pitch though, and admitted that the team needs to improve its mental strength. Pochettino admitted that the mentality of his team must improve after the home defeat by Newcastle . The Argentine manager admitted that his team need to display more resilience. He said: 'I think we are the psychologists. The players want to hear the manager and the staff, the assistant manager, the goalkeeper coach. We can help them. 'In my career always, when I was a player, we had a lot of meetings, just the players for good and bad things. Maybe here, it's not the habit. We tried to push that because it's important sometimes that the players have different meetings with the captain to realise some different situations. The players can always improve in their own meetings. Harry Kane is in line to start against Brighton on Wednesday after his Europa League hat-trick last week . Brighton drew 1-1 with Rotherham on Saturday and are a lowly 21st in the Championship . 'We did a lot of work in groups, and as individuals. In the training ground, in meeting rooms, in my personal office, in different areas. But always you need more time to change the habits. We talk about mentalities and changing habits. 'The mental process is always more slow than the physical or tactical. We are in a good way, I think our job does not reflect in the table. This is maybe a difficult period, but it is the process we have to go through.' Pochettino is expected to hand a start to Harry Kane for the visit of Brighton on Wednesday, after the striker was dropped for the Newcastle clash despite scoring a hat-trick three days earlier against Asteras Tripoli in the Europa League.","Mauricio Pochettino says the small White Hart Lane pitch inhibits Spurs .

Aston Villa right back Alan Hutton has been ruled out of the clash against Tottenham with injury . Tottenham . Mauricio Pochettino will have to decide on whether to hand Harry Kane his first Premier League start at Aston Villa on Sunday. Kane pushed his claims for selection after scorimg his eighth goal of the season in the Capital One Cup win over Brighton - in which Pochettino made 10 changes. The likes of Hugo Lloris, Younes Kaboul, Christian Eriksen, Erik Lamela and Emmanuel Adebayor are likely to return to the team but Nabil Bentaleb (ankle) and Kyle Walker (pelvis) are still missing.

Harry Kane celebrates scoring for Tottenham in their midweek Capital One Cup win over Brighton . Key match stats (supplied by Opta) Aston Villa have scored just one goal in their last six Premier League matches against Tottenham, including failing to score in the last four meetings in a row. Emmanuel Adebayor has scored more goals against Aston Villa (7) than versus any other opponent in the Premier League. Adebayor has netted four in four Premier League starts for Spurs against the Villans. Tottenham have won eight and lost none of the last 11 Premier League matches against Aston Villa (D3). Andros Townsend has scored on his last two Premier League visits to Villa Park. Aston Villa haven't beaten Tottenham at Villa Park since Martin Laursen headed home five minutes from time in a 2-1 Premier League victory on New Year's Day in 2008 . Aston Villa have become the ninth different side to lose five successive Premier League games without scoring a single goal. The PL record is seven (Ipswich Town in 1995). The last time that Aston Villa went five league games without scoring was March 1992. They have never failed to score in six consecutive league games. Andreas Weimann has played a hand in 75 per cent of Aston Villa’s league goals so far this season, scoring two and assisting another. Tottenham have not drawn any of their last 37 Premier League games 0-0 - the longest run of its kind among the 20 current PL clubs. Spurs have scored more goals in the opening 30 minutes of their matches (5) than Aston Villa have managed all season (4).","Alan Hutton ruled out of Aston Villa side to face Tottenham on Sunday .

"Tottenham striker Harry Kane is happy with his current goal haul but hopes to continue his fine scoring form with chances in the Premier League. The 21-year-old scored his seventh of the campaign as Spurs beat Championship side Brighton in the Capital One Cup on Wednesday. Kane, who is outscoring fellow Spurs strikers Emmanuel Adebayor and Roberto Soldado, still hasn't been handed a Premier League start by Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino, despite his form. Academy product Harry Kane celebrates scoring for Tottenham against Brighton in the Capital One Cup . 'I'm always happy to be scoring and getting those goals inside the box, those strikers' goals, is always good,' Kane told Spurs TV. 'It (the number of goals) is a good return but I'm concentrating on the next game now and hopefully I will get some minutes and get some goals. 'These are the sort of games I want to be scoring in and getting myself out there, I always enjoy playing - I just want to keep playing and keep scoring.'

Pochettino insisted after the Brighton game that Kane, who scored a Europa League hat-trick last week, will have to continue to be patient. 'He shares with another striker like Adebayor or Soldado the minutes in the official games,' said Pochettino. 'We need to understand that we are in different competitions.

"They shuffled away from Trent Bridge in high good humour. They had enjoyed a day of strong ale, fierce sunshine and Jimmy Anderson. There were tales to tell and memories to store. In short, it was just like the game God and Grace invented. Small wonder that every face wore the broadest of beams. On such an evening, with so many of the audience in such a mood, it felt vaguely unseemly to harbour doubts about the validity of the event. But those doubts were being expressed by those who spent their careers coping with all manner of Test wickets, and their disquiet was unanimous. Lighting up the day: Anderson was brilliant despite the poor quality of the wicket . For the fact is that the first Test of this keenly awaited series has not been a true contest between bat and ball since the first morning. The straw-coloured strip on which gifted players are required to perform has proved as dead as Python’s parrot. The fast men have bent their backs and spilled their sweat, but their efforts have proved largely unprofitable. Stuart Broad’s full-hearted attempts to generate pace and movement from the unrewarding surface have been as futile as Andy Murray hitting serves in a paddy field. Everybody has enjoyed time to play; so much time that the most accomplished batsmen seemed to be weighing up the alternatives before deciding on an appropriate shot. Of course, wickets have fallen, since good bowlers possess the skill and spirit to find a way. But the odds have been laughably stacked against their best efforts. Steve Birks, the Nottinghamshire groundsman, got his retaliation in first at the close of the opening day. Aware that the county might be accused of preparing a pitch to last through five lucrative Test match days, he issued a statement of explanation. ‘We wanted to produce a pitch with pace, bounce and carry, which hasn’t happened unfortunately,’ he announced. Partnership: Anderson and Joe Root also became part of England's highest ever last wicket stand in a Test . Respect: Anderson and Root are applauded off at lunch after their inspirational display . Man of the hour: The Trent Bridge crowd had one big topic to talk about at the end of the day . It was a memorable piece of understatement which apparently produced dark chuckles in the England dressing room. Pace, bounce and carry were conspicuous non-starters. The result was that nicks failed to carry, honest endeavour went miserably unrewarded and the draw seemed depressingly predestined. None of which detracts in the slightest from yesterday’s contribution from Jimmy Anderson. For the cricket lover, few things can match the sight of a tail-ender bravely prospering, defying the probabilities, rising far beyond his status. Anderson answered all these demands in his riotous alliance with Joe Root. A wonderful air of unreality hung over proceedings as an England team which once had scuffled to avoid the follow-on marched on to a first innings lead. At one stage, it seemed roughly as plausible a prospect as Germany scoring seven against Brazil. But with Anderson contriving to bat like Sobers reborn, the fantasy was duly delivered. A game which relishes records celebrated the onslaught of startling statistics as Anderson and Root laid about them. Having broken heart and back in the Indian innings, Anderson relished the chance of answering in kind. The most entrancing of cricket grounds came thrillingly to life as Jimmy played his shots; each cut, drive and glance detonating explosions of approval. Whether he would have found the time to flourish such vibrant strokes on a more challenging surface was a question which did not detain the Trent Bridge clientele. Brothers in arm: The brilliant partnership of Joe Root and Anderson was a big highlight . Naturally, there were regrets: that Anderson did not reach the hundred for which the whole of Nottingham was yearning; that the stand — during which both batsmen had declined a steady stream of singles — fell just two short of the double-century. But these were the merest quibbles in the face of such enjoyment. There was even the threat of robust altercation, when Ishant Sharma came marching, jabbing, bawling down the pitch after his appeal for a catch off Root was rejected. In truth, there is something rather undignified in a fast bowler losing his rag when the last-wicket stand is surging towards 200; still more when the replay reveals that the batsman missed the ball by a country mile. In any event, Anderson was equal to the occasion, striding down the wicket and guiding young Root away from hostilities, clearly anxious that his dream innings should not be disrupted. Up in the radio commentary box, the sage of the Broad Acres was running out of insults to describe the 22-yard strip of straw. ‘You know what this pitch would be good for?’ asked Geoffrey Boycott. ‘A timeless Test. Like that one they had in South Africa before the war. Lasted 10 days, didn’t it? This is the pitch for that.’ The thought occurred that Geoffrey might have been in his element in such a Test match, but it was swiftly banished. For, despite all the misgivings, this was a strangely compelling day of Test cricket. Yet we knew, beyond decent doubt, that it might have been so much better. Fire power: Anderson hits another great shot mid-way through his impressive display .","The quality of the wicket at Trent bridge has been troublesome for pace .
The odds have been stacked in the favour of batsmen over bowlers .

"Louis van Gaal is ‘a democratic, empathetic human being’. He has a ‘strong personality’ as well as a ‘strong philosophy’ and he believes he can ‘live up to all the expectations’. And with that unrevealing self-portrait, one of the most significant men in British sport introduced himself to his public. In the week of a compelling Open golf championship and a crucial Lord’s Test match, the introduction of the latest manager of Manchester United won an extraordinary share of attention. New job: Louis van Gaal leaving for a Man Utd training session in Los Angeles . Unveliing: The new boss with club legend Sir Bobby Charlton at his arrival announcement . This owes much to the nation’s ongoing obsession with football but still more to a curious public fascination with events at Old Trafford. Van Gaal was playing politics when he described United as ‘the biggest club in the world’. But the claim was not entirely laughable, hence the importance of his new post. United’s recent activities on the field have been wholly underwhelming. Having won the Premier League title with an ailing team a year ago, they saw that team fall apart last season, to the extent that they were flattered by finishing seventh. Even a manager of 23 years’ experience, a man who has won everything that European club football has to offer, would be hard-pressed to fashion anything remotely formidable from the prevailing mediocrity. But then, we remember their extraordinary resources. Last week, United concluded a 10-year, £75million-per-year kit deal with adidas. Already in place is a seven-year, £51m-per-year Chevrolet sponsorship, plus a trifling £17m-per-year deal with AON for, of all things, their training kit. These are merely the highlights, for they are following all manner of lucrative avenues. The fact is, they are wading through oceans of bank-notes, enjoying the kind of resources which no British club have ever experienced. Some will consider this kind of affluence to be mildly obscene and they may have a point. But since wealth ultimately dictates results, sooner or later United will get things right, and the consequences will be dramatic. Out for a stroll: Jonny Evans and Anders Lindegaard lead the way as United head for training . Touching down: Manchester United's players step off the plane in LAX airport . Will Van Gaal be the man to deliver the required results? Clearly, nobody knows; equally clearly, it does not matter. For the fact is that Manchester United have ceased to be the football club that we all knew and many loved. Instead, they are a corporation who regard football as their ‘core business’ but who have a whole stream of alternative  activities, all producing profits for the Glazer family of Palm Beach, Florida. In this corporation, Van Gaal effectively serves as chief executive (football). If his division produces results, all well and good. If those results should falter — and we are talking months rather than seasons — then he will be replaced. His last two jobs, with Bayern Munich and the Holland national team, each lasted for two years. Although he has signed a three-year contract with United, it seems highly unlikely that he will see it through to the end. For scrutiny will be intense, the pressures will be unrelenting and his principal employers — none of whom could ever be mistaken for a ‘football person’ — will be intolerant of anything save overwhelming success. But Van Gaal is 62. He understands how the executive game is played and we may be sure that his contract will insulate him from the perils of premature redundancy. Even so, he will not be at Old Trafford for the long term. Beach boys: Manchester United's players took a stroll on Santa Monica beach in Los Angeles . Sights and sounds: David de Gea and Juan Mata take in the picturesque scenery as they stroll . He will not be given time to identify and cultivate young talent and he would not expect such indulgence. Instead, he will be asked to supply titles and trophies to order. And should he fail, then he will be treated like any other executive who misses his sales targets. Such is the way in which modern corporations are run. Just 14 months have passed since Sir Alex Ferguson departed the manager’s office and already the memories are sepia-tinted. Which is not to say that he will not do an efficient job, however brief his tenure. An untalented man could not have won titles in Holland, Spain and Germany, nor could he have handled his country’s World Cup efforts with such energy and flair. He will upset a good many players and staff, he will fall out with referees and opposing managers on a regular basis and when the axe falls, he will doubtless blame the media. But while he is there, he will know where his loyalty lies. Not to the 75,731 who fill the stadium every other week; cheering and singing and creating that raucous atmosphere which television finds so appealing. Not to the legions of disenfranchised United fans, remotely following every pass and tackle. Certainly not to any romantic notion of the men who built the club; from Busby, Best and the Babes, through to Giggs and Rooney. No, Louis van Gaal must serve a more demanding constituency, one composed of adidas, Chevrolet, AON and that folksy, down-home family from Palm Beach, Florida. In short, he must place himself at the mercy of the balance sheet, as befits a chief executive (football). By that test, the young Ferguson would have lasted about six months. We must hope that United’s latest ‘democratic, empathetic human being’ stays around for a little longer. Germans were a class apart . However much some of us wanted to see Lionel Messi lift the World Cup, the trophy ultimately came to rest in the most deserving hands. Germany’s power and class set them apart from their challengers. Yet only in the week following the final did we learn the true extent of that class. There was the training centre they built in the fishing village of Santo Andre in Bahia state, their constructive contributions to the local economy and the efforts they made to socialise with the local people. Class apart: Germany's stars celebrating after winning the World Cup . Then there was their Arsenal midfielder Mesut Ozil, who had decided to devote a slice of his World Cup bonus to paying the hospital bills of 11 Brazilian children. When Germany won the Cup, he expanded that number to 23. Of course, Ozil and his colleagues can afford such gestures but that is scarcely the point. This was a World Cup held in the spiritual home of the game and Germany had recognised the need to honour the occasion by respecting their hosts. It was a considerable performance by a remarkable football nation. Tenacious Tiger battles on . If you wanted to follow Tiger Woods’s progress at The Open, then you had to search a long way down the field. The false promise of an opening 69 was followed by the cruel reality of a 77, then a 73 to put him three over. He made the cut by a single shot. Somebody congratulated him and he had the grace to appear embarrassed. At such times, we inevitably recall how it used to be, when his touch was impeccable and his game was governed by a fierce rage for perfection. Tenacious: Tiger Woods is battling on at the Open despite a disappointing week . Even those elders who remember Hogan and revered Palmer, Nicklaus and the gods of the game had seen nothing quite like him. In his days of glory, the majors were reduced to a struggle for second place. The winner was predestined, the trophy was spoken for. At 38, he must be aware that such days will never return. But he battles on, searching for the spark, with a tenacity which does him great credit. As an intensely proud man, Tiger Woods will neither welcome nor value our sympathy. So he must settle for our unbounded admiration. PS . A drowsy Lord’s afternoon. England are grafting diligently in the heat and Sir Ian Botham is gossiping with David Lloyd, aka ‘Bumble’, about the dogs they have owned. ‘That one you had,’ says Botham, ‘the one who used to bite my ankles.’ ‘Bertie,’ says Bumble. ‘Yeah, Bertie,’ says Botham. ‘What happened to him?’ ‘He’s on the mantelpiece, wi’ me Dad,’ says Bumble. Truly, there are times when Sky’s admirable cricket coverage seems to have been scripted by Alan Bennett.","Van Gaal dealing with kind of money no British club has ever experienced .
