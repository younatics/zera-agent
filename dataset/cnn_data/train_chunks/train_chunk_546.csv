A man accused of raping two British women in Barbados has been cleared of all charges after the victims protested his innocence. Dr Rachel Turner, 30, and Diane Davies, 63, were convinced Derick Crawford was not the man who attacked them. Mr Crawford had already spent 18 months behind bars after being wrongly arrested in May 2011. Victims: Derick Crawford, who was cleared of rape, with Dr Rachel Turner (right) and Diane Davies (middle) Dr Rachel Turner (centre) has struck up a friendship with Derick Crawford (left), the man accused of raping her. Turner and actress Hillary Heath were at Holetown Court after two charges of rape against the Barbadian man were dismissed . Cleared: Derick Crawford (right) in conversation with president of Barbados Bar Association Andrew Pilgrim outside the Holetown Court in Barbados . Dr Rachel Turner, from Hertfordshire, and Diane Davies, from North Wales, were raped within days of each other in Barbados in 2010 . But yesterday, after Dr Turner gave . evidence for a second time, the courts finally accepted the women's . protestations and the island's director of public prosecutions ordered . that the charges be dropped. The women were assaulted within days . of each other in 2010 in almost identical attacks when they were dragged . off the same remote beach path and raped in a deserted hotel building. But after Mr Crawford was arrested, . university researcher Dr Turner and retired primary school teacher Mrs . Davies told police that he bore no resemblance to their attacker. They maintained that their rapist was . ten to 15 years younger and had a different voice, build and facial . features. Police claimed they had a confession from Mr Crawford, 47, . something he says was extracted through torture. Yesterday, Dr Turner emerged from the . courthouse, in the parish of St James, with Mr Crawford by her side. Criticising the police handling of the case, she said: 'It was a total . sham. I told the hearing that I am convinced this was not the man who . attacked me. 'I'm glad the case has been dismissed . against Mr Crawford, but there are a lot of questions which still need . to be answered. I would like to see an investigation into this . investigation.' Savage: Mrs Davies' face was bruised and swollen after the attack, which left her with a broken collarbone and ribs . Dr Turner, from Letchworth, . Hertfordshire, moved to Barbados after studying for a PhD in tropical . coastal management and holds a research post at the University of the . West Indies. She said: 'I want to know if Mr . Crawford may have even been beaten when his statement was taken by the . police. The circumstances surrounding the non-existing evidence have to . be known and we want them made public.' Widower Mrs Davies, speaking from her . home in Anglesey, Wales, told the Mail: 'I am delighted that Derick has . been cleared and proved that what we have been saying all along is true. 'But this is only the first step. What . we want now is for the police in Barbados to admit they have made a . mistake and to say they are going to go all out to find the real . culprit.' Last month Mrs Davies, who was raped while on holiday, flew to Barbados to give evidence at one of three preliminary hearings. While there, she met Mr Crawford for the first time after the two women helped to secure bail. The grandmother said: 'We have been . saying for almost two years that they had the wrong man and for that . whole time they have ignored us. It is so wrong that it has gone on for . this long.' Mr Crawford, who lived with his mother . and brother before his arrest, declined to speak after the ruling . yesterday, but spent 30 minutes outside court thanking Dr Turner. He has previously thanked the 'very . brave' women for waiving their anonymity and fighting for his release. His lawyer described them as 'two very determined English ladies'. Mr Crawford was represented by Andrew . Pilgrim, president of the Barbados Bar Association, only after actress . Hilary Heath heard about the case and paid his legal fees. Meeting: Rachel Turner (left) and Diane Davies (centre) met Derick Crawford (right) outside the court in Holetown, Barbados . Face-to-face: Hilary Heath (left) also met with Derick Crawford along with Rachel Turner and Diane Davies. The three British women paid for an attorney to represent Mr Crawford . Mrs Heath, 66, an addiction . counsellor, was raped at knifepoint when a masked intruder broke into . her Barbados home in 2004. Afterwards, she made a formal complaint about . the police's poor attempts to catch her attacker. The two latest victims believe police . rushed to charge Mr Crawford to limit the damage to the isle's image as a . holiday destination. Royal Barbados Police Commissioner . Darwin Dottin said yesterday the force had 'an excellent reputation in . the law enforcement community and is highly regarded'. He added: 'This is not to say that we . never make mistakes. On the contrary, on such occasions it is our policy . to admit our failings. 'To suggest that we put the  reputation of our country before the welfare and comfort of our  visitors is utterly wrong.' Convinced: Rachel Turner and Diane Davies said police ignored their insistence that Derick Crawford is not the man who attacked them . Speaking out: The women have waived their right to anonymity to speak out as they believe the real rapist is still at large . Dark side of paradise: Mrs Davies was dragged from a path near this beach in exclusive Holetown, Barbados .","Derick Crawford was accused of raping the two women two years ago .

A California judge has been publicly criticised today for controversial comments he made saying a rape victim didn't put up a fight during her assault and that if someone doesn't want sexual intercourse, the body 'will not permit that to happen.' Echoing the widely condemned comments on 'legitimate rape' of outgoing U.S. representative Todd Akin, Superior Court Judge Derek Johnson said 'If someone doesn’t want to have sexual intercourse, the body shuts down.' Furthermore, the states Commission on Judicial Performance attacked the the judge for taking ten years off the recommended sentence for the rapist in the case, imposing a six-year sentence instead. Scroll Down for Video . Controversial: Superior Court Judge Derek Johnson said 'If someone doesn¿t want to have sexual intercourse, the body shuts down.' Metin Gurel was sentenced in 2008 by Johnson after being convicted of rape, forcible oral copulation, domestic battery, stalking and making threats against his former live-in girlfriend. Prosecutors said that on the day he raped the woman he had threatened to mutilate the woman's face and vagina with a screwdriver he had heated up. 'I’m not a gynecologist, but I can tell you something,' said Johnson according to documents released Thursday. 'If someone doesn’t want to have sexual intercourse, the body shuts down. The body will not permit that to happen unless a lot of damage in inflicted, and we heard nothing about that in this case. 'That tells me that the victim in this case, although she wasn’t necessarily willing, she didn’t put up a fight.' The commission which said that it only learned of the remarks in May 2012 voted 10 to 0 that Johnson deserved his public admonishment from the body which is made up of judges, lawyers and members of the public. Metin Gurel was sentenced in 2008 by Johnson after being convicted of rape, forcible oral copulation, domestic battery, stalking and making threats against his former live-in girlfriend . In addition to his claims on rape at the sentencing, the judge who has been with the Orange County Superior Court since 2000 also said that the rape was 'technical' and not 'a real, live criminal case.' 'To treat this case like the rape cases that we all hear about is an insult to victims of rape,'the judge said reported the LA Times. 'I think it’s an insult. I think it trivializes a rape.' Judge Johnson has apologised for his comments but the San Francisco based Commission on Judicial Performance said that his comments flew in the face of Californian law, which does not require proof that a rape victim attempted to resist an attack. 'In the commission’s view, the judge’s remarks reflected outdated, biased and insensitive views about sexual assault victims who do not ‘put up a fight,’  the agency said in a news release Thursday. The controversial comments were made at the Orange County Courthouse in 2008 - but not reported until May 2012 . 'Such comments cannot help but diminish public confidence and trust in the impartiality of the judiciary. In his response to the commission and at his appearance, Judge Johnson conceded his comments were inappropriate and apologized.' Johnson remains on the bench. 'Neither Judge Johnson nor I will be making comment,' said Johnson’s attorney, Paul S. Meyer . In August, Todd Akin who was a nominee for the Senate in Missouri  said during an interview that women don't become pregnant if they are the victim of a   'legitimate' rape while explaining his anti-abortion views on TV. Voicing his opinion: Rep Akin spoke to TV station KTVI in St Louis this morning . Opinions: Senate candidate Representative Todd Akin said that women were unlikely to get pregnant from 'legitimate rape' He told the Jaco Report that it was rare for a woman to become pregnant after being raped because the 'female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down'. The GOP senate hopeful was explaining his no-exception rule when it comes to abortion. 'First of all, from what I understand from doctors, (pregnancy from rape) is really rare,' the GOP stalwart told KTVI-TV. 'If it’s a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down.' He went on to say: 'But let’s assume that maybe that didn’t work or something. I think there should be some punishment, but the punishment ought to be on the rapist and not attacking the child.' Todd Akin did not win election to the Senate and is leaving his post as a member of the House of Representatives.","Judge Derek Johnson did not impose the recommended sentence on a convicted rapist and said about the victim: 'If someone doesn’t want to have sexual intercourse, the body shuts down.'

A week after learning that half of the people in England are actually of German descent, their Tuetonic cousins have branded them as telly-obsessed, alcoholic hooligans with bad dental hygiene and a love of casual sex and trashy celebrities.

It also described you as a typical Englander if you answered yes to dreaming of Pizza, Pippa or Camilla, according to the Daily Star.

A millionaire property developer and his wife, who say they were ruined because of a simple banking error, have lost their High Court claim for more than £3milion in damages. Michael and Carol Ann Gatt are now faced with a £1million legal bill after they were left living in a bungalow on a building site near their former home - £4million Melksham Court, a Cotswold country estate once sought after by the actor Hugh Grant. The couple, both 66, claimed Barclays wrongly told credit reference agencies Mr Gatt was over his agreed overdraft limit, ruining his credit rating and killing their business. Ruined: Michael and Carol Ann Gatt say they were ruined because of a simple banking error. They lost their claim for more than £3million in damages . Judge Patrick Moloney QC rejected claims of negligence, breach of contract and defamation and said the couple probably would have lost their assets in the credit crunch anyway. The Gatts had ‘borrowed beyond their means’ and their business would have been unlikely to survive the crash in the property market, he said. Speaking after the judgment was handed down, Mrs Gatt told Judge Moloney: ‘It is an absolute mockery, I have £30 in my bank account’. The judge, who heard the High Court trial last year, said the Gatts had been successful property developers who ‘lived the lifestyle of prosperous, indeed wealthy, people’. They sold their £2million home in Kent in 2004 and moved to Melksham Court, a medieval manor house with substantial grounds and outlying cottages. There, they had space for Mrs Gatt's stable of quarter horses, a £240,000 mobile home, as well as Mr Gatt's Ferrari and collection of Harley-Davidson motorcycles. The judge continued: ‘Plainly, they were not afraid of borrowing, as some people are, but regarded being overdrawn for business and living purposes as a normal condition, confident of being able to repay when their ship came in.' Former home: The couple were left living in a bungalow on a building site in the shadow of their previous home - £4million Melksham Court (pictured) Disaster struck for the couple in April 2008 when they were refused remortgage finance by RBS on their home, which they needed to plough into development projects. They soon learned that Barclays had provided reports to credit reference agencies stating that Mr Gatt's account was ‘delinquent’, since it was £260,000 overdrawn when the agreed limit was only £1,500. Lack of finance resulted in the collapse of development projects and their GLN Holdings Ltd business, the repossession of Melksham Court and Mr Gatt's eventual bankruptcy. Unable to fund anywhere else to live, they moved into a bungalow, owned by their son, on the boundary of the historic Melksham Court estate, in Stinchcombe, near Dursley. The bungalow was part of a development property and so the couple, who had once lived in the nine-bed stately home, were left living a stone's throw away, surrounded by building works. They sued on the basis that, although Mr Gatt was indeed £260,000 overdrawn, it was with the permission of the bank and should not have led to adverse credit reports. Claims: The couple claimed Barclays wrongly told credit reference agencies Mr Gatt was over his agreed overdraft limit . Giving his judgment today, Judge Moloney said that, on the evidence before him, the bank was correct in saying that the account was well overdrawn. The higher limit had been sanctioned to provide funds in February 2007, but for four months only, after which it reverted to the £1,500 limit. The information disclosed by the bank to the credit agencies was with Mr Gatt's contractual consent and was ‘true and not misleading’, he said. ‘It is more probable that, like so many others, the Gatts, who had prospered on the rising market but had spent their profits and continued borrowing beyond their means, would not have been able to survive the falling market even if these credit reports had not been published, and even if they had continued to speculate with more borrowed money into 2009. ‘In short, they would probably have lost their net assets, which were in fact very few, in any event.’ The judge allowed a counterclaim by the bank for the repayment by Mrs Gatt of £847,287 in outstanding loans and overdrafts, as well as £80,000 in costs. Mr Gatt had originally been a claimant in the case, but his claim was bought by the bank from his trustee in bankruptcy and discontinued. He was in court alongside his wife throughout.","Michael and Carol Ann Gatt were left living in a bungalow on a building site .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 19:05 EST, 8 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 20:22 EST, 8 January 2013 . A judge has reduced any possible sentence for Pfc Bradley Manning after finding he was illegally punished for allegedly sending reams of classified documents to website WikiLeaks. Army Col Denise Lind ruled during a pretrial hearing on Tuesday that authorities went too far in their strict confinement of Manning at a Marine Corps brig and should get 112 days cut from any prison sentence he receives if convicted. Manning was held in a windowless cell for nine months in Quantico, Virginia, in 2010 and 2011 for 23 hours a day, sometimes with no clothing. Brig officials said it was to keep him from hurting himself or others. Wrongly held: Army Pfc. Bradley Manning is seen escorted out of a courthouse in Fort Meade, Maryland on Monday after a pretrial hearing found him having been illegally punished . Lind said Manning's confinement was 'more rigorous than necessary.' She added that the conditions 'became excessive in relation to legitimate government interests.' Manning faces 22 charges, including aiding the enemy, which carries a maximum sentence of life behind bars. His trial begins March 6. The 25-year-old intelligence analyst had sought to have the charges thrown out, arguing the conditions were egregious. Military prosecutors had recommended a seven-day sentence reduction, conceding Manning was improperly kept for that length of time on highly restrictive suicide watch, contrary to a psychiatrist's recommendation. Lind rejected a defense contention that . brig commanders were influenced by higher-ranking Marine Corps officials . at Quantico or the Pentagon. Prison cut: Any prison sentence Manning receives if convicted for allegedly sending reams of classified documents to website WikiLeaks will be cut by 112 days the judge ruled . Manning showed no reaction as Lind read her decision. He fidgeted when the judge took the bench to announce her ruling, sometimes tapping his chin or mouth with a pen and frequently glancing at his attorney's notepad, but those movements tapered off during the hour and 45 minutes it took the judge to read the lengthy opinion. Mike McKee, one of about a dozen Manning supporters in the courtroom, said he was disappointed. He called the ruling 'very conservative,' although he said he didn't expect the charges to be thrown out. 'I don't find it a victory,' McKee said. 'Credit like that becomes much less valuable if the sentence turns out to be 80 years.' Jeff Paterson of the Bradley Manning Support Network, which is funding Manning's defense, said the sentencing credit 'doesn't come close to compensating Bradley' for his harsh treatment. 'The ruling is not strong enough to give the military pause before mistreating the next American soldier awaiting trial,' Paterson wrote in an email. Lind ruled on the first day of a scheduled four-day hearing at Fort Meade, near Baltimore. The hearing is partly to determine whether Manning's motivation matters. Prosecutors want the judge to bar the defense from producing evidence at trial regarding his motive for allegedly leaking hundreds of thousands of secret war logs and diplomatic cables. They say motive is irrelevant to whether he leaked intelligence, knowing it would be seen by al-Qaida . Manning allegedly told an online confidant-turned-informant that he leaked the material because 'I want people to see the truth' and 'information should be free.' Defense attorney David Coombs said on Tuesday that barring such evidence would cripple the defense's ability to argue that Manning leaked only information that he believed couldn't hurt the United States or help a foreign nation. Manning has offered to take responsibility for the leaks in a pending plea offer but he still could face trial on charges such as aiding the enemy. The Crescent, Okla., native is accused of leaking classified Iraq and Afghanistan war logs and more than 250,000 diplomatic cables while working as an intelligence analyst in Baghdad in 2009 and 2010. He is also charged with leaking 2007 video of a U.S. helicopter crew gunning down 11 men, including a Reuters news photographer and his driver. The Pentagon concluded the troops acted appropriately, having mistaken the camera equipment for weapons. Manning supporters consider him a whistleblower whose actions exposed war crimes and helped trigger the pro-democracy Arab Spring uprisings in late 2010.","Judge found authorities went too far in nine-month confinement of Manning in 2010 and 2011 .

However, online sales now account for 54 per cent of its revenue after rising by 17 per cent over the past 19 weeks, according to The Times. As the company seeks to cut costs on its catalogue division, one likely strategy is to open more High Street branches selling its brands. 'We are an online company looking to open stores,' chief executive Alan White said. Brands: The retailer specialises in aiming its products at middle-aged women and larger customers . For men: Jacamo, promoted by cricketer Andrew Flintoff, is another successful N Brown brand . The retailer currently operates a total of 48 stores, including seven which opened in the past year selling products from Simply Be, the 'plus size' women's brand. Mr White said N Brown would open up to six more Simply Be stores in 2013, and would aim to end up with a network of 25 stores with 'nationwide coverage'. Some of the branches will also sell the Jacamo range for larger men, which is promoted by former England cricketer Andrew Flintoff. Shares in the firm have risen by 60 per cent over the course of the past year as it saw strong growth in the U.S. as well as in its British stores and online. Struggling: HMV is one of many well-known firms to have gone into administration in recent months . The success of N Brown, which has been operating from Manchester since 1859, stands in stark contrast to the fate of other major brands. This week it was announced that both music retailer HMV and video rental chain Blockbuster have gone into administration after seeing their profits relentlessly squeezed by the rise of digital media and online retailers. The iconic firms could disappear from the High Street within months if administrators do not succeed in finding a buyer for them. Other companies hit by the double-dip recession have been forced to close down altogether in the wake of squeezed consumer spending. JJB Sports, Comet and Jessops all shut up shop recently as the High Street vacancy rate reached an astonishing one in nine. Among the others to go into administration are Peacocks, La Senza, Blacks, Game, and Clinton Cards, while . more are expected as the economy shows little sign of picking up any time soon. N Brown may be expanding its physical presence, but the past few years have seen brutal conditions on the High Street as a host of well-known retailers have gone out of business .

Rapist: Hesam Khosravi kicked and beat his victim and threatened to tape up her mouth during the attack last April in Trafford, Greater Manchester . A 24-year-old Iranian immigrant who filmed himself raping a woman at knife-point on his Apple iPad was today jailed for six years. Hesam Khosravi kicked and beat his victim and threatened to tape her mouth up during the attack in Trafford, Greater Manchester. He pulled her around by her hair and forced her to strip and perform a sex act before raping her, Minshull Crown Court in Manchester heard. During the harrowing half-hour of footage, which was shown in court, Khosravi can be heard laughing and commentating on the assault in Farsi as the woman cries and sobs throughout. Police found the recording on his iPad after he was arrested for an unconnected offence - but Khosravi claimed it was consensual ‘role-play’. Before the video was shown, the judge warned the court of the 'very distressing' footage and told the public gallery: ‘This is the time to leave if anyone does not want to watch the video.’ Jonathan Dickinson, prosecuting, said Khosravi rested his iPad on a windowsill, lit the room with a halogen lamp and pressed record in a deliberate bid to capture the assault last April. He said: ‘He begins by asking her questions - what's your name, etc. If she didn't answer his question, he threatened her with a knife which he can be seen to be holding. Hearing: Minshull Crown Court (pictured) in Manchester was told he forced her to strip and perform a sex act . ‘He ordered her to take her clothes off. She believed that if she didn't take her clothes off he would strangle her.’ Mr Dickinson added: ‘She was saying “leave me alone”. She was distressed throughout - it's clear in the footage.’ After raping the woman, Khosravi ‘strikes her hard about the head, then stands up and kicks her with considerable force on a number of occasions’, Mr Dickinson said. Khosravi, who faces a deportation application on his release, had taken crystal meth before the attack, which made him ‘more aggressive’, Robert Lancaster, defending, said. He said the defendant, of no fixed address, had a £600-a-month habit. He also said Khosravi had not shared the video of the assault. Tablets: Judge Adrian Smith said that, due to the growing accessibility of digital recording, sex attackers filming their crimes was an 'increasing feature coming before the courts'. A file photo of an iPad is seen . Khosravi initially pleaded not guilty to two counts of rape but changed his plea to guilty before he went on trial. Judge Adrian Smith said . Khosravi was a well-educated man from a ‘decent, supportive family’ who . turned ‘violent and frighteningly menacing’ during the attack. 'He ordered her to take her clothes off. She believed that if she didn't take her clothes off he would strangle her. She was saying ""leave me alone""' Jonathan Dickinson, prosecuting . He said the filming of the rape was an aggravating factor in a ‘degrading and humiliating’ assault, adding: ‘She was sobbing and crying throughout and clearly frightened that you might use the knife that you had to injure her. Her fear is obvious.’ He jailed Khosravi for six years and ordered him to register as a sex offender on his release. Judge Smith added that, due to the growing accessibility of digital recording, sex attackers filming their crimes was an ‘increasing feature coming before the courts’.","Hesam Khosravi kicked and beat victim and threatened to tape her mouth .

David Cameron dramatically called off a long-awaited speech last night in which he was due to warn Britain is heading towards the EU exit unless key powers are returned. In the wake of the bloodbath in Algeria, the Prime Minister abandoned a planned trip to the Netherlands, where he had been due to deliver a landmark address on Britain’s future in Europe. Mr Cameron had initially been expected to make the speech at last autumn’s Conservative Party conference, but it has been repeatedly delayed. It is now not clear when it will happen. The Prime Minister plans to promise the first referendum on Britain’s place in Europe since 1975. When the speech is finally delivered, he will say the UK no longer accepts one of the founding principles of the EU – that membership means ‘ever closer union’, according to senior sources. He will insist that powers must flow in both directions between member states and Brussels, setting out plans to renegotiate the terms of Britain’s membership before asking voters to accept or reject it in a vote expected to take place in 2018. Senior Eurosceptic Tories, including Iain Duncan Smith and Liam Fox, are content with Mr Cameron’s stance. But the long-delayed speech will lead to demands from dozens of Tory MPs for the Prime Minister to legislate for a referendum before the next election – even without the support of the Liberal Democrats. MPs are also insisting a referendum pledge must be a ‘red line’ in any future coalition negotiation with the Lib Dems, warning it cannot simply be ditched if Mr Cameron fails to win an outright majority and seeks a new power-sharing deal with Nick Clegg. Scroll down for video . Eurosceptics: Liam Fox, left, and Iain Duncan Smith, right, are content with David Cameron's European stance . Warning: Mr Cameron was to warn that the UK could exit the EU if powers do not 'flow in both directions' between member states and Brussels . Downing Street sources said Mr Cameron, who had chosen the Netherlands as his venue because it is a founding member of the EU and shares some of Britain’s concerns about the need for reform, would set out a ‘positive vision’ of how Britain can remain in a changed EU. But he risked infuriating Eurocrats by warning them that their union could fall apart unless they addressed a growing democratic deficit felt not just in Britain but across the Continent. In extracts released by No 10 before the speech was called off last night, Mr Cameron said: ‘I want to speak to you today with urgency and frankness about the European Union and how it must change – both to deliver prosperity and to retain the support of its peoples. ‘I come here as British Prime Minister with a positive vision for the future of the European Union. A future in which Britain wants, and should want, to play a committed and active part.’ Mr Cameron was to argue that there were three challenges that threatened the EU – the eurozone crisis, competitiveness and public support – which must be addressed. ‘Why raise fundamental questions about the future of Europe when Europe is already in the midst of a deep crisis? 'Why raise questions about Britain’s role when support in Britain is already so thin?’ he was due to say. ‘There are always voices saying, “Don’t ask the difficult questions”. But it’s essential for Europe – and for Britain – that we do because there are three major challenges confronting us today. ‘First, the problems in the eurozone are driving fundamental change in Europe. Second, there is a crisis of European competitiveness, as other nations across the world soar ahead. ‘And third, there is a gap between the EU and its citizens which has grown dramatically in recent years and which represents a lack of democratic accountability and consent that is – yes – felt particularly acutely in Britain.’ The Prime Minister had been expected to point to a rise in anti-EU sentiment in countries that have been forced to implement austerity measures in order to remain in the union. ‘There is a growing frustration that the EU is seen as something that is done to people rather than acting on their behalf, and this is being intensified by the very solutions required to resolve the economic problems,’ he was due to say. Under siege: The gas field in Amenas, Algeria where militants held a number of workers including some Britons hostage. The situation has forced Mr Cameron to abandon his speech in the Netherlands . He believes the best opportunity to reshape Britain’s relationship with the EU will be offered by treaty change to allow the countries of the eurozone to forge a closer economic and political union designed to keep the single currency together. Repatriation of powers on social and employment law and a UK opt-out from policing and criminal justice measures are seen as key areas. Last night former Belgian PM Guy Verhofstadt, a leading federalist, likened the Prime Minister to ‘a suicide bomber threatening to blow himself up unless he gets his own way’. He added: ‘Cameron will not succeed if he attempts to hold his European partners to ransom.’ Provocative: MEP Graham Watson's Tweet . A Lib Dem MEP provoked widespread disgust last night when he claimed the terrorists had won by forcing Mr Cameron to abandon his speech in Amsterdam. Sir Graham Watson, leader of the liberal grouping in Brussels, tweeted: ‘Al Qaeda 1, @David_Cameron 0.’ A senior Government source said: ‘That is completely inappropriate.’","David Cameron was to warn that Britain could exit the EU .

Agony: Archie Eldridge struggled to walk on his broken right knee after doctors misdiagnosed his injury last month . A two-year-old boy who broke his knee in an agonising gymnastics accident was forced to walk on the untreated injury for two weeks because doctors dismissed it as 'psychological'. Archie Eldridge took a tumble on May 21 and was initially told he had suffered a 'suspected hairline fracture below the right knee'. But after being given a temporary cast and booked into a fracture clinic appointment 10 days later, doctors looked at his original x-rays and decided to remove the cast. To the amazement of his mother Natasha, the youngster could still not put any weight on his right leg at the follow-up appointment, but was told this was a 'psychological issue' and that he would be walking within a few days. Mrs Eldridge, 33, said: 'The doctor informed us there was no fracture to his leg and asked Archie to walk, but he struggled to put any weight on his right leg. 'The doctor said this was psychological and he would be walking within the next few days.' Archie was then discharged without a plaster cast and no further appointments were arranged. But as time passed, it became evident Archie’s leg was not improving and his mum decided to take him to the A&E department at Queen Mary’s Hospital in Sidcup, for a second opinion. She explained: 'We were extremely unhappy with how Archie was walking. 'His right foot was turning out and he had been limping from the point he first put the foot on the floor, which was two days after being discharged from Darent Valley.' Queen Mary’s referred him to his GP at Crayford Town Surgery who was equally concerned at the way the two-year-old was walking and immediately arranged a further appointment at the fracture clinic. On June 14, Mrs Eldridge took her son back to Darent Valley, two weeks after he had been Discharged. Mrs Eldridge, of Crayford, Greater London, said: 'We were sent for more X-rays of Archie’s hips and right leg. Probe: Bosses at Darent Valley Hospital in Dartford are investigating how the youngster's broken knee was missed by medics . 'On returning to the consultant we were told he had a definite break just below the right knee. 'We were told Archie was very lucky there was no long-term damage yet. 'He admitted the initial fracture diagnosis was a mistake and we had every right to be angry but we should concentrate on getting Archie back to full health.' Despite having further appointments at Darent Valley’s fracture clinic, Mrs Eldridge says she 'does not trust the hospital'. She added: 'I’ve got no confidence in them but have to go back because Archie started his treatment there.' A Darent Valley Hospital spokesman said: 'We take complaints very seriously and we will be investigating. 'Once we have concluded our investigations, we will be writing to Mr and Mrs Eldridge with the results of our findings.'","Experts diagnosed Archie Eldridge, 2, with hairline fracture, only for fracture clinic to remove case and say injury was 'psychological'

The tabby was only discovered after train manager Emily Mahoney-Smith heard meowing when the train stopped briefly on its way to Cornwall. Scroll down for video . Nine lives: Polly had her leg amputated after surviving a 1,700-mile journey trapped under the train . The two-year-old cat is thought to have climbed on board the high-speed express near her home in Plymouth, Devon, before enduring the two-day journey without food and water. She suffered a badly-broken leg during the ordeal, which later had to be amputated. Vets said by the state of her injuries Polly may have been trapped for even longer. Ms Mahoney-Smith, 33, said the cat could only have got into the sealed unit when the panels were removed for maintenance at the shunting depot near her home. She said: 'She was in surprisingly . good condition and her coat was very shiny, although she was incredibly . smelly from her infected leg. Polly's leg was so badly broken that vets had no choice but to amputate but she is now recovering . Rescuers: Emily Mahoney-Smith, Penzance Station Train Manager, left,  discovered Polly before veterinary surgeon Jenny Franning, right,  operated and amputated the cat's leg . Polly was found on a First Great western train on the line from Penzance to London Paddington . 'She was very friendly and when I made a couple of PA calls she could be heard purring in the background. 'It's amazing how she survived for so long - I think she climbed into the train as she was after rats in the shunting yard.' Polly disappeared from her home three weeks ago before finding herself locked inside the train. The 06.51 service from Plymouth to . London Paddington set off on Thursday, January 10, and then travelled from . the capital to Swansea. It then headed back to Paddington later in the day before ending the day in Bristol via Westbury, Wiltshire. The . following day the same train went back to Paddington via Worcester and . Oxford before completing another run to Swansea and back to London. Finally it left Paddington at 19.03 on Friday heading for Penzance in Cornwall nearly six hours away. Polly was eventually found late on Friday evening when Ms  Mahoney-Smith heard the distressed cat. Ms  Mahoney-Smith said she first thought the noise was a fault with the air suspension and went onto platform to check. Miraculous: Polly amazingly survived the 1,700 mile train trip that took her on a number of round trips between London and Swansea before eventually being discovered in Penzance . Polly survived without food and water but is now recovering and will soon be reunited with her owners . She saw no sign of the cat and the train carried on into the night but she heard the meowing again at the next stop at Saltash. The . train could only wait temporarily there because part of it was on the . Tamar Bridge but at the next station at St. Germans Emily and the driver . got out where they pinpointed the noise and were able to pull her out. Ms  Mahoney-Smithtook her on board and fed her tuna from a sandwich from the train's buffet and put her in a box in her compartment before calling the RSPCA. On-call vet Matthew Berriman said the cat was in such a bad state that he thought she was a stray and was preparing to put her down.

The inauguration for Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez is to be postponed due to his ill health, the government announced yesterday. President Chavez has not been seen since his cancer surgery on December 11 and is reported to be suffering from a ‘severe lung infection’ in addition to his surgery recovery. The formal inauguration for the 58-year-old's fourth period as president was to be held in Caracas tomorrow and the delay has outraged the opposition which now insists upon a temporary replacement. The socialist leader, who has been in power since 1999, was diagnosed with an undisclosed form of cancer in June 2011 and has been through four operations since. Angry opposition leaders now insist that Mr Chavez must be sworn in before the National Assembly tomorrow  as laid out in the constitution, or temporarily step aside and leave an ally in power. ‘The commander president wants us to inform that, based on his medical team's recommendations, the post-operative recovery should extend past January 10, said Vice President Nicolas Maduro, Mr Chavez's chosen successor, in a letter read to the legislature. ‘As a result, he will not be able to be present at the National Assembly on that date.’ The letter said authorities would seek another date for the inauguration ceremony but did not say when it would take place or give a time frame for President Chavez's return from Havana, Cuba where he is recovering. Rather than being sworn in by the legislature, he would take his oath at a later date before the Supreme Court, the letter said, as allowed by the constitution. Government leaders insist Mr Chavez is completely fulfilling his duties as head of state, even though official medical bulletins say he has a severe pulmonary infection and has had trouble breathing. In addition, Mr Chavez’s unprecedented has left many Venezuelans convinced he could be in his last days. His . resignation or death would wreak havoc to politics in the oil-rich . South American nation, where Mr Chavez currently enjoys a god-like . status among his supporters. His . critics call him a fledgling dictator who has squandered billions of . dollars from crude sales while dashing the independence of state . institutions. No show: Vice President of Venezuelan National Assembly Dario Vivas, left, and President of the Assembly Diosdado Cabello at the announcement of the postponing of Mr Chavez's inauguration as president . The constitution does not specify what happens if the president does not take office on January 10. The Supreme Court, controlled by Mr Chavez allies, called a news conference for later today where it is is widely expected to announce an interpretation of the constitution that will give Mr Chavez leeway to take office when he is fit to do so. If he dies or steps aside, new elections would be called within 30 days. Before leaving for Havana in December, the president instructed his supporters to back Maduro in that vote if he were unable to continue. Opposition leaders argue that Congress . chief and Mr Chavez ally Diosdado Cabello should take over, as mandated . by the constitution if the president's absence is formally declared. Cabello has ruled that out, saying the president continues to be in charge. ‘Who . could have believed the opposition would be screaming for Diosdado . Cabello to be given the presidency of the republic?’ he said during a . rambunctious session of Congress. ‘That's crazy, the opposition is . losing it.’ President prayers: Chavez supporters at one of the many vigils which have been held across Venezuela, where the president enjoys a deity-like status amongst his supporters, since his December cancer surgery . Meanwhile opposition deputies accused the Socialist Party of failing to follow Mr Chavez's instructions - a scene that would have been unimaginable before his prolonged absence. ‘President Chavez is the only one among you who has spoken clearly,’ said opposition leader Julio Borges. He was drowned out by pro-Chavez deputies clapping and chanting the socialist leader's name and rebuffed by Cabello, who had long been considered a potential successor to Mr Chavez until he was passed over for Maduro. ‘It's not my fault you weren't chosen, don't take your frustration out on me,’ Borges quipped. Another opposition deputy complained that during the debate a copy of the constitution was thrown across the chamber from the direction of the Socialist Party's deputies. Maduro has taken over the day-to-day running of the government and looks set to continue in the role past Thursday.","President Chavez was to be inaugurated for fourth term in office tomorrow .

A woman who claims she was raped by a top choir director was a fantasist who told ‘a complete pack of lies’, a jury heard today. The alleged victim of Michael Brewer and his former wife, Hilary Kay Brewer, who was said to have encouraged the rape, was ‘indulging in the realms of fantasy’, a court was told. She also claims the former music director at the prestigious Chetham's School of Music in Manchester indecently assaulted her as a pupil in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Trial: Michael Brewer was charged with rape and six counts of indecent assault following a police investigation along with his wife Hilary Brewer . Under cross-examination in giving evidence at Manchester Crown Court, the complainant denied she made up the allegations. She had previously detailed how the relationship with her teacher, Mr Brewer, progressed at the age of 14 from hugs in his unlocked school office to kisses, intimate touching and then full sex. Their trysts would also regularly take place in unlocked practice rooms at Chetham's, in his camper van where she would perform oral sex on him while driving in the streets of the city and on a canal bank in broad daylight. He also abused her at his family home in Chorlton while his wife and four children were asleep or away from the house, she said. Kate Blackwell QC, representing Mr Brewer, said to her: ‘You are indulging in the realms of fantasy.’ She replied: ‘No, I am not in the realms of fantasy and I really understand why so many cases do not come to court.’ Miss Blackwell asked: ‘You were never caught?’ The witness replied: ‘I wish I had.' Prestigious: Brewer was director of music at the renowned Chetham's School in Manchester until 1994 . The rape was said to have taken place at the Brewer family home when she was aged 18. Mrs Brewer is said to have told the teenager ‘she had always . wanted a sexual relationship with a woman’ and that the girl ‘owed her’ because of what had happened with her husband. The girl was taken upstairs and forced . to take part in a sex act by Mrs Brewer. The jury was told that her evidence was that they all stayed in the same bed together for the rest of the night before Mr Brewer drove her to the train station the next morning. ‘Utter fantasy,’ said Miss Blackwell. ‘B******s,’ replied the witness. Miss Blackwell continued: ‘You have told this jury a complete pack of lie about the visit to this house.’ The complainant replied: ‘This is why cases don't come to court. This happened.’ ‘You spent the night lying next to two of your rapists?’ said the barrister. The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, answered: ‘But this happened. I felt guilty, I did not know how to get out of it. ‘This is a lie,’ said Miss Blackwell. ‘You could have left the house at any time.’ Court: The pair have both pleaded not guilty at their trial at Manchester Crown Court, pictured . The witness replied: ‘You have got no idea clearly about what it is like to be raped. ‘You have clearly no feminine understanding of what someone goes through like that. What shock your body goes through. How you almost feel you deserve it.’ Miss Blackwell said the alleged victim was ‘traumatised’ to the extent that years later she spent the night at the Brewers' house with her own husband and children before catching a holiday flight. The witness agreed her husband had found it ‘odd’ that she wanted to return to the scene of the alleged rape but she thought she may have done it to prove to them she had a normal family life. ‘My husband has heard many stories that you might think come from a fantasist,’ she explained. ‘I could give you so many examples... but unfortunately it's my reality.’ Brewer, 67, of Swarthmore Road, Selly Oak, Birmingham, denies rape and 13 counts of indecent assault. After leaving Chetham's, Brewer, who was awarded an OBE, went on to become the artistic director of the National Youth Choirs of Britain and has also directed the World Youth Choir. He also served as an adjudicator in international competitions and in 2008 led BBC workshops for the programme Last Choir Standing. Hilary Kay Brewer, also 67, of Knowl Gap Avenue, Rossendale, Lancashire, denies one count of indecent assault and aiding and abetting rape.

As for weather girl Alessandra, 27, bank records uncovered by Italian prosecutors in January 2011 showed that Berlusconi paid her more than £100,000 for attending his infamous sex parties - money disguised as a 'non-interest-earning loan' paid to 'help with studies'. The payments started in 2010 and averaged . £8,500 a month – a figure Ms Sorcinelli refers to in a text . message to Mr Berlusconi’s aide, Giuseppe Spinelli, which read: ‘May I . urgently remind you of the 10,000 euro bank transfer.’ Silvio Berlusconi announced last month that he intends to run for Prime Minister for the fourth time in the February elections. Thanks ladies: The girls' convenient show in the lingerie shop came on the same day as it was announced that Silvio Berlusconi's wiretap trial was postponed until after the general elections in February . Dressed again: The girls leave with their new kit, including the Barack Obama shirts . Today an Italian court accepted a request from his defense team and agreed to postpone the wiretap leaks trial until March. Prosecutors have asked for a one-year jail sentence for Berlusconi for his alleged role in the publication of wiretap transcripts in a newspaper owned by his media empire and three years for his brother Paolo, the publisher of Milan newspaper Il Giornale. The ruling was in contrast to the decision by another court, which rejected Berlusconi's bid to halt his sex-for-hire trial. That ruling makes a verdict likely before the vote.

Standing trial: Michael Brewer, a school music director, is accused of raping an ex-pupil and Manchester Crown Court today heard another former student give evidence of 'sexual abuse' A respected choirmaster accused of raping a pupil was  later forced to resign after almost being caught with the school’s head girl half-naked in his office, a court heard yesterday. But the real reason for Michael Brewer’s departure from world-renowned Chetham’s School of Music was ‘kept quiet’ and instead given as health issues, a jury was told. Now in her mid 30s, the former head girl and talented oboist said that when she was 17 Brewer used to invite her into his office at the boarding school, take off her top and bra and fondle her breasts. She told Manchester Crown Court that Brewer – then 49 – wanted to take things further, commenting on the ‘horrid tights’ she wore with her school uniform and saying they were ‘about denying access’. On another occasion, she said, he told her to look at a picture on his office wall, and when she turned back he had exposed himself and then mentioned a sex act. The teacher also bought them matching watches inscribed with her initials, she said. Brewer resigned after the headmaster knocked on the office door during one of their sex sessions and became suspicious, the trial heard. After leaving his post as director of music at Chetham’s in the mid 1990s, Brewer went on to hold the same position with the National Youth Choirs. He was awarded the OBE and featured in the BBC series, Last Choir Standing. Yesterday the jury heard from the former head girl of the Manchester school about incidents that happened in the 1990s – more than 20 years after Brewer is accused of raping another pupil, encouraged by his then wife. The witness said Brewer liked to be ‘familiar’ with pupils, but on one occasion when she was 17 he gave her a ‘sexual’ hug. A day or two later, she told the jury: ‘He kissed me on the mouth – it was a passionate kiss. I was very surprised but I let him do it.’ From then on she would see him almost daily in his office at the school or in a practice room. Scene: Brewer is accused of carrying out a string of sexual assaults at Chetham School of Music, Manchester . ‘He started to feel my chest and my legs, and unbutton my shirt and eventually I was without a bra,’ she said. ‘We would just be talking and he would touch my breasts.’ She told the jury she felt out of her depth and tried telling Brewer she’d be going away to university soon, to which he replied: ‘The way I feel now I would wait four years for you.’ They also discussed another pupil he had had an affair with who Brewer described as ‘a bad girl who seduced me and took me to bed’. At around the same time, she said, Brewer told her he wanted her to meet his then wife, known as Kay, which she found ‘weird’. The court heard that one evening she was sitting on the sofa in Brewer’s office, naked from the waist up when the headmaster, Reverend Peter Hullah, knocked on the door. Brewer ‘panicked’ and bundled her out of a side door as she threw her clothes back on. After an inquiry, Brewer admitted inappropriate behaviour and resigned. The witness said the public explanation was ‘health reasons’ and ‘it was all kept quite quiet’. Earlier the trial heard from the alleged victim who said Brewer sexually abused her from the age of 14, then raped her, with his wife’s encouragement, when she was 18. Brewer, 68, of Selly Oak, Birmingham, denies one count of rape and 13 counts of indecent assault.

"By . Jane Bunce . PUBLISHED: . 14:15 EST, 22 August 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 01:49 EST, 23 August 2012 . Scientists have developed camouflage makeup that not only helps soldiers hide from the enemy, but also shields them from the searing heat of bomb blasts – and it’s thinner than a sheet of paper. The heat-resistant face paint, developed for the US military, has been described as one of the most fundamental changes in thousands of years to camouflage, and could also benefit fire fighters. The material is powerful enough to protect against a thermal blast that can reach 600 degrees Celsius (1,112 degrees Fahrenheit), as hot as a burning cigarette. In the near future, camouflage paint could do a lot more than help soldiers hide from their enemies - it could even protect them from bomb blasts . ‘The thermal blast lasts only two seconds, but it can literally cook the face, hands and other exposed skin,’ said lead scientist Dr Robert Lochhead  from The University of Southern Mississippi. Dr Lochhead and colleagues set out to find a material that soldiers could smear on their faces like suntan lotion yet protects against heat far hotter than the rays that normally reach the skin. Protection: The makeup could help soldiers avoid burns from thermal blasts . The formulation they discovered lasts far longer than a normal two second blast, generally providing protection for up to 15 second – and 60 seconds in some tests – before its own temperature rises to the point where a mild burn could occur. The finding raises the possibility that . other professions exposed to intense heat, such as fire fighters, could . also use a colourless version. The team had a difficult task in . designing the face paint as they could not use traditional makeup . ingredients – oil or wax-based face paint – as it can melt on the face . and burn the skin when in contact with intense heat. So instead they . turned to non-flammable silicone. Blend in: Soldiers have used face paint for centuries to shield them from enemies . Roadside bombs, which have claimed . hundreds of lives in Iraq, Afghanistan and other conflicts, produce two . blasts. Firstly, a blast wave at high pressure that spreads out at . supersonic speeds and can cause devastating internal injuries. Secondly, . the thermal blast, which follows almost instantaneously and exceeds 600 degrees Celsius. The new face paint can provide protection against this second blast. The . makeup also had to be waterproof and non-irritating, and, in an extra . challenge set by military rules, contain the insect repellent Deet. ‘Deet also is flammable, so when the Department of Defense asked us to incorporate it, we didn't think we could do it,’ Dr Lochhead said. Their solution was to encapsulate the Deet in a water-rich material that prevented it catching fire. The team now plans to test the material on other surfaces to see if it can used to protect clothing, tents and other items from burning. The study was presented at the annual meeting of the American Chemical Society.","Makeup can protect soldiers against intense explosions up to 600 degrees Celsius .

Gallop was brought up in Borneo by her strict Chinese mother and British, school-inspector father, educated at boarding school in England, and lost her virginity aged 21. Speaking to the Sunday Times Magazine, she said the aim of her online start-up is to provide an alternative to the industrial-strength hardcore porn on the market. The videos on her site, she feels, look less like hardcore porn and more like sexy indie films. Admitting that she likes porn and watches it herself, she also says that children today are watching incredibly graphic reenactments of sex, often before they have even had their first sexual experience, and wouldn't it just be better for them to see something more realistic? The average age for children to start watching porn is, she says, around 11 years old. Some even begin as early as eight.

A dog has made a miraculous recovery after being found buried up to its neck in dirt outside a Florida house with two gunshot wounds in its head. A county animal services officer was greeted by two sad brown eyes peering out of the ground when she arrived at the vacant property in Tampa to rescue the pit bull-cross. One bullet had pierced the animal's forehead and exited through her back, while the other entered under an eye and left through her neck. Warning: Graphic content . How did she survive? This pit bull cross was found buried up to her neck in dirt outside a Florida house with two gunshot wounds in her head . Covered in blood: One bullet had pierced the Phoebe's forehead and exited through her back, while the other entered under an eye and left through her neck . Her head was bloodied and she was dangerously thin, but was remarkably friendly after being dug out of the earth and immediately bonded with her rescuer. Sgt Pam Perry, investigations manager at Hillsborough County Animal Services, said: 'This is sick. 'If they did this to a dog, they'll do it to another dog, a cat, a child or a person.' He said no shell casings or bullet fragments were found at the scene, although it is believed a small-caliber weapon was used. According to The Tampa Bay Times, the wounds only damaged soft tissue and Phoebe suffered no brain damage. But she did require four days in the emergency clinic to treat her injuries and the effects of her malnourishment. Lucky escape: Incredibly, the bullets only damaged soft tissue, but she did need four days of emergency treatment to treat her wuonds and the effects of malnourishment . Back on her feet: Phoebe will be put up for adoption when she has fully recovered . The two-year-old weighed just 30lbs when she was found compared to a healthy weight of 50lbs. An anonymous caller claimed to have heard three shots shortly before Phoebe was discovered in Deerfield Drive on October 29. Perry said the suspect may have been trying send a message to animal services because investigators had rounded up a number of 'dog-fighting' animals from vacant homes in the Clair-Mel neighborhood in the days before Phoebe was discovered. The sheriff's office also arrested 25 people during an operation on November 9. Another dog was found at the property in Deerfield Drive earlier this year, this time tied to a carport. Perry said animal cruelty was endemic to the area, but was confident there elements in the community who wanted stamp out such activities. Phoebe will be put up for adoption when she has fully recovered.","Two-year-old buried up to neck in dirt outside vacant home in Tampa .

It's known as the home of heroic outlaw Robin Hood - so it's fitting that one of his band of legendary Merry Men should make an appearance in the trees of Sherwood Forest. Walkers spotted what looks like a bowed figure sitting under a snow-covered tree in the famous Nottinghamshire forest - with Facebook users now claiming that he looks like Friar Tuck. The unusual shape was spotted in the trunk of the much-loved 1,000-year-old Major Oak - once voted Britain's favourite tree - after heavy snowfall blanketed the forest earlier this week. 'Monk on a trunk': An unusual figure, likened to Robin Hood's companion Friar Tuck, has appeared in the famous Major Oak tree in Sherwood Forest . Likeness: The figure in the tree has been likened to Friar Tuck, one of folk hero Robin Hood's band of Merry Men, seen here played by Phil Rose in the television programme Robin of Sherwood . A worker at the Sherwood Forest Nature Reserve, Paul Cook, took a picture of the tree and uploaded it onto the Nottinghamshire County Council Facebook page. Since then, local residents have flocked to the page to discuss whether the unusual figure looks like Robin Hood's trusted companion or other figures such as former Prime Minister Winston Churchill. But it's likeness to Friar Tuck and the forest's connection with the legendary outlaw have seen the figure dubbed 'Monk on a Trunk'. Paul said: 'Being so familiar with the legend of Robin Hood with Sherwood Forest being his historic home, we would dearly love it to be an image of Friar Tuck. 'I just wanted to take some images of the snowfall and got more than I bargained for once the image appeared on Facebook. 'I did not initially notice anything unusual when I first posted it up, but when you look closely at the picture the outline of what appears to be a monk does appear to be sitting at the base of the tree - the resulting discussion on the county council's Facebook is now very exciting indeed.' Famous: The 1,000-year-old Major Oak which sits at the heart of Sherwood Forest in Nottinghamshire and was once voted Britain's favourite tree . One resident, Ken Wood, commented on the picture: 'It sorta resembles the way a Fryer would Tuck himself down beside a tree and observe all of nature!' (sic). The tree is visited by thousands of people each year and has become popular with couples getting married. Because of its age a fence has been put up around Major Oak to stop visitors' feet from compressing the ground above its roots in the hope that it will keep the tree healthy for years to come. The Major Oak is a Quercus Robur, the English or pendunculate oak and in a 2002 survey was voed Britain's favourite tree. Local legend suggests that Robin Hood and his men used its hollow trunk as a hiding place. Beautiful: The picturesque Sherwood Forest is not only known for its association with Robin Hood but also as an area of outstanding beauty . It weighs around 23 tonnes and has a trunk circumference of 33 feet and a 92 foot branch span. The tree has been known by several names over the centuries including the Cockpen Tree and the Queen Oak. It became known as the Major Oak after Major Hayman Rooke included it in a popular book about the ancient oaks of Sherwood written in 1790. Coservation work has been carried out on Major Oak since 1908, with metal chains initially used to support the branches, replaced by wooden struts in the late 1970s. Thin steel poles now prop up its branches.","The figure appeared on the Major Oak in Sherwood Forest, Nottinghamshire .

When her beloved puppy was stolen, Miriam Francome refused to give up hope that the two of them would one day be reunited. But even she found it hard to believe when, eight years later, the dog was found wandering just a few miles from her home. The former wife of champion jockey and racing pundit John Francome had spent months putting up posters, knocking on doors and dropping leaflets after Lhasa Apso-terrier crossbreed Tweed was stolen in 2005, even offering a £1,000 reward for the dog’s safe return. Back together: Miriam Francome has been reunited with her dog that was found after eight years wandering a few miles from her home . Mrs Francome said: ‘She was born on my bed and had never been away from me. I was completely heartbroken at the time. ‘Although I never quite gave up hope of seeing her again, I could not believe it when I got the call saying she had been found. I just burst into tears.’ Tweed had been microchipped, so when she was found in Wantage, Oxfordshire last month – not far from Miss Francome’s home village near Hungerford, Berkshire – the council was able to trace her owner. Despite being flea-ridden and filthy, the worst Tweed, who is now nine, appeared to have suffered was a bad haircut. ‘Thankfully it doesn’t look like she has been mistreated, she is not anxious or cowering, she seems happy and relaxed,’ said  Mrs Francome. ‘She’s not been starved either and is eating well. She’s still as good-natured as I remember her to be and the vet has given her the all-clear.’ Former love: Miriam and jockey John Francome split in the early 1990s . After she was informed Tweed had been found, Mrs Francome had to wait eight days to allow anyone who may have unwittingly bought the dog in the eight years she was missing to come forward. The former model said: ‘It was amazing when I went to pick her up, I wanted to cuddle her but she smelt so bad and her hair was all matted. Whoever had her had cut all her lovely hair off. ‘She recognised me straight away and responded to her name. When I brought her home, she knew exactly where she was.’ Mrs Francome, who dated  ex-racehorse trainer Charlie Brooks – now married to former News International chief executive Rebekah Brooks –  after separating from former jockey champion  John in the early 1990s, had bred Tweed and her brother Harris from her pet Megan. Dog Lost, a charity that helps reunite owners with their missing animals, says that 3,500 thefts were reported last year . ‘We think Tweed may have been used for breeding and her puppies sold for around £200 each. ‘I . imagine that the last time whoever had her had tried to mate her, she . didn’t conceive because of her age. And they had no more use for her and . just dumped her,’ said Mrs Francome, who now works part time as a . barmaid and dog-sitter. ‘It is strange to think that she was so close to me all these years but I just never knew it.’ Tweed . is now settling back in at home after being reunited with her brother . Harris and introduced to Mrs Francome’s five other dogs. She had been . stolen during a spate of dog thefts in the area as she played with her . brother outside Mrs Francome’s cottage on the morning of February 2, . 2005. Dog Lost, a charity . that helps reunite owners with their missing animals, says that 3,500 . thefts were reported last year – an increase of almost 20 per cent on . the previous 12 months.

A post-Christmas rush to the divorce courts is being blamed for a rise in pet dogs ending up in  rescue centres. More than 700 dogs belonging to couples splitting up will be taken in this month, a survey by the Kennel Club has revealed. Despite 3,500 dogs being rescued in January by groups affiliated to the Kennel Club – double the monthly average – only 53 will be unwanted Christmas presents, it added. A further 570 have become too expensive to keep. Spokesman Laura Quickfall said: ‘The results from our survey  were surprising. We’ve always known January is a busy time for rehoming, but the survey identifies relationship breakdown as the most common cause.’","Tweed had been microchipped and was traced back to its owner .

We may be cutting back in all sorts of ways to survive the economic downturn but it seems there is one thing we can’t do without – chocolate. Sales have held up throughout the hard times of the last few years and will continue to do so in coming years, experts say. Peter Ayton, of market research firm Mintel, said low-cost treats such as chocolate and snack foods would help fuel consumer spending. Essential treat: Chocolate is the treat we can't live without as sales remain steady despite the recession . He added: ‘Chocolate confectionery fits the bill exactly.’ It is thought to be recession-resistant because whatever the economic environment consumers turn to it as a reward or a treat. Product innovation is another factor as chocolate manufacturers are constantly bringing out something new to tempt customers. Around 500 new chocolate products are launched in the UK each year. Yummy: Market research firm Mintel say that our love of all things chocolate will help fuel consumer spending . The Economist Intelligence Unit and Mintel said in a report on consumer spending that generally people had traded down to own-brand goods, but they detected signs of ‘recession fatigue’. The beauty product market remained strong, the sale of good quality clothes should increase. According to the report, the tobacco market will be robust, the two groups estimated. But sales of alcohol will be ‘relatively flat’ amid a fall in the number of drinkers.","Market research firm Mintel believes that low cost treats will help fuel consumer spending .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 13:10 EST, 10 August 2011 . A NATO helicopter crashed in eastern Afghanistan this morning, just two days after 38 people were killed in another Chinook crash. Officials said there were no apparent casualties on board the ISAF helicopter, which mad a 'hard landing' in the volatile Paktia province. An investigation is underway but it appears there was no enemy activity in the area at the time, confirmed ISAF spokesman Lieutenant Colonel David Doherty. A NATO helicopter made a 'hard landing' in Paktia province, a volatile area in Afghanistan's east, today. There were no reported casualties. File picture . Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid . claimed in a text message sent to Reuters that the Islamist group had . shot down the helicopter, another Chinook, in the Zurmat district of . Paktia, killing 30 American soldiers. The Taliban often exaggerate claims in . attacks against foreign troops and Afghan security forces and . government targets, although they correctly identified the number killed . in the weekend's Chinook crash in Wardak. The Wardak crash accounted for the largest single loss of foreign forces in 10 years. A worrying surge of military deaths is being matched by record casualties among civilians, who continue to bear the brunt of a war that appears to have become bogged down despite claims of success from both sides. Afghan men shout anti American slogans during a protest over the deaths of two men in Ghazni, west of Kabul, Afghanistan, today. On Monday, three hundred angry Afghans took to the streets in central Ghazni province carrying the bodies of two people they claimed had been killed during a raid by ISAF troops. Civilian casualties caused by foreign troops hunting insurgents have long been a major source of friction between Kabul and its Western backers. U.N. figures show such casualties hit record levels in the first six months of 2011, although it blamed 80 percent of them on insurgents. NATO officials are still investigating the cause of a helicopter crash two days ago that killed 38 people, including 30 U.S. soldiers, seven Afghan commandos and an Afghan interpreter. Of the dead, more than 20 were US Navy Seals from the elite unit that killed Osama Bin Laden. The Taliban claim to have shot down that troop-carrying CH-47 Chinook helicopter in central Maidan Wardak province and a U.S. official in Washington, who asked not to be identified, said that helicopter was believed to have been shot down. Dead: Lt Cmdr Jonas Kelsall was one of the lives lost in the central Maidan Wardak province crash two days ago . 'We're still not aware of the cause of the incident, this is a very vital part of the investigation,' said Brigadier General Carsten Jacobsen, senior spokesman for the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF). 'The area in which the helicopter was operating was known to be not free of insurgents,' he told a news conference. ISAF has imposed a security crackdown on the area while the grim task of recovering the aircraft and the bodies of those killed is completed, although some residents have complained about some of the measures that have been taken. Graphic locates Wardak province in Afghanistan, where the Taliban shot down a US helicopter . 'I can only advise (civilians) not to try to approach the site of the crash while the investigation is ongoing,' Jacobsen said . At least another seven ISAF troops were killed in a ghastly 48 hours for the coalition. Four were killed in two separate attacks on Sunday, including two French legionnaires. The spike in casualties -- at least 383 foreign troops have been killed so far this year, almost 50 of them in the first week of August -- comes at a time of growing unease about the increasingly unpopular and costly war. U.S. and NATO officials issued statements vowing to 'stay the course' in Afghanistan after the deadly weekend Chinook crash but the recent devastating death toll will likely raise more questions about how much longer foreign troops should stay in Afghanistan. Afghan President Hamid Karzai spoke with U.S. President Barack Obama by telephone overnight and shared condolences over the Wardak crash, Karzai's palace said in a statement. 'The U.S. president thanked the Afghan president and emphasised the fight against terrorism, which is a threat for security in the region and the world, and said the people of Afghanistan and the U.S. unitedly stand against the terrorists and their sacrifices will be never forgotten,' it said. The deaths came barely two weeks after foreign troops began the first phase of a gradual process to hand security responsibility over to Afghan soldiers and police. Afghan President Hamid Karzai spoke with . U.S. President Barack Obama by telephone overnight and shared . condolences over the Wardak crash . Excluding the latest, and worst, crash, they are:June 28, 2005: U.S. helicopter is shot down in eastern Kunar province during a rescue operation, killing 16 special operations troops.April 6, 2005: U.S. Chinook helicopter crashes in a sandstorm near eastern Ghazni, killing 15 American troops and three civilian contractors.May 5, 2006: U.S. Chinook helicopter crashes while attempting a night landing on a small mountaintop in eastern Kunar province, killing 10 U.S. soldiers.September 21, 2010: U.S. Army Blackhawk crashes in southern Zabul province, killing nine troops on board, including four Navy Seals.February 18, 2007: U.S. Chinook carrying 22 U.S. soldiers crashes in southern Zabul province, killing eight and injuring 14. That process is due to end with the last foreign combat troops leaving at the end of 2014, but some U.S. lawmakers are already questioning whether that timetable is fast enough. Karzai has already said 'enemies of Afghanistan' -- the Taliban and other insurgents -- want to disrupt the process. In Ghazni, deputy police chief Mohammad Hussain said almost 300 people had gathered to carry the bodies of what they said were two civilians to the provincial governor's office after an overnight raid by ISAF in the Khogyani district. ISAF earlier said there were no reports of civilian casualties but Jacobsen said a man had fired on an ISAF patrol from inside a house with his family around him. 'We are very much certain that ISAF could not be aware that the man was shooting from a house where his family was inside,' Jacobsen said, adding that an investigation was underway. On Sunday, Karzai ordered an investigation into a NATO air strike that allegedly killed eight civilians in volatile southern Helmand province on Friday. U.N. figures show that 1,462 Afghan civilians were killed in conflict-related incidents in the first six months of 2011, the deadliest period for civilians since the Taliban were toppled by U.S.-backed Afghan forces in late 2001. Foreign military deaths also hit record levels in 2010 with 711 killed, with 2011 following a similarly bloody trend.","NATO reports no casualties .

Drink a lot: Researchers found that nations which consume a lot of milk and milk products also tend to have more Nobel laureates among their populations . Countries that drink a lot of milk also win a lot of Nobel prizes, reveals a new study. Researchers found nations that consume a lot of milk and milk products also tend to have a lot of Nobel laureates among their populations. Research published last year in the New England Journal of Medicine reported a strong association between a nation’s chocolate consumption and Nobel laureate prowess, speculating that the flavonoid content of chocolate was behind the boost in brain power. This got the letter authors thinking. As chocolate is often combined with milk, could it be the amount of milk or milk products consumed per head that fuels Nobel Prize success? They looked at the 2007 data from the Food and Agriculture Organisation on per capita milk consumption in 22 countries as well as the information provided by the author of the chocolate theory, and found a significant association. Sweden has the most Nobel laureates per 10 million of its population. Although, it hosts the Nobel committee - which some might argue could introduce an element of bias - it also consumes the most milk per head of the population, getting through 340 kilos (750lb) every year. And Switzerland, which knocks back 300 kilos (660lb) of the white stuff every year, has a Nobel haul of similar proportions. Boasts brains: Switzerland, which consumes 660lbs of milk per head a year boasts 32 Nobel laureates . Conclusion: To improve your chances of winning Nobel prizes, the report recommended you eat more chocolate as well as drink milk . However, at the other end of the scale, China has the lowest number of Nobel laureates in its population. But it also has the lowest milk consumption of the countries studied, at around 25 kilos (55lb) a year. However, the researchers noted there . does seem to be a ceiling effect with no discernible impact beyond an . annual per capita consumption of 350 kilos (771lb), as Finland’s Nobel haul . seems to attest. They queried if milk consumption was simply a reflection of a strong educational system. But there is a plausible biological explanation for the link as milk is rich in vitamin D, and this may boost brain power, the evidence suggests. The report concluded: 'So to improve your chances of winning Nobel prizes you should not only eat more chocolate but perhaps drink milk too or strive for synergy with hot chocolate.' The findings were published in the journal Practical Neurology.","Researchers found that nations that consume a lot of milk and milk products tend to have a lot of Nobel laureates .

Accused: Alicia Inglish has been arrested on 120 counts of suspected animal cruelty and tampering with evidence . An animal rescue boss has been arrested after police raided a shelter and found 149 starving dogs living in filthy conditions. Alicia Inglish, 24, had been taking in unwanted pets and running Willamette Animal Rescue centre from a warehouse in Marion County, Oregon, in the U.S. But police became concerned about the welfare of the animals after complaints from people who adopted dogs. They found many piled up on top of each other in tiny carriers with waste dripping down from one to another. As many as five dogs were crowded into a living area only fit for one. Officers said there was just two bags of dog food in the entire building. The dogs appeared to be mainly surviving on stale bread. Many of the them were said to be severely malnourished and what little water was available was contaminated with rubbish. Some of the dogs' eyes were sealed shut with bodily fluids while others had open sores and bald patches on their coats. A team of 21 officers and volunteers worked through the night after the raid on Sunday to remove the dogs and assess them. The Oregon Humane Society took in 110 dogs. Many of the dogs were found living in cages usually used to transport animals . 'This is so far and away from the perception of warmth and caring people expect in an animal shelter,' Sharon Harmon, executive director of the Oregon Humane Society, told The Oregonian. 'This is just a tragic case of neglect.' Inglish has been arrested on 120 accusations of second-degree animal neglect and tampering with evidence. She was reportedly arrested on Sunday morning as she pulled up to the warehouse with another four dogs. Police raided the animal rescue centre after receiving complaints from people who had adopted dogs . Many of the dogs were malnoursihed and had open sores on their snouts . On the group's Facebook page, which has since taken down, a plea had been posted appealing for dog food on November 10. According to The Oregonian, it read: 'We go through about 120 pounds of . dog food each day at the shelter so gift cards to Costco, Petsmart and . Petco are always a big help!' A former volunteer at the center, Christian Kidd, 23, defended Inglish saying she had been takin gin dogs from a local pound that would otherwise have been euthanized. 'We would pick up dogs sentenced to death and bring them back to rehabilitate them and try to find them loving homes,' said Kidd. 'She didn't want the dogs to die. That's all she cared about.' Inglish is being held at the Marion County Jail on £190,000 bail and is scheduled to appear in court this afternoon. Marion County Sheriff's office said additional arrests are expected.","Police raided shelter in Oregon, US, after receiving complaints .

Yesterday Mr Malde accused the London . hotel, which had a turnover of £32.3million last year, of ‘using a . sledgehammer to crack a nut’, and said it would ruin him to fight it in . court. Mr Malde said Desborough’s Ritz, which . has stood for more than 80 years, poses little competition to the . capital’s – especially as afternoon tea at the London venue costs guests . more than he charges per person for an entire wedding meal. The 43-year-old said: ‘When I opened the letter I thought it was a joke. I could not believe my eyes. ‘What kind of competition do they think we might pose to The Ritz in London? Tough times: Mr Malde said his is a small family business, 'trading in difficult times and running a conference centre in a rural community in Northamptonshire' Inside the Ritz Desborough: Mr Malde, who even owns the rights to the website www.theritz.co.uk, now fears his wedding and conference venue will suffer as a result and accused the hotel of using 'a sledgehammer to crack a nut' Quite a difference: Owner Mr Malde claims that Desborough's Ritz poses little competition to the capital's - especially as afternoon tea at the London venue costs more per head than an entire wedding at his . Five-star fancy: The 106-year-old Ritz Hotel, on London's Piccadilly, claims Desborough entrepreneur Kris Malde stole its trademark . ‘We operate in completely different . markets. They serve the rich and famous, we serve a largely local . clientele who just want good food and facilities at a good price. ‘But even if we took this to court and won, the costs would kill us.’ In a letter to the wedding venue, . lawyers argued that The Ritz name was synonymous with excellence in . hotel and restaurant services, and gave Mr Malde a deadline of 4pm on . December 19 to agree to a name change. This has since been extended, . although a deadline has yet to be set. London law firm Ashurst, representing . Ritz owners Ellerman Investments Limited, said: ‘Our clients are . concerned to discover that you are using the domain name in connection . with a business which appears to be trading as “The Ritz” and offering . banqueting and conference services. ‘As you are no doubt aware, The Ritz . Hotel was opened by Cesar Ritz in 1906, and since then its owners have . built up a very substantial reputation and goodwill throughout the . world. As with any valuable property, our clients cannot allow their . trademarks to be used without consent.’ Fighting talk: Lawyers for the Ritz Hotel in London said its owners 'have built up a very substantial reputation and good will throughout the world in The Ritz Hotel and the Ritz name in connection with hotel' The letter adds that Ellerman takes any infringement of its valuable intellectual property rights ‘extremely seriously’. Mr Malde said his Ritz was founded in . the Thirties as a cinema, then became a ballroom before falling into . disrepair. It was always called The Ritz. He added: ‘We are a small family . business trading in difficult times and running a conference centre in . Northamptonshire. We do not even have rooms for guests to stay in and . people cannot just wander in off the street for a drink or a meal. Our . venue is simply hired out for events.’ Mr Malde bought the building, which had been derelict for five years two years ago and spent £800,000 refurbishing it. It caters for 250 to 600 guests and costs £3,000 to hire for 12 hours. He opened it as a wedding and . conference venue in November last year. That, and his use of the domain . name www.theritzuk.co.uk, seems to have triggered Ellerman’s interest in . his business. Stephen Boxall, managing director of .

A schoolboy was injured when a BlackBerry smartphone exploded and set the end of his bed alight while he slept. Kian McCreath, 11, has been scarred after the handset blew up in the middle of the night, leaving melted plastic from its casing stuck to his leg. Yesterday his parents branded the Curve 9320 handset ‘dangerous’ and called on BlackBerry maker Research In Motion to recall the model while an investigation takes place into what caused  the incident. Dangerous phone: Kian McCreath, left with the twisted remains of the phone woke up screaming in a burning bed and was left with painful injuries, right . Frantic: Kian's terrified mother Sarah put out the flames, lifted her son out of the bed and put him in the bath . The Curve model is a budget smartphone . popular among teenagers who are drawn to the free BBM message service . offered by BlackBerry. It was bought for Kian’s brother, Mason, as a 13th birthday present a fortnight before the blaze at the family’s home. The two siblings share a bedroom at . the house in Holbrooks, Coventry, and the fully-charged phone exploded . moments after their mother, Sarah, 39, had taken it off charge and . placed it on Kian’s bed.

Doctors are fighting to save the sight of the artistic director of Russia's illustrious Bolshoi Ballet after an acid attack on a Moscow street. Sergei Filin, a 42-year-old former Bolshoi star, said a man threw the acid into his face late Thursday near the gate of his apartment building. The attacker wore a hood and either a mask or a scarf, so only his eyes were visible, he said. 'I got scared and I thought he was going to shoot me,' Filin, his face covered with white bandages, told REN TV. 'I turned around to run, but he raced ahead of me.' Bolshoi spokeswoman Yekaterina Novikova said Filin would be flown to a . specialist burns centre in Brussels later today after an urgent . operation on his eyes. First Channel TV said doctors were 'trying to preserve his eyesight.' She told Channel One that Filin had received threats before and that they suspect that that he fell victim to the notorious infighting and rows between different groups of dancers and managers at the theatre. 'We never imagined that a war for . roles - not for real estate or for oil - could reach this level of . crime,' she said. The theatre in the heart of Moscow is an enduring symbol of Russian culture and a big draw for both locals and foreign tourists, but has seen power struggles among both dancers and directors during its more than 200-year history. Scroll down for video . Prestigious career: Sergei Filin in 2011 with the then president Dmitry Medvedev and his wife Svetlana attending a gala opening of the Bolshoi in Moscow . The Bolshoi, which has both ballet and opera troupes, reopened last February after a six-year renovation to its landmark colonnaded building, close to Red Square in the very centre of Moscow. As a symbol of Russian culture for more than 200 years, it is a big draw for both locals and foreign tourists, and has seen power struggles among both dancers and directors throughout its history. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, many of those conflicts, whether driven by egos or artistic convictions, have been played out in public. After the tightly controlled three-decade tenure of Yuri Grigorovich ended in 1995, the Bolshoi Ballet went through five artistic directors before Filin's appointment. In 2003 Anatoly Iksanov, director of the Bolshoi, dismissed ballerina Anastasia Volochkova after reportedly saying she was too heavy for male dancers to lift, and in 2011 a senior ballet manager resigned after a scandal over sexually explicit photographs. Filin, a Moscow native, joined the Bolshoi's ballet troupe in 1988 and was named its artistic director in March 2011. Sergei Filin, a former leading dancer at the Bolshoi who has been in the high-pressure job at the heart of Russian culture for nearly two years, was attacked outside his Moscow apartment building as he returned from the theatre late on Thursday. Filin, a Moscow native, joined the . Bolshoi's ballet troupe in 1988 and was named its artistic leader in . March 2011, after three years in a similar position at another Moscow . theatre. There was 'fierce rivalry' for the Bolshoi position at the time, according to RIA Novosti. Such is the power and prestige of the post in Russian life that Anatoly Iksanov, director of the Bolshoi, said he believed the attack was a product of envy or rivalry. Filin had already reported having his car tyres slashed and his emails hacked, as well as receiving repeated nuisance calls from someone who stayed silent when he answered. 'He said, `I have a feeling that I am on the front lines,'' Iksanov quoted Filin as telling him Thursday before the attack. The culprit should be sought among those for whom it was beneficial to compromise the theatre leadership', Iksanov told reporters. 'This two-week campaign has ended tragically and despicably,"" he said. Iksanov said Filin had told him he believed he had been followed home, and that the attacker had called him by name before throwing acid on his face. 'There are very serious burns on his . face, in his ears, his forehead, his mouth, and of course there are . serious concerns about his eyesight,' he said. Filin's mother, Natalya, said he had . been threatened but that she did not know who could have been behind the . attack, state-run RIA news agency reported. 'What's important to me now is the health of my son, that he not lose his eyesight,' she said.

A church-going widow in her 80s who waged ‘psychological warfare’ on her soldier neighbour and his family has been told she faces a jail sentence. Ethel Watkins – known as the Duchess on her middle-class estate because of her smart dress and aloofness – branded the children ‘hooligans’, taunted the wife over the death of her month-old baby and said she hoped the Sergeant Major ‘wouldn’t come back from Afghanistan’. Yesterday, as the 83-year-old was convicted of harassment, her victim said it made him feel ‘ashamed of being British, if Watkins is the kind of person I have been fighting for’. 'Vile': 83 year-old Ethel Watkins leaves Loughborough Magistrates Court today after being found guilty of breaching a restraining order and told she may face jail . The soldier, who cannot be named to . protect the identity of his children, said he had been awarded eight . medals for service, but would ‘gladly give them up’ if he could . guarantee peace for his family. Harassment: Ethel Watkins, 83, launched a shocking campaign against a young family after a child's football landed in her garden . He feared they would never sell their . home because he would feel ‘honour-bound’ to tell buyers about Watkins. Watkins’s campaign began when a football landed in her garden shortly . after the family moved in to the house in Melton Mowbray, . Leicestershire, in  2011. The pensioner, a member of the British . Legion’s Women’s Section for 66 years, has since been kicked out of the . organisation. She first appeared in court in July to admit harassing the family. Loughborough magistrates handed her a five-year restraining order, fined . her £900, and warned she had escaped jail only because of her age. But just 24 hours later, the former Army base stores worker committed the first of four breaches of the order. The grandmother yesterday returned to the court to deny the breaches. Watkins told magistrates that far from taunting the family with songs . about the soldier’s fate in Afghanistan, she was singing her favourite . hymns, Abide With Me and How Great Thou Art. But magistrates – who branded her ‘not credible’ – convicted her of the four breaches. Chairman of the bench Ben Faust told Watkins, who followed the . proceedings with a hearing aid: ‘We are leaving all our options open . including prison, or the case being sent to the Crown Court where the . sentencing powers are far greater.’ The case was adjourned to January . 23. Abusive: The pensioner would pass the house ans swear at the house, as well as sing vile songs and abuse her neighbour about the death of her baby and that she hoped her husband would be killed in action . The court heard Watkins regularly insulted the mother with songs she had . made up, and began setting off her own  burglar alarm and banging on . the walls to prevent the children from sleeping. Magistrates took just an hour to convict Watkins yesterday. She declined to apologise or comment as she left court. Watkins married the same man, Ernie Watkins, three times, with the . couple splitting twice – apparently over her combustible personality. Mr . Watkins died in 2003. Daughter-in-law Carol Watkins said the . pensioner’s behaviour had estranged her from her family. Mrs Watkins, 60, who lives with her maintenance fitter husband Terry, . also 60, in Melton Mowbray, said: ‘Ethel was difficult from the moment . we married 40 years ago. 'The last straw was when she tried to break up . our marriage. I told her to get back on her broomstick and get lost.’ A friend of the victims said they were ‘very happy’. He added: ‘They say . that it shows that people who complain of harassment will be listened . to.’","Pensioner Ethel Watkins 'waged psychological warfare' and said she hoped her soldier husband died in Afghanistan .

"Footballer Cy Whitham, who played for Ipswich Town Academy was jailed for causing unnecessary suffering . Staffordshire Bull Terrier wasn't fed for TWO WEEKS and weighed 20lbs - less than half a healthy weight . Two dead dogs may have been decomposing for ONE MONTH . By . Emily Davies . PUBLISHED: . 07:21 EST, 18 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:01 EST, 18 January 2013 . A top young footballer has been jailed after his flea-infested dog was found starving to death in her own filth. Cruel ex-Ipswich Town Academy midfielder Cy Whitham, 20, was locked up for 18 weeks yesterday and banned from keeping animals for 15 years. A veteran RSPCA inspector told South East Suffolk magistrates' court in Ipswich it was arguably the worst case he had ever seen. Staffordshire bull terrier KD abandoned by footballer Cy Whitham was found locked in a room surrounded by her own faeces . KD weighed less than 20lbs when she was found. A healthy weight would be 42lbs . Whitham, of Defoe Road, Ipswich, admitted two . counts of causing unnecessary suffering and two charges of failing in . his duty to ensure an animal's welfare. Whitham's mother Millie Whitham, 47, who lived with him, admitted the same charges. Hugh . Rowland, prosecuting, said the footballer's horrifically thin . Staffordshire Bull Terrier, called KD, was found shut in a bedroom at their former home on Donegal Road, surrounded by her own faeces and urine. The Whithams moved out of their housing association owned property in Donegal Road on September 3, more than three weeks before KD was found. Emaciated KD was found when a . pest controller was sent to the Whithams' filthy house on September 26 . to tackle a flea infestation. The Bull Terrier ran out out of a bedroom and downstairs. Millie Whitham said she had run out of money to feed her pet. She claimed she last fed the dog a week after moving out. The bodies of two other decomposed dogs were also discovered in a shed at the property. RSPCA Inspector Jason Finch estimated the dogs' corpses could have been rotting for one month and said they were too decomposed to identify their breed or their cause of death. But the Whithams both denied any involvement with the dead dogs found at their former home. Three-year-old KD was just under 20lbs when she should have weighed over double that, about 42lbs, the court heard. Footballer Cy Whitham was jailed for 18 weeks for causing unnecessary suffering . Mr Rowland said malnourished KD was dehydrated, starving, wracked with pain and crawling with fleas. After seeing pictures of the starved dog, chairman of the bench, Diana Hunt, said: 'It's amazing it's still alive, isn't it?' Mr Rowland said KD must have suffered terribly for weeks and was very close to death when she was rescued. Inspector Finch, who has for the RSPCA for 13 years, said he could not recall seeing an animal in such a wretched condition. Brave KD, who has been renamed Lottie, is now doing well in the hands of the RSPCA and has made a successful recovery from her ordeal, magistrates heard. Inspector Finch said: 'When the pest controller opened the door, Lottie came . straight out and immediately started trying to scavenge for food or . anything that she could eat. 'He gave Lottie a couple of biscuits and called us straight away. When I saw her I couldn’t believe she was still alive, the poor girl looked like a bag of bones.' 'When we found her she weighed just 9.2kg, but she should have weighed between 18kg and 20kg. 'Thankfully she’s made a fantastic recovery in our care and now weighs nearly 17kg.' Healthy: Staffordshire bull terrier KD, now renamed Lottie, is recovering and looking for a new home . Both mother and son Cy admitted they could have done more to look after their dog. Their solicitor, Neil Saunders, said: 'There is little mitigation here. It must have been obvious the dog was suffering. 'The condition of the house was dire having read the papers, but that is probably part and parcel of why there are carers involved. 'It's neglect over what must have been a considerable time. I can't really mitigate on this because the pictures say it all.' Referring to Cy Whitham, Mr Saunders added: 'There's no room for manoeuvre here. That dog suffered because of him.' Cy Whitham was jailed as his mother's sentencing was adjourned until February 5. Ipswich Town Academy, where Whitham played as midfielder, were unavailable for comment.","Footballer Cy Whitham, who played for Ipswich Town Academy was jailed for causing unnecessary suffering .

Jailed: Hypnotherapist Philip Sherwin, 47, filmed himself sexually abusing a 19-year-old patient in his treatment room while she was in a trance-like state . A judge condemned the lack of regulation in the hypnotherapy industry as he jailed a practitioner who filmed himself sexually assaulting a patient. Philip Sherwin, 47, molested a girl of 19 while she was in a ‘light trance’ after she sought treatment for anxiety issues. A court heard Sherwin had worked in a print factory before setting himself up as a £95-an-hour hypnotherapist. His training amounted to just a week-long training course and two-day seminar. Jailing him for 18 months, Judge Simon Hammond said it was a matter of ‘grave public concern’ that there was no regulatory body to oversee hypnotherapy practitioners. Referring to a report on the case by Professor Graham Wagstaff, an expert in hypnotherapy from Liverpool University, the judge said he was also concerned at the lack of formal training required. In the UK there is no legislation to control hypnotherapy and nothing to stop so-called ‘hypno-cowboys’ with little or no experience. Practitioners can affiliate to one of a plethora of organisations such as the British Hypnotherapy Association, Hypnotherapy Association UK or the Association for Professional Hypnosis and Psychotherapy, which require members to abide by a code of practice. But while rogue practitioners can be struck off from these groups, there is nothing to stop them from continuing to treat patients. Leicester Crown Court heard Sherwin treated the ‘vulnerable’ woman twice, gaining her trust enough so that she took up his offer of a further two free sessions where she would become his ‘guinea-pig’ for research aimed at taking things to ‘a new level’. Worrying: Leicester Crown Court, pictured, heard Sherwin also took provocative photos of the teenager half-reclining in just a skimpy black vest top and pink knickers . On the second of these sessions, Sherwin told her he would perform Chi massage on her while she was under a light hypnosis. Sherwin persuaded the woman to take . her trousers off so he could ‘remove the energy from her legs’, then . proceeded to massage her thighs and touch her intimately. Prosecutor James House said: ‘He told her she may feel sexually aroused but shouldn’t worry.’ Sherwin was a registered member of the . Academy of Hypnotic Arts, run by Jonathan Chase and his partner Jane . Bregazzi from Devon. In an online advert he claimed to have a diploma in . ‘remedial hypnotism’. At the time of the incident he was working at the . Centre of Balance, a multidisciplinary clinic in Leicester. The woman had no knowledge of being . molested until officers discovered the footage, along with  250,000 . pornographic images including 40,000 child porn pictures, on his . computer, in July 2010. The court heard she suffered depression . afterwards and was unable to take up her place at university. Sherwin, from Leicester, admitted sexual assault and possessing indecent images of children. The judge imposed a restraining order . on Sherwin forbidding any contact with the victim and banned him from . ever working with children. His computer use will be monitored and he . will be on the sex offender register for ten years.","Philip Sherwin massaged the teenager's naked inner thighs .

The woman could have been electrocuted or killed by an oncoming train in the attack that took place at 2.30pm, but she luckily manages to pull herself off the tracks without injury before a train arrives at the station. The victim, who asked to remain anonymous, told CBSNews: ‘By the time I zipped my jacket back up, that's when he was on me, on my neck. I was just telling him, 'I don't have no money,' and he was just like, 'Shut up.' "" Terrifying: The 23-year-old victim was dragged across the subway platform, pictured, after being repeatedly punched, and thrown onto the track. The attacker fled with her phone .

"PUBLISHED: . 15:33 EST, 18 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 15:34 EST, 18 January 2013 . Craig Slee posted gruesome videos on Facebook of Al-Qaeda beheading captured victims . A 'fantasist' who posted gruesome videos on Facebook of Al-Qaeda beheading captured victims was today jailed for five years. Craig Slee also put online links to a communique by Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb claiming those from the West were 'Crusaders' and encouraging terrorism. The 42-year-old defendant from Preston, Lancashire, created a false identity and set up a Facebook page using the alter-ego 'Hashim X Shakur'. He was also the creator and administrator of another Facebook account called 'FB Mujahideen'. A judge condemned Slee for his 'shocking and barbaric depravity' after he posted a wealth of disturbing videos online. On his 'Hashim X Shakur' Facebook account, Slee claimed to be a Muslim and provided personal information about himself, the majority of which was false. He chatted online under the pretence of his alter-ego, claiming he had been on trips to Jalalabad, Afghanistan, intimated he had suffered shrapnel injuries and inferred he was a member of the Taliban. Anti-terror police found Slee has no connection to the Taliban, Al-Qaeda or any other terrorist network or organisation. Officers also recovered a can of CS gas from an address in Preston linked to Slee following the investigation by the North West Counter Terrorism Unit. He pleaded guilty to four offences under the 2006 Terrorism Act; encouraging terrorism and dissemination of terrorist publications - and one count of possession of a prohibited weapon. One clip he posted was entitled 'The . Execution of American Soldier Nick Berg' recording the beheading of the . victim carried out by Abu Musad al-Zarqawi a senior Al-Qaeda figure in Iraq. Slee created an alter-ego, claiming he had been on trips to Jalalabad, Afghanistan, intimated he had suffered shrapnel injuries and inferred he was a member of the Taliban (posed by model) The video also contained footage of the beheading of an unknown man which is referred to as the 'slaughtering of one of the spies who inform about the explosive devices south of Mosul', followed by footage of the beheading of an Iraqi army major. Another video showed attacks on the vehicles of 'Jews and Christians' referred to as enemies who invaded Afghanistan unjustly and another example of videos intended to 'glorify terrorism and encourage people to engage in terrorism,' the court heard. Jailing Slee for five years at Preston Crown Court, Judge Anthony Russell QC said: 'It beggars belief that anyone can have an interest in such material which reveals a shocking and barbaric depravity and complete absence of any degree of humanity. 'There is no doubt that this and the other videos have been created in order to encourage people to rally to the terrorist cause, however difficult it is to comprehend that such material would have that result except for the most perverted of minds.' Outside court Detective Chief Superintendent Tony Mole, head of the North West Counter Terrorism Unit, said: 'It is clear that Slee was a total fantasist. 'He had no links whatsoever to any terrorist organisations, was not a radical convert and there is no evidence whatsoever to suggest he engaged in any attack planning. 'However, what this case illustrates is the very real dangers of misusing the material that is ready available on the internet. 'The power of the internet and social networking sites is vast and extends worldwide, so while Slee may not have been planning any sort of attack, he could easily have influenced someone else with the propaganda he was uploading. 'I want to stress that this case is not about policing people's freedom to browse the internet. 'The materials that were downloaded were not stumbled upon by chance - these had to be searched for and contained very dangerous information - that is why we had to take action.'","Craig Slee created an alter-ego and inferred he was a member of the Taliban .

A disturbed Delaware woman allegedly had sex with a dog in her home while her boyfriend photographed her. Samantha L. Golt, 24, and James P. Crow, 25, were arrested on Tuesday, January 10, following an investigation into their heinous act, state police said. The investigation began on December 28 when a concerned neighbor tipped off state troopers about the abuse of a canine, according to court documents. Deranged: Samantha Golt, left, engaged in sexual intercourse with a dog while her boyfriend James Crow, 25, took photographs, police say . Odd couple: The couple performed their disturbing act of bestiality in their home west of Milford, Delware . Troopers found that Golt had engaged in sexual intercourse with a dog in her home west of Milford, Delware, while her boyfriend Crow took photographs, said Master Corporeal Gary Fournier. The date of offense was listed in court papers as occurring between 8am on August 31, 2012 and 1:12am on December 29, 2012, according to records. Investigators compared Golt’s driver’s license photo with the photographs seized as evidence in order, Fournier said. By doing so they were able to positively identify her, he said. Golt and Crow were each charged with one count of felony bestiality and felony second-degree conspiracy. The perverted couple were later released after posting $12,000 secured bail. Both Golt and Crow, center, were charged with one count of felony bestiality and felony second-degree conspiracy . A state police spokesman said that the couple was issued a no-contact order with any animal during their initial court appearance on the charges. Authorities said a local SPCA was notified at the time of the investigation, and that no animals were removed before charges were filed this week. Beth Butts, Kent County SPCA spokesman, told Delaware State News that a bestiality charge is rare, and the shelter ‘feels like any level of animal abuse is absolutely abhorrent.’ ‘Animals need to have protection the same as children do in that they are innocent and can’t defend themselves,’ she said. Butts said that domesticated animals build up a level of trust with their owners and can be more vulnerable to abusive attacks. ‘If you have a dog or any other pet that trusts you and you begin hitting or kicking it or committing any kind of abuse, they will not bring much of a defense because they’ve been under your protective, trusting care for a period of time,’ she said. ‘They think you’re supposed to be supporting their needs, not abusing them, and don’t react like they should to an attack.’ No pets allowed: A state police spokesman said that the couple was issued a no-contact order with any animal during their initial court appearance on the charges .","Samantha Golt, 24, and James Crow, .

"By . Jaya Narain . PUBLISHED: . 14:24 EST, 23 August 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 01:39 EST, 24 August 2012 . A Heavily-pregnant woman flew from her home in Nigeria to take advantage of the NHS by having her baby in Britain. She had £10,000 of treatment but is understood to have returned to Nigeria with her baby without paying a penny. The woman travelled 3,200 miles from Lagos to Manchester because she was worried about the standard of care in her own country and thought she would  be in safer hands. Health tourist: The woman travelled 3,200 miles from her home in Nigeria to cash-strapped Wythenshawe hospital . On arrival she went straight to Wythenshawe Hospital where she told doctors that there were complications with her pregnancy. Two midwives, two urology consultants, a radiology consultant, two obstetric consultants and  two anaesthetists attended her in the delivery room before her healthy baby was born by emergency Caesarean section on Wednesday of last week. Before she was discharged on Monday, hospital staff sought billing details for the woman and told her the cost of the treatment was around £10,000. However, she is not thought to have paid anything. The heavily-pregnant woman is understood to have cost the NHS £10,000 by having her baby in Britain . Last night MPs called for an inquiry and accused the unnamed woman  of ‘effectively stealing’ from the British taxpayer. The . Government said it hoped new measures would tackle ‘health tourists’ who fly to Britain to take advantage of the world-renowned NHS. Health minister Simon Burns said: ‘We won’t tolerate abuse of our health service. The NHS has a duty to anyone whose life or long-term health is at immediate risk but it is not there to serve the health needs of the globe.’ Hospitals are allowed to bill non-EU patients who travel from their home countries to the UK for medical treatment on the NHS. But health sources say that in  reality patients often return to their homeland without paying and the debts are then almost impossible  to recover. The Harvard-educated woman flew to Manchester Airport and went directly to Wythenshawe Hospital. It is believed she chose the well-respected university hospital because she knew it had a maternity unit and was less than two miles from the airport. On arrival she told doctors she had undergone an ultrasound scan in Nigeria which revealed complications with her pregnancy which suggested a Caesarean was advisable. Nigeria offers free maternity treatment but the quality of the care  is very poor and there is a high mortality rate. A woman there has a one in 13 chance of dying during pregnancy or childbirth, according to recent statistics. Her baby was born at Wythenshawe without complication. Mr Burns said: ‘There are comprehensive rules and procedures to charge visitors for hospital treatment but we know that the system needs to be improved. Pregnancy dash: The woman was rushed from Manchester airport directly to Wythenshawe Hospital . Curiously the woman was educated at elite Harvard University in America . ‘That is why we are currently . reviewing those arrangements to prevent inappropriate free access to the . NHS and provide a fairer more balanced system. Hospitals have a legal . duty to recover any charges made to overseas patients.’ Shadow . Health Secretary Andy Burnham said: ‘We need a full inquiry into the . circumstances and how the hospital has been left in this position. There . are clear rules about health tourism and the NHS must be able to . recover its costs.’ Probe: Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham has demanded an inquiry . Graham . Stringer, Labour MP for the Manchester seat of Blackley and Broughton, . added: ‘This is simply a foreigner choosing to effectively steal off the . NHS and the Government should use whatever powers it has to get the . money back.’ University Hospital of South Manchester NHS Foundation Trust – which runs Wythenshawe – is short of funds and is having to cut £17.5million this year. The hospital has a dedicated team who pursue payment by invoicing patients, but once they leave the UK the hospitals are almost powerless to act. However hospitals can inform the UK Border Agency and repeat entry into the UK by visa may be withheld until the bill is settled. A hospital spokesman said: ‘If a patient is a non-UK resident and treatment is considered necessary  or urgent then it would never  be withheld. ‘In regards to reclaiming costs from non-UK residents who use our services, we adhere to guidelines issued by the Department of Health.’ Figures revealed by Wythenshawe Hospital showed the number of non-EU patients treated rose from 78 in 2008/09 to 133 in 2011/12. Bimbo Ayelabola: Five babies . Nigerian-born Bimbo Ayelabola, 33, travelled to Britain to give birth to quins at a cost of up to £200,000 to British taxpayers. The wife of a wealthy businessman had two boys and three girls by Caesarean section in April last year and was in Homerton Hospital, East London, for almost two weeks. Mrs Ayelabola, from Lagos, who had been taking a fertility drug, said at the time: ‘I had already had miscarriages and couldn’t bear the stress another pregnancy would cause. So I decided to visit my family in London. ‘I thought I would stand a much better chance of avoiding another miscarriage in a calmer place with friends and family.’ Mrs Ayelabola claimed her husband left her and returned to Nigeria after discovering she had given birth to five babies. She was given a visa to stay in Britain which runs out in December of this year. Health tourism is thought to cost the NHS up to £200million  a year. Patients who have lived in the UK for a year get all their NHS treatment free. And emergency care at A&E and walk-in clinics is completely free for anyone. For EU residents, their country covers the cost of other treatment. Non-EU residents get a bill. Urgent but non-emergency treatment such as maternity care is provided regardless of residence status or ability to pay, but hospitals must take steps to recover debts. Non-urgent treatment for chargeable overseas visitors is not supposed to go ahead without full payment.","She travelled 3,200 miles from Lagos to cash-strapped Wythenshawe hospital in Manchester ."

'Eye-watering' sums: High-ranking army officer Robert Jolleys allegedly took money fraudulently to pay for his children to attend boarding school . A former high-ranking army officer allegedly claimed almost £220,000 to pay for his three children to attend a prestigious private boarding school. Lieutenant Colonel Robert Jolleys, 52, allegedly took ‘eye-watering’ sums of money to pay fees for £28,000-a-year Stonyhurst College in Lancashire from the Army’s Continuous Educational Allowance. But when Jolleys separated from his wife Judith he became ineligible for the scheme, which pays for 90 per cent of boarding school education fees for children of serving members of the Army, Swindon Crown Court heard today. He failed to notify higher personnel and filled out forms claiming he was still married in order to receive the money seven years after the couple separated, it is alleged. Lt Col Jolleys, who denies all the charges against him, is accused of asking Judith to lie and state that he was the main provider to the boys when investigations began. The court heard how Jolleys’ scheme paid for sons Rupert, 22, Charles, 20 and William, 15, to attend the prestigious school and that he would not been able to afford to fund their schooling without the money. Prosecutor Nicolas Gerasimidis told the jury how Jolleys carried out the fraud while working for the Directorate of Education Training Services for the Army in Swindon. He said: ‘This is not all just a mistake, it was deliberate from the point at which he knew the separation was inevitable. ‘He knew what his obligations were and he didn’t fulfil those. ‘When the balloon went up he tried to put in a series of measures to try and undo the damage and save face. ‘He wanted to stop them clawing back the rather large sums of money for the education.’ He said the deception was only uncovered by accident in 2009 when Judith phoned his base to find out where he was. Judith told officers she was no longer married to Jolleys, a surprise to his superiors who received paperwork from Jolleys stating that his circumstances had not changed. Jolleys was also living in quarters specifically for serving members of the Forces who were married, the court heard. Records showed Jolleys attempted to file a retrospective application in an attempt to change his status to reveal he was separated so he could fulfil criteria needed for a single parent to claim the money but Army personnel rejected the application and stated he did not qualify. Mr Gerasimidis said: ‘As a senior officer he would have been well versed in his obligations when it came to the disclosure of these personal circumstances. ‘He knew precisely what the rules were. ‘The . point at which his marriage broke down it was his obligation to tell . those above him and it was up to him to try and change his . categorisation but he did not. ‘It was all about getting boarding school fees paid for when he was not entitled to it. ‘It is a very impressive school. It is precisely the sort of place you would want your children to go. Could not afford: Jolleys became ineligible for the scheme after he separated from his wife Judith. The court heard that he would not have been able to afford to send his three children to Stonyhurst College (pictured) without the scheme . ‘It is for that reason extremely expensive, which is shown in the eye-watering sum of money he claimed. ‘Between 2002 and 2009 those eye-watering sums of money total somewhere in the region of £220,00 of school fees.’ The court heard how Jolleys tried to ‘bully’ Judith into claiming he had become the sole provider for the children when suspicions arose. Mr Gerasimidis said: ‘He bullied her and provided her with a document which told her what to say. ‘Using my words, he told her that “you . support me or we are serious trouble. We have just paid £220,000 worth . of education which they may try to get back”.’ 'Bully': Swindon Crown Court (pictured) heard how Jolleys tried to 'bully' wife Judith into claiming he had become the sole provider for the children when suspicions arose . The court also heard that during divorce hearings Jolleys tried to make out that his wife was an unfit mother and accused him of ‘manipulating’ the proceedings to support his assertion that he was the primary carer, Mr Gerasimidis said. He also allegedly forged his wife’s signature on official documents. Mr Gerasimidis said: ‘It is further evidence - not only of the allegation that he forged her signature - but to give the impression that child benefit was going to him rather than his wife.’ He is accused of 11 offences of entering fraudulent expenses claims for education and boarding school allowances relating to his children’s schooling between 2002 and 2009. Jolleys denies five counts of obtaining a money transfer by deception between 2002 and 2006, three charges of fraud by false representation between 2007 and 2009 and three counts of forgery 2004 and 2005. The alleged bogus claims - totalling £218,094.11 - were made at bases where Jolleys was serving, in Upavon, Oxon, and at Harrogate, Yorkshire. The trial was adjourned until tomorrow.

The Moroccan woman at the centre of former Premier Silvio Berlusconi's sex-for-hire trial arrived in court to testify as a witness today - only to learn that the trial did not need to hear her testimony. Karima el-Mahroug, 19, was ordered by the court to appear after failing to show on two previous dates, reportedly because she was in Mexico on holiday. Better known as 'Ruby the heartstealer,' she had been called as a defence witness at the trial in Milan, which Berlusconi had wanted delayed in case it affected his re-election chances. Last witness: Moroccan-born Karima El-Mahroug -- better known by her nickname as 'Ruby the Heart Stealer' arrives for to testify at Milan's court . Berlusconi is accused of paying for sex with el-Mahroug, when she was 17, and then trying and cover it up . His Lawyer Niccolo Ghedini said Berlusconi would be too busy campaigning for the February election to attend court, but judges rejected the application. Berlusconi, 76, is accused of paying for sex with el-Mahroug when she was 17, and then trying to cover it up. Both deny sexual contact. The age of consent in Italy is 14 but paying a woman for sex under the age of 18 is a crime. Prosecutors claim he had sex with her 13 times. Arrival: Karima el-Mahroug, left, arrives in a court room to testify as a witness for the first time, in Milan . Order: El-Mahroug was ordered by the court to appear to testify after failing to show on two previous dates because she was reportedly in Mexico on vacation . El-Mahroug was the last witness due to testify, meaning that a verdict could come before the Feb. 24-25 elections in which Berlusconi is heading a center-right coalition. She looked relaxed, chatting with her lawyer, and wore a dark parka with fur trim and carried a Louis Vuitton handbag. Berlusconi went on trial in 2011 over the sex allegations, which focus on a series of parties he is said to have thrown at his luxury villa at Arcore near Milan. Showgirls and wannabe starlets allegedly performed erotic dances for him and were paid with cars, cash and jewellery. Both . he and Miss El Mahroug deny any wrongdoing, although the teenager is . said to have boasted to friends that Berlusconi gave her several . thousand euros for attending the parties and that he was besotted with . her. Strike a pose: Silvio Berlusconi poses for photographers in RAI's Studios in Rome on Friday . Denials: Ms El-Mahroug who is widely known as Ruby Rubacuori ('heart-stealer') has always denied having sex with the prime minister when she was 17 - or being a prostitute . Trials and accusations: Mr Berlusconi, now 76,  of paying to have sex with Karima El-Mahroug . in 2010 when she was 17 . The former cruise ship crooner-turned-politician has fought numerous legal battles in his 20-year career and two months ago he was convicted of fraud. However, he has insisted all the trials he has faced are politically motivated and he is innocent of all accusations. If convicted of having sex with an . underage prostitute, Berlusconi faces a three-year jail sentence. He is . also on trial for abuse of office after prosecutors said he lied to . cover up for Miss El Mahroug when she was arrested for theft - wrongly . telling police she was related to then Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak . and should be freed. Last week Berlusconi has labelled judges who ordered him to pay his ex-wife £29 million a year in a divorce settlement as 'feminists and communists'. Joke: He insisted that the expression bunga-bunga to refer to alleged sex parties at his villa in Sardinia, came from a joke . Berlucsoni lashed out during a TV interview in his first public comments on the decision which emerged last month. The ruling works out at £82,000 a day, four times the average annual salary for an ordinary Italian but small change to Mr Berlusconi, who has a personal fortune of more than £5 billion. Last month Berlusconi announced his engagement to a girl young enough to be his granddaughter. His new partner is TV showgirl Francesca Pascale, 27, who has been at his side constantly in recent weeks since he announced he would be running in next February’s General Election. He made the revelation during a long and wide-ranging interview on one of his numerous TV stations - and it came despite the fact he is still officially tied to his second wife Veronica Lario. Engagement: Last month Berlusconi announced his engagement to a girl young enough to be his granddaughter. His new partner is TV showgirl Francesca Pascale, 27 . Berlusconi also spoke of his ongoing trial which is centred on his infamous bunga bunga parties and again insisted nothing untoward took place at the evenings in his villa at Arcore near Milan. He said: 'There was nothing illegal going on, they were just elegant dinners. It was a particular moment for me, I had just announced my divorce, my mother and my sister had just died. 'I would go home and there was no-one there, I felt sad.' But Berlusconi hit back at judges and prosecutors in Milan where the case is being heard, once again insisting they were politically led and out to get him. Divorce settlement: Italian premier Silvio Berlusconi, right, has been ordered to pay his ex-wife Veronica Lario £29 million a year . He said: 'I have fallen into their trap, it’s been built up by the judiciary. The trial is just an incredible machination. 'It was an excuse they needed to hit me with a massive defamation operation against me and my government which had international implications.' He added: 'In a twenty year political career you get used to all sorts of insults. But there is something that before God smells of a vendetta. 'I have been convicted to four years in jail by a court in Milan who accused me of being behind a system that saved me three million euros a year but at the same time I paid 570million euros in taxes.' In a 120-minute interview on his Canale 5 station with host Barbara D’Urso, Berlusconi also explained why he was running for prime minister a year after being forced out of office. He said: 'We are in the same situation as 1994 - if I don’t run then the Left will get in. We cannot run the risk of them winning.' Despite his boasts commentators see a win for Berlusconi as unlikely given that his party is trailing third in the polls with around 20 percent of the vote, with Democratic Left leader Pier Luigi Bersani the favourite to win. Berlusconi’s appearance on the show unleashed a storm of protest on the internet, with many expressing anger at what they described as an 'obvious and concrete example of a conflict of interest.'

More than £340million worth of songs were illegally downloaded in the  UK in the first half of 2012, research revealed yesterday. Millions of Britons are breaking the law rather than paying for music, evidence from the Digital Music Index by analysts Musicmetric has shown. The data suggests that the blocking of Pirate Bay – a file-sharing website – earlier this year, has had little impact on an industry worth £1.2billion a year in exports alone. Slowing market: Record labels recognise that the illegal download business is damaging to their sales . Albums by Ed Sheeran and Rihanna were among the most popular downloads . People looking to download music for free have instead turned to BitTorrent, a network where tunes can be obtained speedily, but mostly  illegally, from other users. The sample also reveals how tastes – and the willingness to break the law – differ by region, providing record labels with useful information about file-sharing patterns among consumers. Manchester topped the list of most illegal downloads per capita, with 1.3m in six months, closely followed by Nottingham and Southampton, while London came 20th. The most popular downloads were albums by pop idols Ed Sheeran, Rizzle Kicks and Rihanna, although in retiree hotspot Bournemouth the most popular record was The Discography of the Eagles. Matt Mason, executive director at . BitTorrent which offers legal downloads but is frequently misused, said: 'Knowing what people are downloading and where is incredibly valuable to labels and artists. ‘It’s short-sighted to think that we can simply tell people to stop and they will,’ he added. Record labels recognise that although the illegal download business is damaging to their sales, there is also the potential to capitalise on the massive online fan base, whether through tours, advertising or sponsorship. Chief executive of Musicmetric, Gregory Mead, said: ‘Knowing exactly where your fans are has long been a holy grail for record labels. ‘Understanding what drives them to engage will be vital to helping the industry prosper again soon.

A French rapist suspected of murdering British student Joanna Parrish 23 years ago is set to appear in court tomorrow to face charges that he raped a 15-year-old girl. The serial sex attacker, who has previously been known only by his initials, was today revealed to be 46-year-old lorry driver Thierry Villetard, who is currently serving a jail sentence in Montpellier. French investigators consider him a 'serious suspect' in the murder of 20-year-old Joanna, whose killer has never been found. Villetard, who was 23 at the time of . Joanna's death and lived near her school in Auxerre, is not yet under . formal investigation for her murder. However, after witness accounts named him as the culprit for the killing, judges decided to re-open the murder investigation. The news was welcomed by Joanna's parents, who last summer feared that the killer of their daughter would never be identified. Villetard . was named in an appeal court document containing crucial written . evidence from named witnesses accusing him of involvement in three . murders, one of which allegedly occurred at the same time Joanna died . and in the same area where her body was found. In . 2011 a French judge had ruled that there was no case to answer against . serial killer Michel Fourniret and his ex-wife and accomplice Monique . Olivier, who were previously  under investigation for Joanna’s murder. They . were jailed for life for the murders of seven girls in 2008. The . Parrish investigation was then placed on hold pending new evidence. When . the case against Fourniret and Olivier was dropped, Joanna’s parents . Roger Parrish and Pauline Murrell feared that their two decade campaign . for justice for their daughter, whose naked body was found in a river . near Auxerre after she had been strangled, had failed. But . last spring the Paris Appeal court ordered the investigation to be . resumed when new evidence about Villetard emerged from investigations . carried out by Auxerre gendarmes. In February the prosecutor in Auxerre reported that gendarmes had been given a crucial lead by the suspect’s former girlfriend. The woman revealed that she and Villetard were living in Auxerre in May 1990 when Joanna was killed. The original suspect in Joanna Parrish's murder was Michel Fourniret, a serial killer known as the 'Beast of Ardennes'. Fourniret, 70, is serving a life sentence for killing nine women aged between 12 and 22. He carried out his murders in association with his wife, Monique Olivier, from 1987 to 1990 and again in 2000 to 2001. The couple met in prison, when she agreed to help him abduct young women if he promised to kill her first husband. He was arrested in 2003 after trying to kidnap a Belgian girl, and Olivier later revealed his other crimes too. The pair were convicted and sentenced in 2008. She told gendarmes that one night her boyfriend returned home with scratches on his face and with a jean bag similar to one that Joanna had been carrying. She said that she had read about the missing bag in a newspaper article written just after Joanna’s murder. A second girlfriend of Villetard told police that he had boasted of having been involved in two murders. One took place in 1990, the year Joanna died. According to the second girlfriend's witness account, the version Villetard gave her was that his victim was suffocated by a pillow and her body concealed in woods near a place called Joigny which is fifteen miles from the place where Joanna Parrish was found. The Gloucestershire student was strangled after her hands and feet had been bound and her body flung into a river. She had gone to meet a man who had answered her advert for private English lessons. The second crime Villetard is alleged to have boasted about involved a woman whose naked body was discovered beside a motorway in the south of France in 1997. Corinne Hermann, a spokesman for the law firm representing the Parrish family, said that the new leads were ‘very interesting’ but stressed that Villetard has not yet been formally charged. ‘At the present time he is in prison,' she said. 'The judge in charge of the investigation will study the new evidence in September and will then decide whether to place him under formal investigation.’ Roger Parrish said after the latest evidence emerged last year: 'All I know is it's a man who is serving a prison sentence for violent sexual crimes, and in the investigations an informant told the police they suspected he was involved in Jo's murder.' 1987 Joanna Parrish attends the University of Leeds . 1989 Moves to Auxerre to teach at a French school as part of her degree course . 16 May 1990 Disappears a week before she was due to leave France . 17 May 1990 Naked body found in river outside city . 2005 Monique Olivier tells police she and her husband Michel Fourniret were reponsible for Joanna's murder .

A quick and easy eye test could offer an effective way of measuring how fast multiple sclerosis is progressing in someone with the disease. Researchers performed scans on 164 M.S patients that measured the thickness of the lining at the back of the eye. The team from John Hopkins University found patients with thinning of the retina had both earlier and more active forms of the disease. Breakthrough scan? Optical Coherence Tomography takes just a few minutes per eye . The scan, known as Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), takes just a few minutes per eye and can be performed at a GPs surgery. Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects nerves in the brain and spinal cord, causing problems with muscle movement, balance and vision. Around 8 out of 10 people with M.S. have a type known as relapsing remitting, which means people will have periods where symptoms are mild or disappear followed by flare-ups. After around 10 years half of patients will develop secondary progressive disease where symptoms get worse and there is little remission. It is difficult for doctors to monitor M.S. because its course can be unpredictable. Scientists believe OCT could provide a good way to do this. 'As more therapies are developed to slow . the progression of MS, testing retinal thinning in the eyes may be . helpful in evaluating how effective those therapies are,' said study . author Dr Peter Calabresi. MRI shows multiple sclerosis in the brain: Disease causes inflammation . The team measured the eyes of 164 M.S patients, 59 of whom were showing no symptoms, every six months for around 21 months. They also gave them MRI brain scans once a year. The study found that people with MS relapses had 42 per cent faster thinning than people with MS who had no relapses. The MRI scans revealed people with MS who had signs of active inflammation - known as gadolinium-enhancing lesions - experienced 54 per cent faster thinning. Meanwhile people whose level of disability worsened during the study experienced 37 per cent more thinning than those who had no changes in their level of disability. The study was supported by the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, the National Eye Institute and Braxton Debbie Angela Dillon and Skip Donor Advisor Fund.","Scan measures thickness of lining at the back of the eye .

Barristers are in the dock today after it emerged they have been googling jurors to help them win trials. The top lawyers use information about their jobs, interests, likes and dislikes then tailor courtroom speeches to get a sympathetic hearing. Now  the Bar Council is planning new . guidelines to tackle the problem which has been rapped as 'unethical' by . a Crown Court judge, it was reported. Concerns: Googling of jurors by barristers has been raised with the Bar Council who are to introduce new guidelines . Jurors face a charge of contempt and jail if they are caught researching defendants on the internet while sitting on a case. In 2011, the Lord Chief Justice warned that misuse of the internet posed a threat to the integrity of the jury system. ‘If the jury system is to survive… the misuse of the internet by jurors must stop,’ he said. A study at University College London has revealed that jurors regularly use the internet to research defendants and are often ignorant about the rules. Almost half of all jurors do not know what to do if they know of improper conduct during a case. Search engine: Jurors regularly google judges and barristers in the cases and discuss how they performed and their reputations . Last week at a Law Commission symposium on contempt, Judge Alistair McCreath hit out at barristers googling the background of jurors. Guilty: A trial collapsed after Theodora Dallas researched a defendant online. She was jailed for six months for contempt . The Recorder of Westminster who sits at Southwark Crown Court, said: 'It sounds all wrong. We don't conduct jury research... for good reason. This seems to undermine all that. It stinks.' Attorney General Dominic Grieve has . asked the Commission to overhaul contempt laws which could include a . new criminal offence of researching cases on the internet. The Times reported that jurors often google judges and barristers in the case, discussing their courtroom performances, previous trials they have been involved in and their reputations. Last year a juror who caused a trial to be stopped because she researched a defendant’s past on the internet was jailed for six months. Lecturer Theodora Dallas, 34, turned to the web while trying a man for grievous bodily harm.She discovered he had previously been acquitted of rape – information not given during his assault trial at Luton Crown Court. Dallas shared her findings with her fellow jurors who informed the judge – and the trial of Barry Medlock, 64, a violent drinker, was halted. Andrew Walker, QC, chairman of the Bar Council committee, told the Times that new guidelines would be agreed soon, but would not signal if they would include a ban. He said:' I would expect all barristers to uphold the highest standards of ethical behaviour.'","Crown Court judges condemns practice as 'unethical'

The two men and two women died after their party of six climbers was caught up in the 'serious' avalanche on Bidean Nam Bian in Glencoe at around 2pm this afternoon. Another woman was taken to hospital with serious injuries, and one man was found safe. Emergency services were alerted when another pair of climbers stumbled across one of the casualties lying in the snow, Glencoe mountain rescue said. Tragedy: The avalanche on Bidean Nam Bian in the Scottish Highlands (pictured) left two men and two women dead . Rescue attempt: Search and rescue workers in Glencoe, where an avalanche on Bidean Nam Bian claimed the lives of four climbers . The injured woman was taken to Belford Hospital in Fort William where her condition is said to be 'very serious'. The male survivor, who had stayed on the mountain to help rescue workers search for the missing members of his party, is 'safe and well', police said. John Grieve, leader of Glencoe mountain rescue team, which co-ordinated the search, said the alarm was initially raised by the two climbers - who were not part of the group of six - when they discovered one of the casualties. But, soon after, police were contacted by the male survivor from the climbing party, who told them more people were missing. Fatalities: A member of the Glencoe mountain rescue team at the foot of Bidean Nam Bian in the Scottish Highlands . The climbers are thought to have been . descending a ridge known as Church Door Buttress, just beneath the . summit of Bidean Nam Bian, when the natural disaster struck. It is thought a snow slope broke away and swept five of the climbers down the mountain, killing four and leaving the female climber severely injured. The male survivor managed to escape the falling snow and ice and alerted police. Mr Grieve, who is in Spain and was not part of the search, said: 'The first call to police was from two other people who had been on the mountain, they found someone lying next to where they were climbing. 'So, the assumption was that it was just one casualty, but it became clear that there were others missing when they heard from the man who is safe.' He said the deceased climbers were located using a technique called 'probing', where a metal stick is pushed into the snow. 'To lose four people from a party of six is truly devastating' Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond . 'I'm not sure how deeply buried they were, but using that technique would suggest it was more than a metre,' Mr Grieve said. Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond described the incident as an 'appalling tragedy', adding 'our immediate thoughts and prayers are with the families of those who have been lost'. 'To lose four people from a party of six is truly devastating,' Mr Salmond said. David Gibson, from the Mountaineering Council of Scotland, said: 'This was a significant tragedy. 'The thoughts of the MCoS are with all of those involved and the rescue services up there doing the job they do. 'It is always difficult in these circumstances, but I think the advice we would give to people is to check the weather and avalanche forecasts before setting off, and to assess the risks.' Mr Gibson said Bidean Nam Bian is a munro - a mountain with a height in excess of 3,000ft - with a number of different climbs. Scotland, like much of Britain, has been battered by heavy snow and strong winds in recent days. Grim-faced: Rescue workers inside a van at the foot of the mountain, where the devastating avalanche struck at around 2pm this afternoon . Northern Constabulary said in a statement: 'Police can confirm that four people have lost their lives in the Glencoe avalanche this afternoon. 'Four people, two men and two women were found by searchers and have now been pronounced dead. 'One woman from the party of six remains in a very serious condition at Belford Hospital. The sixth climber who raised the alarm is safe and well and being assessed and cared for by emergency services. 'Police are making efforts to identify the deceased and to contact next of kin,' the statement added.

Alec Simchuk, 46, hobbled into the Miami federal courtroom on a crutch because Russian thugs broke one of his legs in a vain effort to prevent him from returning to the U.S. to plead guilty and testify against his cohorts, most of whom were convicted after an 11-week trial. Federal prosecutors sought a light sentence because Simchuk returned voluntarily from Russia despite the assault and threats against both his life and that of his wife. U.S. District Judge Robert Scola agreed, even shaving four months off the prosecutor's recommended prison term. 'I think he should be given credit for coming here and facing the music,' the judge said. Simchuk testified that he imported his scam from Riga, Latvia, to Miami Beach in 2009. With him came a few dozen attractive Russian and Eastern European women who worked as 'B-Girls,' which is short for 'Bar Girls.' The scantily-clad women trolled swanky South Beach bars looking for rich men – they were instructed to focus on expensive shoes and watches – and invited them back to private clubs operated by Simchuk's gang. Baited: Simchuk has admitted to flying women from Russia and the Baltic States into the U.S. to manipulate men at his private South Beach clubs, including pictured Anna Kilimatova, 25, of Latvia . Speaking out: Testifying against Simchuk and his illegal operations has been 24-year-old 'B-girl' Marina Turcina of Latvia, pictured, who previously pleaded guilty to her involvement . The clubs had cool-sounding names like Caviar Bar and Stars Lounge but were not open to the public. Once there, the women made sure the . men got exceedingly drunk and then ran up huge alcohol charges on their . credit cards. The clubs even had vases where the women would pour out . drinks so the men would have to order more. 'I think he should be given credit for coming here and facing the music' One victim, former Philadelphia TV . weatherman John Bolaris, testified that he was charged some $43,000 over . two nights through the scheme. In all, dozens of men were fraudulently . charged between $400,000 and $1 million, according to court records. The . total is still being calculated. Simchuk initially fled to Russia – . which has no extradition treaty with the U.S. – just before he and 18 . others were indicted by a federal grand jury in 2011. A year later, he agreed to surrender . and cooperate even though his leg had been broken by mobsters after . Simchuk received a threatening phone call from Albert Takhalov, 31, who . was convicted in the recent U.S. trial. Big spenders: Valeria Matsova, 22, pictured of . Estonia, is also one of the named 'B-girls' who helped lure . at least 88 men in all to the private clubs and purposely racking up . thousands of dollars worth of bar tabs . Prize: The women, two pictured from left Kristina Takhalov, 29, of Miami Beach and Agnese Rudaka, 22, of Latvia, were promised a 20 per cent commission off of the men's bar tabs . Simchuk pleaded guilty to charges of . wire fraud and conspiracy to defraud the U.S., which could have landed . him in prison for a much longer term. In court Friday, Simchuk said he . was sorry and pleaded for another chance to live an honest life. His attorney, Michael B. Cohen, said . Simchuk's cooperation was key to the convictions of Takhalov and two . other men in December. They each face more than 20 years in prison when . they are sentenced later this year. 'He did his job. He did what he was supposed to do,' Cohen said. Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Thakur . said Simchuk initially lied about how he broke his leg, telling . investigators he slipped on ice. But Cohen said that was only to protect . his wife, who was still in Russia at the time. In all, 12 of those charged in the scheme pleaded guilty, including most of the 'B-Girls' who have subsequently been deported. Three men were convicted in last . year's trial. One suspect remains a fugitive, and another is scheduled . for trial in the coming months.","Alec Simchuk, 46, hobbled into a Miami courtroom after Russian thugs broke his leg .

Peekaboo: This Komodo dragon baby emerges from its egg this week after 240-some-odd days of incubation at 84 degrees at the Memphis Zoo in Memphis . A Memphis zoo has made a remarkable and rare announcement: the captive birth of a baker's dozen of endangered Komodo dragons - and an amazing three more are on the way. Thirteen of the carnivorous creatures reportedly hatched at the Memphis Zoo starting January 2. An additional trio are said to be now pecking away at their potato-sized eggs in a bid to join the world. 'It certainly is significant, any institution that is producing dragons,' Rick Haeffner of the Denver Zoo told The Commercial Appeal in Memphis, Tennessee. 'For very many years, U.S. zoos had dragons but they weren't successfully reproduced until the early 90s.' The births represent the third time the Memphis Zoo has successfully bred Komodo dragons in a little more than a year. The Commercial Appeal reports that fewer than 20 U.S. zoos have bred Komodo dragons in captivity, and fewer than half that tiny number have succeeded in performing the trick at least twice. The proud parents are reportedly Hollywood Jeff, a 15-year-old Komodo dragon who resided at the Memphis Zoo since 2005 and Norberta, a nine-year-old dragon who's been there for approximately the last five years. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Hello World: Thirteen of the endangered lizards were hatched in captivity at the zoo since the New Year, and another trio are said to be on the way shortly . The zoo lays claim to a third adult dragon, a 12-year-old male named Voltron, who has lived at facility since 2006. 'We've already got a list of other zoos that want Komodo dragons,' Chris Baker, assistant curator of reptiles for the Memphis Zoo told The Commercial Appeal. 'At this point, it's just a matter of making sure everyone's healthy, which they are. It'll depend on the duration of time before we ship. If they're going to hang out for two or three months, we may well get some on display.' The Komodo dragon is indigenous to several Indonesian islands, and can grow to as much as 150 pounds in weight and 10 feet long. Big fella: Kimodo dragons are said to be the largest lizard in the world, growing to about 10 feet long and 150 pounds in size . Rare feat: While most zoos have never bred a Komodo in captivity, the Memphis Zoo (pictured) has accomplished the feat three times in little more than a year . Predator: Indigenous to Indonesia, the Komodo dragon is said to primarily feed on carrion, although it will prey upon live birds, deer, and even attack a human, if provoked . The Komodo dragon is reportedly the largest-living species of lizard on the globe, and feasts on mammals, like deer, as well as birds and invertebrates. The lizard has been known to attack human beings in rare cases. The newborns reportedly have a tough time ahead of them, as their very own mother might try to devour them if they aren't ready for action. ""They'll bite, first day out of the egg,"" Baker told The Commercial Appeal. 'She'll eat them if she can catch them. ... When they hatch out of the egg, they have to be ready to go right then.'

A Mennonite community in Tennessee is grieving after one of its members - and two of his kids- presumably died in a freak canoe accident on a rain-swollen creek in the southeastern area of the state. The Cleveland Daily Banner reports the Mennonite and five of his children were tossed into the frigid Canosauga Creek around 4pm Wednesday, when their canoe capsized amidst the fast-moving waters. Three of the children - and are all under 10 - were reportedly able to swim to the safety of the creek's banks, while their dad and siblings were swept away in the creek's currents. Tragedy: The father and five children tossed into the frigid Canosauga Creek Wednesday were not wearing life vests when their canoe capsized (stock image) All six people - the five children and their still-missing father -  reportedly belong to the same Mennonite family from Delano, an unincorporated community in Tennessee's Polk County. 'It's a real shock to the community, and I'm sure the grief that is spreading out among the Mennonites is significant,"" Polk County Mayor Hoyt Firestone told The Chattanooga Free Times Press. 'It's just one of those freak accidents that you don't plan for. It's just a regrettable situation all over.' Authorities had yet to identify the concerned family by Friday, although the father was said to be in his 30s. An intense search: Rescue workers (pictured) look upon the creek where the accident occurred Wednesday around 4 pm . Flooded: The Canosauga Creek was reportedly flooded by the seven inches of rainfall that had pounded Polk County since Sunday . The family was canoeing along what authorities described as a fast-moving creek, swollen from the seven inches of rain that reportedly deluged Polk County since last Sunday. Emergency workers reportedly canvassed the creek to no avail, beginning their search early Thursday morning. The search was reportedly called off on Friday as authorities coped with freezing temperatures and continued snow and rainfall. A community in mourning: Three of the children were able to swim to safety, while their father and siblings were swept away. All six belong to the local Mennonite community in Delano, Polk County . Newspaper accounts of the search depict concerned Mennonites slogging along the creek's bank, as rescue workers search for their missing brethren. A community farm market where Mennonites usually hawk fresh produce had been turned into a staging area for authorities as they continued the hunt. Polk County is located about 50 miles northeast of Chattanooga. None of the six people who were in the canoe at the time of the accident were reportedly wearing a life preserver at the time it capsized. Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency Co-Chair Dan Hicks had previously said rescuers hoped to find the missing people clinging to trees or fences along the creek, but hope was fading with the cold weather.","Authorities are yet to identify the man - and three kids - believed dead .

The pool at  the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's new home could be moved to a sunnier and more private site it has today been claimed. And the decision may have been influenced by the publication of topless photographs taken of Kate while she was on holiday in France last year. Kate and William are expected to be given Anmer Hall, a Norfolk mansion, by the Queen. Sprawling estate: The royal couple are expected to be given the country house by the Queen. Plans to relocate the pool may have been influenced by the publication of topless pictures of Kate sunbathing . Anmar Hall was lived in by the Duke and Duchess of Kent from 1972 to 1990 and is now leased to James Everett . A planning application has been submitted to the council to make changes to the Georgian property . According to the Sunday Times, a list of refurbishments to the grade II listed Georgian building have been released in planning documents, submitted on December 10 last year. It includes a new driveway, installation of electric gates, and conversion of wood stores. It is believed the work will be carried out by Charles Morris, who has previously worked for the Prince of Wales, and who is the great great grandson of Sir John Kelk, who built the Royal Albert Hall. A source told the paper Anmer Hall was not an 'occasional house' but would be where the couple, who are expecting their first child, intend to spend a lot of time. King’s Lynn and West Norfolk Borough Council is being asked to approve plans to re-route the existing driveway in order to make it more private as well as construct a new garden room. The application, which is described as a ‘major development’ in council papers, also involves converting a wood store into accommodation – which could be used for police guarding the couple - and extending an existing garage block to form an equipment room. Couple: . The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge pictured as the Duchess left hospital . after a severe bout of morning sickness. The couple are currently based . in Kensington Palace, West London . The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh stay at Sandringham every Christmas with the rest of the Royal family . Anmer Hall is one of the 150 properties owned by the Queen on her 20,000 acre estate in north Norfolk and is only two miles east of Sandringham House. It is surrounded by 60 acres of estate farmland, which will afford William and Kate a high level of privacy . At the moment the main entrance to the hall is about 100 yards down a tiny lane which is also used as a public road to St Mary the Virgin Church, where services are held twice a month. Anmer Hall which largely dates back to 1802 was reportedly one of the houses where Prince Charles and his then mistress Camilla Parker Bowles, now the Duchess of Cornwall, used to enjoy secret trysts, when it was rented by the prince’s friend Hugh van Cutsem. William spent many childhood holidays playing in the grounds with the van Cutsem boys, who are all close friends. It was earlier leased to the Duke and Duchess of Kent as their country house from 1972 until 1990. The current tenant is James Everett, who owns a kitchen and timber company, and has leased the property until 2017, which means William and Kate’s son or daughter would be three years old when then move in. The palace declined to comment.","Plans submitted to relocate pool at Anmer Hall which is expected to be gifted to the royal couple .

A teenage girl who almost died after becoming tangled in a noose at a Halloween haunted house cannot remember how the bizarre accident happened. Jessica Rue, 18, was working as an actress at the Creepyworld attraction in St Louis, Missouri, last October when she was found unconscious with the prop around her neck. It is thought that during the two to ten minutes she was left hanging, members of the public walked past her, thinking she was a gory lifesize doll. Coma: Jessica Rue, then 17, was working as an actress at the Creepyworld attraction in St Louis, Missouri, last October when she was found unconscious with a noose around her neck . Eventually discovered by a co-worker, Jessica, then 17, spent three days in a coma before she came to. The noose had choked off oxygen to her brain. One year on, she is not only unable to recall the events leading up to the accident, but also the two weeks beforehand. Jessica could also not understand why, in the weeks after she came out of the coma, she had to stay at home. Grisly: During the two to ten minutes she was left hanging, members of the public likely walked past her, thinking she was a gory life-size doll . She told STLToday.com: 'I wanted to go to school. I couldn't understand why I couldn't go to school.' Jessica was only two days into her job, to scare customers as they walked through a bathroom scene soaked in fake blood, when the accident happened. Although exactly what happened may never be known, it is thought that Jessica was standing on the edge of the bathtub when she slipped and fell. Police found shoe scuff marks on the wall and inside the tub itself. Photos taken of her injuries shortly after she was cut down show ligature marks on her neck and burns on her fingers where she had tried to pull the noose off. In the 12 months since the accident, Jessica said she suffers from headaches, dizziness, heart flutters and even occasional blackouts. She lives with her aunts, Nancy Hakala and Annie Hanger, who said Jessica's personality and behaviour has also changed. She now has to phone to ask for directions to get home and becomes easily frustrated, they told STLToday.com. Ms Hakala, who was Jessica's legal guardian until she turned 18, said the teenager should not have been left to work alone and that the noose should have given way and not have been bolted to the ceiling. In January, Jessica filed a lawsuit against Halloween Productions, the firm that owns Creepyworld.It names Creepyworld owner Larry Kirchner and two employees, Chelsey Rusbarsky and Sam Israelsen, as defendants. The suit claims all three were negligent and encouraged actors, including Jessica, to scare customers while wearing a noose around their necks.

A girl who lost her foot when Syrian jets bombarded her home is just one of the thousands of refugees whose hardship is unleashing a 'staggering humanitarian crisis' in the Middle East, an aid agency said today . Sharifa's new home is now a dirty, hardscrabble refugee camp near Turkey, where she is just one of the children growing up confused and far from home. The hijab-clad girl, who needs crutches to move around the camp, weeps for her lost limb. 'I can't get it back,' she told CNN. Heartbreaking story: Sharifa, a resident of a camp housing Syrian refugees in Turkey, who lost her foot in an airstrike by jets on her village ordered by the regime . 'I just want to walk again. I just want to walk,' she told the news network. 'I don't want to play again, I just want to walk.' Syria's civil war is unleashing a 'staggering humanitarian crisis' on the Middle East as hundreds of thousands of refugees flee violence including gang rape, the International Rescue Committee (IRC) said today. Over 600,000 Syrians have fled abroad - many to neighbouring Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan - as violence has spread and international efforts to find a political solution have sagged. Like many of her young peers who have been uprooted from their homes by the conflict, Sharifa's life has been hijacked - but the defiant girl remains resilient and one day hopes to return to her village. She wants to continue her studies and become a teacher. But while Syria remains gripped by violence between government and rebel forces, that is unlikely to happen soon. Brutalised: Like many of her young peers who have been uprooted from their homes by the conflict, Sharifa's life has been hijacked - but the defiant girl remains resilient and one day hopes to return to her village . 'I just want to walk again. I just want to walk': Sharifa now needs crutches to get around the camp . Opposition activists today claimed an air strike on rebel-held territory south-west of Damascus killed 20 people, including women and children. The death toll adds to the more than 60,000 people estimated to have been killed in the 21-month-old conflict. Elsewhere conditions in other refugee camps are even worse than those endured by Sharifa and her family. Heavy rains at the Zataaria camp in Jordan have repeatedly flooded the fragile tents where thousands are housed. A CNN report claims that some nights nearly 2,000 refugees arrive fleeing the violence in Syria and the agencies running the camp have not got the resources to cope with the influx. And with young children among many of those turning up the situation needs urgent action. Andrew Harper, UNHCR's representative to Jordan, told CNN: 'About 20 per cent of the population is under the age of four. We are getting children five days old, nine days old, ten days old and they are coming across in these sorts of conditions. 'We knew this was coming, we knew that the weather was going to get worse and it's not going to be the last of the wet weather and the snow unfortunately.' Cold: More refugees arrive every day at the Zaataria refugee camp on the Jordanian border . Hard: Freezing winter downpours have flooded tents at the camp, where 20 per cent of the refugees are children . Asked why the agency had not provided more prefabricated housing for the refugees streaming across the border, Mr Harper replied: 'That's money, simple as that. Our funding is about 25 to 50 per cent of what we asked for.' In the 23 page report by the New York-based IRC, published today, refugees interviewed by the NGO cited sexual violence as the main reason they fled Syria. Gang rapes often happened in front of family members and women had been kidnapped, raped, tortured and killed, it said. 'After decades of working in war and disaster zones, the IRC knows that women and girls suffer physical and sexual violence in every conflict. Syria is no exception,' the group added. Rebels and government forces have both been accused of human rights abuses during the conflict, which began with protests against President Bashar al-Assad in March 2011. The unrest soon turned violent and has since become a full-scale civil war. Fierce winter weather has worsened the plight of hundreds of thousands of refugees. The IRC urged donors to step up planning and funding in the expectation that more Syrians will flee. 'Nearly two years into Syria's civil war, the region faces a staggering humanitarian disaster,' the IRC report said. Making good: The agencies in charge of running the camp say they do not have enough money for what they need . Better than home: Rebels and government forces have both been accused of human rights abuses during the conflict, which began with protests against President Bashar al-Assad in March 2011 . Despite advancing in Syria's north and east and winning support from regional powers like Turkey and Saudi Arabia, the Syrian rebels have been unable to break a military stalemate with government forces elsewhere. They have struggled to counter government air power in particular, making it hard for them to take and hold territory crucial to Assad's grip on power, including major cities. An activist in Moadamiyeh, a rebel-held town southwest of Damascus, said an air strike there killed 20 people on Monday. Activist video footage showed images of the limp body of a boy being pulled out from broken concrete, his back covered in dust and his front in blood. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a London-based monitoring group, said at least 13 people had died in the air raid but the toll was likely to rise. Syrian state television said 'terrorists' - its word for rebels - had fired a mortar from the Damascus suburb of Daraya on a civilian building in Moadamiyeh, killing women and children. The reports could not be independently verified because of government restrictions on independent media in Syria. Syrian warplanes also bombarded the strategic Taftanaz air base that rebels seized last week, the Observatory said. Inside Syria: Syrian men run to aid injured people in the aftermath of a strike by Syrian government warplanes on the residential neighborhood of Maadamiyeh south of Damascus . Horror: A Syrian carries an injured child in a room of a house damaged in the aftermath of the strike . In another sign of escalating bloodshed, Human Rights Watch said it had evidence that government forces had used multi-barrel rocket launchers to deliver Egyptian-made cluster munitions in recent attacks. 'Syria is escalating and expanding its use of cluster munitions, despite international condemnation of its embrace of this banned weapon,' it said. Syria's rising death toll has brought international intervention no closer. The U.S. and Russia have been deadlocked over how to resolve the crisis. Moscow - which has continued to back its long-standing ally and arms client Assad - urged the opposition on Sunday to make its own proposals in response to a speech by President Assad a week ago. The speech, which reportedly offered no concessions, was criticised by the United Nations and U.S. Syrian rebels described it as a renewed declaration of war. Talks between Russia and the U.S. in Geneva on Friday failed to produce a breakthrough. As diplomatic efforts have stalled, the conflict has continued to draw in Syria's neighbours. A mortar round apparently fired from Syria crashed in a field in Turkey overnight close to a refugee camp housing thousands of Syrians along the border, Turkish state media said. NATO troops have begun deploying Patriot defence missiles in Turkey against a potential attack from its southern neighbour. The missiles are expected to be operational by the end of the month. Turkey is a strong supporter of the Syrian rebels. Nato said Syrian government forces had launched a short-range, Scud-style ballistic missile on Sunday, bringing to more than 20 the number launched in the past month. The missiles, apparently fired against opposition targets, landed in Syrian territory, mostly in northern Syria, a Nato spokeswoman said in Brussels, but some of the missiles landed 'quite close' to the Turkish frontier.","Over 600,000 Syrians have fled abroad to escape violence between rebels and government forces .

High speed 4G mobile phone networks are finally coming to Britain - but consumers will not be able to use them until the end of next year at the earliest, regulator Ofcom admitted today. The telecoms regulator unveiled plans for the auction of fourth generation (4G) bandwidth for mobile phone services, but has said bidding will not start until early 2013. The high speed technology promises to allow smartphone owners to watch high definition TV on the move. High speed delays: Ofcom today announced plans to set up high speed 4G phone networks in the UK - but customers will have to wait until the end of 2013 to use them . Last year, the watchdog said it hoped to run the sale towards the end of 2012, after it was initially scheduled to take place early in 2012. The auction will sell chunks of radio spectrum to support future 4G mobile services, providing superfast broadband to mobile devices. The move will give access to the fourth . generation, or 4G, network, to at least 98% of people across the UK, . which will allow users to download data - such as music and . high-definition films - at much faster speeds, Ofcom said. Eddie Murphy, telecoms analyst and founder of Priory Consulting, told the BBC that there would be a feeling of deflation in the industry, given the new delay. 'There was a general expectation that there would be a date for the auction this morning,' he said.'But it's probably very important from Ofcom's point of view to get it right.' The auction will offer the equivalent of three-quarters of the mobile spectrum currently in use - some 80% more than released in the 3G auction which took place in 2000. The proposed reserve prices for the 4G auction lots add up to £805.1 million - but they are thought to raise much more after the 3G sale pulled in a staggering £22.5 billion from mobile companies. Mobile phone masts across Britain will need to be upgraded to use the new high speed 4G networks . Ofcom said it expects the auction process to start before the end of this year, with prospective bidders required formally to apply to take part. Those applications will then be assessed by Ofcom before the bidding phase starts, likely to be in early 2013. Mobile operators are expected to start rolling out 4G networks using the auctioned spectrum from the middle of 2013, and to start offering 4G services to consumers later that year, Ofcom added. Ofcom chief executive Ed Richards said: 'The 4G auction has been designed to deliver the maximum possible benefit to consumers and citizens across the UK. 'As a direct result of the measures Ofcom is introducing, consumers will be able to surf the web, stream videos and download email attachments on their mobile device from almost every home in the UK.' Ofcom decided to reserve a minimum amount of spectrum in the auction for a fourth operator on top of the three biggest mobile companies - Vodafone, 02 owner Telefonica, and Orange and T-Mobile firm Everything Everywhere. The new auction will offer at least two spectrum bands - 800 MHz and 2.6 GHz. The lower frequency 800 MHz band is ideal for widespread mobile coverage, while the higher frequency is ideal for delivering the capacity needed to deliver faster speeds. The combination of low and high frequency spectrum creates the potential for 4G mobile broadband services to be widely available across the UK, while offering capacity to cope with significant demand in urban areas.","Bidding to run new networks will not start until 2013 .

Vibrant graffiti and frescoes uncovered during a restoration of the Colosseum in Rome have revealed the arena, famed for its bloody gladiator battles, was a far more colourful place than had previously been thought. Traces of red, black, green and blue frescoes, as well as graffiti and drawings of phallic symbols, were found in the 1st century building's only intact internal passageway which sits between the second and third levels. The findings paint an all together different appearance than the monochrome grey and red brick that archeologists had previously imagined for the famous 50,000-seat amphitheatre. Find: Brightly coloured fragments of frescoes were found during a restoration of a passageway inside the Colosseum . A restorer stands in front a wall with remains of frescoes and graffiti . The findings were part of a long-delayed restoration of Rome's Colosseum . They show that while the exposed seating area was . covered in white marble, the insides, the galleries, all the corridors . and transverse hallways were completely colored. Huge amounts of calcified rock and dirt . had hidden the frescoes, which were finally revealed during the cleaning and . restoration project, which began in November. Among the finds was a red palm frond and a picture of a crown believed to have been drawn by a gladiator fan as he or she passed through the passageway. Another restored section has images of a phallus, which officials said was commonly drawn for good luck. The Latin word 'VIND', referring to victory or revenge, was also found. Colosseum director Rosella Rea said less than one per cent of the painted surfaces of the Colosseum remain. She said: 'We need to imagine a building with extreme contrasts of color. This was a surprise. 'Many of the splashes of color are covered with layers of more recent graffiti. ""Ricciu"" signed his name there with the date 1943. ""Maria"" and ""Filippo"" did as well. Someone else left some drawings in 1620.' The ancient graffiti, seen here in red in the background, was another discovery of the restoration . The frescoes were hidden under decades of calcified rock and grime, and were revealed after the surfaces were cleaned . Archaeologist Alessandro Danesi shows brightly coloured fragments of frescoes inside a corridor of the Colosseum . Officials say the scrawlings probably . date from the 3rd century, after the Colosseum was restored following a . fire in A.D. 217. but some may be even earlier. The passageway, which will be open to the public later on this year, leads to the highest level of seating - a wooden gallery reserved for the lowest classes and furthest . from the action in the arena. It was built between 72 and 80 AD and was originally used for gladiator contests, and re-enacting sea battles. It was the largest ever built in the Roman Empire, and was constructed of concrete and stone. In its heyday it could seat 50,000 spectators on three tiers of seating. The building ceased to be used for entertainment in the early medieval era. It was then used for a variety of purposes, including housing and and a Christian shrine. The exterior of the building is visited by millions of tourists each year. 'We're used to thinking that during excavations, archaeological surprises are a risk for builders and for the city's development,' said Rome archaeological heritage superintendent Mariarosaria Barbera. 'This is a beautiful archaeological surprise Even in a monument as well known as this one, studied all over the world, there are still new things to discover.' Aside from the hallway cleaning, the Colosseum is set to undergo €25 million ($33.31 million) head-to-toe restoration funded by Italian businessman Diego Della Valle, founder of the Tod's shoe empire. The effort is primarily designed to shore up the monument, one of the world's most famous, which is crumbling under years of neglect. Asked how such details could have gone undetected for nearly 2,000 years, officials said flatly: money. There simply wasn't funding available to carry out the restoration of the passageway, which Rea said had been a goal for her office for 20 years. Pieces of masonry and rock have fallen from the rafters, and the travertine is covered in gray dirt from car exhaust and pollution. A frescoe reading 'vind' was found - it means victory or revenge . The traces confirmed that while the Colosseum today is a fairly monochrome colour, it used to have halls decked in colour . The nearby subway rattles its . foundations, such that the Colosseum has begun sinking in the same way . the Leaning Tower of Pisa does, with a 40-centimeter (nearly 16-inch) inclination on its south side. 'It's not serious, but it needs to be . restored,' Rea said, noting the last major restoration was carried out . in the 1970s. 'The later you start, the worse it is.' Work has been delayed because of . court challenges to the contract bidding process, with the latest . hearing this week put off until the end of the month. While intriguing, none of the . fragments restored so far rival the gorgeous frescoes found in other . nearby ruins of the Roman Forum, such as the 6th century biblical scenes . in the Santa Maria Antiqua church.

An earthquake hit Loughborough in Leicestershire giving residents an early morning shock. The tremor measured 2.9 magnitude and was recorded by the Edinburgh-based British Geological Society at 5.20am. The quake occurred yesterday at a depth of 13km and was said to have been felt by residents over a wide area including Nottingham, Leicester, Derby and Matlock. Where the earthquake struck: Residents in Loughborough in Leicestershire got a shock . Movement: The tremor measured 2.9 magnitude and was recorded by the Edinburgh-based British Geological Society at 5.20am yesterday . One resident in Groby, Leicestershire, told BBC Radio Leicester: ‘It lasted at least 20 seconds and some DVDs fell off a shelf in my room.’ Another caller, from Leicester, said: ‘It sounded like an underground train coming and everything wobbled, but nothing fell off shelves.’ It was a million times weaker than the 8.9 earthquake which struck off the Japanese coast, causing a devastating tsunami in March 2011. On Monday the old mining area of New Ollerton in Nottinghamshire was also hit by a smaller quake - its second in as many days. The quake measured 1.8 magnitude and struck at 10.09 am at a depth of 2km. Loughborough High Street: The area was the epicentre of the earthquake . Britain is shaken by hundreds of earthquakes every year, but most are too small to detect. Once a century there is a quake with a magnitude of 5.5 which is capable of badly damaging buildings. Britain’s largest quake was in 1931 in Hull -  it had a ­magnitude 6.1 and killed one person. Another damaging UK earthquake was in the Colchester area in 1884. Some 1200 buildings needed repairs, chimneys collapsed and walls were cracked. The tremor was said to have been felt by several residents in New Ollerton. Another earthquake hit the area at 3.59am on Saturday - also at a depth of 2 km. Despite its early morning timing, residents also felt that one too. They are the latest of a recent series of tremors to be measured by the British Geological Survey in the UK. There are roughly 200-300 quakes in Britain every year, but the vast majority are so small that no one notices them. However between 20-30 are over 2.0 magnitude which can be felt over a wider area. Pronounced: A scale showing the Loughborough quake data uploaded from Loughborough High School . UK earthquakes, particularly in Scotland, are most often attributed to glacial rebound. Until about 10, 500 years ago much of the north of the UK was covered by a thick layer of ice - which pushed the rocks down into the underlying mantle. These rocks have been slowly rising back up ever since the ice melted, causing occasional earthquakes in the process. The UK is also subject to tectonic stresses caused by the expansion of the Atlantic Ocean, which is slowly pushing the entire of Eurasia to the east, and from the northward motion of Africa, which is pushing into Europe from the south. In addition there are smaller spreading centres beneath the North Sea, the Rhine Valley and the Bay of Biscay, all of which exert tectonic stresses upon Britain.","Tremor measured 2.9 magnitude and struck at 5.20am .

Lord McAlpine’s lawyers were last night negotiating with ITV for damages over the broadcast in which This Morning host Phillip Schofield presented the Prime Minister with a list of alleged paedophiles. The Conservative peer’s legal team is looking for ‘substantially more’ than the £185,000 it has already agreed with the BBC for the Corporation’s botched Newsnight investigation. Libel claims have a ‘practical ceiling’ of around £200,000 if they reach court. But ITV will be keen to avoid an expensive legal battle and could agree an even higher settlement taking into account Lord McAlpine’s costs. Scroll down for video . This . was the extraordinary moment Philip Scholfield handed a list of alleged paedophiles . to David Cameron - which Lord McAlpine's lawyer says 'destroyed' his . client's reputation in the process . During the live ITV broadcast Schofield handed Mr Cameron a list of names, including Lord McAlpine’s, and asked whether he would be speaking to them. Some of the names were briefly visible to viewers. Lord McAlpine’s lawyers argue those who did not see the names could have gone to the internet and quickly found the false allegations linking him to child abuse. Andrew Reid, McAlpine's solicitor, said in doing so the experienced presenter 'embarrassed the Prime Minister and destroyed the reputation of my client' and has sent a 15-page letter before action to ITV encouraging them to settle. An ITV source told MailOnline that they received the letter on Thursday and will respond to it today - within the 48-hour-deadline set out in the paperwork. Lawyers said the Lord McAlpine, pictured, case could potentially involve the largest number of defendants in British legal history . The former Tory treasurer has said because the BBC is publicly-funded he tempered the claim made against them. But because ITV is a private company he is looking for a huge damages deal, it has emerged. A source close to the peer told MailOnline: 'Lord McAlpine is suing ITV and he would be looking for substantially more damages than the £185,000 he got from the BBC because it is a large private organisation and not taxpayer-funded. 'Up to £500,000 is what they are looking at.' Alan Davies, pictured, could face legal action after mentioning false child abuse allegations against Lord McAlpine . Meanwhile comedian Alan Davies is the latest celebrity to face the possibility of a lawsuit for falsely naming Tory peer Lord McAlpine on Twitter in connection with child abuse claims. The Jonathan Creek star joins a growing number of potential defendants facing libel action which lawyers think could swell to 10,000 – the largest in British legal history. Davies tweeted after a BBC2 Newsnight programme earlier this month which speculated about the identity of a senior Conservative accused of child abuse. The report did not name 70-year-old Lord McAlpine. But social networking sites were quickly awash with his name. It later emerged he had been falsely accused. Davies, 46, tweeted to his 440,000 followers: ‘Any clues as to who this Tory paedophile is...?’ He then retweeted a response naming Lord McAlpine. Davies, who appears on BBC2 panel show QI, refused to comment yesterday. Others who tweeted the peer’s name include Sally Bercow, wife of Commons Speaker John Bercow. She tweeted to her 59,000 followers on November 4: ‘Why is Lord McAlpine trending? *innocent face*.’ On Friday she tweeted: ‘Yes had letter from Lord McA. His lawyers ambulance chasers tbh [to be honest] #bigbullies.’ BBC controversy: Lord McAlpine announced last week that he is taking landmark legal action against internet gossips who falsely branded him a paedophile after BBC's Newsnight broadcast the wrong claims . Mistake: Sally Bercow took to Twitter to comment on speculation as to the identity of the Tory at the centre of a Newsnight investigation and could be sued . She later added: ‘I don’t have money to contest a multi-millionaire. Lord McA falsely accused but not by me. ‘Loving my trial by tabloid, mind. I . never said Lord McAlpine paedophile – just noted he trending. Nor did I . tweet about *that* Newsnight. This is totally politically motivated, I . tell you. And I don’t do conspiracy theories as a rule.’ She went on: ‘Night twitter. Off to . cuddle up with my lovely husband who takes so much **** (often on my . behalf) #poor John #topspeaker #greatmanontoast.’ The peer’s lawyers have identified . 1,000 ‘original’ tweets and a further 9,000 retweets, which is when a . user re-posts a comment sent to them. About 40 of these potential . defendants have so far approached the peer’s lawyers to apologise. Mr Reid previously warned that tweeters, even those who deleted their accounts or messages, will be contacted so should come forward. He added that it was time to clamp down on Twitter, which allowed people to say 'vile, disgusting' things. 'We have been inundated by the public who have wanted us to deal with this problem of Twitter, and have encouraged and in some cases have actually offered us funds. 'Twitter is not a place where you can gossip and say the nastiest things possible with impunity. 'We've been watching people who have been taking down what they put on Twitter. What they don't seem to understand is that once it's there, you can't take it down and what's more we really have all the information,' he said. 'Not only do we have it, but we have managed to find a couple of firms of experts who are able to produce the pre-tweets, the post-tweets, the effect of the tweets and the re-tweets. 'So what starts as a sort of maybe one (recipient) ends up as 100,000 or more in some cases.' Twitter says information about its users that is not public will not be revealed unless they are legally required to do so. Twitter . adds that to obtain information that is not public – including the full . name of the Twitter user and their address - would require a witness . summons, a court order or another valid legal process. Without . any of these, only the Twitter user’s ID – which could be a pseudonym – . and any other information they have willing disclosed will be . available. Lord McAlpine could now apply for an order which would enable them to obtain the private details of users who tweeted about him. Christopher . Hutchings, a privacy lawyer, said: ‘In . the case of Lord McAlpine, the mere seriousness of the libel would mean . applying for a court order would be a straightforward application.’ His . legal team plans to make each of them pay a nominal sum of possibly £5 . to a children’s charity. Lord McAlpine is not expected to treat people such as Sally Bercow in the same way. Her lawyers approached his legal team last week but were given short shrift. A friend of the peer was reported to . have said: ‘They tried to say she didn’t really mean any harm. We’ve . sent them a letter before action.’ VIDEO: The astonishing moment This .

Friday November 2: Newsnight broadcasts a highly-anticipated investigation into historic abuse at a Welsh children's home. Victim Steve Messham (right) tells them a leading Thatcher-era Tory sexually abused him regularly. Lord McAlpine is never named but the programme leads to huge speculation online and he is named by thousands on Twitter as the subject of the report.

Thursday November 8: In a now infamous exchange David Cameron is confronted by Phillip Schofield on This Morning, who produces a list of names he found online  - which is picked up by a camera - and hands it to his guest. The flustered PM (below right) does not look at the list, and told the presenter 'there is a danger this could turn into a witch-hunt, particularly against people who are gay' and says anyone abused should go straight to the police. Friday November 9: The credibility of the BBC Newsnight report collapses when The Guardian names Lord McAlpine as the subject of the botched probe and lists many reasons why he is a victim of 'mistaken identity'. The corporation now apologises for the investigation, admits it had wrongly focused on Lord McAlpine, admitting all allegations made against him are untrue. All Newsnight investigations also stopped. Victim Steve Messham then admits it is a case of mistaken identity, adding police showed him a picture of his abuser but had falsely said to him the man who abused him was Lord McAlpine. The Tory peer also releases statement saying any links to him are 'wholly false and seriously defamatory'. Saturday November 10: Director general George Entwistle has series of disastrous interviews on BBC Radio 4 and BBC Radio 5Live and admits he did not see the Newsnight show, had missed all tweets linked to it and also the Guardian front page from the day before. That evening he resigns and receives a £450,000 pay-off for doing the 'honourable thing' after just 54 days in the job.

Large groups of bats in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park are feared to be infected with the deadly white-nose syndrome . Large groups of bats in one of America's most popular national parks appear to have gone crazy after being infected with a deadly disease. At a time of year when they should be in deep sleep, bats at the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, on the border of Tennessee and North Carolina, are said to be awake, acting in an odd way and attacking people. Officials have said it is likely the bats have been infected with white-nose syndrome, a lethal fungus wiping out a variety of bat species throughout the East Coast. There have been reports of holidaymakers being forced to fight off the bats, while one man was even struck in the forehead in an attack. Some biologists have even warned the disease could could in fact be a possible extinction event, according to The Washington Post. Bill Stiver, supervisor of wildlife biologists at the park, said while it was likely to be white-nose syndrome, it should be confirmed during February when the annual census is carried out. He said: 'Our gut feeling is the disease is starting to manifest itself in the caves.' Steven Thomas, leader of the National Park Service regional monitoring program, made the discovery while he was in the caves, when he saw a white spot on a bat. Tests proved it had been infected with the disease, which is thought to have killed between five million and seven million bats since it was first discovered in 2006. It is feared the disease, which is killing bats up and down the East Coast, could be a possible extinction event . White-nose syndrome is linked to a . cold-loving fungus known as Geomyces destructans and usually strikes . during hibernation, which lasts between October and April. Despite . attempts to battle the fungus by federal agencies and non-profit . groups, it is feared the common little brown bat could disappear in the . East and even in the Midwest if the fungus continues to spread. There are also fears for the northern long-eared bat and the Indiana bat. Reports . of erratic behaviour in the Great Smoky National Park, which has 275 . million visitors a year, started just before Christmas. It is hoped bats in the U.S. will develop an immunity to the fungus, like bats in Europe have. But others fear the worst. Mylea . Bayless, conservation programs manager for Bat Conservation . International in Austin, said: 'We’re watching a potential extinction . event on the order of what we experienced with bison and passenger . pigeons for this group of mammals.' White-nose syndrome (WNS) has been linked to the deaths of at least 5.7 million to 6.7 million North American bats. The condition was first discovered in Schoharie County, New York, USA, in February 2006. Researchers conducted in 2011, found that the condition was caused by a fungus called Geomyces destructans, but no obvious . treatment or means of preventing transmission is known. It has rapidly spread and as of spring 2010, the condition had been found in over 115 caves and mines ranging mostly throughout the Northeastern US and as far south as Alabama and west to Missouri and into four Canadian provinces. Most researchers agree that bat-to-bat transmission is the predominant factor in the spread of the disease. A recent study found that bat-to-bat contact is required for the spread of the disease. The fungus Geomyces destructans has been found in soil samples from infected caves and suggests that it can be transported from cave to cave by soil, such as that carried by human clothing. Precautionary decontamination methods are being encouraged to inhibit the possible spread of spores by humans. Cave management and preservation organizations have been requesting that cave visitors limit their activities and disinfect clothing and equipment that has been used in possibly infected caves. In some cases, access to caves is being closed entirely.","Bats in Great Smoky Mountains National Park have been acting crazy .

A ‘drop-a-dress-size’ diet pill could be on sale within months – and the first weight loss drug for children could follow. An American company has applied for permission to sell lorcaserin under the brand name Belviq to adults in the UK and Europe. If given on the green light, it wants to produce a children’s version. The manufacturers of Lorcaserin that will be sold under the name Belviq if it gets the green light . Given to boys and girls as young as six - the twice-a-day drug, which acts on the brain to curb appetite - could be a flavoured syrup, a chewy pill or a tablet that dissolves in the mouth. The creation of paediatric formulations of new medicines is now required by law. But the idea that children could be fed drugs which act on the brain to make them lose weight has horrified experts. Dr Ian Campbell, a GP and medical . director of charity Weight Concern, said: ‘My immediate reaction is that . I shudder to even contemplate it.’ Tam Fry, of the Child Growth Foundation, described medicating obesity in children as ‘playing with fire’. In a study of 7,000 people, dieters who took the pill for a year lost an average of 8 per cent and in extreme cases up to 40 per cent. Some dieters suffered side-effects including headaches for a fortnight, dizziness or nausea but the drug appeared free of the cardiac and psychiatric problems that caused other drugs to be pulled from the shelves. Lorcaserin, which is taken before breakfast and dinner, mimics the effect on the brain of serotonin, which regulates appetite, making those who take it feel less hungry. Overweight: One third of 11-year-olds are too fat and drug manufacturers said it would only be used for obese children . The drug’s Californian manufacturer, Arena, has applied for permission to sell it to adults in Europe and hopes to get the green light in the first half of 2013 and could go on sale shortly afterwards. In line with EU regulations, Arena has drawn up plans for a paediatric version of lorcaserin for six to 18-year-olds. In recent years, companies seeking a licence for a new drug, have been required to also do tests on children. Medicines for diseases that do not affect youngsters, such as Alzheimer’s, and treatments that would obviously be dangerous, are exempt but most others have to go through the process. Trials of Belviq children will not begin until the drug has been on sale for at least a year and wide-scale use on youngsters is still at least five years away. Craig Audet, Arena’s senior vice president, stressed the drug would be for obese children and teenagers, not those who are merely overweight. He said: ‘When obese children go through puberty, it is almost impossible for them to lose weight. That’s why treating children at a younger age may make sense if diet and exercise alone don’t work.’ Latest figures show that than a third of 11-year-olds are too fat and the numbers are continuing to grow.","American company wants to sell lorcaserin or Belviq in UK and Europe .

Rulings of judges presiding over the Supreme Court, the UK's most powerful court, will be shown on the website for the first time after a successful trial run which saw live web footage of proceedings shown through Sky News. The move will mean that, unlike during the trial, clips of the five minute judgements will be available to view at a later date. Powerful: Supreme Court judges sit in session at its Parliament Square headquarters . Court president Lord Neuberger hopes that the videos will explain the reasoning behind rulings. He told The Times that demand for the Sky News stream had far exceeded expectations with around 20,000 people logging on to watch each month. Supreme Court spokesman Ben Wilson said: 'The idea is partly so that the judgements will be available online for law students, professionals and anyone interested in the outcome of an appeal to watch at their convenience. New audience: Footage from judges rulings at the Supreme Court building, Parliament Square, London, will be posted on YouTube for the first time . 'But it is also very much about trying to reach a wider and younger audience.' The videos, which will be a five minute summary of each case written by its lead judge, will be published on YouTube from next Wednesday. They will feature a brief outline of the case, and reasons for the judges decision. Lord Neuberger has asked for clarity in rulings to ensure that judgements are accessible to all. He said: 'We hope this new service will open up another window on our work and the reasoning behind our decisions, and broaden our audience.' As well as judgements from this year, an archive of 25 cases from 2012 will also be uploaded to the court's dedicated YouTube channel. Three judgements are expected on Wednesday. Videos will be available by lunchtime. The Supreme Court is the highest court of appeal in the UK and helps to shape British law.

She said that she’s ‘shattered’ that her son will likely not be home for the holidays, even as news comes that Hammar might need a presidential pardon from Mexican president Enrique Pena to be released. Scroll down for video . Going home: Ex-Marine Jon Hammar, pictured from his Mexican jail cell with shackles on his leg, returned to the U.S. last month . Upset: Olivia Hammar, the mother of the Marine veteran, has pleaded for her son to be released and to be returned home before Christmas . Speaking with Fox News, Ms Hammar . said: ‘The chances of him coming home for Christmas are not looking good . at this point. I’m shattered. He looks so hopeless and as a mother, to . see your child look like that and not be able to help him, it feels . obscene.’ She continued that the choice to incarcerate him was ‘an administrative mistake.’ She pleaded for Pena to ‘please release him.’ The first photo of Marine Veteran Jon . Hammar, held captive in one of Mexico’s most infamous prisons for four . months, has recently been released to the public. The photo shows Hammar, 27, in a solitary cell inside Matamoros state prison in Tamaulipas, shirtless, barefoot and chained by handcuffs around his right ankle. He was photographed sitting on an thin mattress with a red blanket in a room with chipped walls and a squalid floor. He does not appear to have any visible injuries. The email containing the photo was sent anonymously to Hammar's mother from a Yahoo.mx account. ‘His eyes look a little lost,’ his . mother, Olivia Hammar, told Fox News Latino. ‘It doesn't look like him. I . feel like my blood pressure is through the roof.’ An summer surfing trip turned into a nightmare for Hammar, who was arrested and thrown into the northeastern Mexico prison where he was subjected to death threats. Trapped: Marine Jon Hammer has been stuck in a Mexican jail since August, when he was detained on a weapons charge . Now, four months after his arrest, his family in South Florida is still fighting to get him back. Hammar and a friend were on their . way to Costa Rica in August and planned to drive across the Mexican . border near Matamoros in a Winnebago filled with surfboards and camping . gear. Hammar asked U.S. border agents . what to do with an unloaded shotgun, which his family said belonged to . his great-grandfather. 'They examined it, they weighed it, they said you have to fill out this form,' his father, also named Jon, told The Associated Press in a phone interview on Tuesday, December 11. But when Hammar and his friend crossed the border and handed the paperwork to Mexican officials, they impounded the RV and jailed the two men, saying it was illegal to carry that type of gun - which they deemed to be an inch too short. Hammar's friend was later released because the gun did not belong to him. The Hammar family's attorney Eddie Varon-Levy said Mexican law prohibits civilians from carrying certain types of guns, like sawed-off shotguns, which can be more easily concealed. Mexican law prohibits shotguns with a barrel of less than 25 inches. Varon-Levy said . Mexican officials measured the barrel on Hammar's shotgun as 24 inches and that it has not been sawed off. Family members said the gun was . purchased at Sears and blamed U.S. officials for telling Hammar he could . bring it across the border in the first place. Hero: Hammar was a combat veteran who had been treated for PTSD just before his arrest in Mexico . Distraught family: Hammar's parents Jon and Olivia Hammar, are now fighting for their son's safe return from Mexico . Varon-Levy also questioned the way Mexican officials measured the gun, because the measurements can differ depending on where they are taken on the barrel. He said dealing with Mexican authorities has also been difficult. He said Hammar was brought to court a few weeks ago, where officials tried to convince him to plead guilty without a lawyer present. Varon-Levy said he didn't show up because he was told there was a continuance. 'I am fuming,' he said. Hammar could face 12 years in prison, but Varon-Levy said that is unlikely. He wants to get the charges downgraded, in hopes that Hammar can plead guilty to a lesser charge of carrying an unregistered weapon, which carries only a fine. Hammar served in Iraq and Afghanistan before being honorably discharged from the Marines in 2007. His mother said surfing helped him cope after he was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. Hammar developed PTSD following the death of a fellow Marine who was killed by a sniper's bullet . when the two served together in Fallujah, Iraq. He had just completed . treatment at a center for veterans in California last year, . before getting detained during his misadventure in Matamoros. Weapon in question: Hammar had his great-grandfather's antique rifle inspected at the border, but he was arrested for carrying it anyway . Ricardo Alday, spokesman for the Mexican Embassy, said in a statement: 'Mexican authorities have fully guaranteed his right to Consular assistance; therefore Mr Hammar has been in contact with U.S. Consular officers in Mexico who have regularly visited him. 'The possession of any weapon restricted for the use of the Army in Mexico is a Federal crime, regardless of whether you declare it or not upon entering the country, and must be automatically prosecuted.' Alday said Harmmar has the right to defense counsel and a fair trial 'as any other detainee facing criminal charges. 'In addition, his life and integrity are protected by national and international laws.' In danger: Hammar is periodically shackled to his bed in a cell by himself and subjected to death threats and extortion demands from cartel gangsters . Still, Hammar is being held in one of the most dangerous areas in Mexico. Matamoros is the active headquarters of the Gulf Cartel, which has been fighting with its former running drug routes along the eastern end of the Texas-Mexico border. A fight among inmates at the prison in October 2011 left 20 dead and 12 injured. When first arrested Hammar was held with the prison's general population, which is filled mostly with members of drug cartels. Now, the 27-year-old marine veteran is periodically shackled to his bed in a cell by himself and subjected to death threats and extortion demands from cartel gangsters, according to his father. The two occasionally speak to one another over the phone. 'Sometimes he's got his head on good. We're like just, ""Hang in there. We're doing everything we can,""' said Jon Hammar Senior, a 48-year-old software engineer. 'Other days, it's like, it's not as good,' In August, the family received a frightening middle of the night phone call from the cartel demanding money, Jon Hammar Senior said. '""Lady, this isn't about the police. This is our house. We have your son. We're going to kill him if you don't send us money,""' Jon Hammar Senior said, recounting the phone call. The couple planned to wire the money to an account, but officials at the U.S. consulate intervened and contacted prison officials. His son was moved into a private cell the next day, he said. Peter Velasco, a spokesman for the State Department, said officials have visited Hammar three times, spoken with him by phone and contacted prison officials to stop them from chaining him to the bed. 'The safety and well-being of U.S. citizens is something we take very seriously,' said Velasco. U.S. Senator Bill Nelson, a Florida Democrat, spoke on the Senate floor Tuesday, December 11, asking Mexican authorities to release Hammar. Jailed: Hammar was taken into custody right after crossing the border from Brownsivlle, Texas, and is now being held at a prison in Matamoros . U.S. Rep Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, of Florida, said: 'This is just an outrageous case.' She was contacted by Hammar's mother Olivia, who asked the Republican congresswoman for help. She added: 'If the parents had not told me about it, and his friends had not gotten involved, I would say that it was just not possible for someone to be in so much trouble for doing the right thing.' Ros-Lehtinen also urged the State Department to work incessantly to reunite Hammar with his family and said she's disappointed the agency has not told her what efforts have been made. The Miami Republican said she plans to contact the Department of Homeland Security and Customs and Border Patrol about Hammar's arrest. 'The Hammar family has suffered a great deal since their son's unjust incarceration in August and the details they have provided to my office are gripping and a clear abuse of Jon's human rights,' she said in a statement.

Scientists have shown that we automatically link lighter or fairer colours with female names and qualities and darker shades with more masculine attributes. As a consequence, most assume that a waiter carrying two glasses of wine would almost certainly give the red to the man and the white to the woman, say the Dutch psychologists. Fairer sex: Researchers found we automatically link lighter colours with female names and darker shades with more masculine attributes . Researcher Gün Semin began by showing a group of volunteers a selection of male and female names printed on a grey background. Some were in white text and others in black. The men and women had only three-quarters of a second to decide whether each name was male or female. The results, presented at the British Science Festival, were clear cut. Professor Semin, of Utrecht University, said: ‘I have never seen such a beautiful result. The male names in black were processed significantly faster than those in white. ‘And the reverse was true for the female names. Those in the white typeface were processed much faster. It was a very strong effect.’ In another experiment, volunteers were shown adjectives before the names flashed up. The words ‘soft’, ‘submissive’ and ‘weak’ sped up the processing of female names, while ‘assertive’, ‘strong’ and ‘weighty’ aided the sorting of male ones. Volunteers were also asked to imagine a waiter bringing a couple’s order to the table. Eighty per cent said that if he had a glass of red wine and one of white, he would give the red to the man and the white to the woman. Similarly, most assumed an espresso would have been ordered by the male and a cappuccino by the female. Professor Semin, of Utrecht University, said that it seems that both sexes link brighter, lighter colours with women and darker ones with men. ‘I can only speculate that there is some notion about purity.  The myth has always been that virginity and purity is distinctly female, whereas males have a dark, sinister, adventurous side. ‘I don’t know what the origin of that is but the effects are unbelievably strong.’","Dutch researchers show volunteers names printed on grey background .

Three out of four doctors struck off the medical register this year were trained abroad, figures show. It means that those who qualified overseas were over five times more  likely to be struck off than British graduates. The data comes amid growing alarm that many foreign doctors are simply not up to scratch, putting the safety of patients at risk. David Gray, left, died when Dr Daniel Ubani gave him a lethal overdose on his first shift providing out of hours care in the UK, while Nicola Sams, right, died after Dr Navin Shankar missed her cancer for six years . Three quarters of doctors who have been struck off in the last year were trained abroad . There is also concern that European law prevents doctors from the Continent from having their ability to speak English tested. While those from outside the EU sit tests of language and competency before being placed on the medical register, one paper is a multiple-choice exam that can be taken over and over again. The General Medical Council has now promised to introduce measures to ensure foreign doctors face a more rigorous assessment. Critics say many of the problems can be traced back to the introduction of a lucrative new contract for GPs under the last Labour government. This allowed them to opt out of out-of-hours work. The Working Time Directive, which limits the working week to 48 hours, has also pushed up demand for locums, some of them flown in. The figures, revealed through a Freedom of Information Request, show that 194 of the 285 doctors struck off for misconduct or incompetence in the past five years were foreign-trained, while 29 of the 39 removed from the medical register in the past year received their medical degree overseas. Julia Manning, chief executive of 202 Health, has said the assessment of doctors coming into the country should be reviewed . With only one-third of the 250,000 doctors on the medical register trained outside the UK, this means that those from overseas were more than five times more likely than British doctors to be banned. The data, from the GMC, shows India has the largest number of doctors struck off in Britain since 2008, followed by Nigeria and Egypt. Hong Kong has the best record, with none of more than 700 doctors working here struck off or disciplined in the past five years. New Zealand’s 600 medics also have a clean record. Julia Manning, chief executive of the 2020 Health think-tank, said: ‘These figures are really worrying and shocking. We need to take a hard look at the assessment of all doctors coming into the country.’ She questioned whether foreign-trained locums are familiar with British medical practices, adding: ‘If I was a hospital chief executive, I would check just how rigorously we have assessed our own doctors.’ Roger Goss, of campaign group Patient Concern, said money may help buy medical qualifications in some countries. Fear of reprisals may mean health professionals are less willing to report colleagues based in Britain, he claimed. Umesh Prahbu, vice-chairman of the British International Doctors’ Association, said: ‘The NHS is known for having problems with discrimination and racism and I think this is part of it.’ Dr Prahbu, who trained in India, said that the technical training there is similar to that in Britain – but it is more difficult to learn the ‘softer’ skills needed and to ensure that patients feel they are being treated courteously. Dr Jerome Ikwueke, left, was suspended for 12 months in July 2010 after failing to spot the abuse of Baby P, while Dr Freddy Patel, right, was struck off in August after the botched post-mortem of Ian Tomlinson . Dr Vivienne Nathanson, of the British Medical Association, said: ‘It is clear that doctors who have qualified overseas are more likely to be subject to disciplinary action. However, more research is needed to understand why this is the case. ‘The UK is still short of doctors and so we must ensure that those who come from overseas are given adequate support to be able to practise medicine in the UK.’ GMC chief executive Niall Dickson said: ‘We absolutely acknowledge that when it comes to the serious end of the scale, those from overseas are more likely to appear, and we have set about a series of reforms to address this.’ This includes a requirement that all doctors working the UK undergo annual appraisals. An induction scheme for all doctors new to the health service is to be piloted and the tests for non-EU doctors are being reviewed. Eight patients a week are left brain-damaged, blind or missing an arm or leg due to NHS blunders. In 2010-11 alone, more than £30million paid out to those who lost a limb or left blind or suffering a brain injury as a result of careless and incompetent medical staff. There were 215 claims in that year for brain damage - and almost £12million paid out. The NHS Litigation Authority handled 134 claims involving the amputation of a limb, at cost to the taxpayer of £18million. There were also 56 claims for blindness in England. Since 1998, at least 1,500 people have sued over a lost limb, 2,860 for brain damage and 809 over being blinded. When all types of medical negligence are taken into account, the NHS paid out a record £1.3billion in 2010/11. A 46 per cent increase on the previous year, the total includes a small amount for non-medical claims, including slips and falls in hospitals. The rise is blamed on no-win, no fee lawyers, who sometimes pocket far more money than the patients they represent. Tory MP Chris Skidmore, a member of the Commons health select committee said: 'Where there is negligence and poor performance, we shouldn't be afraid to root it out. 'We must put patients first if we are to have a world-class NHS.' Catherine Dixon, chief executive of the NHS Litigation Authority said: 'In general the NHS is very safe but if an NHS patient has suffered injury as a result of a mistake, it is right that they are financially compensated. 'We aim to help reduce claims by working with the NHS to prevent mistakes from happening in the first place.' BY FIONA MACRAE .","Figures reveal majority of doctors struck off were trained abroad .

Adolf Hitler, pictured in 1934, moved in to a flat opposite the home of Edgar Feuchtwanger in 1929 . A Jew who grew up as a neighbour of Adolf Hitler in Munich has written a book detailing life next door to the man who would become one of history's greatest mass murderers. Edgar Feuchtwanger, 88, was five when Hitler - boss of the rising National Socialist German Workers Party in Munich - moved into a palatial flat at Prinzregentplatz in 1929, opposite his family home. Hitler was to keep the apartment there right up until his suicide in April 1945, but was seldom there after he became chancellor of Germany in 1933. 'It all sounds so cosy when I talk about how I lived in the same road as Hitler, like it was not a big deal,' Edgar said. 'But it's so difficult to think that people you saw almost on a daily basis were responsible for turning the world upside down. 'Hitler would come to Munich at weekends. You could tell he was at home because of the cars parked outside. I remember seeing him once when I crossed the street with my nanny. He looked straight at me, I don't think he smiled. 'A few people stopped and shouted 'Heil Hitler!' In response, he raised his hat, like a democratic politician might do before driving off in an awaiting car. Of course I knew who he was, even as a little boy. As chancellor he was dominating the whole scene. 'On my walk to school I used to admire the gleaming silver Mercedes coup coming and going from the underground garage at the villa of Heinrich Hoffmann, Hitler's photographer - and employer of Hitler's mistress, Eva Braun. 'The parents of a schoolfriend of mine lived next door to Hoffmann, and I remember, probably after the beginning of the Third Reich, Hitler sitting quietly in a deckchair in the next garden. 'But there was a sense of menace in the air, which even as a child I could feel. In the days before 30 June 1934, later dubbed the Night of the Long Knives, the atmosphere was particularly oppressive. Adolf Hitler, pictured leaving the headquarters of the National Socialists party in 1931, kept the flat in Prinzrengentplatz until his suicide in 1945 . Menace in the air: Edgar Feuchtwanger describes the period before June 1934 has 'particularly oppressive' 'At about six o'clock in the morning of that Saturday, I became an unwitting witness to preparations for what was to become the worst political massacre in Europe since St Bartholomew's Night in 16th-century Paris.' This was when Hitler eliminated the leadership of the Brownshirted SA - Stormtrooper - movement because he felt they posed a threat to his power. He went on: 'I was woken up by the slamming of car doors, boots clattering on the pavement, and raised voices. I craned out of the window, which I was just tall enough to do. A long line of cars was parked outside Hitler's apartment block, and men were rushing in and out of the door. 'As a historian, I now know that Hitler had been laying plans to crush the storm troopers. Their leader, Ernst Roehm, a thick-set, brutish-looking man whom I once remember seeing leaving our local polling station with his mother on his arm, wanted a bigger share of the spoils of office. Hitler feared an SA confrontation with the army generals, whose support he needed. Persecuted: Edgar's father was arrested and marched to a concentration camp with other Jewish prisoners, pictured, in Dachua on the outside of Munich . Captives: Jewish 'slave workers' in striped uniforms are pictured at work in a Nazi ammunition factory near Dachau concentration camp during World War II . 'In the early hours of that Saturday morning, Hitler had torn off the insignia of rank from arrested leaders of the Munich SA and handed them over for execution. 'Then he left for Bad Wiessee, 30 miles south of Munich, where he had summoned a meeting of Roehm and the other SA leaders. As I saw, he stopped by his flat, which was en route, and most accounts put his arrival in Bad Wiessee before eight o'clock.' He recalls another occasion how his mother once quipped that there was no milk for them on the doorstep one morning 'because the milkman has left so many bottles at the door of the Hitler residence'. Edgar said there was always a . 'screeching of brakes' and the running of a 'posse of bodyguards' which . indicated when Hitler was back at his home. Lucky escape: Edgar's father managed to get released from the concentration camp in December 1938 and fled the increasingly powerful Nazis. pictured at the Kroll Opera House in Berlin, for Britain . He went on: 'At that stage, seeing him up close did not instil fear. Perhaps if I had thought about it I might have been scared, but it wouldn't have done me any good. I was just curious to see him there.' After the state-sponsored Kristallnacht - Night of Broken Glass - pogrom against the Jews of Germany in November 1938, Edgar's father was arrested and flung into the new concentration camp of Dachau on the outskirts of Munich. Luckily he managed to get released after six weeks and escaped with his family to the UK. Now living in Aveyron, France, Edgar wrote his memoir My Neighbor Hitler: Memories of a Jewish Child with the aid of a French journalist and it is being released next week.

Families woke up across Germany on Christmas Day to play what they thought were religious melodies - and instead got tunes including The Rotten Bones Are Trembling, the official anthem of the Nazi youth movement. Its lyrics run: 'We will continue to march/ Even if everything shatters/ Because today Germany hears us/ And tomorrow, the whole World!' Distressing: Families waking up across Germany on Christmas Day were horrified to find the hate-filled Nazi songs on their new CDs, instead of the religious tunes they expected.

'To the Swastika, devoted are we/ Hail our leader, Hail Hitler to thee!' Corrupting influence: The songs recorded on to the CDs sent out by SOS Children's Villages charity contained lyrics such as 'let the knives slip into the Jew's body' The NSDAP was the National Socialist German Workers Party - from its German initials, Nazi. The most shocking tune copied on to the CDs was Blood Must Flow, which runs: 'Sharpen the long knives on the pavement/ let the knives slip into the Jew's body/ Blood must flow, a whole lot of it/ and we s*** on the freedom of this Jew Republic.' All such songs, along with symbols of Nazism such as the swastika and the lightning flashes of the dreaded SS, have been banned in Germany since the end of the war. Some 50,000 of the Christmas carol CDs were sent to households in Germany by the SOS Children's Villages charity.

'We have had many complaints that we were spreading Nazi hate propaganda,' he added. An investigation has been launched into incitement to hatred by prosecutors in Munich. The Hitler Youth was founded by Hitler in the 1920s to indoctrinate the country's young into Nazi ideals and beliefs.

Close up: Sir David Attenborough reveals the secrets of the rare pink iguana for the first time on screen from its home in the Galapagos Islands . At his age, David Attenborough thought he’d seen most things -  but his extraordinary career still holds surprises. For the first time on screen, the veteran broadcaster reveals the secrets of the very rare pink iguana from its remote home on the Galapagos Islands. Sitting 600 miles west of Ecuador in the Pacific Ocean, the archipelago’s treasure trove of weird and wonderful wildlife intrigued Charles Darwin and inspired his theory of evolution. Now, almost two centuries later, Sir David reveals a spectacular lizard that Darwin missed. In his latest TV series, the 86-year-old naturalist introduces the world to a pink iguana that is so rare that it took until 2009 for it to be documented by science, despite the islands being among the most studied in the world. Describing the reptile, which can grow to more than three feet in length, Sir David said:  ‘It’s a remarkable thing in this day and age when you think about the number of scientists per square metre in the Galapagos and yet suddenly we have discovered a new species. ‘A little periwinkle or something which nobody has identified before is one thing. But this is more than that, it’s a large pink iguana. ‘I used to collect stamps and this was a Penny Black of the natural world in a very big way.’ In Galapagos 3D with David Attenborough, the broadcaster describes how he placed his hands on the creature, thought to be one of fewer than 100 in existence, to calm it ahead of filming. Sir David said: ‘This is a very rare animal I’ve got sitting here and it was a privilege to see it.’ Unfortunately, the iguana took flight mid-way through filming and almost damaged the delicate 3D camera equipment. Scroll down for video . Rare: Sir Richard Attenborough with Dr Gabriele Gentile (right) and a pink iguana that he filmed while he worked on his new Sky series Galapagos 3D in the Galapagos Islands . Anthony Geffen, who produced the three-part series for Sky 3D, said: ‘When he finally came face to face with the iguana it was just one of the most extraordinary moments that I’ve ever experienced: here was the world’s greatest naturalist coming face to face with a new species. ‘In the footsteps of Charles Darwin, but almost 200 years later, David Attenborough was capturing the rare species on film for the first time.’ The pink iguana is believed to be one of fewer than 100 and related to a more yellow iguana that is found on the islands. No one knows why it is pink but scientists think the two species can mate with one another, with studies showing a yellow iguana has genetic material that points to a pink grandfather. Last filming: Sir David was the last to film Galapagos Islands legend Lonesome George who was a 100-year-old giant tortoise - the last of his species . Sir David was also the last to film another of the islands’ icons – Lonesome George, the last of his species of giant tortoise. Thought to be around 100 and with several failed mating projects behind him, he became famous as the world’s rarest creature. He died last June, just ten days after being filmed by Sir David. Sir David, who first visited the Galapagos in 1978 while working on his groundbreaking Life On Earth series for BBC, said: ‘I can’t say I was surprised but I was saddened when the news came two weeks after we’d filmed our interview, old Lonesome had just not woken up and that was his end but he will be… . ‘I know his effigy will be around in the Galapagos for a long time yet.’ The new iguana will feature in the third episode of Galapagos 3D With David Attenborough. The series begins today at 7pm. The Blue Footed Booby is one of the extraordinary creatures native to the Galapagos Islands . Marine iguanaDescribed as ‘hideous looking’ by Darwin and the only sea-going lizard in the world, these digest their own bones to make themselves smaller and more energy-efficient when a change in weather makes food scarce. Found solely on the Galapagos, they can hold their breath underwater for 40 minutes and spit out excess salt from their food through glands near their noses – creating a white ‘wig’ effect.Galapagos penguins With the Galapagos just north of the equator, these live further north than any other type of penguin. Their feet sit underneath their bodies to prevent sunburn in temperatures of 86f-plus (30c+). Only found on the cooler side of the archipelago, they are a petite 16 to 18in tall and weigh just 5lb.  Translucent spiders These live in a network of hollow volcanic ‘pipes’ beneath the islands. The lack of daylight means they don’t need to waste energy making a coloured pigment that provides camouflage, leaving them see-through.Lava lizards Territorial males threaten intruders by perching on rocks in the sun and doing ‘press-ups’. It is thought that the seven different species of lava lizard on the islands had a common ancestor that evolved in different ways to live in different habitats. They live for up to ten years with survival mechanisms including the ability to jettison their tail when a predator grabs hold of it and grow a new one as necessary.Blue-footed boobies Found along the northern Pacific coast of Central and South America, half of all breeding pairs are found on the Galapagos Islands. Male birds show off their feet to prospective mates with a high-stepping strut. The bluer the feet, the more attractive, and likely younger, the suitor. Ungainly on land, blue-footed boobies are exceptional divers and will plunge into the water in search of a meal at speeds of up to 60mph.","Sir David Attenborough examines the iguana in his new series Galapagos 3D .

A Scotsman who married in a kilt, supports Rangers, likes white pudding and drinks Irn-Bru is now being tipped as the possible ruler of Germany. After climbing high and fast through the ranks of Germany’s CDU conservative party, pundits speculate great things lie in store for 41-year-old David McAllister, who is up for re-election as governor in the state of Lower Saxony later this month. The son of a German mother and a Scottish father from the tough Gorbals area of Glasgow, he is recognised as one of the leading figures in Germany's ruling Christian Democratic Union party. Massive fan: The Scottish governor of Germany's Lower Saxony David McAllister (right) receives a jersey from the head coach of Glasgow Rangers, Alistair McCoist (left), in July 2011 . He has a massive following in the wealthy state he leads - so much so that the rival Social Democrats seeking to oust him accuse his party machine of 'creating a Cuba-like cult of personality around him.' Even so, they are unlikely to topple the man who within a decade is expected to lead Germany. In 2008, he was appointed head of the CDU in Lower Saxony, the second most important and powerful regional post in the country. In 2010, he became the state governor - one of a number of mixed-nationality citizens changing the political landscape of the Fatherland. Mr McAllister, who has dual British-German nationality, grew up in Berlin, where his father, James, was a British Army officer on attachment with the signals corps. Before that he was a captain with the 51st Highland Division on active service in Germany during the Second World War. Growing up enclosed by the Berlin Wall left its mark on Mr McAllister. Future leader? Mr McAllister, pictured with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on a visit to a market garden in 2010, is tipped to hold her position one day . He said: 'Berlin was surrounded by communism – that is how I experienced it as a child. This left its mark, and since then my motto has been ""future, not socialism"".' Previously, the youngest conservative party parliamentary leader in Germany, McAllister is a trained lawyer who party insiders believe could be on the chancellorship ticket within ten years. He is known to be well liked – and well rated – by current leader Angela Merkel. Mr McAllister is the first British citizen ever to hold such high office in Germany. Despite feeling German, he described his upbringing as 'very British – British network, British schools. 'While most of the other kids went home to relatives in Britain, I had a German mum so I grew up fluent in both languages.' He said his parents imbued him with an equal sense of pride in Scotland and Germany. However, when he was 11, the family moved to the North Sea coastal town of Bad Bederska, a move which made it 'more or less clear to me that we had turned German then'. Mr McAllister still returns to Scotland to visit cousins in Newton Mearns, and enjoys the odd can of Irn-Bru and shortcake at Christmas. He added: 'I guess the other Scottish thing is I take milk in my tea.' A keen supporter of Rangers and Hanover football clubs, Mr McAllister also plays for the parliamentary 11. Position? 'Like my politics,' he said. 'Centre right.' Though McAllister proposed to his wife on the shores of Loch Ness and married in a kilt, he is keen not to be categorised as the CDU's token German-Scottish politician and only uses his mother tongue with his two young daughters at home. While he insists that he does not have Berlin in his sights just yet, others are convinced he is on the path to greatness. German weekly Stern compared McAllister's career path to that of three-time Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Germany's longest-serving postwar leader. Should ‘Mac’, as the headline writers call him - and 'Big Mac' after he took over the premiership of Lower Saxony - seek Germany's highest office, he has the potential to be Chancellor, said Klaus Wallbaum, political editor at the Hannoversche Allgemeine Zeitung, a Hanover-based daily. 'There aren't really that many others in the CDU of his age who look like coming through,' he said. 'It could happen.' Karl-Heinz Nassmacher, a political scientist at Oldenburg University, said the Scottish name would not hurt his chances. 'It wouldn't bother anyone here,' he said. McAllister met his wife, Dunja Kolleck, when they were studying law in Hanover. They have two daughters, Jamie Elizabeth and Mia Louise, and the family live in Bad Bederska.","David McAllister, 41, married in a kilt, supports Rangers and drinks Irn-Bru .

The ‘arrogant’ teenage son of a decorated Royal Marine has been jailed for raping a girl at a lavish 18th birthday party. Privately educated George Gray, 19, attacked the 17-year-old guest and forced himself on her in a bathroom. Yesterday his father, Colonel Mark Gray, watched as the teenager was sentenced for the rape, which occurred at a party attended by 170 guests who had been entertained by opera singers and a seven-piece band. Convicted: George Gray (left), son of Royal Marine Colonel Mark Gray MBE (right), was sentenced to four years in a young offenders' institute for the rape of a 17-year-old girl . Gray ‘guided’ his victim into a . bathroom at the £3million property next to an area housing a swimming . pool, gym and cinema. There, he locked the door and raped her, covering . her mouth with his hand when she tried to scream, the court heard. The victim had agreed to . kiss the defendant and to go to a quieter area of the house, but had . made it clear she did not want to have sex with him. David Sapiecha, prosecuting, had told the jury: ‘She told him to stop. She was trying to call out but he put his hand on her mouth.’ The court heard that, after the attack, the victim immediately told . friends she had been raped and was taken to hospital. Gray was told to . leave the party and was walking to a friend’s home when a police officer . spotted him staggering, with blood on his face and shirt. Private education: George Gray was a student at Truro School, which charges £3,835 per term for non-boarders, at the time of the sexual assault . The victim, . now at university, said that she had known Gray for some weeks and . thought he was ‘nice’. But, describing the defendant’s actions at the party, Mr Sapiecha said: . ‘George Gray was clearly getting drunker and drunker and was a pest and . misbehaving. He wasn’t interested when the victim said she didn’t want . sexual intercourse. He didn’t care. He was forceful and injured her.’ Gray, from East Lyng, near Taunton, Somerset, denied having sex with the . girl or putting his hand over her mouth. But he was convicted after a . four-day trial and yesterday was sent to a Young Offenders’ Institute . for four years. He will serve half that sentence before he can be . released and will be put on the sex offenders’ register for life. Guilty verdict: George Gray was sentenced to four years at a Young Offenders' Institute at Truro Crown Court . Passing sentence, the judge, Mr Justice Burnett, told Gray he had come across in the witness box as ‘brash and arrogant’. He added: ‘You have shown no remorse and consider yourself to be a victim in all this.’ Gray was 18 and a pupil at £22,000-a-year Truro School in Cornwall at . the time of the rape on October 29 last year. Robert Linford, defending, . said Gray had suffered from Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder . from a young age and was an immature person who tried to ‘big himself . up’. He added: ‘He continues vehemently to protest his innocence.’ Gray’s father has served in Northern Ireland, Iraq, Beirut and the . former Yugoslavia, where, as part of the Nato-led International Security . Assistance Force in 1992, he defied land mines and booby traps to save . 20,000 lives from a planned Serb attack on a dam. He was made an MBE in . 2002.","George Gray, 19, guilty of raping a 17-year-old girl at extravagant party .

Hoax victim: Jacintha Saldanha, 46, committed suicide after receiving a hoax call from Australian radio DJs about the Duchess of Cambridge . The nurse who committed suicide after answering a hoax call about the Duchess of Cambridge had been treated for depression after a previous suicide attempt, it was claimed yesterday. Jacintha Saldanha, who killed herself days after the hoax phone call from two Australian radio DJs, was admitted to a hospital psychiatric ward following two apparent suicide bids. She reportedly took an overdose of pills during a family visit to India last December and tried to commit suicide again just nine days later by jumping from a building. Mrs Saldanha, 46, was kept in intensive care for two days before she received psychiatric care and was reportedly prescribed a nine-month course of anti-depressants. Her family has previously denied any history of depression, and yesterday refused to comment on the reports about her previous suicide attempts in Mangalore, southern India. They have sent letters to the Australian radio station which broadcast the hoax and King Edward VII Hospital in London, where Mrs Saldanha worked and the Duchess of Cambridge was treated for acute morning sickness. The grieving family asked if there was any indication that the nurse was under ‘increased pressure or stress’ in the weeks before her death, or if she was ‘spoken to’ by a matron by telephone a day after the prank call. Mrs Saldanha was found hanged with a scarf at her living quarters at the Central London hospital on December 7. Three days earlier, she was the duty nurse who answered the prank call from DJs Mel Greig and Michael Christian, who pretended to be the Queen and Prince Charles, and transferred the call to a colleague. That nurse revealed confidential medical . information about the pregnant Duchess and the call was broadcast in . Australia and made headlines around the world. Sadness: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge leaving King Edward VII's Hospital after Kate had been treated for severe morning sickness. The couple said they were 'deeply saddened' by the tragedy . Prank: Australian DJs Michael Christian and Mel Greig who were responsible for prank call to King Edward VII hospital . Apologies: DJ's Michael Christian and Mel Greig during an interview on Australia's Channel Seven . British police have passed a file to the Crown Prosecution Service to determine if any offences were committed. The DJs could face a charge of attempting to obtain medical details by deception and charges could be brought against their radio station 2Day FM if it is found to have broadcast the call without the permission of the participants. Members of her family said Mrs Saldanha was so ashamed about the call that she did not tell her husband or their two children about it before her death, despite speaking to them by telephone several times. Nurse Jacintha Saldanha, pictured with her husband Ben Barboza, is believed to have tried to commit suicide twice previously . Relatives in Mangalore said she had only told her husband to watch the news, without telling him she was at the centre of the prank call storm. Reports in the Deccan Herald in Mangalore claimed Mrs Saldanha had been battling depression for at least 12 months. In December last year, she and her husband Benedict Barboza, 49, an accountant, and their son Junal, 17, and adopted daughter Lisha, 14, attended a family wedding near Mangalore. The devout Catholic family celebrated Christmas together but just a few days later Mrs Saldanha was admitted to a private hospital and treated for ‘self-harm’. She was believed to have attempted suicide again on January 8 and was treated at Father Muller Medical College Hospital for head injuries from a ‘fall’. She was kept in intensive care for several days and then transferred to the hospital’s psychiatric ward, where she was treated for depression. Mrs Saldanha was discharged three days later and given a nine-month course of anti-depressants, and doctors warned her family of ‘the risk of deliberate self-harm and the need for 24-hour supervision’, according to the Indian paper. Her younger brother Naveen Saldanha, 42, told the Mail on Sunday: ‘We didn’t know about the first incident, but we knew about the second incident at Father Muller.’ He refused to give further details. He said he believed Mrs Saldanha did not tell her family about her involvement in the hoax as she felt ashamed. He said: ‘I want justice for my sister. I want the British authorities to get the truth. My best memory of my sister was her kindness.’ It is not known if staff at King Edward VII Hospital knew of Mrs Saldanha’s treatment in India, and the hospital refused to comment. Her widower Mr Barboza also declined to comment at the family’s home in Bristol, saying: ‘I’m sorry, I don’t want to say anything.’ Funeral: Jacintha Saldanha's daughter Lisha, left, and son Junal, right, are consoled by their father Benedict Barbosa during their mother's funeral . Ms Saldanha, 46, is understood to have spent several days in intensive care before receiving psychiatric treatment and being prescribed a course of powerful antidepressants for nine months following her suicide attempts .","Jacintha Saldanha, 46, killed herself days after answering a hoax phone call from two Australian radio DJs about the Duchess of Cambridge .

Lone voice: The cockerel was branded a potential 'noise nuisance' by his local council after one neighbour complained . When a new resident arrived in a picturesque village, it didn’t take him long to ruffle a few feathers. For rather than fitting in with the ways of country folk, the townie moaned about the noise – from Reg the rooster. He complained to the council, only to find villagers flocking together to support the much-loved cockerel. Now the newcomer and his wife have moved out, much to the relief of residents in Sutton Poyntz, near Weymouth, Dorset. The unnamed couple were upset by the . noise being made close to their detached £450,000 home at 5am every day . and the husband made an official complaint about Reg to Weymouth and . Portland Council. Council officials warned blacksmith Simon Grant-Jones, . who owns the rare exchequer leghorn cockerel, that they had a duty to . investigate. They said checks would be made to see if the bird’s crowing . was excessive – and if it was, enforcement action could be taken under . the Environmental Protection Act. But the threat sparked a village . revolt, starting with a petition that was launched at the local coffee . morning. It was signed by 160 people – more than half the villagers. Such was the ill-feeling towards the . newcomer, villagers say, that he went into hiding. He and his wife have . since sold their home and moved out of Sutton Poyntz, meaning the . complaint is no longer valid. Mr Grant-Jones, who has had Reg for . more than two years, said yesterday that he was relieved the threat to . his rooster had been lifted. Close-knit: Outraged villagers launched a petition at a local coffee morning to make sure that Reg was not removed . ‘I am glad it is all over. I was . overwhelmed by, and very grateful for, the support for Reg,’ he said. ‘Hearing a cockerel crowing in a rural  village is part and parcel of . living in the country. 'The villagers got quite upset about this one . complaint and the threat that Reg would have to be removed. I think the . guy went into hiding. 'Never underestimate the power of the coffee . morning. ‘He has since sold his house and has . moved out. I telephoned the council to tell them this and was told that . there would be no further action against Reg.’ Mr Grant-Jones, 49, who lives with his . wife Lyn, a midwife, and their two children, buys two roosters each . year for the table but has kept Reg because he is a rare breed and . protects his hens. Swift exit: The newcomer who complained is thought to have gone into hiding at his £430,000 house, pictured, before moving out of Sutton Poyntz with his wife . 'Ways of the country': Owner Simon Grant-Jones, left, said he was glad the stand-off was all over and things had gone back to normal in Sutton Poyntz, right . ‘Reg has gone from strength to strength and is now . the proud father of 30 chickens and is a bit of a local hero,’ he said . proudly. Bill Egerton, chairman of the Sutton . Poyntz Society, said: ‘I was horrified when somebody objected to a . cockerel crowing. As a society we do try to preserve the village feel of . the place and having a cockerel crowing is a part of village life. ‘I didn’t know the guy who complained but some people felt incensed by the complaint. ‘His was a point of view that wasn’t shared with the rest of the village.’ A spokesman for the council confirmed that the complaint has now been dropped.","Simon Grant-Jones was warned the council would check if the noise was excessive .

A World War II veteran has spoken of his dismay after his home was targeted by burglars who stole a watch given to him as a memento of his days in the RAF. Graham Furley, 91, has just been awarded the British Empire Medal in the New Year’s Honours for his charity fundraising. He was asleep when his home was burgled by thieves who stole his wallet and iPhone as well as a watch with a gold Spitfire on the face - a reminder of his days as an RAF pilot. Hero: Graham Furley (pictured) was burgled only days after he was awarded a British Empire Medal . Two other watches were also taken from his home in Stroud, Gloucestershire. Mr Furley, who dropped paratroopers over North Africa in 1944 and flew mercy missions over Burma said yesterday of his stolen belongings: ‘The iPhone had everything I needed to know on it and I could always keep in touch.’ He added: ‘The police have been excellent - I hope they catch the perishers.’ The raid on Mr Furley’s house took place on New Year’s Day. Charitable: Mr Furley was awarded a British Empire Medal (pictured) for his charity work. He is well known in Stroud for towing a Santa's sleigh behind his white VW Beetle to raise funds at Christmas . After forcing their way in through a side window, burglars took the Spitfire watch, which has a white metal strap, two watches with multi-dials and brown straps, a brown leather wallet, debit and credit cards, and the black Apple iPhone. Police Sergeant Jo Fletcher said: ‘This gentleman is one of the country’s heroes, having courageously served in the Second World War. ‘This remarkable man put his life on the line to protect the nation and ensure freedom for future generations and then continued in his civilian life by devoting himself to charity work.’ He added: ‘For someone to break into his house is a despicable act and whoever has done this should be ashamed of themselves. ‘We are calling on anyone who knows anything about this burglary to come forward and help us catch those responsible.” Former garage proprietor Mr Furley is a popular figure in Stroud where he is well known for towing a Santa’s sleigh behind his white VW Beetle to raise funds at Christmas time. Last week he said he was ‘mystified’ at being awarded the BEM for his services raising thousands of pounds over several decades for Stroud Hospital. His main job as a pilot in his early 20s was to deliver new planes over the Atlantic. Then after the Second World War, his time in Burma as a pilot was a ‘turning point’ in his life. Making aid drops to civilians, he spotted a village which had been razed to the ground. He urged his senior ranks to allow an extra drop. Veteran: Mr Furley's main job as a pilot in his early 20s was to deliver new planes over the Atlantic . ‘We did so and tipped our wings on the way out, then a week later a man arrived with a wooden box he had made,’ said Mr Furley. ‘I was told he had walked for a week through the jungle to say thank you. I’ve always valued people saying thank you since then.’ Mr Furley’s daughter, Jane Oldmeadow, said it was worrying to think that her father could be honoured in recognition of his services to the community on one day and two days later have his home broken into. Mrs Oldmeadow, 60, said: ‘He’s quite a strong character, so he’s quite cross about it - the fact that they’ve been in and taken his bits and pieces that matter to him.’ The Spitfire watch was a present from his daughter intended to honour his years as a wartime RAF pilot. Anyone with information that could help the investigation should call police on 101 quoting incident 309 of January 1, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.","Thieves broke into Graham Furley's Gloucestershire home as he slept .

The choppy waters braved in yesterday’s annual dip meant many emerged from the sea dripping with blood.

Some of the swimmers were swept towards the rocks. ‘The barnacle-covered rocks meant the . swimmers in difficulty were well covered by grazes. The Inshore Rescue . members on the beach went to help.’ Poor weather for swimming: Heavy rain throughout December has caused havoc across Britain . Up until five years ago only a few dozen took part in the Sidmouth event, but the number has since increased tenfold.

A swim across the Thames in Henley was called off after the Environment Agency said the river was dangerously flooded. It was flowing so fast that the safety boats would not be able to manoeuvre if any of the swimmers got into trouble.

The man and his wife handed over the eight-week-old black and white cat, called Little Boy, who was back with its owner today unharmed. A Romanian woman, 41, was being questioned by police today over the alleged theft - which has caused public outrage over the way the kitnapper roughly man handled the pet and forced it into a black zip-up bag.

Police are now appealing for information about this woman who is pictured holding the cat . Shocking: The woman is pictured putting the cat in her bag . Little Boy was being looked after by animal lover Carol Ivory, 62, at her  shop, Albany Pets, in Diana Street, Cardiff, when he was cruelly snatched last weekend. It was an hour later that Carol realised Little Boy was missing and checked her CCTV. It showed young children . picking the kitten up from its basket, where it had been sleeping, before their mother . snatched it from them, threw it into her handbag and fled. After CCTV footage of the theft was released, officers tracked the kitten to a property a mile away. A shocked husband told police he believed the shoplifter to be his wife after seeing the images. He was returned to an 'overjoyed' Carol, who said: 'I'm absolutely delighted to have him back. 'I'm so glad he's OK, I really feared . the worst, I never thought I'd see his little face again. He's going to . get so pampered and cared for now.' She added: 'I was fearing the worst - the way she chucked it in the bag so roughly was really upsetting. 'I knew that Little Boy wouldn't be cared for properly if that's the way he will be treated. I couldn't believe my eyes when he turned up with him safe and sound.' Carol was looking after Little Boy and his mother Felicity for a friend, who is away on a three-week holiday, when the cat snatcher struck last Saturday. Cute: Little Boy, the cat which was stolen, has been described as timid . Suspicious: The woman is pictured looking around the store . Timid: The black and white kitten - called Little Boy - was not even for sale . A South wales police spokesman confirmed a 41-year-old woman was being questioned over the alleged theft. Police and the RSPCA are investigating and appealing for information about the mystery woman. Carol said: 'I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw what happened. 'The children obviously took a shine to the kitten and you can see on the film that they want it and she is going to steal it. 'But the way she chucks it in the bag so roughly is really upsetting. 'You just know that Little Boy won't be cared for and looked after properly if that's the way he will be treated.' The woman was in a group of people who entered Carol's shop in Roath, Cardiff, at 11am last Saturday. Disgrace: The cat was stolen from Albany Pets in Cardiff . The shop's video shows two men, two women and three children walking around looking at the animals on display. Horrified: Pet shop owner Carol Ivory was looking after the young cat and its mum for a friend . After three minutes and 40 seconds, one of the children is seen holding the male kitten. One of the women takes the animal from the child and motions for the other woman to hand over her handbag, which she does. Holding the kitten in one hand, she opens the handbag and throws the animal inside before closing it again. The video then switches to another camera angle, overlooking the shop entrance, where the two men are standing. About a minute later, the footage shows the women and children walking out of the shop, with one of the children holding the handbag. One of the men pays for an item before following the rest of the group out of the shop with the other man. Lifelong animal lover Carol only noticed the kitten was missing an hour later. She said: 'It was the shock as much as anything - you don't think anyone would do that. 'The thought of a defenceless little kitten being with them is just horrifying.' A reward was put up yesterday for information leading to the safe return of the kitten. Carol added: 'He's so good and very quiet, he doesn't stand up for himself. 'What are they going to do to him if he makes a mess on the carpet out of fright?' Carol yesterday said she was so upset she would not be renewing her licence to sell pets.

Judy and Fred Galietta heard two shots after their six-year-old Brittany Spaniel, Sadie, ran into the backyard of retired police officer Christopher Gibbons' Hampstead, New Hampshire home. 'When I got to her, I knew she was dead,' Judy Galietta told WHDH. 'I lifted up her head and there was nothing. It's like losing a child. She was our life.' But Mr Gibbons claims the animal was pestering his pet rabbits and saw he had no choice but to shoot it dead - and police have revealed that the law is on his side. Scroll down for video . Battle: Christopher Gibbons, left, shot dead Judy Galietta's beloved dog after it went into his garden . He said he awoke on Saturday morning . to find the dog barking at the two pet rabbits he keeps in a pen in his back . garden, and feared the noise might give them heart attacks. 'I went to the window and looked and saw . and the dog was running round and round and round the cage jumping up on it and . clawing it,' he said. When screaming at the dog did make it stop, Mr Gibbons grabbed his AR-15 assault rifle and fired a warning shot from his second floor bedroom window before aiming for animal. 'I shot one round into the dog and killed the dog,' he said. Police said that Gibbons called 911 immediately after shooting the dog to report the incident, and initially claimed he did not know the animal. Killed: The Galiettas believe he shot dead their pet, Sadie, as revenge for their complaints about his noise . Scene: But Mr Gibbons said the dog was barking at and scaring his rabbits in this outdoor cage . But the Galiettas . insist he recognised the dog, who ran around their garden in summer. They said they think he aimed for the dog as they've previously . complained about Gibbons' target shooting. Lt. John Frazier from the Hampstead Police Department said: '[He] probably could have handled it a little bit differently, be more neighbour-like. But what he did is not illegal.' State . law dictates that 'any person may kill a dog that is… out of the care . of its owner… worrying, wounding, or killing sheep, lambs, fowl, or . other domestic animals'. There has been some contention over the exact meaning of the word 'worrying' and the Galiettas are now calling on lawmakers to scrap it from the law. Missed: The Galiettas said Sadie, a six-year-old Brittany Spaniel, was like a child to them . Sadness: Judy and Fred Galietta plan on filing a civil lawsuit against Gibbons and asked for a change in the law . In light of the incident, Rep. John . Sedensky said on Thursday that he plans to call a meeting with local . legislators to see if the law should be changed due to the different . interpretation of 'worrying'. Sen. Jim Rausch said the term 'worrying' was included to protect livestock, especially sheep, in situations where they may be chased by dogs, causing them damage while not being attacked. 'There is a legitimate reason for that terminology,' he said. 'It's not the law that's wrong, it's people not behaving.' He added: 'This situation just highlights that we . have individuals who use no common sense. This should have been resolved . in a manner of good neighborly relations.

The unusual names feature on a list compiled by parenting website Bounty.com of names given to the 430,000 babies born in the UK this year. But traditionalists need not fear, as the most popular names given to both boys and girls sound a great deal more familiar. In the overall top 100 lists Harry came top for boys with Jack in second and Charlie in third place. Amelia has overtaken Olivia as the most popular girls’ name with Emily third. A spokesman for Bounty said yesterday as the lists were released: ‘Parents are being creative and wanting their children to stand out from the crowd with unusual names. ‘Some parents chose unusual names because they don’t want their child to share the same name as others at school. The desire for Classroom ""standout"" is certainly a growing trend.’ School friends: Sailor, Wade, Zed and Hendrix could end up being in the same class as Bliss, Star, Pyper, Kizzie and Buttercup, which have all been recorded on birth certificates over the last 12 months (file picture) She continued: ‘The vast majority of parents acknowledge that their children will probably have an easier ride in the playground if they choose a more traditional name, which is why more conservative names such as Harry and Amelia win out overall.’ The most popular names of 2012 in the boys list are Harry, Jack, Charlie, Oliver and Alfie. The rest of the top ten is made up of Riley, Jacob, James, Thomas and Ethan. In the girls list Amelia is top followed by Olivia, Emily and Jessica. In fifth place is Sophie closely followed by Lily and Mia. Ava, Isla and Ruby complete the top ten. The spokesman added: ‘Today’s baby trends change quickly and names that first seem unusual can quickly become common in the classroom. ‘Just a few years ago Ava and Isla were relatively unheard of as a baby girl’s name yet this year they are both in the top ten. ‘Likewise for boys, there is a growing trend for ‘old man’ names, especially those that are given a contemporary spin by using the nickname for the traditional variation like Alfie, Archie, Bobby, Charlie, Frankie and Freddy. ‘Generally speaking, whatever name a child is given they usually grow up to make it their own.’ 1.

Passengers flying from Heathrow and Gatwick face being forced to pay a 'congestion charge' which would double the amount they would pay in tax compared to at other British Airports. In a bid to address Britain's air capacity crisis, the Government is exploring whether increasing passenger duty could ease congestion at the country's two busiest airports, which are both set to reach full capacity in six years. In a study by HM Revenue and Customs, it was found the number of passengers flying from Heathrow would fall from 23.1million a year to 18.9million if a premium rate of tax was added to fares. Full to bursting: Heathrow Airport is set to reach full capacity in 2019, prompting the Government to explore ways of easing congestion. One solution suggested is to significantly increase passenger taxes . If the plans went ahead, the tax on an economy flight to New York would rise to £32.50. A similar charge at Gatwick would see passenger departures fall from 15.1million to 12.8million in 2014, with the knock-on effect that more passengers would use Luton, Birmingham and Stansted. While Birmingham backs the idea, Heathrow warned it would damage Britain's trade, with carriers choosing to switch to other European hubs. A BAA spokesman told the Daily Telegraph: 'Long haul flights forced out of Heathrow by the higher taxes would not go to other UK airports - they would go to our European competitors in Paris, Frankfurt or Amsterdam. Congested: Gatwick is the busiest single-runway airport in the world and is set to reach full capacity in six years . 'The economic growth and trade deals that come with these flights would then benefit Europe, not the UK.' A spokesman for the CBI, the business lobbying organisation, said the answer was to increase capacity, rather than force airlines and passengers away. 'We're already losing business to other European destinations so we can't kick this into the long grass,' he told the paper. 'We need new connections with fast-growing markets like India, China and South America - with space for airlines to put on new flights. Stansted is thought of as the existing London airport most likely to be expanded to ease Britain's aviation capacity crisis . The Treasury said it asked HMRC to examine the impact of the charge, but insisted it was simply a 'research project to inform policy-making in general'. According to latest government projections, Gatwick will reach bursting point in 2019, while City Airport in east London will be full in 2021. The only space for expansion in London appears to be at Stansted, which will fill up in 2028, a year ahead of Luton. Chock-A-Block: Luton, popular with low-cost carriers like Ryanair, is projected to be full by 2027 . A ban - signed off in 1979 -  on expansion at Gatwick expires in 2019 and the airport's owners are considering applying for a second runway to be built after that, which would double capacity to 70million passengers a year. A commission will present its thoughts on how London can deal with its capacity issues later this year. It will explore the feasibility of the so-called Boris Island airport in the Thames Estuary, which is the preferred option of London Mayor Boris Johnson, or whether the Government should reverse its policy on expansion of London's existing airports.","Tax could be double to that at other airports .

It is not known for its swathes of white sand or constant sunshine – and it can be a little uncomfortable for bare-footed paddlers. But despite its pebbled shoreline, Brighton has been named among the world’s best cities with beaches. Also on the elite list drawn up by Lonely Planet are the arguably more glamorous Rio de Janeiro, Cape Town, Barcelona, Miami, Sydney and Dubai. Tourist attraction: Sunbathers line the seafront at Brighton, which has been named alongside exotic destinations like Rio and Miami in a list of the world's best beach cities . Ipanema: Rio's beaches boast white sands rather than pebbles, and a view of Sugarloaf Mountain rather than Brighton Pier . In an online feature, the guidebook company says: ‘The beach is made up of pebbles, not sand, but that doesn’t stop the crowds heading here in their droves. ‘Whether it’s midday sunbathing or midnight partying, Brighton beach seems to be in use at all times. ‘Brighton is the most vibrant seaside resort in England. Just an hour from London, it is a thriving, cosmopolitan city with a Bohemian spirit; home to an exuberant gay community, a dynamic student population and a healthy number of ageing and new-age hippies, as well as traditional candyfloss fun.’ Barcelona, Spain . Cape Town, South Africa . Rio de Janeiro, Brazil . Tangier, Morocco . Sydney, Australia . Valencia, Spain . Tel Aviv, Israel . Dubai, United Arab Emirates . Miami, U.S. Brighton and Hove, England . According to tourist chiefs in the East Sussex city, nearly three quarters of visitors take in the beach as part of their trip. Yesterday might not have been  the best day to do so however, with temperatures falling below zero. Visitors to Cape Town would have basked in 25C. Geoffrey Bowden, of the Brighton and Hove economic and culture committee, was delighted with the city’s new accolade. ‘For the city’s beaches to be placed alongside those of Rio, Sydney and Barcelona shows the unique positioning and branding we have achieved globally as a tourist destination,’ he said. The list was drawn up as suggested destinations for travellers unable to decide whether to have a city break or beach holiday. Barcelona is described as Spain’s most cosmopolitan city where the ‘largely artificial’ beaches attract seven million bathers every year. The final three cities included were  Tangier, Valencia and Tel Aviv. A recent guidebook to Great Britain published by Lonely Planet described the country as being full of overpriced restaurants, poor quality tourist attractions and expensive hotels. It claimed the country ‘has had its day’ and even natives can no longer afford to holiday at home. Pebbly: The stony shore at Brighton is a far cry from the white sands of Rio or Miami, but that doesn't deter sun worshippers in the summer months . Iconic: Sunbathers cool off on Bondi beach in Sydney, where temperatures today reached a record breaking 45.8 degrees Celsius . Glamorous: Miami beach, Florida, a favourite haunt of celebrities including Jennifer Lopez and Kim Kardashian . Beach activities: Kite surfing at the coast in Tel Aviv, Israel, which also made the Lonely Planet's list of brilliant beach cities .

John Samuels, 56, parked by a Tesco Metro store but was unaware he was liable to pay the £1 charge because the sign was obscured by a pillar. After returning to his vehicle to find a £50 penalty notice, he scoured the car park and eventually saw a blue sign on a wall at ground level, reading: ‘This is a pay and display car park.’ He then sent photographic evidence of the hidden sign and a cheque for the £1 charge to Wiltshire Council and appealed against his fine. John Samuels, 56, parked by a Tesco Metro store but was unaware he was liable to pay the £1 charge because the sign was obscured by a pillar . On much closer inspection the sign was tucked away behind a height barrier . But the council rejected his appeal and he had to attend a Traffic Penalty Tribunal in Bristol – to which the council sent two officials and submitted a 74-page dossier. Adjudicator Deborah Gibson cancelled the parking ticket and ruled the signage was ‘inadequate’. Mr Samuels said his battle had cost him far more than the £50 fine but he had contested it as ‘a point of principle’. Declining to specify the financial loss he suffered in terms of lost time, he pointed out the ‘sheer cost’ to the public of the council’s campaign. He said: ‘Besides a mass of paperwork for the council defence, the council sent out someone to take their own photographs. ‘All this for a missed £1 parking payment which I sent a cheque for on the same day in retrospect, which the council returned and insisted on fining me.’ Mr Samuels had parked at Emery Gate Shopping Centre in Chippenham, Wiltshire, while he attended a brief meeting. He assumed it was free because the area was signposted as ‘Tesco Metro parking’. Mr Samuels, who has now won his case, said his battle had cost him far more than the £50 fine but he had contested it as 'a point of principle' But when he returned to find a penalty ticket on his car he searched for signs stating that it was a pay and display car park. When he eventually found the small blue sign he photographed both it and a white van which was obstructing his view of a ticket machine at the far end of the car park. Mr Samuels, who lives near Glastonbury, Somerset, submitted his photos and a £1 cheque to Wiltshire Council on the same day. But they refused his appeal so the case ended up at the Traffic Penalty Tribunal. In a ruling, the adjudicator said: ‘Mr Samuels produced photographs of other car parks where there were more numerous and clearer signs. ‘I find that relying upon signs at machines at some distance when the entrance is not clearly marked as pay and display but being a Tesco car park is not sufficient. ‘I find that the signage was not adequate and the contravention did not occur.’ The council has since changed the signs, with the sign on the wall at ground level moved so it is no longer obscured by the pillar. A new sign stating that Emery Gate is a pay and display car park is underneath the Tesco Metro sign at the car park entrance. Councillor Dick Tonge, Cabinet member for highways at Wiltshire Council, said: ‘The signage at Emery Gate is continually reviewed as part of the council’s maintenance programme. ‘There is no fee for the Traffic Penalty Tribunal as they are funded by annual fees from local authorities.’ The council refused to state how much they had paid for the case but said the main cost would be officer time.","John Samuels claimed he did not know he had to pay at the Tesco Metro store because the sign was obscured .

Charged: Ronald Miller, pictured, was arrested after performing a test on his child's elementary school. He entered the school and repeatedly quizzed teachers about what they would do if he had a gun . A father has been arrested on terror charges after threatening his child's elementary school to test if they could deal with an armed intruder. Ronald Miller, 44, was described as 'aggressive and combative' during the incident at Celina Elementary School, just outside Dallas. He made his way inside the school's main office and confronted staff after dropping off his child early on Wednesday morning. According to CBSdfw, he pointed at members of staff and said 'you're dead'. He then repeatedly asked panicked teachers what they would do if he had a gun and 'a target inside the school'. 'He asked questions such as what would you do if I had a gun and I had a target inside the school? Those questions would obviously be alarming,'  Patrol Sergeant Shea Scott of the Celina Police Department told myfoxdfw.com. 'He was putting them on the spot and demanding quick responses.' Miller was not armed and left the scene peacefully. He handed teachers a note telling the school district to call him if they were in need of security training. The former volunteer firefighter was later arrested at his home and charged with making a terrorist threat. If found guilty he could face prison with a sentence anywhere between two and ten years. Somewhat ironically other parents criticized the school's security measures in the wake of the incident and the local police chief admitted changes would be made to security procedures as a result. 'He exposed to us some weaknesses that we have,” Celina ISD Superintendent Donny O’Dell told CBSdfw. Parents said they should have been informed of Miller's threats and given the option to remove their children from school that day. 'I feel that they should have potentially locked down the school. It would have been my choice if I picked up my child,' mother Abby Hall told Fox. Scroll down for video . Panicked: Teachers at Celina Elementary School were left unnerved by Ronald Miller, who threatened the school on Wednesday. The father of a second grader quizzed them on what they would do if he had a gun . Another parent emailed the channel: 'My son attends kindergarten at Celina Elementary School. We were NOT notified of this whatsoever! I . found out today via FACEBOOK!' Miller, father of a second grader at the school, is a paramedic and has no formal security training, he is being held in lieu of a $75,000 bond. His family is well-known in the community after holding fundraisers for his teenage daughter, Ashley, who developed a rare form of cancer in 2010. She died in July 2011. The school district put out a statement defending the school's response to the incident. Angry: Abby Hall, pictured, was one of the parents angry at Celina Elementary School after Ronald Miller pretended to be a gunman. She said the school should have been locked down . 'At no time did we feel our students were in harm's way. However, as a precaution a police officer was positioned at each of the campuses for the rest of the day,' it said. It is not the first time a parent has decided to act on school security in the wake of last month's Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre.

Lost photographs that a 15-year-old boy took of a natural and relaxed Marilyn Monroe on an afternoon in New York are being exhibited for the first time. Peter Mangone donned a suit and tie and used to cut class from Bronx's James Monroe High School in 1955 to go and look for his idol outside her home at the Gladstone Hotel. Armed with just an eight millimeter movie camera, luckily for him, in Monroe's charismatic laid-back way, she invited him to film her one afternoon as she made her way around Fifth Avenue. Caught on film: Marilyn Monroe was filmed by Peter Mangone in 1955 as she walked down Fifth Avenue. He thought he had lost the footage for almost fifty years . 'The whole day she played with me,' he said in an interview with the Today show in 2006. 'People that have . filmed her said no one captured her like the [15-year-old] kid, because . she wasn’t threatened, she wasn’t afraid. It wasn’t going to be in the . paper so I got the real girl. 'She noticed and cared - she was absolutely magical' However, the footage wasn't found until some 47 years later after Mangone was convinced he had thrown it away. The filmmaker died last month just weeks before his work would be exhibited. It was found in 2002 by Mangone's brother, Louis, who was clearing out their family home. The 'real girl': 15-year-old Mangone waited outside Monroe's hotel before she invited him to film her for the afternoon. His intimate photographs are being exhibited in New York . Playful: Monroe entertained her young fan Peter Mangone as he filmed her for the afternoon on New York's Fifth Avenue . 'I was always aware of his fascination with Marilyn Monroe and the . film,' his partner of 33 years Dan Pye told southfloridagaynews.com. 'Every time we visited New . York City and walked past the hotel he’d say 'if I only hadn’t . thrown that film away.’' Three years later and slightly embarrassed by his movie star crush, Mangone had intended to bin the film alongside his old movie magazines. But somehow the five and a half minutes of footage survived. He went on to have a celebrity lifestyle of his own as a roller derby star and well-known hairdresser and was delighted on receiving the call that told him his film was intact. Special bond: Peter Mangone, left, then 15, was invited to film Marilyn Monroe for the afternoon.  The 8mm footage was taken of Monroe and the designer who later was fitted for the dress she sang Happy Birthday to JFK at Madison Square Garden in, right . New Yorker: The owner of the Danziger Gallery exhibiting the photographs said Monroe felt at home in Manhattan, where the shots were taken . 'To me it was gone. Never to be seen again so it was like wow!,' he told the show. 'Within this ordinary context Monroe has . never looked more extraordinary, natural, or beautiful. It takes an . unusual generosity of spirit to enable an encounter like this and that . warmth glows throughout the film,' a . statement from the Danziger gallery says. She and Mangone were joined on the . walk by the fashion designer George Nardiello, who would later sew her . into a sequined dress she sang Happy Birthday to JFK in, and her friend and business partner Milton . Greene. The star was recently divorced from Jo DiMaggio and had just moved to the city. Unnoticed: The star was not troubled on the streets of New York as she walked around in 1955. Natural beauty: Monroe wasn't made-up for her afternoon captured by 15-year-old photographer Peter Mangone. James Danziger, the Gallery Owner said: 'Marilyn loved Manhattan, when she died, . she was actually a New York City resident and she seems very comfortable . in Manhattan. And I think that the way that she is dressed in these . pictures, in a very chic kind of black suit with a fur collar makes her . look much more like a New Yorker than we normally think of Marilyn as . being.' The . gallery's promotional material adds: 'So much of our fascination with Monroe is tied up with her face it . comes as something of a surprise to see her hourglass figure and how . chic and New Yorker-y she looks in her fur trimmed black cashmere suit. 'But it is the way that she drifts in and out of interaction with her 15 . year old film-maker fan that is most intriguing.  She blows him a kiss . with a smile that could light up the Empire State Building. She looks up . at the skyscrapers with a look that is both naïve and perturbed.' 'The exhibition will continue as planned – a fitting tribute to Pete'.

But instead, it is empty, and her plate, which should be covered with turkey and all the trimmings, simply bears a photograph of her beaming smile. This image is a heart-breaking reminder of how, while millions of families settled down to Christmas dinner, there were 26 tables in Connecticut missing loved ones. Missed: Hannah D'Avino uploaded this picture of her sister's empty place at Christmas dinner. Rachel D'Avino, 29, was one of the six teachers gunned down with 20 students in Newtown on December 14 . It was uploaded to Reddit by her younger sister Hannah nearly two weeks after Rachel, a newly-appointed special needs teacher at Sandy Hook Elementary School, was gunned down with 20 children and five other female staff members. 'My sister was a victim at Sandyhook elementary school,' the photograph's caption reads. 'This is her seat at the table for Christmas dinner.' Just two days before her death, Rachel's long-term boyfriend, Anthony Cerritelli, had asked her parents for her hand in marriage, and planned to propose on Christmas Eve. Instead, in a twist none of the family could have predicted, she lost her life on December 14 - and the ring that symbolised so much promise was instead placed inside her coffin as she was buried. 'She would have said yes,' Hannah explained on Reddit. 'My grandmother gave her the ring. My . sister told her boyfriend where she put it. He had it cleaned up, and . replaced the diamonds.' Loved: Rachel, left, is pictured with her Hannah, who said the photo was her way of remembering her sister . She added that she wanted to share the Christmas dinner photograph with the online community as Rachel, 29, had been a Reddit user and she 'would have appreciated this'. 'This is my way of sharing memories of my sister,' she wrote. After the killings, it emerged that . Rachel, who only began working at the school for two weeks before the shooting, tried to draw . the shooter away from children at the school, but was killed in the . process. She worked in special education and had been a therapist for autistic children.

Saying goodbye: She was buried with the ring after her funeral in Bethlehem, Connecticut last week . Rachel D'Avino had a special talent for reaching children with autism, Sarah said. In one example of her sister's skill, she explained how one girl didn't talk or make eye contact when Rachel started working with her. 'This girl came to Rachel's wake and actually looked my sister, me and my mom in the eye, said how much Rachel meant to her and that she was sorry,' she said. 'Rachel made her way into the girl's world and helped bring her out."" Rachel's friend Lissa Lovetere said teaching special needs children had been her calling. 'She had that gift, that maternal instinct. She cared for people,' Ms Lovetere told MailOnline. 'Working with special needs children was her forte.'

Ahead of Thursday's service, Mrs Murphy's brother-in-law Thomas Newman read a brief statement sending love and support to the families of the other victims of the massacre. They 'pray, for all the families touched so terribly, that God may . help these feelings of such great pain and grief pass quickly; that . they be replaced with only happy thoughts and joyous memories of those . we have lost,' he said. Speaking to Fox News, friend Janelle Wingert said Mrs Murphy had asked her after 9/11 what she would do if someone attacked her at the school where she worked.

But it was a really good year. I'm convinced that I'll see her again.'

Three students were laid to rest on Thursday, while six others were memorialised. At the funeral for Benjamin Wheeler in Newtown, Connecticut, Boy Scouts lined the entrance to the church - paying tribute to the six-year-old, who was a Tiger Scout. In nearby Southbury, mourners tied green balloons to trees around town in honor of six-year-old Allison Wyatt, who is being buried today as well.

Prosecutors in the trial of an Arizona woman accused of slashing and shooting her ex-boyfriend to death in his shower have shown the jury a graphic picture of his face and body after the attack. A bloody image of Travis Alexander, a 30-year-old Mormon motivational speaker and insurance salesman, was one of the many found on his water-logged camera in his washing machine after his decomposing body was discovered. His ex-girlfriend, Jodi Arias, is on trial for stabbing Alexander 27 times, slitting his throat and shooting him in the head at his Mesa, Arizona home in June 2008, months after they broke up. Despite initially telling police she had . not seen him for months, the camera revealed their sexual encounter on . the day of his murder, as well as naked images of Alexander in the . shower moments before he died. Accused: Jodi Arias, who is accused of stabbing her ex-boyfriend to death, listens during her trial on Thursday . The device even revealed photographs of his bloody body and another showing Arias dragging it across the ground - apparently taken accidentally when the camera was dropped. The images are just the latest pieces of bizarre evidence in the trial that is already being compared to the dramatic 2010 murder trial of Casey Anthony. Arias, a photographer who dated . Alexander for nearly five months in 2007, has pleaded not-guilty to first degree murder. If convicted, . she could become the fourth woman on Arizona's death row. She originally claimed she had not . seen Alexander the day of his murder, before claiming she had seen two . men kill him, before eventually saying that she killed him out of self defense. Last moments alive: The jury was shown pictures of Travis Alexander's dead body. Other images on a camera found in his home show him posing naked in the shower (pictured) before his death . Troubled couple: A Mesa police detective said Arias told him that she and Alexander were so distressful of one another that they had exchanged online passwords . At the trial, . defense attorneys have painted a picture of Alexander as an abusive, . manipulative boyfriend who made Arias wear a t-shirt reading: 'Travis . Alexander's'. Defense attorney Kirk Nurmi asked lead detective Esteban Flores whether Alexander . referred to his ex-girlfriend in emails as a s*** and a w****, . to which he detective answered in the affirmative. Flores also testified that the . communique included the devout Mormon writing to Arias: 'I think I . was little more than a dildo with a heartbeat to you.' On Thursday, jurors heard testimony from Flores and a recording of a conversation he had with Arias in June 2008. On . the call, Arias denied being involved in the death and calmly told the . detective that she had not seen Alexander in two months. Motive: The prosecution claim Arias flew into a jealous rage after learning he wanted to date another woman . Happier times: She met Travis Alexander, a Mormon and motivational speaker, at a Las Vegas conference . According to Flores, the defendant told . him during questioning that she and Alexander were so distrustful of . each other that they shared their Facebook, MySpace and Gmail passwords . in a failed bid to patch up their unraveling relationship, ABC News reported. Visualization: Prosecutor Juan Martinez points to his neck showing the jury where Travis Alexander had his neck slit by a knife . Jennifer Willmott, an attorney for . Arias, told jurors her client acted in self-defense after Alexander . 'lunged at Jodi in anger' in his suburban Mesa home after she dropped . his new camera. 'Jodi's . life was in danger. He knocked her to the ground in the bathroom where . there was a struggle,' Willmott said. 'If she did not have to defend . herself, she would not be here.' Yet prosecutors argue Arias was a jealous woman who brutally attacked Alexander after he tried to end their relationship. 'This . is not a case of whodunit,' Deputy Maricopa County Attorney Juan . Martinez said in his opening statement. 'The person who committed this . killing sits in court today - Jodi Ann Arias.' Alexander had told friends Arias had . become too possessive and was acting like a stalker, so he ended their . relationship to see other women. But phone and email records indicate . the pair continued to carry on a sexual relationship, The Arizona . Republic reported. Flores downplayed the stalker . description, saying Alexander was inviting Arias to his home and the . phone calls between them 'were back and forth.' According . to court records filed by Arias' attorneys, Alexander persuaded her to . come to his home on June 4, 2008. They claim the couple had sex, then . took provocative photographs of each other. The couple had met at a work . conference in Las Vegas in September 2006 and began speaking on the . phone every day. Court records show they exchanged as many as 82,000 . emails. Story: Arias offered investigators three different versions of events ranging from her denial of being at the scene of the crime to claims of self-defense . Offensive terms: Prosecutors presented emails in court in which Travis Alexander called Arias a 'slut' and a 'whore' They started dating . in . February 2007 and, because Alexander was a Mormon, Arias chose to be . baptized into the church. But they broke up in June 2007, with Arias . telling police jealousy on both sides was to blame. In December 2007, Alexander . began dating another girl and allegedly told friends that Arias became so jealous that she . slashed the tyres on his car twice. In June 2008, Alexander told friends he thought Arias might have hacked . into his Facebook account and told her to stay away. 'There's nothing about her that I see in . marriage material - or wife material,' Alexander had said, according to . his friend, Dave Hall. 'But it's hard to say no to a woman that sneaks . into your house, crawls in your bed and tries to, you know, seduce you.' The claims come as RadarOnline revealed a tragic post on Alexander's blog about his fear of dating an 'axe murderer' and his desire to get married. Accused: Jodi Arias, 32, faces the death penalty after allegedly murdering her ex-boyfriend, right . 'Obsessed': The couple only dated for five months before breaking up over jealous issues, she said . He wrote that he hated 'desperately . trying to find out if my date has an axe murderer penned up inside of . her and knowing she is wondering the same thing about me'. In jail: Arias claimed she had nothing to do with the murder but later said it was out of self defense . At first Arias denied being at his . house the day he was killed, yet police found a camera in . Alexander's washing machine containing graphic pictures of the pair having sex. The water-logged camera, which belonged to . Alexander, had been damaged in the washing machine, but the Mesa police crime lab was able to recover images, some of which had been deleted. Among those deleted were pictures showing Alexander posing naked in the shower at 5.22pm, with the last picture . showing him alive at 5.30pm. Later photos showed him bleeding . while on the floor. The camera also contained pictures of Arias posing naked on . Alexander's bed at 1.40pm. On June 9, his friends went to his upscale home after he had failed to return their calls. They found him dead in his shower and his body was 'well into the decomposition process'. Wounds show that Alexander attempted . to fight back, court records show. An autopsy found he sustained 27 puncture . wounds and one gunshot wound, with the bullet found in his left cheek. Investigators also found a bloody left palm print with Arias' DNA on the bathroom wall. Her DNA was also found . in hair recovered from a bloody wall, according to the Arizona Republic. After . initially claiming that she had not been at his home that day, Arias . changed her story to admit she had been there - but had not killed her . ex-boyfriend. Troubled: Alexander's friends said she stalked him in the months before his death and slashed his tires . Missed: Alexander, a motivational speaker from Arizona, was found several days after the killing . 'I witnessed Travis being attacked by . two other individuals,' she told Inside Edition. 'Who were they? I . don't know. I couldn't pick them up in a police lineup.' She later changed her story once . again, telling the court that she killed Alexander in self defense after . he became angry when she dropped his camera. She claims he had been sexually and physically abusive throughout their relationship. 'It makes me sick because I know her . true side,' Steven Alexander, Travis Alexander's brother, told ABC. 'And I ask people to please not buy into . this sweet innocent personality that she puts on.' As well as the inconsistencies in her story, Arias' case has been plagued with difficulties with her legal representation. Scene: A grab shows Alexander's home in Mesa surrounded by police tape after his body was found . Deceit: Police found a camera in Alexander's washing machine, pictured, that contained pictures of him having sex with Arias on the day of the killing. There were also pictures of his dead body . She asked to represent herself but . when she submitted letters to the court that she claimed Alexander had . written - saying he was a pedophile - they were found to be forgeries, and she told a judge she was in 'over her head'. Her defense team was reinstated but in December 2011, her attorney, Victoria Washington, was granted a motion to withdraw from the case. Jennifer Willmott, a death penalty-qualified defense attorney, had now been assigned to represent Arias. In January 2012, a judge denied a motion asking for the death penalty to be rejected.","Jodi Arias 'was obsessed with Travis Alexander, 30, and stalked him after he broke up with her and started dating someone else'

It may only just be summer, but one experimental chef is already getting busy in the kitchen preparing to offer us a range of Christmas treats we'll remember until spring 2013. Heston Blumenthal, the Michelin star-winning chef famed for the snail porridge served in his unconventional Bray restaurant The Fat Duck, has announced the festive collection he will be cooking for and selling through supermarket chain Waitrose. And this year his menu - which arrives 167 days before the big day - is as bananas as ever. In fact, one dish even contains bananas.... Ho ho ho: Chef Heston Blumenthal has already unveiled his crackers Christmas menu for Waitrose . Sweet treats: Heston's Christmas pudding will actually taste of chocolate brownie . Among the items Blumenthal has devised are a traditional fruit cake . that looks like a Christmas pudding but is decorated in white chocolate and tastes like a chocolate brownie - after all, why have one dessert when you can have three? There will also be a cranberry sauce made . with vodka, a bread sauce with truffle oil and a gammon baked in mulled cider. One of the festive favourites promises to be a baked Alaska with a raspberry parfait, encased in chocolate, surrounded by a caremalised banana parfait instead of ice cream. But none of these offerings should come as much of a surprise to anyone who knows the sort of cooking Blumenthal is famous for. Last year the chef brought us pine-sugar mince pies that smelled like Christmas trees, the year before was all about the Hidden Orange Christmas Pudding, so popular it sold out two years running and was eventually being sold on eBay for £250. Anyone who missed out on the pudding last year shouldn't worry too much, as they will be able to try again this time around when it goes on sale for the third year in a row. Speaking about his baked Alaska, Blumenthal said: 'Baked Alaska is a childhood favourite of mine. I love the juxtaposition of the soft meringue against the smooth creamy interior, but I hated the idea that it all melted so quickly. 'So I was inspired to create my take on the old school classic by creating a raspberry mousse centre which gave the creaminess without melting and adding one of my favourite flavours – bananas!' Gobble gobble: Heston's Hidden Orange Christmas pudding, left, which has sold out two years running, and, right, the trifle featured in his recipe book Further Adventures In Search Of Perfection . Waitrose spokesman Andrea Watson said: 'In recent years Heston has really captured our shopper’s imagination at Christmas. 'I’m sure that just like our Hidden . Orange Christmas puddings his version of the Baked Alaska will be . extremely popular with Waitrose shoppers this Christmas.' The Heston From Waitrose range will be available from October 2012.

"By . Emily Allen . UPDATED: . 06:54 EST, 30 July 2011 . The military commander of Libya’s rebels has been killed in mysterious circumstances, fuelling fears of a rift among opposition forces. Initially, rebel leaders claimed that General Abdel Fattah Younes had been executed by agents of Colonel Gaddafi. But yesterday belief was growing that  he had been killed by a gunman from his own side. Assassinated: Head of the rebel forces Abdel Fattah Younis was killed yesterday . The 69-year-old was for years a key ally of Gaddafi before defecting in February. His death is a severe setback to the rebels as they were beginning to make progress on the battlefield. Rebel leader Mustafa Abdul-Jalil said Younes and two aides had been shot hours after being recalled from the front lines. He said the ringleader of the killers had been captured but gave no other details.  It was unclear even whether the bodies had been recovered, with one report saying they had been set ablaze. A British official in Libya said: ‘It’s win, win for Gaddafi. If the killers were Gaddafi’s men it shows no one is safe, if they were from within the rebels it shows how fragmented they still are despite everything invested in them by London, Paris and Washington.’ Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi. Younis used to work has his head of security . The killing was greeted with  jubilation by Gaddafi’s supporters in the Libyan capital Tripoli, which was last night hit again by Nato airstrikes.Younes – a former interior minister who had served at the heart of Gaddafi’s regime since the 1969 coup that took him to power – had become one of the most recognisable faces of the rebel Transitional National Council. The group was recognised by Britain and its allies this week as Libya’s ‘sole governmental authority’. Younes had been recalled from battle to appear before judges in the rebel capital Benghazi, although the exact nature of the questions he was facing are unclear. They were said to have involved differences of opinion over the progress and nature of military operations. Some unconfirmed reports suggested the general and his aides had been arrested near Libya’s eastern front on Thursday. Rumours in the rebel stronghold said he had been held on suspicion that his family still had ties to the Gaddafi regime. Other reports claimed he was involved in unauthorised contact with the administration and had even helped to supply Gaddafi troops with weapons. Younes was not trusted by some rebel fighters because of his long association with Gaddafi. In the besieged city of Misrata, troops have refused to accept orders from him. Smoke rising into the air following a NATO air strike in Tripoli, Libya in June . Libyan rebel fighters shoot in the air and shout religious slogans as they attend the funeral of seven fallen comrades earlier this month . Significantly, Younes is reported to have nearly come to blows with his rival for the army command, Klalifa Hefter, during a meeting in March which led to them both claiming they were in charge. Geoff Porter, from North Africa Risk Consulting, said: ‘A lot of the members of the TNC were Gaddafi loyalists for a very long time. ‘The killing is indicative of schisms that have been appearing within the TNC over the last few months... We might be seeing the most egregious examples of the divisions between the former regime members and the original rebels.’ The rebels claimed to have seized several towns in the western mountains on Thursday but have yet to make a serious breakthrough.",Rebel security arrest head of group behind killing of Gaddafi defector and his two aides .

A woman who crashed her SUV and ended up at the bottom of an embankment for two days was saved by a inquisitive passerby on Wednesday. Billie Earl, 68, of Herrin, Illinois, disappeared on Monday afternoon after driving her car off the road. She then spent 48 hours with no food and water in sub-zero temperatures. Earl was rescued when local resident Alan Geary noticed skidmarks on the road and went to investigate. Geary found Earl at the bottom of the steep bank, perilously close to a former strip mine, flooded with around 50 feet of water. Billie Earl survived in sub-zero conditions for two days with no food or water after running her SUV off the road and down an embankment. Her life was saved by an inquisitive passerby . Billie Earl's SUV ended up only feet away from a former strip pit full of deep water . Earl went missing around 1 pm on Monday afternoon when her SUV left the road, careered through bushes and came to a stop at the bottom of the ravine. She crawled out of her car but, due to knee and hip injuries, was unable to make it any closer to safety. Earl remained there, trapped around 90 feet from the busy Crenshaw Road, for the next two days. While the wintry conditions put Earl's life in severe danger, they also saved her - she ate ice to stay hydrated. Good samaritan: Alan Geary noticed skidmarks on the road and went to investigate. He discovered Billie Earl, who had been trapped for 48 hours . Earl was discovered on Wednesday, when passerby Geary became curious about signs of an accident. After getting out of his truck to take a look he spotted Earl's vehicle. The SUV was crashed perilously close next to the old strip pit. As Geary explained to Wsiltv.com, this was the first of Earl's incredible escapes. 'That pit probably has 50-60 feet of water and it's straight down, ain't no doubt the car would have sunk,' said Geary. The man thought the car had been stolen and abandoned, so he alerted authorities. But then he heard Earl's faint cries for help. It was impossible for Geary to reach the woman so he called for help. 'I seen her, and told sheriff's department I needed an ambulance and people out here quick,' he told Wspdlocal. Authorities were then able to rush the miraculous survivor to hospital, where she remains in a stable condition. Earl may need surgery on her knee, and it will take plenty time to recover from her ordeal. But her life was saved by good fortune and Geary's curiosity. 'Just amazed me after two nights out there she made it,' Geary said. Yet he also believed Earl's escape was an act of God. 'The good lord upstairs, he ain't willing to take you till it's your time. Evidently it wasn't her time,' he told Wpsd. The woman would not have survived if the vehicle had fallen into the pit. 'That pit probably has 50-60 feet of water and it's straight down, ain't no doubt the car would have sunk,' her rescuer said .","Billie Earl, 68, of Herrin, Illinois, crashed her SUV on Monday afternoon, then spent two days trapped outside her car in wintry weather .

Death: Savita Halappanavar died in hospital on October 28 last year from suspected septicaemia . A coroner has promised the husband of an Indian dentist who died after she suffered a miscarriage in Ireland that her inquest will be transparent and open to public scrutiny. Savita Halappanavar died in hospital on October 28 last year from suspected septicaemia. The 31-year-old's husband, Praveen, claims that doctors at Galway University Hospital refused to carry out an abortion 17 weeks into her pregnancy because a foetal heartbeat was present. He says they were told Ireland 'is a Catholic country'. The inquest into Mrs Halappanavar's death was opened before the Coroner for Galway city, Dr Ciaran MacLoughlin, this morning. He urged all sides involved in the hearing to respect the functions of the court after medical records stating that Mrs Halappanavar had requested an abortion were leaked last night. The family's legal team had previously said that medical notes they had seen did not record the request for a termination. Dr MacLoughlin offered his condolences to Mr Halappanavar and said he would carry out the inquiry with dignity and respect 'his beloved Savita'. 'It is my duty as coroner to ensure that the inquiry shall be independent, effective and prompt - that the procedures are open, transparent and accountable and are subject to public scrutiny,' Dr MacLoughlin said. Promises: Praveen Halappanavar, the husband of Savita Halappanavar outside Galway Coroners court today . The hearing, which is expected to last more than a week, will begin on April 8 at Galway Courthouse. Speaking about his wife's final moments, last month, . Mr Halappanavar said: ‘In the night, at around one o'clock, the nurse . came running, as I was standing outside ICU. ‘She just told me to be brave, and she took me near Savita, and she said: “Will you be ok to be there, living her last minutes? ‘I said: “Yes, I want to”.

Grieving husband: Pictured on their wedding day, Mrs Halappanavar's husband Praveen Halappanavar begged doctors at Galway University Hospital to terminate the pregnancy after she began miscarrying and now refuses to assist investigators . Mr Halappanavar, who works as an . engineer at Boston Scientific in Galway, came to Ireland from India with . his wife four years ago to start a new life together. She had a job in . Westport, Co Mayo and the pair lived in Galway city. They were so excited about the expected . birth of their first child, which was due on March 20, that they had an . early baby shower in recent weeks when Mrs Halappanavar’s parents were . visiting. But their world began to fall apart, . when Mrs Halappanavar’s back pain worsened and she was forced to seek . medical help at University Hospital Galway on the morning of Sunday . October 21. After routine tests the young mother-to-be was told everything was fine and the couple were sent home. But within an hour of returning, Mrs Halappanavar was positive something was wrong after using the bathroom.

Following a more in-depth examination, . she was told around noon that there had been a cervical dilation and the . medics would not be able to save the baby. The pair were told it would all be over . in four to five hours, and then the dentist could go home. But she . remained in agony and two days later her health began to sharply . deteriorate. Happy couple: Savita and her husband Praveen dancing at 2010 Diwali festival in Galway, video from YouTube . ‘On Tuesday night, things really started . getting worse... All of a sudden Savita started feeling cold, she . started shivering terribly,’ said Mr Halappanavar. She was taken into the hospital's high dependency unit before being transferred to intensive care. By Friday morning, Mr Halappanavar was . asked by a midwife if he had told wife’s family, who were travelling . back to India, about the severity of her condition. She had not wanted . to worry them until they returned home. ‘I just told them she is still in the . hospital and that she is fine, she is doing well. I only told them about . the miscarriage,’ said Mr Halappanavar, speaking to RTE from Belgaum, in . Karnataka, in south west India. ‘But (the midwife) said you have to tell . them that she is critically ill. She said it is better that her parents . and all her family know about it.’ In the early hours of Sunday, October 28, Mrs Halappanavar died. Mr Halappanavar said he believed his wife, a Hindu, would have survived if she had been given an abortion.

'When the consultant came on the ward . rounds, Savita asked if they could not save the baby, could they induce . to end the pregnancy. ‘The consultant said, “As long as there is a foetal heartbeat we can’t do anything”.’ He said he had gone from being ‘on top of the world’ to having his world torn apart in just days.","Savita Halappanavar died of blood poisoning after an abortion was refused .

The first part of Lance Armstrong's doping confession to Oprah Winfrey drew about 4.3 million viewers to Winfrey's struggling television network on Thursday night, according to Nielsen ratings. The number - roughly the same as Good Morning America's daily audience - is good news for OWN, Winfrey's network, but it hardly compares to big interviews from her days of yore, such as the 1993 Michael Jackson that attracted 62 million viewers to ABC. During her peak in the early 90s, 'The Oprah Winfrey Show' drew an average 13 million viewers, according to the New York Times. Scroll down for video . Lance Armstrong has responded to claims that he was not totally frank in his exchange with Oprah Winfrey during which he admitted taking performance enhancing drugs . Winfrey was counting on her popularity to follow her to her new network in January 2011, but she has had . trouble getting the channel off the ground. She was hoping that her interview with Armstrong would serve as a turning point in the network's trajectory, but it failed to impress. About 3.17 million people tuned in for the first airing of the interview at 9 p.m. on Thursday, and another 1.12 million tuned in for the repeat airing at 10:30 p.m. The channel says another couple hundred thousand people watched the interview via live stream online, as well. Previously, Winfrey's interview with Bobby Kristina, the daughter of Whitney Houston, held the two-year-old network's record for drawing the highest number of viewers. That interview, aired in March of 2012, drew 3.5 million viewers to the channel. With the Armstrong interview spread over two . nights and not one - as originally planned - OWN has been selling . advertising space at premium prices and expected to set record viewing figures. In the interview, Armstrong, who she interviewed on Monday, admitted to using banned performance-enhancing drugs during his professional cycling career that included seven Tour de France titles. The cyclist had vehemently denied doping for more than a decade. OWN planned to air one episode with Armstrong but expanded the program to two nights after the cyclist talked with Winfrey for more than two hours. The interview is generating a wave of publicity for OWN. Confession: Lance Armstrong admitted to doping in an interview with Oprah Winfrey this week . In 2012, OWN's primetime ratings rose 32 percent over the previous year among its target audience of women aged 25 to 54, according to data from the network. OWN averaged 147,000 viewers aged 25 to 54 during primetime in 2012, according to Nielsen data provided by Horizon Media. A chunk of ad time for the Armstrong interview was pre-sold to regular advertisers of 'Oprah's Next Chapter,' a weekly show where she sits down with big-name stars and newsmakers such as reality TV's Kardashian family and rapper Usher. The remaining commercial time is being sold in the final days leading up to the telecasts in the 'scatter' market, which commands higher prices than the pre-sold rates. Thanks to growing interest in Armstrong's comments, OWN is securing a premium over the usual scatter rates for 'Oprah's Next Chapter,' Logan said. 'I left it all on the table with her and when it airs the people can decide,' he said in a text message to The Associated Press . 'We are seeing the premiums' on ad rates, he said, but declined to provide specific figures. The network is giving priority to advertisers who have bought time on the show in the past and those that will also commit to other shows, he said. Ongoing OWN sponsors include General Motors Co, Target Corp, and Kellogg Co . OWN scored some of its biggest audiences with Winfrey's celebrity interviews. Her March 2012 talk with Whitney Houston's daughter shortly after the singer's sudden death drew 3.5 million viewers. Singer Rihanna's appearance in August 2011 grabbed 2.5 million viewers.

"PUBLISHED: . 08:40 EST, 10 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 02:59 EST, 11 October 2012 . It may have been an unlikely dream, but scientists have finally put paid to hopes of resurrecting dinosaurs from DNA. A study of fossils found in New Zealand found that DNA has a half life of 521 years - meaning half the bonds between cells are broken after this time. 'This confirms the widely held suspicion that claims of DNA from . dinosaurs and ancient insects trapped in amber are incorrect,' Simon Ho, a computational evolutionary biologist at the University of . Sydney in Australia told Nature.com. Scroll down for video . The research means that it would be impossible for the plot of Jurassic Park, which saw dinosaurs brought back to life using DNA recovered from amber, to come true. Palaeogeneticists led by Morten Allentoft at the University of . Copenhagen and Michael Bunce at Murdoch University in Perth, Australia, . examined 158 DNA-containing leg bones belonging to three species of . extinct giant birds called moa. The bones, which were between 600 and 8,000 years old, had been . recovered from three sites within 5 kilometres of each other, with . nearly identical preservation conditions including a temperature of 13.1 . ºC. By comparing the specimens' ages and degrees of DNA degradation, the . researchers calculated that DNA has a half-life of 521 years - ruling out the dreams of bringing dinosaurs back to life. The findings are published today in Proceedings of the Royal Society B1. The team predicts that even in a bone at an ideal preservation temperature of −5 ºC, effectively every bond would be destroyed after a maximum of 6.8 million years. The DNA would cease to be readable much earlier — perhaps after roughly 1.5 million years, when the remaining strands would be too short to give meaningful information. However, some researchers have raised the question of whether fossils trapped in permafrost. 'I am very interested to see if these findings can be reproduced in very different environments such as permafrost and caves,' Michael Knapp, a palaeogeneticist at the University of Otago in Dunedin, New Zealand, told Nature. Researchers also admit several other factors could help preserve DNA. Alan Cooper, director of the Australian Centre for Ancient DNA at the University of Adelaide, South Australia, said: 'The rotting process after death is very seasonal and context dependent, and has a major impact on DNA survival.' Last week the Moscow News reports a male mammoth which died about 30,000 years ago at the age of 15 had been found frozen in permafrost - and hope to find DNA. The boy who made the astonishing discovery has been named as Yevgeny Salinder, ABC News reported. He found the frozen beast in Taymyr, north Russia, where he lives with his family, close to the Sopkarga polar station. Woolly mammoths have been found in the permafrost in Siberia since at least 1929, but this is one of the best preserved, researchers believe. Its tusks, mouth and rib cage are clearly visible. Rare: It is believed the remains - which include a tusk - are the right half of the body, weighing in at 500kg . Remains: It is believed to be a male which died about 30,000 years ago at the age of 15 . After telling his parents about his incredible find, scientists were able to confirm the discovery. It is believed to be the second best preserved mammoth ever unearthed and the best mammoth discovery since 1901. It has now been named Zhenya after the boy's nickname and will be studied by scientists. Alexei . Tikhonov, a mammoth specialist with the Russian Academy of Sciences, . told journalists that the last time such a well-preserved mammoth was . found in Russia was in 1901, also in the Krasnoyarsk region, but much . farther south, according to the statement. The . carcass will become an exhibit at the Taimir Regional Studies Museum, . but museum staff have agreed to allow scientists from zoological and . paleontological institutes in Moscow and St. Petersburg study it first.","Discovery rules out possibility of recovering viable DNA from dinosaurs .

"By . James Chapman, Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 12:51 EST, 20 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 03:28 EST, 21 January 2013 . Former defence secretary Liam Fox has seen the Prime Minister's speech . Voters want a return to the Common Market, one of the Conservative Party's leading Eurosceptics told David Cameron yesterday today ahead of the Prime Minister's long-awaited speech on Britain's future in the EU. Former defence secretary Liam Fox said Britain should be aiming to return to a 'basic economic relationship' with Brussels, which people backed in a referendum in 1975. Dr Fox said he had seen the Prime Minister's speech -- expected to be delivered on Wednesday after being postponed because of the Algeria hostage crisis -- and believed it would be an historic moment. 'If that is the speech that is finally delivered, a great many of us will think that it's a speech that we've been waiting a long time for any Prime Minister to deliver,' he said. Mr Cameron will promise, if re-elected with a majority, to renegotiate a looser, more trade-based relationship with the EU and then hold an 'in/out' referendum, expected to take place in 2017 or 2018. The Prime Minister is also expected to say that Britain now rejects the aim of 'ever closer union' that was at the heart of the EU's founding principles. However, Mr Cameron will stress that he wants Britain to remain as a strong voice at the heart of a reformed EU - and will campaign for a 'yes' vote in the referendum, as long as significant powers are returned. Diplomats believe there will be an opportunity to demand repatriation in key areas in exchange for allowing the Eurozone countries to forge a closer economic and political union in response to the debt crisis on the Continent. Labour and the Liberal Democrats have . so far rejected the idea of a referendum -- insisting that to announce . one now risks damaging investment by creating uncertainty about . Britain's future in the EU. That stance won surprise backing . yesterday from Michael Portillo, who served as Conservative defence . secretary under John Major and was a notorious Eurosceptic during his . time in power. 'To commit himself to an in/out . referendum in the mid term of his next government seems to me to be . extraordinarily dangerous,' Mr Portillo told Sky's Murnaghan programme. 'People like to kick their government in the teeth.' Prime Minister David Cameron is expected to promise a negotiation on looser ties with Europe if he is re-elected . Foreign Secretary William Hague insisted there was a 'strong case' for a referendum, saying 'fresh consent' was necessary for Britain's membership of the EU. 'We want to succeed in the European Union - we want an outward-looking EU to succeed in the world, and for the United Kingdom to succeed in that,' he told the BBC's Andrew Marr programme. 'But we have to recognise that the European Union has changed a lot since the referendum of 1975 and that there have been not only great achievements to the EU's name but some things that have gone badly wrong, such as the euro.' Dr Fox said he was 'broadly satisfied' with the Prime Minister's proposals. UKIP leader Nigel Farage has ruled out any political links with the Conservative Party . 'I think ultimately there has to be an in/out referendum, because otherwise we're going to have our politics in Britain constantly undermined by this debate. And I think it's very important that we settle one way or another the European argument for a generation,' he told the BBC's Sunday Politics. 'I would like to see us with a basic economic relationship, and I think, yes, I think that people in Britain voted in the 1975 referendum for a Common Market, and that's what we expected to be delivered. 'I think certainly for myself, my preference would be to have a renegotiated relationship. [But] if we were put into a position where the British people didn't like any renegotiated solution and decided to be outside, a lot of countries do exist outside the European Union. It would have undoubtedly some difficulties for us, but I don't think they could not be overcome.' Andrea Leadsom, founder of the Fresh Start group of around 120 Tory MPs who have drawn up a shopping list of powers to be returned, said the party was 'hugely united'. She said most MPs favoured a renegotiated relationship and that the number who wanted to leave the EU come what may could be 'counted on the fingers of two hands'. UKIP leader Nigel Farage said there was no prospect of his party, which saw its support slump in polls yesterday following news of Mr Cameron's plans, doing a deal with the Conservatives despite the proposed EU referendum. 'I think with David Cameron as leader that is virtually impossible to even contemplate,' he said. 'Mr Cameron, whenever he's asked about UKIP, just throws abuse at us and calls us nutters and closet racists, so I don't think there's any prospect of us doing a deal with the Conservative Party with Mr Cameron in charge.' On the chances of local deals with sympathetic Tory candidates, he said: 'It may happen but it's not my priority.' Shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander insisted Mr Cameron's speech had 'more to do with the politics of the Conservative Party...than actually to do with the national interest'. 'Why has the speech been delayed for more than a year? David Cameron I would suggest was actually rendered speechless because of the gap between what his backbenchers will tolerate and what European partners will give him.' Shadow education secretary Stephen Twigg threw Labour's position on a referendum into further confusion when he suggested the party would 'never' rule one out. The outgoing US ambassador to Britain, Louis Susman, said the relationship between our two countries 'couldn't be any stronger' and would not be affected by an EU referendum. 'This does not affect the special relationship. We believe in a strong EU, we can't imagine a strong EU without a vibrant partner in the UK and that's what we hope will come about but it's up to the British people to decide what they want,' he said.","Dr Fox calls for return to 'basic economic relationship'

The boardwalks of New York and New Jersey have for generations been the backdrop for generations of families to spend their summers, strolling the promenade, eating hot dogs and ice cream, and enjoying the balmy summer weather. But it was weather that destroyed the beloved mainstays as Superstorm Sandy’s savage winds ripped through low-lying coastal areas, rendering them to all but splinters. Nostalgia aside, boardwalks prove to be a driving economic force for these shoreline communities like the Rockaways and the Jersey Shore, and now, those communities are scrambling to rebuild their boardwalks before the busy summer months.

Rush: On November 1, a worker removes damaged boards from the Point Pleasant Beach, New Jersey, boardwalk; coastal communities are racing to rebuild their boardwalks in time for next summer . In Far Rockaway, more than 500 residents from around the area showed up for a rally yesterday to demand federal support for rebuilding boardwalks and replenishing sand on the beaches, Rockaway’s The Wave newspaper reported. The destroyed boardwalk in Long Beach in Long Island will cost an estimated $25million to repair. Likewise, the terminal and boathouse in Ocean Beach could cost as much as $1million to rebuild, according to Newsday. Those in stricken communities will need the tourism money this summer more than ever as they try to rebuild homes and other infrastructure. The expensive efforts are forcing decisions not only about how much to spend, but also whether to rebuild with environmentally sensitive wood or more durable materials. The destruction of late October's Superstorm Sandy will likely result in some changes along the shoreline, with more wooden walkways giving way to concrete or synthetic materials. 'Under the Polymerwalk' might not have the same ring to it as The Drifters' 1960s hit 'Under The Boardwalk,' but in some places there will no longer be boards in the boardwalk. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg has decided wooden boardwalks simply can't cut it anymore. City parks officials say concrete sections of boardwalk in Queens' Rockaways and Brooklyn's Coney Island held up much better in the storm. Desolation: Seagulls screech on the boardwalk in Ocean Grove, New Jersey; the boardwalk was warped and cracked by Superstorm Sandy . Synthetic strength? A section of the Spring Lake, New Jersey boardwalk ripped loose during Superstorm Sandy, despite being made of out synthetic material . And the mayor has long wanted to move away from the tropical hardwoods, harvested from endangered rainforests, that were used to build many boardwalks. That is an issue Tim Keating, director of Rainforest Relief, has been working on for years. He says coastal communities will be under pressure to quickly rebuild but urges them to resist the temptation to use tropical rainforest wood such as ipe, which is cheaper than synthetic materials and popular for its durability. Belmar is considering ipe for its boardwalk reconstruction. Keating says durable synthetic materials are the best choice for boardwalks; Belmar, Spring Lake, Point Pleasant Beach and other places already used it. Wooden boardwalks have staunch . defenders, who say nothing else looks, feels or even smells quite like a . true wooden boardwalk. A group from Coney Island called Friends of the . Boardwalk sued last year to block a New York City plan to replace wooden . boardwalks with concrete and plastic. Todd Dobrin, the group's leader, isn't convinced concrete will withstand a storm any better than wood. 'When hurricanes come through, they don't ask whether it's concrete or wood,' he said. 'They destroy whatever is in their path.' The destruction in Seaside Heights has become emblematic of the storm because of a roller coaster that plunged into the ocean. Yet Sandy also destroyed the boardwalk where families eat belly-busting foods like zeppoles — fried dough laden with powdered sugar — and where Snooki and company partied their way through the MTV reality show 'Jersey Shore.’ Month later: Sand and rubble sit where the boardwalk used to be in Seaside Heights, New Jersey on November 29 . Mayor Bill Akers said 75 percent of his town's budget comes from tourism, with the remaining 25 percent raised from local taxpayers. 'You can see how important it is for us to get the boardwalk back up and running, and to make sure we have a summer season,' he told the Associated Press. 'It's something we have to get done.' Seaside Heights, like several other Jersey shore towns, is soliciting bids to rebuild its boardwalk; Akers estimated it will take $10 million to $12 million. The Federal Emergency Management Agency will reimburse towns for 75 percent of those costs, but local governments first must front all the money themselves, forcing many to borrow in the short or long term. In these towns, even in the many non-commercial sections where boardwalks are merely a non-sandy way to get from here to there, not having one is not an option. To the north, Belmar has approved the largest boardwalk rebuilding project so far in the aftermath of the storm, committing $20 million to rebuild its 1.3-mile boardwalk and haul away the remnants of the old one. It is also considering erecting a steel sea wall to be buried under sand dunes to help protect the boardwalk and homes and businesses. 'The beach and the boardwalk go together,' said Mayor Matthew Doherty. 'It's who we are; it's part of our identity.' Yet identity only goes so far in shore towns' calculus. Money is a bigger factor. 'If there's no boardwalk, people aren't going to come this summer,' Doherty said. 'They'll go somewhere else, and if they like it there, they won't be back here. We want to be the first in the race to get things started for the summer.' Scope: A satellite view of Hurricane Sandy shows the massive scope of the storm . A 20-foot chunk of boardwalk is all that remains in Belmar, for one reason. It was an experimental section, bolted to underpinnings with the same hurricane tie-down straps that many home builders use to bind homes to their foundations. The entire new Belmar boardwalk will be built this way, Doherty said.Other Jersey shore towns including Sea Girt, Asbury Park and Point Pleasant Beach are moving forward with boardwalk rebuilding plans; Spring Lake has to rebuild its boardwalk little more than a year after Tropical Storm Irene wrecked half the old one. New York state parks, including the popular Jones Beach, also are starting to rebuild. 'We've engaged a contractor to go in and begin repairing it and experiment with some techniques as they go along,' said Ron Foley, Long Island regional director for the New York state parks. 'The boardwalk damage at Jones Beach was different. The wave action at some places got underneath the boardwalk. They lifted it right up, including the pilings driven into the sand, gave it a roller coaster effect.' Manasquan, New Jersey, for decades has paved its beachfront walkway with asphalt. Yet that, too, gets trashed by major storms. A 1992 nor'easter smashed large sections of it, and Sandy wrecked about half of it.","Officials debating whether or not to use synthetic materials other than wood to replace decimated boardwalks .

Taxpayers will end up footing the bill for legal fees for disgraced former Royal Bank of Scotland boss Fred Goodwin, it has emerged . Taxpayers will end up footing the bill for legal fees for disgraced former Royal Bank of Scotland boss Fred Goodwin, it has emerged. Former shareholders have launched a £4billion lawsuit against RBS that is likely to see Goodwin appear in court. The bank, which is 82 per cent owned by the taxpayer, refused to say whether it is paying for his representation. But industry sources say it is standard practice for major companies to pick up the tab for former bosses in such cases – even though Goodwin is drawing a £342,500-a-year pension from his time at the bank. According to a letter seen by the Daily Mail, law firm Herbert Smith is not only acting for RBS, but also for Goodwin, former chairman Sir Tom McKillop and former investment bank chief Johnny Cameron. The bank is thought to have taken out ‘indemnity insurance’ that protects them against financial liability for lawsuits. Labour MP John Mann, who sits on the Commons Treasury Committee, described the situation as ‘extraordinary’, saying: ‘It shows that the banks really don’t get it.’ He added: ‘He’s [Goodwin] done extremely well out of his mishandling of the bank so he should be paying for this himself. The taxpayer should not be footing the bill.’ And Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘This is yet another slap in the face for taxpayers and a timely reminder that the bank must be put back into private hands as soon as possible.’ The case hinges on whether the bank gave an accurate picture of its financial health in 2008, when it asked investors to spend £12billion on new shares in a ‘rights issue’. The shares plummeted in value as the bank came to the brink of collapse before being part-nationalised just months later, needing billions in public cash to keep it afloat. Those who invested in the rights issue were left nursing huge losses. The RBS Shareholders Action Group, which is co-ordinating the lawsuit, argues that RBS knew it was effectively bust without the extra cash, but failed to admit this.

The bank - 82 per cent owned by the taxpayer - refused to say whether it is paying for his representation, but industry sources say it is standard for companies to pick up the tab for former bosses in these cases . The action group’s law firm Bird & Bird is expected to say that RBS billed the fundraising as a ‘capital strengthening exercise’ to shore it up against the approaching financial storm. Instead, they will argue, RBS should have offered them the stock at a much lower price, admitting that it was conducting an emergency whip-round to save it from collapse following the disastrous acquisition of Dutch bank ABN Amro. The deal, which saddled RBS with billions in toxic debt, was widely blamed for RBS’s near collapse and £45.5billion taxpayer-funded bailout. RBS has denied making any misleading statements to investors. Sanctions against Goodwin, nicknamed Fred the Shred for his ruthless stewardship of the bank, have so far been limited to him being stripped of his knighthood. He was awarded a £703,000 pension when he retired at the age of 50 in October 2008 but eventually bowed to public anger, and agreed to forfeit £200,000 of the annual payout.","Shareholders have launched legal action against Royal Bank of Scotland which is likely to see Fred Goodwin appear in court .

"By . Shari Miller . PUBLISHED: . 05:41 EST, 20 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 07:03 EST, 20 January 2013 . The former partner of a benefits fraudster, who swindled as much as £100,000 from taxpayers to enjoy a lavish lifestyle, claims the ex-Moulin Rouge showgirl was also a love cheat who drained his finances. Company director Marc Lissimore, 46, today spoke of his relationship with mother-of-two Dawn Orton, who used taxpayers' cash to buy a convertible Mercedes and go on 41 holidays in 13 years. Orton was jailed for 12 months for wrongly claiming widowed mothers' allowance, plus an additional month after she initially refused to turn up for her trial at Hull Crown Court earlier this month. Dawn Orton, once a Moulin Rouge dancer who travelled the world, was found guilty of benefit fraud . The 47-year-old had in fact fled Britain to Malaga. An international arrest warrant was issued and Orton handed herself in to police last Friday. In an interview with the Sunday Mirror, Mr Lissimore reveals the full extent of her deception, which left him cash poor and fighting for her affection after discovering Orton had an American lover. He said: 'She was a devil in disguise. She was beautiful and I was an overweight businessman who thought he was lucky to have her, and she made sure I knew that.' The heartbroken businessman met Orton, who once performed as a dancer all over Europe and Japan, through his ex-wife Betsy. When Mr Lissimore's marriage ended, he was contacted by Orton, who told him that her husband Robert had committed suicide. He travelled from Hull to Tamworth, Staffordshire, to attend the funeral in October 1996 and offered support to the newly-widowed Orton. A relationship quickly developed: by Christmas she had moved into his home with her sons Reece, 19 and CJ, 23, and by New Year's Day 1997 the pair were engaged. Mr Lissimore, who owned and ran haulage firms in Hull said the couple enjoyed a wealthy lifestyle and he often lavished her with extravagant gifts and foreign trips. They also bought a £280,000 house in the leafy village of Cottingham, as well as a craft shop which Orton ran. But he was unaware that throughout the 13 years they were together, Orton had continued to claim an allowance for widowed mothers. This should have stopped when she moved in with Mr Lissimore. She had also previously received incapacity benefits for an injured shoulder. Prosecutors believe Orton's deception amounts to at least £29,000 - and as much as £100,000. The situation began to unravel following the death of Orton's mother in May 2010 from breast cancer. The otherwise devoted wife told Mr Lissimore that she needed to get away for a few weeks and that she would travel to America and stay with an old friend from school called Roger Bailey. Love cheat: Marc Lissimore claims he was left devastated when he discovered Dawn Orton was having an affair with yacht salesman Roger Bailey (pictured) But the father-of-two was suspicious and decided to check his wife's emails, discovering that the two were in fact lovers. 'I couldn't resist opening a couple of their email exchanges and I felt sick when I read one from Dawn, saying, ""How am I going to introduce you to my children?"" When I confronted her she denied it all. She said she loved me and when she returned we would get married...something she'd been putting off for 13 years.' Mr Lissimore believed Orton and even took her to Manchester airport for her flight in June 2010. But she then refused to return and asked for her son, Reece, to join her. When she finally returned home, Orton claimed she had made a mistake and begged for the company director to take her back. It was a pattern that would repeat itself many times over, as she continued to pay her long-term partner against her American lover. The deceived businessman also said Orton often used sex as a 'weapon' to get her own way. Mr Lissimore then claims Orton, who had fears about becoming pregnant, promised she would leave her lover if he had a vasectomy. In desperation, he agreed to the procedure, but it was not long before Orton left him for good and returned to yacht salesman Bailey. Deception: Prosecutors believe Orton claimed at least £29,000 - and as much as £100,000 to fund a lavish lifestyle and frequent holidays abroad . He said: 'I was devastated. I'd done everything, everything I could, to keep this woman, but she was cold and callous. What she did to me was terrible, but what she did to her two sons was even worse. They are both disgusted and neither of them talk to Dawn any more.' Within weeks of leaving him, Mr Lissimore discovered she was being investigated for benefit fraud. And worse was to come - when he tried to recoup some of the money from his house and shop, he was told he had no rights because both were in Orton's name. Mr Lissimore had agreed to do this, because of debt issues - and he said he had no reason to distrust his partner at that time. Following Orton's conviction last week, Mr Lissimore said: 'Dawn expects the world to run around her. She will not believe she has done anything wrong. He added: 'Her whole life has been about greed. Taking as much cash as she can from anyone.' Orton now faces an investigation under the Proceeds of Crime Act to claim back her ill-gotten gains and will appear for a hearing at Hull Crown Court on April 4.","Heartbroken Marc Lissimore claims Dawn Orton was 'cold and callous'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 14:11 EST, 8 September 2011 . FBI agents today raided the headquarters of California solar panel manufacturer Solyndra, which received more than $500 million in federal loan guarantees before filing for bankruptcy last week. The search comes amid intensifying pressure on the Obama administration, which championed Solyndra as being at the forefront of solar technology when President Barack Obama visited the company's Fremont, California, facility in 2010. 'We are executing search warrants at Solyndra regarding a joint FBI and Department of Energy Office of Inspector General investigation,' Julianne Sohn of the FBI said. Raided: An FBI agent stands outside of Solyndra headquarters in Fremont, California . DOE officials confirmed the search but declined to give any additional information. Solyndra filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection this week. The company received a $535 million loan guarantee from the federal government in 2009 and raised more than $700 million in venture capital funding in recent years. The company said it could not bring down its costs fast enough to compete with cheaper Chinese rivals, and it is currently seeking a buyer. Solyndra spokesman Dave Miller said agents were collecting documents but the company did not know the reason for the search. Supporter: President Obama was given a tour of the solar power company's factory in 2010 . Investigation: FBI agents,left, speak with an unidentified Solyndra worker, right, at Solyndra headquarters . Company executives were on the premises but were not likely to make a statement, he said. 'It certainly was a shock this morning to arrive and see the FBI here this morning,' he said. The assumption was that the search was related to the loan guarantees, Mr Miller said. Also today, House of Representatives Democrats Henry Waxman of the Energy and Commerce Committee and Diana DeGette of the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee called on the subcommittee's chairman, Cliff Stearns, to invite Solyndra Chief Executive Brian Harrison to testify at a September 14 hearing on the Solyndra loan guarantee.

Furious Jennie Cosh, 20, claims she was left fitting after nurses at Gloucestershire Royal Hospital ignored her calls - despite one standing at the bed next to her. She says staff on the hospital's stroke ward were stretched beyond their limits, meaning they were not able to respond to patients' needs properly. Stroke victim Jennie Cosh, 20, says her treatment at Gloucestershire Royal Hospital was a 'disgrace' Jennie alleges that elderly patients were forced to soil themselves when there was no response to them repeatedly pressing the buzzer and loudly wailing for help. The journalism student, who is now recovering at home in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, said she wanted to raise awareness of conditions in the hospital to help others. She said: 'I was shocked at how poor the standard of care was at Gloucestershire Royal Hospital. 'I was lying in a hospital bed, having a fit, and a nurse just two metres away ignored my cries for help. 'It is supposed to be a ""centre for excellence"" for stroke victims but that wasn't my experience at all. 'I was put on a big ward in an open bay with very little privacy - and I was the youngest patient by about 60 years. Staff hardly paid any attention to me. 'I felt totally isolated and alone and it was worse for some of the elderly patients around me who were constantly buzzing for assistance and being ignored. She claims the staff on the hospital's stroke ward were stretched beyond their limits, meaning they were not able to respond to patients' needs properly . 'One poor lady was buzzing repeatedly and, as there was no answer, she ended up soiling herself. 'Another threw up over herself. It was a disgrace.' Jennie was suffering from a splitting headache, dizziness, blurred vision and a high temperature on June 26 last year while eating dinner with parents. She went outside to cool down where she struggled with her right leg before taking a combined aspirin pain killer tablet. Furious Jennie claims she was ignored by nurses even after calling out for help . Her worried parents took her to the doctor after her symptoms persisted and she was given the shock news that she had suffered a stroke. Doctors have still not been able to pinpoint exactly what caused her stroke. Jennie describes herself as 'perfectly healthy' and does not smoke, drink or take drugs. Jennie was admitted to Gloucestershire Royal Hospital hours after visiting the doctor and remained there until July 2. She added: 'I remember at one point I started to feel faint and buzzed for a nurse. There was no response and I started fitting. 'Although there was a nurse on the very bed next to me, she didn't even acknowledge me for nearly 10 minutes. 'I couldn't believe how bad it was, but I was only there for a short time. But what about the elderly people who are in for weeks on end?' Jennie has been left with limited feeling down her right side from the ordeal, but has been working hard to regain full fitness. A spokesman for Gloucestershire Royal Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, which runs the hospital, said it would need more details for a full investigation. He said: 'Gloucestershire Hospitals is committed to providing high quality and safe care for our patients and we take complaints seriously. 'We are disappointed to hear that Jennie Cosh was unhappy with the care provided. We would like to invite her to speak to us about her concerns.'

A mother has lost 12 stone in nine months after her children begged her to take control of her weight. Annette Skinner, 46, shrunk from a size 32 to a size 14 after her son Alex came home upset that she didn't look like other mothers. Her daughter Kelly, 25, was also concerned her mother's weight would restrict Alex's upbringing, and he too would be bullied as she had been as a child. At her peak, Annette, from Walsall, . weighed 25st 10lb. She says she was so big that people didn't realise she was pregnant with Alex. Annette Skinner was nearly 26 stone when her children begged her to lose weight. She has since lost more than 12 stone and now runs regularly . She told MailOnline: 'I have never been skinny, but over the years, because I was happy and ""comfortable"", I just piled on the pounds. 'Chocolate was my biggest downfall – I got through . a few big bars of Galaxy a day. Any junk food I opened, I had to . finish. ‘I was basically in total denial – it was the story of my life. I became a hermit of my own making, never . seeing what other people saw. 'Maybe that was because I never looked . below my neckline in the mirror. As stupid as that sounds, it’s true. Annette, who now weighs 13 stone, with daughter Kelly and son Alex. She says chocolate was her biggest downfall. 'I got through a few big bars of Galaxy a day. Any junk food I opened, I had to finish' ‘I’d tried loads of diets, but even if I lost weight, I would always put it back on – and some.' Over the years, Annette's family had voiced their concerns about her weight and her health - she was often breathless and suffered from sore knees. 'I refused to go to social events that . would put me in situations where my weight would be the topic on . everyone’s lips. 'And instead of listening to my husband Kevin when he was trying . to help me, I would just bite his head off by saying: “if you don’t . like it, you know where the door is!” 'He was just worried about me, but I always had to retaliate. I think the amount of weight I had to lose just seemed so much that it was a mountain I didn't think I could face climbing. The turning point came when Annette’s daughter Kelly sat her down to voice her fears about her mother’s health. Annette's daughter Kelly says she was bullied at school for having the 'fat mum' and didn't want her brother Alex to suffer a similar fate . Annette says she often felt breathless and had sore knees due to her weight . ‘She said she didn’t want Alex to feel the same way she had growing up – not being able to join in with normal activities a child should do. ‘Growing up she was the one in the class that could never go to swimming parties as I would never go in the pool with her. She was also bullied at school for having the ""fat"" mum. 'We couldn't do the simplest of activities such as going to the park due to me being short of breath or as the mother-daughter shopping trips that she watched all my friends doing.' To add to her guilt, the next day Alex came home from school and dropped his own bombshell. 'He came in and said: ""Mummy, why can’t you look like other mummies?” Annette and Kelly now exercise together regularly and say they have a much closer relationship . ‘It quite honestly broke my heart. I was in pieces and something inside me just switched and I thought “this really needs to happen”. At this point, Annette had been a member of her local Fitness First gym for a year, having been bought a membership the year before by her mother. Annette says: 'I would go, but make any excuse to do as little as I could. I would also convince myself I had ""exercised"" – and that gave me a right to eat what I wanted - even if I'd just done five minutes of walking. ‘My confidence was also so low that I had the constant fear of everyone staring at the fat lady on the treadmill. ‘Now I know that most people don’t give two hoots about other people in the gym – we’re all there for the same reason.' But on 1st August 2011, Annette took the bull by the horns and began her exercise programme. 'I decided to get a personal trainer to kick me a kick start,' she says. 'He asked me ""what do you want to . achieve"", and I said “I just want to look normal” – the last time I had . looked normal was when I was a teenager.’ Her . initial sessions with Paul, her personal trainer, were ‘very hard . work’, involving a combination of walking and the bike. She then went on . to have three sessions a week. ‘He . never put me on a diet – he just gave me tips on how to eat healthily. There was no crash dieting as I just knew that wouldn’t be sustainable . in the long term. ‘I lost two stone straight away because I was so big, then around one stone a month.’ Annette with her mother - who initially bought her the gym membership. For the first year, she admits she was in denial and would go for just five minutes each time . Annette now weighs 13 stone and due to exercising three times a week, had also managed to keep the weight off. 'That has actually been much harder than losing the weight,' she says. Now I see Paul just once a week and the rest I do myself. 'But I must stress you have to be in the right place when you start something like this - the reason I think I was so successful is because I really wanted it. 'Over the past year and a half I have seen the gym in a new light - I never believed walking through that door would change my life like it has. But thanks to Paul I am now half the woman I was. Last year I went to a party and some of my old school friends didn’t recognise me.' Annette says she now feels terrible guilt for what she put her family through. Her . daughter Kelly, who encouraged Annette by going to the gym with her, . said: ‘My mum has been a “big” woman for as long as I can remember. ‘She is such a loving, caring and giving human being but when I was growing up her large frame altered my 'normal' upbringing. ‘I was never deprived of anything that I needed but what she gave in love she lacked in other areas. Annette says she is 'truly a new person. Not only by the way I look but also my confidence is sky high, from the woman who always looked at the floor, I now hold my head high' ‘The final straw was one year ago when . my brother came home from school and said: “mummy, why don’t you look . like the other mummy’s?"" I could no longer stand the thought of my mum . making my brother suffer the same fate that I did. 'I sat her down and . told her my worries about her health and what my brother will miss out . on should she not do anything about her weight. 'Since that day she has . never looked back and watching her go from a size 32 to a 14 has been amazing. ‘She has lost more than my total weight and my brother’s height in inches. As a result we are a lot closer; we . now workout together, we go shopping any chance we get and to top it all . off my brother has never missed one swimming party. I’m one very proud . daughter.’ Annette agrees her weight loss has boosted her relationship, with Alex, too. 'We now go to the park, swimming and race along the road together. Last year I did a 5k run in 40 minutes – there’s no way I could have done that before. ‘I can truly say I am a new person, not . only by the way I look but also my confidence is sky high, from the . woman who always looked at the floor, I now hold my head high. ‘The other day I caught sight of myself . in the gym and didn’t recognise myself – there was someone normal . staring back at me. I’ve basically lost a whole person in weight. 'My only regret is I never did this . earlier. I am ashamed of . myself before and feel I was very selfish towards my family.

A newborn who was a day from death after her body was starved of oxygen, was saved thanks to her mother's instincts. Kelly Crow took her three-week-old daughter Kaci in to hospital after she failed to put on weight and had a blueish tinge to her hands and feet. After a battery of tests she was diagnosed with an extremely rare heart defect and rushed to surgery in the nick of time. 'She constantly had blue hands and feet. I knew that something definitely wasn't right,' Ms Crow said. Write caption here . Kaci was born last summer, weighing 5lbs 15ozs and her mother said she thought something was wrong straight away. However, doctors discharged them with the promise they would keep an eye on Kaci's progress. Back at home in Millbrook, Hampshire, Ms Crow became more concerned. 'She just wouldn't feed, so I was really worried that it was something serious,' the mother-of-four said. She took Kaci back to hospital when she was three weeks old - a decision she is eternally grateful that she made. Kaci underwent a battery of tests including blood tests, X-Rays and an eco-cardiogram. Within hours she was diagnosed with Total Anomalous Pulmonary Veins Drainage, a life-threatening condition that has only affected six children in the UK in the last decade. It is a rare but deadly congenital . defect in which veins in the heart are in the wrong place, affecting how . oxygen rich blood is pumped around the body. 'Instead of blood going to her lungs, . liver and kidney, it was just bypassing her lungs and she was just being . starved of oxygen,' her mother said. Kaci, pictured with her parents Kelly and John and older brothers and sister . has beaten a heart condition that has affected just six children in the last decade . Surgeons at the world-renowned . children's heart unit in Southampton Hospital, cut one of the . chambers of Kaci's heart to correct the flow. The procedure was a success and she was allowed home after nine days. However, afterwards surgeons revealed it had been a very close call. 'I'd taken Kaci in at teatime on August . 17, and the surgeons said she would have died within 24 hours if she . hadn't gone under the knife,' Ms Crow said. 'Thankfully I did and by a miracle she's still here today. The surgeons saved my baby's life and I owe them a lot. 'Without them I may never have seen her take her first steps or develop into the absolutely brilliant character she is today.' Now 18-months old, Kaci is a delight for her mother, father John Phillips, 33, and three older siblings. Ms Crow is planning a 15,000ft skydive to raise £2,000 pounds for the unit that cared for her baby. It came under threat from government funding cuts last year but was saved from the axe by a 250,000 strong petition. Miss Crow added: 'Because Kaci's surgery was a repair operation no further action is needed. 'Kaci will be observed just like any other little girl as she grows, but she's been given a clean bill of health to live a full, happy, healthy life. 'I don't like heights and never thought I'd jump out of a plane but if my daughter could be brave at such a young age, then I can be brave too.'For more information visit justgiving.com/kellykellie .","Kaci's heart condition has only affected six children in the UK since 2002 .

Although we are most accustomed to seeing her dazzle on the red carpet, A-list actress Gwyneth Paltrow maintains that she feels happiest with a tea towel over her shoulder in her North London kitchen cooking for her family. The budding chef has already divulged her diet secrets and favourite dishes in two popular cookbooks, and her latest offering is so hotly anticipated that it is taking pre-orders four months before its release date. The 40-year-old's latest book of cuisine, It's All Good: Delicious, Easy Recipes That Will Make You Look Good and Feel Great, features recipes 'for the foods she eats when she wants to lose weight, look good, and feel more energetic', according to the description on Amazon. Sneak peak: Gwyneth Paltrow's new cookbook It's All Good features recipes that 'make you look and feel great' According to the book's synopsis, after a grueling schedule and lapse of overindulgence last Spring, Gwyneth was left feeling fatigued and faint and a trip to the doctor later revealed that she was anemic, vitamin D deficient, and that her stress levels were sky high. Her doctor prescribed an elimination diet banning coffee, alcohol, sugar, eggs, wheat, meat and processed food to clear out her system and help her body heal. Budding chef: The 40-year-old actress has openly spoken out about her love of cooking hearty meals and already has two cookbooks out . As an avid foodie, the actress was concerned that so many restrictions would make mealtimes boring and repetitive, so joined forces with food writer Julia Turshen to compile a collection of recipes that adhered to her guidelines and put the fun back in food. The 185 recipes, which include huevos rancheros, hummus tartine with scallion-mint pesto, salmon burgers with pickled ginger, and even chocolate brownies with banana ice cream, apparently help the star feel more energetic. During her twenties, Gwyneth followed an incredibly strict macrobiotic diet to keep in shape. How does she do it? The shapely A-lister admits to loving pizza and fries . But the mother-of-two has certainly loosened up her diet a bit and now allows . herself to indulge in her favourite treats, including pizza and French . fries. While she still detoxes before movie roles . and works out religiously, she has revealed she eats liberally most of the time, and if her juicy roast chicken and no-fry fries recipes are anything to go by, we can all shun salads and look like Gwyneth in no time. 'Invest in what's real. Clean as you go. Drink while you cook. Make it fun. It doesn't have to be complicated. It will be what it will be . ‘Cooking makes me feel so calm and happy – doing things that are routine and mundane. If I’m stressed out, I start to cook and I completely relax.’ 'I love bread and cocktail sauce,’ 'I honestly think that even ordering a pizza and sitting down together as a family is great.' ‘My dad loved to barbecue – he’d fire up . his grill and do all kinds of ribs, hamburgers and hot dogs. It wasn’t . very healthy back in the day. 'I was macrobiotic for three or four . years, but when I got pregnant with Apple I wanted french fries, grilled . cheese... it went out the window. 'I eat fish, a little dairy... but I . love cheese. We'll make chocolate chip cookies and eat them, but sugar . makes me feel pretty bad. I have coffee and wine. I've got lots of . lovely vices.'

A super slimmer who became agoraphobic after being attacked three times has told of her amazing recovery which has seen her regain her independence and shed an incredible seven stone. Sue Bushnell, 51, was left petrified to leave her home after she suffered recurring violent incidents in her line of work as a bookmaker in Harehills, Leeds, West Yorks., forcing her to leave her job four years ago. Afraid to leave the house without her husband or daughters, Sue resorted to comfort eating and her weight soared to 18-and-a-half stones. Before and after: Super slimmer Sue Bushnell lost a staggering seven stone after being held at gun point while working as a bookmaker drove her to comfort eating . Finally, after encouragement from her youngest daughter Sarah, 25, Sue - who was also suffering from post traumatic stress, sleep apnoea and high blood pressure - joined Slimming World. Now, just 18 months later, Sue has escaped from her own virtual prison as a confident and independent woman - and a svelte seven stones lighter. Mother-of-three Sue said: 'The first incident was when I was going to bank the takings from the bookmakers. I was jumped from behind. 'Six weeks after that I was working in the shop when someone barged in and started pointing something at me. 'I thought it was a gun so I threw myself on the floor. Next I heard the man laughing and leaving the shop with the cash from the till. 'The next time, it was a real gun. I was petrified and I couldn't go back into work after that.' Comfort: After the attack Sue developed post-traumatic stress and would feast on chocolate . None of the perpetrators were ever caught and Sue was diagnosed with post traumatic stress. She left her job of 11 years and became trapped inside her own home. She said: 'I started getting flashbacks and terrible nightmares. I couldn't go out of the house because I would have panic attacks. 'I found it difficult to even have family and friends round to our house and would sometimes have to retreat to my bedroom. Helping hand: The mother-of-three was motivated to lose weight and join Slimming World by her daughter Sarah . 'Food was my only comfort. I would eat when I wasn't even hungry. I wouldn't have any proper meals because I couldn't concentrate on cooking. 'I just snacked on whatever was in the fridge. Chocolate was my biggest downfall.' Sue joined Slimming World after taking inspiration from her daughter. 'Sarah joined in November 2010 and I'd watched how she flourished,' said Sue. 'I was becoming more worried about my health, and Sarah encouraged me to go with her. 'I . was so nervous and just stayed by her side the whole night. But after a . couple of weeks I started to look forward to going. All the women were . lovely and they were so supportive. 'Gradually, as I went more, my confidence grew. I even started getting out and about, going for walks with my husband Alan. Such a difference: Sue has not only lost seven stone but she also feels happier, healthier and more independent . 'For years, I had felt trapped, not only because I was embarrassed about my appearance but I was also terrified of being in other people's company.' Sue has lost seven stone and a few weeks ago she went to the supermarket on her own for the first time. She said: 'When I got home, I had the most brilliant feeling. I was so proud of myself. I'd always been independent until this happened, and then I started to rely on everybody else. But now I'm starting to be my own person again.' Sue has progressed so well that she came in the top 50 of Slimming World's Women of the Year 2012.","Sue Bushnell tipped the scales at 18-and-half stone after three attacks in her job as a bookmaker led her to hiding at home and comfort eating .

"By . James Slack and Jack Doyle . PUBLISHED: . 08:44 EST, 14 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 03:29 EST, 16 January 2013 . Crossbench peer Baroness Meacher said that like illegal drugs, her morning coffee was not safe . Youngsters should be encouraged to switch from drinking alcohol to taking drugs, the head of a powerful parliamentary group said yesterday. Baroness Meacher also compared taking banned substances to drinking coffee. The former social worker insisted some drugs are ‘a good deal safer’ than tobacco and alcohol and said it may be a ‘very good thing’ if teenagers stopped getting drunk and took some types of legal highs instead. Her comments came the day after the All Party Parliamentary Group for Drug Policy Reform, of which she is chairman, called for the possession and use of heroin, ecstasy and crack cocaine to be decriminalised altogether, which would relegate it to the status of a minor driving offence. The report suggested that giving criminal records to young drug users creates ‘higher levels of unemployment, homelessness and relationship problems’. It also called for licences to be issued to allow chemists to sell so-called ‘legal highs’, which have been blamed for causing more than 40 deaths in a single year. Baroness Meacher told Radio 4’s Today programme: ‘No drugs are completely safe. Coffee is not safe. I have just had a cup but it isn’t safe. ‘The fact is some of these drugs are a good deal safer than tobacco and alcohol. It may be a very good thing if we could get some young people to switch from alcohol. ‘As you know, a lot of young people . are drinking far too much. Get them to switch to something rather . safer.’ The cross-bench peer, who is paid up to £50,000 a year by the . NHS, said many young people are ‘determined’ to take drugs but there was . ‘nowhere’ for them to do so. If hard drugs are decriminalised users would escape with a fine, confiscation and no criminal record . Under existing laws users of drugs such as heroin, cocaine or ecstasy face a maximum sentence of seven years in jail, along with a criminal record, but the new report calls for a weakening of these regulations . Under the group’s plan, chemists . would have to show that the substances carried only an ‘agreed low risk . of harm’. They would be given licences and regulated by council trading . standards officers. Yesterday, Baroness Meacher suggested they could stock ‘legal highs that are a substitute for ecstasy’. Taking drugs would remain illegal but users would escape with a fine, confiscation and no criminal record. The report drew an angry response from anti-drugs campaigners. Tory MP Michael Ellis, a member of . the home affairs committee, said: ‘It is balderdash to say that we . should legalise drugs. We would see increased A&E admissions, . increased criminal justice incidents as well as far more deaths and . injuries.’ Mary Brett, of Cannabis Skunk Sense, . said drugs would fall into the hands of minors if made readily . available. She added: ‘Does she think the drug dealers will just pack up . and go home? ‘They are criminals, they will smuggle them in and undercut the price. They will still target the under 18s.’ The Lib Dems want a major review of . Britain’s drug laws, but the idea is being fiercely resisted by the . Prime Minister. Yesterday, David Cameron’s official spokesman said: . ‘[His] very strong, clear view is that the approach we currently have is . the right one and is working.’ Molly Meacher has held a string of . public sector and quango posts in her career which have granted her . significant influence over public life. The . ex-wife of the Labour firebrand Michael Meacher, she worked as a social . worker before becoming a commissioner for the Mental Health Act in . 1987. She was a senior adviser to the Russian government on employment in the 1990s, while filling key roles on London health trusts. She . is also a former deputy chairman of the Police Complaints Authority and . chairman of the Security Industry Authority – a hugely controversial . quango which granted hundreds of illegal immigrants permission to work . as bouncers.","Crossbencher Baroness Meacher calls for heroin, ecstasy and crack cocaine to be decriminalised .

Retired Cardinal Roger Mahony and other top Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles officials maneuvered behind the scenes to shield molester priests, provide damage control for the church and keep parishioners in the dark, according to church personnel files. The confidential records filed in a lawsuit against the archdiocese disclose how the church handled abuse allegations for decades and also reveal dissent from a top Mahony aide who criticized his superiors for covering up allegations of abuse rather than protecting children. Notes inked by Mahony demonstrate he was disturbed about abuse and sent problem priests for treatment, but there also were lengthy delays or oversights in some cases. Disclosed info: Retired Cardinal Roger Mahony and other top Roman Catholic Archdiocese officials in LA made efforts to shield molester priests, provide damage control for the church and keep parishioners in the dark . The confidential records show how the church handled abuse allegations for decades and also reveal dissent from a top Mahony aide who criticized his superiors for covering up allegations of abuse rather than protecting children . Mahony received psychological reports on some priests that mentioned the possibility of many other victims, for example, but there is no indication that he or other church leaders investigated further. ‘This is all intolerable and unacceptable to me,’ Mahony wrote in 1991 on a file of the Reverend Lynn Caffoe, a priest suspected of locking boys in his room, videotaping their crotches and running up a $100 phone sex bill while with a boy. Caffoe was sent for therapy and removed from ministry, but Mahony didn't move to defrock him until 2004, a decade after the archdiocese lost track of him. ‘He is a fugitive from justice,’ Mahony wrote to the Vatican's Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, who is now Pope Benedict XVI. ‘A check of the Social Security index discloses no report of his demise, so presumably he is alive somewhere.’ Caffoe died in 2009, six years after a newspaper reporter found him working at a homeless mission two blocks from a Salinas elementary school. Apology: Mahony was out of town but issued a statement Monday apologizing for his mistakes and saying he had been 'naïve' about the lasting impacts of abuse . Mahony was out of town but issued a statement Monday apologizing for his mistakes and saying he had been ‘naïve’ about the lasting impacts of abuse. He has since met with 90 abuse victims privately and keeps an index card with each victim's name in his private chapel, where he prays for them daily, he said. The card also includes the name of the molesting priest ‘lest I forget that real priests created this appalling harm.’ ‘It remains my daily and fervent prayer that God's grace will flood the heart and soul of each victim, and that their life journey continues forward with ever greater healing,’ Mahony wrote. ‘I am sorry.’ The church's sex abuse policy was evolving and Mahony inherited some of the worst cases from his predecessor when he took over in 1985, J. Michael Hennigan, an archdiocese attorney, said in a separate series of emails. Priests were sent out of state for psychological treatment because they revealed more when their therapists were not required to report child abuse to law enforcement, as they were in California, he said. At the time, clergy were not mandated sex abuse reporters and the church let the victims' families decide whether to contact police, he added. In at least one case, a priest victimized the children of illegal immigrants and threatened to have them deported if they told, the files show. The files are attached to a motion seeking punitive damages in a case involving a Mexican priest sent to Los Angeles in 1987 after he was brutally beaten in his parish south of Mexico City. When parents complained the Reverend Nicholas Aguilar Rivera molested in LA, church officials told the priest but waited two days to call police — allowing him to flee to Mexico, court papers allege. At least 26 children told police they were abused during his 10 months in Los Angeles. The now-defrocked priest is believed to be in Mexico and remains a fugitive. The personnel files of 13 other clerics were attached to the motion to show a cover-up pattern, said attorney Anthony De Marco, who represents the 35-year-old plaintiff. Further shielding: The files show Mahony worked to keep molester priests out of state to avoid criminal and civil trouble . In one instance, a memo to Mahony discusses sending a cleric to a therapist who also is an attorney so any incriminating evidence is protected from authorities by lawyer-client privilege. In another instance, archdiocese officials paid a secret salary to a priest exiled to the Philippines after he and six other clerics were accused of having sex with a teen and impregnating her. The exhibits offer a glimpse at some 30,000 pages to be made public as part of a record-setting $660 million settlement. The archdiocese agreed to give the files to more than 500 victims of priest abuse in 2007, but a lawyer for about 30 of the priests fought to keep records sealed. A judge recently ordered the church to release them without blacking out the names of church higher-ups. They echo similar releases from other dioceses nationwide that have shown how church leaders for decades shuffled problem priests from parish to parish, covered up reports of abuse and didn't contact law enforcement. Top church officials in Missouri and Pennsylvania were criminally convicted last year for their roles in covering up abuse, more than a decade after the clergy sex abuse scandal began to unfold in Boston. Mahony, who retired in 2011 after 26 years at the helm of the 4.3-million person archdiocese, has been particularly hounded by the case of the Reverend Michael Baker, who was sentenced to prison in 2007 for molestation — two decades after the priest confessed his abuse to Mahony. Mahony noted the ‘extremely grave and serious situation’ when he sent Baker for psychological treatment after the priest told him in 1986 that he had molested two brothers over seven years. Baker returned to ministry the next year with a doctor's recommendation that he be defrocked immediately if he spent any time with minors. Despite several documented instances of being alone with boys, the priest wasn't removed from ministry until 2000. Around the same time, the church learned he was conducting baptisms without permission. Church officials discussed announcing Baker's abuse in churches where he had worked, but Mahony rejected the idea. ‘We could open up another firestorm — and it takes us years to recover from those,’ Mahony wrote in an October 6, 2000, memo. ‘Is there no alternative to public announcements at all the Masses in 15 parishes??? Wow — that really scares the daylights out of me!!’ The aide, Monsignor Peter Garcia Richard Loomis, noted his dismay over the matter when he retired in 2001 as vicar for clergy, the top church official who handled priestly discipline. In a memo to his successor, Loomis said Baker's attorney disclosed the priest had at least 10 other victims. ‘We've stepped back 20 years and are being driven by the need to cover-up and to keep the presbyteriate & public happily ignorant rather than the need to protect children,’ Loomis wrote. ‘The only other option is to sit and wait until another victim comes forward. Then someone else will end up owning the archdiocese of Los Angeles. The liability issues involved aside, I think that course of complete (in)action would be immoral and unethical.’ Mahony preferred targeted warnings at schools and youth groups rather than a warning read at Masses, Hennigan said. Parish announcements were made two years later. Baker, who was paroled in 2011, is alleged to have molested 20 children in his 26-year career. He could not be reached for comment. The files also show Mahony worked to keep molester priests out of state to avoid criminal and civil trouble. One case involved the Monsignor Peter Garcia, a molester whom Mahony's predecessor sent for treatment in New Mexico. Mahony kept Garcia there after a lawyer warned in 1986 that the archdiocese could face ‘severe civil liability’ if he returned and reoffended. Garcia had admitted raping an 11-year-old boy and later told a psychologist he molested 15 to 17 young boys. ‘If Monsignor Garcia were to reappear here within the archdiocese, we might very well have some type of legal action filed in both the criminal and civil sectors,’ Mahony wrote to the director of Garcia's New Mexico treatment program. Mahony then sent Garcia to another treatment center, but Garcia returned to LA in 1988 after being removed from ministry. He then contacted a victim's mother and asked to spend time with her younger son, according to a letter in the file. Mahony moved to defrock him in 1989, and Garcia died a decade later.

A man is being questioned on suspicion of murder after a 'caring and quiet' teenager died when he was stabbed in the heart in broad daylight. A 26-year-old man from Bracknell, . Berkshire, was arrested last night on suspicion of murder and remained . in police custody for questioning, a spokesman for Greater Manchester . Police said. The family of 18-year-old Kieran Crump-Raiswell said he 'had his whole life ahead of him', and may have been intending to hand out his CV to shops and businesses in Manchester city centre when he was attacked in Whalley Range on January 16. CCTV footage released by police shows Mr Crump-Raiswell walking along Upper Chorlton Road just minutes before he was killed, listening to music on his headphones, carrying his rucksack and apparently 'oblivious' to what was about to unfold. Seconds later his killer emerged from bushes on a side street and attacked him from behind with a knife at 2.20pm before running off. He was given first aid by a passing fire crew but his injuries proved too severe and he later died in hospital. A post-mortem examination concluded he died from a stab wound to the chest. Kieran was a former student at Loreto Sixth Form College in Manchester, and previously a pupil at nearby Chorlton High School. He had successfully completed his A Levels in politics, history and physical education last summer and was taking a gap tear before going to Sheffield Hallam University to read history.

The youngster 'had his whole life ahead of him', his family said, and was due to start university in September after finishing his gap year. The day before he was killed he had been handing out his CV to local businesses.

He had his whole life ahead of him.' CCTV shows Kieran's final moments before he was attacked . The family’s next door neighbour Nick Dearden, 44, solicitor and law lecturer said: 'There’s no understanding to what happened to Kieran. He was an excellent young man and I can’t imagine how his family are going to cope with his death. 'He was the eldest, Anna was 16 and Paddy 13 and they were always looking out for each other. He always looked after them. He was a football coach and he was always practising and kicking out the back and on the street. 'I am just so shocked he was a very quiet lad very family orientated and most of the time you would see them out as a family. he was going to university this summer he was a bright lad I think he was studying either politics or politics and history. 'He had got a place at Sheffield Hallam University and was looking forward to it. As neighbours we all looked out for each other they are fantastic neighbours he was such a lovely quiet lad I’m not sure whether he had a girlfriend or not. 'He was a keen footballer and cricketer and a massive Manchester City fan I think he had a season ticket too. He only came back from America a bit ago after a few months coaching football in America in Virginia. 'I believe he was very talented to be coaching football at such a young age. 'He had his life ahead of him it wasn’t like he was waiting around with no plan. One of the surprising things was that he did not ever seem to go through that stroppy teenager faze and never lost interest with his younger siblings. 'I used to see him kicking the ball in the street I was told he had a massive talent. Det Chief Insp Peter Marsh: 'I still want to hear from you if you saw anyone acting suspiciously.' 'It really makes no sense at all I can only imagine that he was in the wrong place at the wrong time. I walk up and down the street in broad daylight you just do not expect something like this to happen. 'There really is nothing to point in the direction of him being involved in anything untoward. I can’t imagine him being involved in anything that would be improper.' Aidan Bruce Assistant Principal Loreto College said: 'The college community is shocked to learn of the news of Kieran’s tragic death. 'He was a most gentle and friendly young man, who was liked and admired by everyone who met him. 'He successfully completed his A Levels in Politics, History and Physical Education in summer 2012 and he was taking a Gap Year before going to Sheffield Hallam University to read History. Appeal for witnesses: Officers said the area would have been very busy at the time of the stabbing . 'He had recently returned from the USA where he had been coaching football for 3 months. In the preceding year he had visited the USA with the college’s History/Politics Department. 'His teachers and friends are devastated by this news and our deepest sympathy goes to his family and friends.' In tributes on Twitter, friend Cara Kerr, 18, said: 'Just thinking things over and over and it doesn't make sense. He is an amazing guy who in 11 years I only heard swear once. 'Unbelievable, he wouldn't of stood up for himself. It's disgusting, couldn't of happened to a nicer person. 'Can't believe such an amazing person has been taken so soon' Rhys Bailey said: 'I can't get my head round it, the guy wouldn't hurt a fly. Some horrible people out there.' Rizwan Anjum said: 'Can't believe it.. RIP Kieran, he was such a quiet kid and kept himself to himself.' Adam Keyworth said: 'Another young lad taken too soon.' Hamza Limbada said: 'Nobody deserves to go like that, especially someone so nice and quiet, RIP Kieran. The good die young.'

Middle earners who dodge tax will be targeted in a major crackdown by the Crown Prosecution Service. In a hard-hitting speech tonight, the Director of Public Prosecutions will condemn those who fail to pay their dues – from lawyers to plumbers. Keir Starmer will say it is a ‘long-standing myth’ that tax evasion – by outright fraud or concealment – is a victimless crime. Director of public prosecutions Keir Starmer will promise to 'ramp up' the number of cases against individuals suspected of tax evasion . ‘Many would be outraged if money was stolen from their personal bank accounts,’ he will add. ‘The latest estimate by HM Revenue and . Customs suggests that tax evasion costs the UK economy £14billion a . year. That is the equivalent of £769 per family. ‘A victimless crime? This is money . that could have been spent on schools, hospitals, firefighters, police . and public services,’ Mr Starmer will say. The CPS has decided to . ‘radically’ increase the number of tax evasion cases that go to court. It is aiming for a fivefold increase, bringing the total to around 7,500 a year by 2014/15. Mr Starmer will say in his speech: ‘Tax evasion has to be dealt with robustly all the time. Plumbers and lawyers are among those to be targeted in the tax crackdown (File pictures) ‘But in a recession when ordinary . law-abiding taxpayers are suffering real hardship, the need to deter, . detect and prosecute those who evade tax is greater than ever.’ The CPS said those caught can expect . to spend a ‘significant’ amount of time in prison if they commit . large-scale tax evasion, even if it is their first offence. An HMRC . spokesman said: ‘The vast majority of taxpayers are honest and pay what . they have to under the law. ‘They rightly expect us to tackle the . small minority of cheats who deprive the country of vital revenues and . we are using every penny of our additional resources to tackle the . cheats.’ The crackdown comes at a time when . questions are being asked about the ability of global giants such as . Google, Starbucks and Amazon to minimise their contributions thanks to . complex schemes. Tessa Lorimer, a former Revenue . prosecutor who is now a barrister at GSC Solicitors, said: ‘Middle- . market cases are easier to prosecute and they don’t cost as much. Mr Starmer will reject the idea of tax evasion being a 'victimless crime' but risks looking like prosecutors are targeting middle earners rather than multi-national firms . ‘They attract a lot of publicity and achieve a lot of deterrence.’ A recent report by the National Audit Office laid bare the ‘staggering’ scale of tax avoidance. It said this was a matter of ‘using the tax law to get a tax advantage that Parliament never intended’. The NAO said celebrities, small . businesses and large firms are among those robbing Britain every year of . around £5billion of tax. n Britain’s largest firms paid taxes . of £77billion last year, equal to 14 per cent of the Government’s total . tax take, according to the accountancy firm PricewaterhouseCoopers. The sum included everything from corporation tax and VAT to national insurance and income tax.","Chief prosecutor Keir Starmer is aiming for a fivefold increase in tax evasion cases that go to court .

She broke the somber news via Twitter on January 19, but that is far from the end of her husband's baby drama. Another suit involves a woman named Chanel Johnson, the mother of Miller's 4-year-old daughter Neesyn Dacey.

While Miller has refrained from mentioning Johnson in the past, there is a trail of Twitter exchanges between Miller and McKenna. On the day Miller proposed to his wife, he took to Twitter, posted a picture of his wife wearing the ring and announced: 'I have found the one!!! And convinced her to marry me.' The celebration didn't last long. McKenna used the micro-blogging site to accuse Miller of not acknowledging his child. McKenna, . who on Twitter describes herself as a firefighter, ex-Marine, and . model, posted a sonogram of her baby and included Bode in her tweet.

U.S. at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia. Miller’s knee first bothered him last . winter when he was competing on an icy hill during a . test race for the games after having knee surgery.

'I have said many times that motivation is a key trait for me when it comes to my racing -- I am super motivated to do great things next year.' Miller has been so successful by doing things his way, on his terms. That gambler's mentality has served him well in his career, leading to five Olympic medals — including that elusive gold at the 2010 Vancouver Games — four world championships and 33 World Cup wins, which is an American men's record. U.S. coach Sasha Rearick applauded Miller's decision to slow down and not rush back into action. He wants Miller healthy in a year, not skiing on the circuit just for the sake of skiing on the circuit. 'It is an incredibly smart and strategic decision by Bode,' Rearick said. 'He's become legendary for pushing the limits of what is possible on skis, but knows an additional injury to his knee could put the 2014 Olympics in jeopardy. 'At this point, he is not fully recovered to race and has turned his focus to being 100 percent fit for Sochi.' By shutting things down early, Miller won't lose his starting position at World Cup races next season.

Convicted: Jordan Swales, 21, raped and beat an 18-year old woman as he walked her home from a party. The attack was only stopped when three members of the public responded to the victims cries for help . A rapist was arrested by a group of courageous members of the public after they heard his victim's desperate cries for help. Jordan Swales, 21, raped and beat the 18-year-old woman as he accompanied her home from a house party. But in the midst of the violent attack, a couple were joined by another man as they made a citizen's arrest on the rapist while he hid in a bush. At the trial in Manchester Crown Court, Kirsty Normanton, her boyfriend Dean King and a third man Alex Ashworth were commended for their bravery. Swales had attended the same party as his victim on August 16 last year at a flat in Eccles, Salford. He left the party with the young woman, who was a student, and both boarded a tram. After little interaction between the pair on the journey home, Swales offered to walk the woman home. Walking across a grassy area, his behaviour suddenly changed, and he began to rape and strangle the woman. The court heard how the victim 'thought she was going to die' due to the 'significant violence' that Swales was using. Miss Normanton and Mr King were . walking nearby when they heard the girl's cries for help, so Miss Normanton . rang police whilst her boyfriend ran to a nearby house for help. The victim was able to escape when Miss Normanton approached Swales. The attacker ran away and hid in a bush, pretending to be unconscious and saying that he was the victim of an assault and his girlfriend had been raped. When Mr King returned with Mr Ashworth, they grabbed the rapist, detaining him before police arrived. Swales, from Manchester, denied rape but was jailed for eight years. The court heard how the victim, who suffered neck and . facial injuries during the attack, has been 'profoundly affected'. The student now suffers from paranoia, anxiety and has flashbacks of the incident. Her studies have also been affected by the violent attack and the court was told how she is now too afraid to go out at night. Attack: Manchester Crown Court heard how Swales strangled the victim, before running away and hiding in a bush when three people came to the victim's help . Defence counsel Mr Richard Littler said . his client had endured a 'difficult childhood' and was placed in care at the age of eight . after his parents split up. He added: 'He has been passed from pillar to . post through various foster carers. 'He has had little assistance in his . life particularly in childhood, he has had a lack of positive role . models and a lack of supported family environment. There is reference to him using drugs and alcohol in his early years.' But passing sentence Judge Michael . Henshell told Swales: 'You carried out a sustained attack, it was . sudden, impulsive and violent case of rape. 'You told her you were going to kill . her, she said that she couldn't breathe and she struggled even though . that made the attack of rape more violent. 'The attack you were carrying out was . interrupted by members of the public who were nearby and who heard the . victim screaming for help. Kirsty heard screaming and approached the . area where the attack was taking place. 'She was later approached by the . defendant and was made to feel as if she was about to be attacked . herself.' Reserving praise for the members of the public who intervened, the judge added: 'Their actions could have caused them . to be subjected to violence themselves but they persisted in their . actions. 'They all probably saved the victim from further harm and their . actions were highly commendable and they will be commended by the . court.' Swales will be on licence for six . years after he is released from jail and he was ordered to sign the . Sex Offender Register. After the case Detective Constable Jon Weir, of . Greater Manchester Police said: 'I must reserve special praise for all . those members of the public that got involved and who did not ignore the . victim's pleas for help. 'They acted bravely and calmly, met . this dangerous situation head-on and between them detained a rapist and . comforted the victim. Had it not been for their actions the . attack could have been prolonged and the offender may have possibly . even got away with this heinous offence.'","Jordan Swales, 21, jailed for eight years after attacking the student .

Two conmen jailed for a total of 20 years for running Britain’s biggest ever mortgage fraud were ordered to pay back more than £30 million today. Saghir Afzal, 50, fleeced banks out of £49 million by buying cheap properties, including a cowshed and an abandoned air base, and paid crooked chartered surveyor Ian McGarry, 43, to provide false valuations. In June 2011 Afzal was jailed for 13 years and McGarry was locked up for seven years. Today they were ordered to pay back a total of . £30,826,013.86 in one of the largest confiscation orders ever made in . the UK or spend a further 16 years behind bars. Scam artists: Saghir Afzal and Ian McGarry have been ordered to pay back £30m or spend even longer in jail . Between 2004 and 2006 companies controlled by Birmingham-based fraudster Afzal and his brother Nisar, 54, bought six commercial properties for just £5,688,125. McGarry, a director at Dunlop Haywards Lorenz, then provided false valuations in order for the Afzals to deceive lenders into loaning £49,287,000. The Afzal brothers - who sent £26m to Pakistan - bribed McGarry with lavish overseas holidays in Dubai, an Aston Martin car, cash in brown paper envelopes, and the purchase of three properties in London, valued collectively at more than £1m, to aid the massive scam. Saghir continues to deny involvement in the scam and refused to take part in proceedings today. Anger: Saghir denies any involvement in the scam and refused to take part in proceedings at Southwark Crown Court today . Judge Martin Beddoe said: ‘He informs me that he was wholly unaware of the fraud and he was the dupe of two men.’ He said that as a result he had ‘simply no idea’ where the bulk of the money has gone. ‘By me trying to determine what he now has available to him is really trying to pin the tail on the donkey, for all I know Mr Afzal now, as a result of good investment, has assets worth £60m,’ said the judge. ‘But, on the basis he shared the profit of this fraud [with his brother] I have to conclude that that is unlikely.’ The judge ordered that Saghir pay back £29,276,565.91p within six months or face another ten years in jail. The court heard Saghir’s Afzal assets are believed to include property in Birmingham, Pakistan, the US, and Spain, and the £26m that was sent to Pakistan . McGarry was told he must pay back £1,549.447.95 within six months or spend another six years behind bars. Historic: Judge Beddoe laid down one of the biggest confisation orders in history today . He was gifted two properties in Monument, central London, valued at almost £800,000, and a third property in Barnsbury, north London, worth £326,000, by the Afzals on which he earned around £50,000 in rent. The court heard that after his arrest he had attempted to hide large chunks of his criminal earnings. Judge Beddoe said: ‘He did his best to minimalise his offending. ‘He was determined to hold on to as much of those dishonest gains as he can time and again since this enquiry began. ‘On his first arrest he attempted to move the £86,000 he had hidden in London’s Silver Vaults. ‘Second he quickly sold the Porsche for £58,000 and hid the money by transferring it into a bank account set up for the purpose in his wife’s name. ‘After the restraint order was made he diverted money he made as a surveyor into a company ostensibly under the control of his wife.’ He said McGarry’s benefit was £2,792,401.29, but stated that the realisable assets were just over £1.5m. Jailing Saghir Afzal and McGarry last summer Judge Beddoe described the fraud as a ‘massive and carefully orchestrated confidence trick’. Prosecutor Andrew Baillie QC said Nisar Afzal had the ‘productive entrepreneurial role’, while Saghir was involved in the ‘day-to-day management of banking and other financial matters’. McGarry abused his position to provide the false valuations which persuaded the banks that the sites were a good investment. One 183-acre site was a former US Airforce base in Fakenham, Norfolk, now known as Tattersett Business Park. It was purchased for £2.75million before a mortgage of £9.1 million was raised from French bank Sociiti Ginirale through a series of front companies. The bank ‘relied on the property valuation provided by Mr McGarry’, while the fraudsters also created bogus leases suggesting the site was accruing significant income from commercial tenants. In reality the site was near derelict and home to several families of gipsies. The Nationwide Building Society was conned when it lent £26m against a former St Ivel dairy in Johnstown, Carmarthen, Wales; offices known as BIP Popes Lane in Oldbury, West Midlands and the Saltley Industrial Estate in Birmingham. McGarry helped raise a £6.563m loan on Saltley, which was later repossessed and sold for £650,000. The value of St Ivel was inflated to £14.25m when it was really worth £750,000, while the £700,000 BIP premises generated a £6.15m mortgage. The fraudsters also used McGarry’s valuations to obtain £11.5m of loans from Cheshire Building Society for Concentric Works, a 3.5acre site made up of workshop and office units dating back to the 1930s in Aston, Birmingham, and worth nearer £1m. Mr Baillie said the scam had a ‘very significant impact of the financial health of that building society’. ‘Cheshire had to make provision for a loss of £10m which reduced its profit for 2005 from £11.7m to £1.7,’ he told the court. Afzal, of Edgbaston, Birmingham, and McGarry, of St Albans, Hertfordshire, admitted two charges of conspiracy to obtain money transfers by deception and four counts of obtaining money transfers by deception. Nisar Afzal is thought to be in Pakistan and is still wanted by the SFO for his alleged role in the fraud.","Saghir Afzal and Ian McGarry, jailed last year for a total of 20 years, have been told to pay back £30m .

A vicar has been charged with presiding over 492 fake marriages in 16 months - equivalent to one a day. Reverend Nathan Ntege was arrested in June last year following an investigation into sham marriages by the UK Border Agency. The 53-year-old is accused of conducting a string of fake marriages at the St Jude's with St Aidan Church in Thornton Heath, south London, between December 2009 and March 2011. Ntege has been charged with 14 immigration offences, including one offence of conspiracy to facilitate unlawful . immigration and 13 charges of assisting illegal entry in relation to . 492 marriages held at his church. It is believed the border agency's Criminal and Financial Investigation Unit started investigating after a tip off about the vast number of marriages conducted at the church. Ntege, who is originally from Uganda but . lives in Croydon, appeared at Croydon Magistrates' Court on Wednesday . along with his 79-year-old verger, Brian Miller, of Selsdon, south . London, who faces the same charges. The pair spoke only to confirm their names and were bailed ahead of a hearing at Croydon Crown Court on Friday. Gilena Petkova, 50, has also been charged in relation to the alleged offences. She is accused of being a 'fixer' for fake weddings and was allegedly married in a sham service. Petkova has been charged with conspiracy and five charges of assisting illegal entry and is due to appear at Camberwell Green JPs on February 7. Claire Holder, a lawyer for the Crown Prosecution Service, said last week there was 'sufficient evidence and it is in the public interest' to prosecute the three. The alleged fake marriages took place St Jude's with St Aidan Church in Thornton Heath, London, pictured . Ntege was bailed on condition that he does not attend St Jude's, officiate at a religious building or service and or apply for travel documents.

A group of pensioners have been banned from holding a singalong concert at their local community centre – unless they hire security. The event was organised by 78-year-old Alma Morris to raise funds to help save the threatened  venue. She wanted a bar so some of the 100-plus elderly guests could enjoy a sherry but was told by council officials that, if alcohol was involved, she would need two bouncers. The former caretaker, from Sandyford, . Staffordshire, said: ‘I don’t know what they think might happen in a . room full of pensioners – it’s ludicrous. 'Never had anything like this before': Tom Simpson, from the Sandyford and Goldenhill Residents' Association is amazed by the local council's demand to charge organisers for two bouncers a pensioner event at Goldenhill Community Hall . ‘We just wanted to put on a nice night of singing. ‘Some people like to have a drink at these things but there is certainly not going to be any binge-drinking going on.’ The decision has angered residents . because Stoke-on-Trent Council has pledged to support them in their . attempts to take over local community halls. Mrs Morris said booking Goldenhill . Community Hall would cost £120 before paying an extra £100 for security – . eating straight into any potential profit. She added: ‘It is coming straight out of people’s pockets and those security men will have the easiest shift ever.’ The council said it would make a final decision on the security guards after looking over profit and loss margins. Eric Jankowski, 82, said: ‘It's not about ticking boxes but making a sensible decision. A load of OAPs in their 70s and 80s are hardly likely to go wild are they? We just want to have fun like everyone else. ‘Now it seems that some jobsworths are, as usual, spoiling the party. It's such a shame that people don't seem to have any common sense anymore. For health and safety: Organisers have since cancelled the event, which was raising money for an under threat elderly day home, because they cannot afford the 'ludicrous' fee on top of a £120 hall booking fee . Denise Harding, 72, said: ‘They don't have doormen or bouncers on the door at my local pub when my son takes me on Thursday afternoons and they have a bar there. ‘Why does the community centre need one? It doesn't make any sense to me.’ Tom Simpson, 55, who is secretary of Sandyford and Goldenhill Residents' Association, said: ‘If they were organising drunken booze-ups then I could understand but not with fund-raising events like this one. ‘I think the council needs to consider every event on merit and it is hard to fathom why they have to pay extra for security. ‘The bar staff are already city council employees. I'm sure if there was a problem they would be capable of calling the police. We have never had anything like that happen before.’ Peter Price, the council's resident director of services, said that he and Councillor Ruth Rosenau would make a final decision on the security guards after looking over the profit and loss margin in the coming months and a council spokesman confirmed it was investigating the matter. Mr Price said: ‘I think the additional cost is going to deter people from booking the venue. It is almost double what it will cost for the hall and they are out-pricing themselves.’ Speaking about the closures, he said: ‘We need to establish whether community halls are going to be financially sustainable for the future. ‘In times of financial hardship, the funding that we have as a city council will mean we have to go through some very difficult decisions.’ Yesterday other party-going pensioners who were expected to attend the bash reacted with shock to the ruling. Ethel Boreham, 82, from Stoke-on-Trent, said: 'They might have needed the bouncers if I was going out 60 years ago, but not any more. We're not really the rowdiest of bunches.. 'Most of the girl's will just sit there knitting, no doubt. Either that or a crossword. 'The only thing I might need a bouncer for is helping me up when my dodgy knees go at the end of the night.' Her husband Ron , 84, a retired delivery driver, added: 'I can't imagine it is ever going to kick off there really. 'Why on earth do they require doormen for a little fund-raiser at a community centre. It is absolutely bizarre. 'What do they think we are going to get up to? Our days of round-the-clock parties are long gone.'","Organisers were hoping to raise money for a elderly day home under threat .

The robot, otherwise known as R2, is the seventh member of the crew of the Space Station and is undergoing rigorous testing by NASA. Using remote commands beamed up from Earth the Robonaut was instructed to operate a set of valves on a task board. Scroll down to video . Robonaut was instructed remotely to operate valves using a taskboard. Eventually it is hoped that the robot will take over the most dangerous, mundane or tricky jobs from the human crew members. It was launched into space on the space shuttle in February 2011 and has been subjected to a series of tests to establish its spaceworthiness. Among the skills it is being tested for is its ability to work in a vacuum or when there is heavy vibration. Robonaut was developed by NASA with General Motors and Oceaneering Space Systems at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. Its development is expected to lead to improvements and new products not just  for space exploration but many other industries, including cars and aeroplanes. Designers constructed the robot to be dexterous and to mimic the human body shape so that it can use the same controls and tools as the other crew members of the International Space Station. It weighs 21 stones and its powerful arms are two feet eight inches long and are powerful enough to carry 20 pounds each in Earth’s gravity.

Police today have today released CCTV footage that allegedly shows the brother of former EastEnders actress Gemma McCluskie disposing of her body. The Old Bailey agreed to release the footage which allegedly shows Tony McCluskie taking her body in a suitcase and dumping it in a canal, is tried for murdering his sister. He told the court he had no recollection of killing her or dismembering her and disposing of her corpse. The 35-year-old said the last thing he remembered was grabbing his sister’s wrists as she wielded a knife at him and threatened to stab him on March 1 last year. He admits killing Miss McCluskie but denies murder, saying he has no recollection of what happened after he grabbed her. Scroll down for video . This CCTV footage, shown in court today, allegedly shows Tony McCluskie disposing of the body of his sister Gemma in a suitcase . Gemma's dismembered torso was discovered in a suitcase and her limbs in plastic bags. Her head was discovered six months later and she was identified from dental records . Miss McCluskie’s torso was found in a suitcase in the Regent’s Canal in east London, followed by her limbs in plastic bags. Her head was found six months later. The 29-year-old, who played Kerry Skinner, the niece of Ethel Skinner, in the BBC soap in 2001, was officially identified by dental records. At her brother’s murder trial at the Old Bailey, the prosecution has said pot-smoking McCluskie bludgeoned his sister to death in the flat they shared after a row about an overflowing sink. McCluskie, 35, today told the jury he had left a tap on early in the morning of March 1, 2012, sparking an argument and prompting his sister to call him later in the day and demand that he move out. The Metropolitan Police released the footage today with the permission of the court. The trial is currently underway . When they were both later back in the house in Pelter Street, Shoreditch, east London, the argument continued and his sister came at him with a knife, he said. McCluskie, wearing a tie and glasses, told the court she had threatened to stab him, his on-off partner Terri Arnull, and to make sure Ms Arnull’s son, who he viewed as his own, was taken into care. 'She started screaming and shouting at me, again calling me all the names: p****, w*****, c***, junkie,” he told the court. 'Calling me all the names, you know, saying that I should go and stay round Terri’s for a while. She just wanted me out the house. 'I kept on saying to her that I wouldn’t be leaving the house.

He said he walked upstairs, and called his sister to come and look at the bathroom. 'She came up the stairs, she was shouting, ‘are you gonna go, are you gonna go, are you gonna go?’. 'I turned round and she was standing there with a knife in her hand.' Actress: Gemma appeared as Kerry Skinner in 30 episodes of EastEnders back in 2001 .

'I got very angry, I just couldn’t believe what I was hearing,' McCluskie told the court. 'All I remember is just grabbing her wrists. After that I have no recollection.' He told the court the next thing he remembered was waking up the Saturday after his sister’s death on the Thursday. McCluskie said he had no recollection of killing her, dismembering her, or clearing up afterwards. He has admitted killing Ms McCluskie and has pleaded guilty to manslaughter, but denies murder. He said: 'I accept what I have done . is wrong, I take responsibility for what I have done to my sister, but . it was never my intention to cause her any serious harm, let alone cause . her death.'

Nike-made victory shirts proudly worn by the U.S. women's soccer team after their gold medal win against Japan last night have caused a backlash from critics. After winning 2-1, the U.S team returned to the field wielding the American flag while wearing big smiles, and T-shirts with slogans that read 'Greatness Has Been Found.' Critics, viewers and fans across the globe cringed, panning the 'tacky', 'humility-lacking' and 'graceless' shirts on Twitter. Greatness has been found: The victory Nike shirts proudly worn by the U.S. women's soccer team after their gold medal win against Japan last night has caused a worldwide backlash . Jerrad Peters, a soccer writer for . Canada's The Score, wrote: 'USA players have donned t-shirts reading . ""Greatness has been found."" That, in a nutshell, is why no one outside . the US likes them.' But for a beloved team, widely viewed as America's own wonder women, the criticisms may be seen as a case of sour grapes towards a country currently charging ahead in medal counts. Canada's loss to the U.S. women's soccer team on Monday caused its own fair share of controversy, after the referee made several calls toward the end of the second half that left the Canadians not just heartbroken, but angry, according to the Toronto Star. Forward Melissa Tancredi said: 'I couldn’t believe what happened. That was our game. That was our win. And it was just taken away.' Christine Sinclair, who scored all . three of Canada's goals, added: 'We feel like we didn’t lose, we feel . like it was taken from us.' MailOnline commenters have weighed in on the debate, with Rosie from Bootle, England, writing: 'For gods sake, Canada just seem like sore losers to me. 'Why can Usian Bolt act like the most arrogant, cocky, full of himself and rude man on earth, but a bunch of talented football players can't wear some t-shirts? Foolishness, probably because they're women. Besides, I'm English, and I like them.' Loud and proud: After winning 2-1, the U.S team returned to the field wielding the American flag, big smiles and T-shirts with slogans that read 'Greatness Has Been Found,' critics, viewers and fans to cringe . Celebration: The Olympic display of victory shirts with such a definitive slogan has been labelled by commentators as tacky with a blatant disregard for sportsmanship . However America's . own Ben Rothenberg, a sports writer for the New York Times, also appeared offended by the teams' Nike victory shirts. He tweeted: . '""Greatness has been found,"" but not humility. Gross.' Members of the team were handed the . shirts immediately after their win, a common ritual for big victories in American team sports. Was the U.S. women's soccer team justified in wearing victory T-shirts? After the Super Bowl and NCAA basketball title games, for example, the winning teams will sport victory gear usually branded with the generic 'Champions'. However the Olympic display of victory shirts with such a definitive slogan has been labelled by commentators as tacky with a blatant disregard for sportsmanship. Sports Illustrated's Courtney Nguyen tweeted: 'Put those t-shirts away, USA. Keep it classy.' While no-one has blamed the women on . the team for wearing shirts they were handed, many are angry at the . 'go-betweens' for Nike and the U.S team. The San Fransisco Chronicle wrote: 'They should have realized the way those shirts could have been perceived.

'If people who were rooting for . the women’s soccer team found them off-putting, imagine the reaction of . the rest of world.' The gold-winning team's victory shirts isn't the only celebratory symbol that has raised eyebrows during this year's Olympics, however. During a game against New Zealand, the U.S. women's soccer team capped its victories with cartwheels, front flips and a team rendition of the ""worm"" - sometimes even during the middle of the game. New Zealand coach Tony Readings, after her team's 2-0 loss, said: 'I wouldn't like it if our team did that. We try to work on scoring goals. We haven't got time to work on celebrations.' Tennis star Serena Williams celebrated her Olympic gold with a 'Crip Walk' - a dance that originated with the Los Angeles street gang and later spread around the world. While her sister Venus, sitting in the stands, looked delighted, Wimbledon, the very proper home of the All-England Lawn Tennis Association, had never seen anything like it, and a few commentators were not amused.

"By . Louise Boyle . UPDATED: . 21:39 EST, 22 January 2013 . A former University of Virginia lacrosse . player, sentenced to 23 years in prison for beating to death  his . ex-girlfriend, launched an appeal today. Attorneys for George W Huguely V filed a petition with the Virginia Court of Appeals on Tuesday arguing that constitutional and procedural errors entitle the 24-year-old to a new trial. Huguely, of Maryland, was convicted of second-degree murder in the May 2010 slaying of 22-year-old Yeardley Love. Appeal: Convicted killer George Huguely V's lawyers said he was not given a fair trial in documents filed today in Virginia . Yearbook: Yeardley, 22 at the time of . her death, and ex-boyfriend Huguely had just broken up when he admitted . to breaking into her dorm and shaking her aggressively so that her head . slammed into the wall . She was found dead in her Charlottesville, Virginia bedroom where Huguely confronted her after a day of heavy drinking. The petition argues that Huguely was . denied the right to his chosen lawyer, the right to a fair and impartial . jury and other violations. Virginia has 30 days to respond to the petition. George W. Huguely V was sentenced on . August 30 last year after Miss Love, from Baltimore, was found face down . in her blood-soaked pillow on May 3, 2010. Authorities . said the 24-year-old defendant left his on-again, off-again girlfriend . to die after he kicked a hole in her bedroom door and physically . confronted her about their sputtering two-year relationship. Police said he had been drinking heavily that day. The jury found the Maryland man guilty last February of second-degree murder and grand larceny. The defense had sought a 14-year sentence, which was disregarded. The final decision came after a lengthy court battle, which included testimony from Roman Catholic priest Rev. Joseph Scrodo who said that he had visited Huguely weekly in jail since the May 2010 slaying of Miss Love. Self-inflicted: Huguely told police after her death that Yeardley banged her own head against the wall . The priest he said the 'wild, out-of-control' person that Huguely has been portrayed as is not the man he knows. Earlier, prosecution witnesses described Huguely beating a man who went home with Miss Love after a party. A woman also testified he angrily put his hands around her neck. Huguely and Love, both seniors and varsity lacrosse players at UVA, had a volatile relationship that spiraled into Huguely's deadly confrontation with Love late on the night of May 2, 2010, after a day of heavy drinking and golfing by Huguely. Love was found the next morning, her battered face in a blood-soaked pillow. In a police interrogation video played at his trial, Huguely admitted he and Love had a physical confrontation over their on-again, off-again two-year relationship but he denied inflicting the fatal injuries Love suffered. He said she had banged her head against her bedroom wall. A coroner concluded she died of blunt force trauma. Love's death followed several months of tension between the two young athletes. Former teammates and friends testified that each accused the other of infidelity and they described incidents of Huguely's escalating drinking. The grand larceny conviction stems from Huguely's theft of Love's computer from her apartment. Talented: Yeardley was a star lacrosse player at the University of Virginia and was just weeks away from graduating when she was murdered . Support: Sharon Love, mother of Yeardley, and . sister Lexie Love, far left, leave court last year . Threat: Prosecutors told the jury that Huguely sent Yeardley Love (centre) an email before she died saying: 'I should have killed you' Love's mother, Sharon Love, has filed two lawsuits seeking nearly $60million. One is aimed at Huguely while the other claims U.Va. and athletic department officials and coaches ignored Huguely's drinking and violent behavior. Huguely was arrested in Lexington in 2008 after a drunken confrontation with a police officer. Love's death has had a lasting impact in Virginia and at the university. It's easier now for abuse victims in Virginia to get a restraining order and students must tell the university if they have ever been arrested. School officials and students also have tried to make the culture on campus one in which people look out for each other and aren't afraid to report relationship violence.

As parents enjoyed a Sunday lie-in, children watching the CBeebies channel saw a character called Max presenting a Top Of The Pops-style programme. He wore a blond wig and gold neck-lace, and did a good impression of Savile’s Yorkshire accent and distinctive speaking style. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . The BBC has apologised after a costume version of Jimmy Savile appeared on the Cbeebies show Tweenies . The character was presenting a Top Of The Pops-style show on the children's programme . The offending Tweenies episode was made in 2001, but blundering schedulers repeated it at 8.30am yesterday. It was shown days after police said . the predatory DJ, who molested children in his BBC dressing room in the . 1970s, was one of the country’s worst ever sex offenders.

Gender gap: Working mothers earn 21% less than men the report says, while the cost of childcare can almost wipe out the benefit of returning to work . Mothers who work full-time earn 21 per cent less than men, a report revealed yesterday. But even women without children are victims of Britain’s gender pay gap. On average, they earn 7 per cent less than men in full-time jobs, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said. ‘Women pay a high price for motherhood,’ the leading international think-tank warned. It also pointed to the crippling cost of childcare in Britain, which can almost wipe out the benefit of a mother returning to work. The study looked at the gender gap in pay between men and women who are 25 to 44, the typical age at which parents are having and raising young children. In the UK, the pay gap between men and women with a full-time job triples from 7 per cent before starting a family to 21 per cent once a woman has children. The OECD report follows a recent study that found the average woman in a senior role will earn £425,000 less during her career than a man doing the same job. Women are also less likely to get a bonus and more likely to be made redundant, the Chartered Management Institute said. The OECD report said the cost of childcare is so high in Britain that it eats up nearly half the salary of a parent earning a lower wage. This is much higher than in most other countries – in Sweden it is 7 per cent, in Norway 12 per cent and in Germany 23 per cent. To add to the pressure on British families, more than two-thirds of the salary that is left after paying for childcare is ‘effectively taxed away’. This is ‘well above’ the 52 per cent average among the 34 countries in the OECD. According to the Daycare Trust, it costs an average of £206 to put a child under two into a nursery for 50 hours a week in England, an increase of more than a third in the past seven years. Warning: Daycare Trust chief executive Anand Shukla has said the childcare system is in need of major reform . Anand Shukla, chief executive of Daycare Trust, said: ‘Some families are no better off when the mother returns to work after maternity leave. Ministers say that work should always pay and they are changing the benefits system to make this happen. ‘But the childcare system also needs major reform as the cost is forcing parents to turn down jobs or end up in hardship.’","Study reveals the true extent of the gender pay gap in Britain .

"By . Kerry Mcqueeney . UPDATED: . 08:46 EST, 30 November 2011 . Scrap-metal thieves are now targeting Britain's roads, plunging entire sections of motorways and dual carriageways into darkness because street lighting cables have been stolen. Motorists' lives are being put at serious risk as they are forced to negotiate highways without any lighting or - in some cases - crucial . road signs. The thieves have turned their attention to roads after . plundering the country's rail network for copper cables which are highly . valuable on world markets. Crimewave: There are serious concerns that scrap-metal theft is putting drivers' lives at risk with sections of highways being plunged into darkness . Transport Minister Norman Baker told MPs the thefts were now affecting Britain's entire transport network. He said: 'It's now a major problem and it's very serious for the rail industry, for passengers and for industry. 'This problem transcends the railway. It has affected motorways, the coastguard and the telecoms industry. 'The . level of theft tends to follow the price of copper and other metals on . world markets.' New legislation might be required to deal with the 'major problem' of cable theft on the railways, Mr Baker added. The British Transport Police (BTP) now regards cable theft, which had resulted in severe delays to . passenger services, as second only to terrorism in its list of . priorities, he told the House of Commons Transport Committee. Mr Baker said: 'BTP has indicated that it . would be helpful to have new powers. There is a general concern, which I . am very happy to share, that the legislation in place isn't designed . for the spate of thefts we are seeing.' 'Major concern': Transport Minister Norman Baker . Mr Baker said that no options had been ruled out, including a possible change to the 1964 Scrap Metal Dealers Act. He said that the rail industry had . initially taken the view that it was best not to publicise cable theft . to try to avoid 'copy-cat activities'. Earlier this week it was revealed how the crimewave had become so bad that undercover police units were travelling on railways in the dead of night to catch scrap-metal thieves red-handed. The . locomotives – dubbed ghost trains – travel with their lights dimmed and . their engines muffled to allow specialist officers, equipped with . infrared cameras, to catch unsuspecting criminals in the act. The . tactic is aimed at countering the metal theft crimewave that has caused . chaos for rail passengers. In the past seven months alone, 1,969 trains . have been cancelled because of 675 copper cable thefts across the . network. Last month a stretch of a dual carriageway more than a mile long in Leeds suffered a blackout after more than £200,000 of street lighting cable was stolen. Police believe the thieves posed as workmen and engineers as they targeted the section of the A63 link road, leaving the half-mile sections of the highway in complete darkness. Road safety experts also said vital road signs were vanishing from dangerous bends. 'You also have to take into account warning signs being stolen. If this happens on a bend, it can be really dangerous' Andrew Howard, head of road safety at the AA . Andrew Howard, head of road safety at the AA, told the Telegraph: 'You also have to take into account warning signs being stolen. 'If this happens on a bend, it can be really dangerous. On a remote road in  North Yorkshire, for example, you would expect chevron signs and if that is not there it is much more worrying.' Meanwhile Mr Baker told the committee that a newly-formed cross-ministerial group had already met twice to discuss the problem and has looked at what could be done to issue new guidance to the Environment Agency in terms of looking at scrapyards receiving rail cable. Mr Baker added that Network Rail (NR) was looking to bury cables in particularly vulnerable areas and making sure that cables were properly marked so they could more easily identified if they turned up at scrapyards. He also told MPs that it was hoped that NR could keep cable theft-caused disruption to train services to a minimum. The committee's chairman Louise Ellman MP said that NR had said that cable theft had cost the railways £43 million over the last three years, plus costing the general economy about £16-20 million a year.","Criminals move on to roads after ransacking the rail network .

But all may not be as it seems as a number of private islands languish on the market and experts warn that some buyers are realizing that the hassle of living on one is more than it is worth. There are now 600 islands up for sale around the world, according to experts, from the Caribbean to the chillier waters of northern Scotland, ranging in price from $50,000 to $100 million. The number of isles on the market has jumped three-fold since 2006. A number of stunning island properties have also been on the market for some time. The spectacular Petra Island near New York City has been for sale for years, and comes complete with a stunning home designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. The price is only available on request. Allen Island off the coast of Washington state first appeared on the market for $25m in 2005 and the owners are now asking $13.5m. Island broker Farhad Vladi told The Sunday Times: 'Some celebrities are getting out of the the market as quickly as they can.' But any dampening of enthusiasm from buyers has not deterred realtors, as this summer more stunning island homes have hit the market including Florida's Little Bokeelia island which is on sale for $29.5million. It appears that the rich and famous who stump up the millions required for their own Robinson Crusoe experience, haven't bargained for trouble in paradise - which often includes no electricity, bureaucratic red tape, endangered species and exorbitant maintenance costs. Lap of luxury: Petra Island, '15 minutes by helicopter' from New York City, has languished on the property market for years despite having buildings designed by Frank Lloyd Wright . Suitable for a Bond villain: The price of Petra Island is only available on request (but if you need to ask, you probably can't afford it) Rocking pad: Petra Island has a 1,200-square-foot cottage completed in 1949 to the specifications of the legendary designer Frank Lloyd Wright . Quirky: The homes on 11-acre Petra Island incorporate stone, cement and mahogany and are considered architectural masterpieces . British TV presenter Ben Fogle has also warned of the dangers of island ownership. 'A lot of people get seduced by the island dream without thinking of the realities,' he told The Times. He said people forget about the high maintenance costs of islands - including the large amount of rubbish being washed ashore. Some 12,000 islands have been put up for sale in the past 100 years - but only one thousand have been fully developed to make for comfortable living. Problems include establishing power to remote locations, dealing with off-season storm damage, wild animals and untamed jungle or forest. Endangered species take precedence over indulged celebrity owners. The . lack of amenities to create the luxury to which they have become . accustomed, appears to have been a stumbling block for several super-rich . island owners. Nicolas Cage got rid of his $3million . Leaf Cay in the Bahamas after an endangered reptile put paid to his . hopes for a luxury home. Singer Celine Dion is reportedly trying to sell her island in Canada for close to $30million - although hers does come with a French-style chateau thrown in. And following the amicable split of Johnny Depp and Vanessa Paradis, Little Halls Pond Cay in the Bahamas could be on the market after it was reported that neither party was interested in keeping the idyllic spot. Microsoft . billionaire Paul Allen discovered that all the technology in the world . didn't make it any easier to have his island near Seattle fitted with . electricity. Allan . Island was bought in 1992 by Allen and is currently on the market for . around $13million for which a buyer will get 292 acres, an airstrip, . dock and luxury log cabin.

Little Hawkins Island, Georgia has been heavily developed with a . spacious home featuring wraparound porches, swimming pool and dock - . although it is reflected in the price tag of $20million. Petra Island, a 15-minute jaunt from New York City (if you have a helicopter that is), has been on the market for several years. The 11-acre island has two properties designed by the celebrated Frank Lloyd Wright incorporating mahogany, cement and stone into the striking structures. A cottage was finished in 1949 while the larger, 5,000 sq ft residence was completed in 2007 from drawings. The price of Petra Island is only available on request (but if you need to ask, you probably can't afford it).

"By . Rachel Quigley . UPDATED: . 17:38 EST, 27 June 2011 . Author: Peter Moskos advocates flogging over jail time in his new book . A U.S. academic has written a book advocating the benefits of flogging over sending criminals to prison. Peter Moskos' book, In Defence of Flogging, outlines the advantages of sentencing criminals to flogging over sending them to jail which, he argues, is an ineffective and cruel form of punishment. Mr Moskos - who teaches at John Jay College of Criminal Justice - is not advocating the medieval punishment in order to get tougher on criminals but actually the opposite - he believes that the criminal justice system is actually too cruel. In his book, he reminds readers that there are currently 2.3 million inmates incarcerated in barbaric conditions. American prisons are bleak and violent, and sexual assault is rampant, he said. He said it is while inside prison that inmates learn more about committing crime rather than become penitent and turn towards better lives. According to Time magazine, Mr Moskos argues that convicts should be given a choice - jail time or two lashes for every year of their sentence. He says that by choosing the latter, convicts would be able to replace soul-crushing years behind bars with intense but short-lived physical pain. When the flogging was over, they could get on with their lives. Punishment: A convicted rapist and murderer is flogged in Iran in 2005 before he was hanged for his crimes . Whip: Flogging was widely used in the 19th century in America until the fifties though it is still used in some parts of the world . Speaking about flogging in an interview with Salon, he said: 'Flogging should horrify people. But taking away a significant chunk of . someone’s life is far worse than any punishment that is virtually . instantaneous. 'We should be honest about prison and recognize that we’re . sentencing people to years of confinement and torture. But we don’t do . that. We still have this hogwash about prison being good for the soul. 'Deep down I think we all understand that no one leaves prison in a . better position than they went in.' Book: The Defence of Flogging is already proving to be controversial . He is not, of course, suggesting that rapists and murderers be allowed to walk the streets but that this option should be offered to those charged with lesser crimes, something he believes would decrease the prison population from 2.3million to 300,000. Serious criminals should spend the rest of their lives in jail, he said. According to Time magazine, the 'lash' was used against slaves and common criminals throughout the 1800s but was used right up until 1952 in America when Delaware administered 20 lashes to a convicted burglar. In other countries it was used even more recently. In 1994, an American teenager named Michael Fay was convicted of spray-painting cars in Singapore and was flogged as part of his punishment. Fay's ordeal received intense media attention, with the number of lashes being reduced from six to four after President Clinton appealed. But as Mr Moskos notes in his book, a newspaper poll in Dayton, Ohio, where Fay's father lived, found that respondents supported the punishment by a 2-1 margin, and at a time of rising juvenile crime, many Americans seemed to echo that sentiment. Mr Moskos argues that when corporal punishment was outlawed and imprisonment became the justice system's primary tool, almost immediately the penitential system ran aground. He said that far from repenting, the confinement and boredom made the prisoners crazy. He argues that prisons are 'vast, inhumane, ineffectual, and incoherent'. 'I can't think of another institution,' he writes, 'that has failed as mightily as the prison has.' The academic has also written a book on using electric shocks to punish criminals.",Peter Moskos argues that convicts should be given the choice of jail time or two lashes for every year of sentence .

A woman who suffers from one of the world's worst cases of gigantism has finally stopped growing thanks to aggressive new treatment. Tanya Angus, 33, from Las Vegas, stands at nearly 7ft tall and weighs 400lbs having suffered from the rare pituitary disorder acromegaly for over a decade. Efforts to treat the condition, that causes the body to produce too much growth hormone, remained unsuccessful until now, and Ms Angus, who was a slender 5ft 8 and 130lbs at the age of 21, continued to grow. Rare disorder: Tanya Angus was a slender 5ft 8 and 130lbs as a teenager, pictured here in 1995 (left). By 2010 (right), she was 6ft 6in and 480lbs. Only now have doctors successfully managed to cease her growth . Over the past year, however, Ms Angus . has been treated with a new drug, that has finally helped regulate her . growth hormone levels. Acromegaly, . which affects 20,000 people in the U.S., is usually caused by a . non-cancerous tumour on the pituitary gland. Ms Angus has undergone . radiation and surgery three times in an effort to have hers removed, . but, as it is wrapped around her carotid artery, it has proved too . difficult. If left untreated, acromegaly can be life-threatening, as it causes organs such as the heart and lungs to grow along with height and weight. Sufferers are at higher risk of . developing diabetes and high blood pressure, while the pressure on their . joints causes swelling and early onset of osteoarthritis. New treatment: The 33-year-old, from Las Vegas, has finally stopped growing at nearly 7ft tall, having struggled to find a way to halt the effects of her acromegaly for over a decade . Dr. Laurence Katznelson, professor of medicine and neurosurgery at . Stanford University Hospital in California, told ABC: 'Their mortality rate is two to four times greater than the general . population.' Describing the symptoms of acromegaly, which is not hereditary, Dr Katznelson said: 'Everything gets thicker and the facial features become abnormal.' Ms Angus, for now, is thrilled by the improvement in her condition. She told KTNV: 'This is such good news.' Change: Photographs of Ms Angus ages 17 (left) and 31 (right) reveal how acromegaly has affected her face . Healthier times: Before her acromegaly diagnosis, Ms Angus was a keen horserider . Her mother, Karen Strutynski added: 'This gives us renewed hope.' Despite the improvement in her condition, Ms Angus's acromegaly has taken a serious toll on her health. She can barely walk and is in . constant pain when she does - the only place she feels relief is a . swimming pool, where the pressure on her joints is eased. One surgery caused a stroke that severely damaged her hearing, another 13-hour procedure nearly killed her. Helping hands: Ms Angus pictured with her medical team and her mother (in white) in 2010 . It is a far cry from Ms Angus as a . energetic 21-year-old, a keen horse-rider who loved dancing. Then 5ft . 8in and 130lbs, she began to notice that her clothes no longer fit her, . and her hands had become enlarged. Renewed hope: Ms Angus's mother, Karen Strutynski . 'She was perfectly normal, but by age 22 she had grown three inches,' her mother revealed. 'Nobody knew what was going on.' Ms Angus, who had been working as a supervisor at a Walmart in Michigan, was fired from her post when her head grew larger, and was dumped by her boyfriend when his parents questioned whether she was a man. Not long afterwards, in 2002, she moved home to Las Vegas where a doctor quickly diagnosed her acromegaly. Though she admits her appearance upsets her, Ms Angus hopes to inspire others with the same condition - indeed, she already receives many messages of support. 'I read emails that people send in saying, ""You're my inspiration,"" or, ""You are so strong,""' she told ABC. 'If I am helping other people, I feel I can do anything.'

Record executive and producer David Geffen finalized a deal last week to buy the luxury penthouse apartment owned by socialite Denise Rich on Manhattan's Upper East Side for record-smashing $54million. Rich, 68, the Grammy-nominated songwriter who renounced her American passport in November, was originally asking $65million for the stunning 12,000 square-foot Fifth Avenue dwelling, but settled for a sum nearly 17 per cent lower than her asking price, according to the Wall Street Journal. Still, the deal marks the highest price ever paid for a co-op in Manhattan, according to Jonathan Miller, president at Miller Samuel Real Estate Appraisers & Consultants. Moving on up: Media mogul David Geffen has just bought the seven bedroom, 11 bathroom penthouse on Fifth Avenue owned by Denise Rich . Grand views: The co-op offers a sweeping panorama of Grand Army Plaza and Central park . Shiny new beginnings: There are marble floors and 11-ft ceilings throughout . New and old: DreamWorks founder David Geffen, left, reportedly purchased Denise Rich's home for $54million; he currently lives one floor below in the exclusive Fifth Avenue co-op . By dumping her U.S. passport, Rich will likely save tens of millions of dollars or more in U.S. taxes over the long haul, tax lawyers say. However, she will still have to pay exit tax on her penthouse. It is a matter of much speculation that . the wealthy Ms Rich left the States so as not to pay any income tax - if . that is the case, than she can afford a few million dollars loss. The New York Post’s Page Six exclusively reported the massive sale, noting that Geffen already lives in the building and will likely spend two years renovating the space. Geffen’s apartment is directly below the one he just purchased. Sources tell Page Six that Geffen plans on selling his old place rather than combining the two properties. The penthouse sits on Fifth Avenue, right outside of Grand Army Plaza, the Plaza Hotel, and Central Park. The Corcoran listing for the apartment calls it ‘the epitome of luxury and grandeur.’ Complete with 11ft ceilings and custom mahogany doors, the apartment boasts seven bedrooms and 11 baths, as well a library, two fireplaces, and wraparound terraces. The plush apartment offers sweeping views of the city, all the way across Central Park and to Columbus Circle. The dining room, which is off of the chef’s kitchen, can seat 22, and leads to one of three terraces.

Dream big: The Master Suite has two bathrooms and closets galore . Gutted: Rich had a professional recording studio in her home; it is reported that the DreamWorks founder will likely tear it out . The incredible space also has two kitchens, a full gym, and a professional recording studio that was used by Rich. Page Six reports that the DreamWorks founder will likely tear it out. But aside from the $54million price tag, Geffen will have to pay a monthly maintenance fee of $25,000. Rich has written songs recorded by Aretha Franklin, Mary J. Blige and Jessica Simpson, and Mandy Moore, to name a few. When she listed the apartment in January, Rich told the Post that she had outgrown the space, as her daughters had recently moved out. ‘My greatest hope is that the next family loves and enjoys this home as much as we did.’ She now plans to live in London, it is said, and is a frequent habitué of Cannes, Monte Carlo, and St. Tropez, often sailing to each port on her 157-ft yacht, Lady Joy. Dining in style: This is one of two kitchens in the co-op, complete with granite counter tops and stainless tell appliances .

According to Page Six, Geffen threatened to . take Rich to court after her Jacuzzi flooded, soaking parts of Geffen’s . apartment. She later settled with him out of court. Geffen, . 69, is a stalwart in the media world, with properties both in New York . and Malibu. He is the proud owner of a 453-foot yacht called the Rising . Sun, which he bought from Larry Ellison. He expanded his maritime collection after he reportedly purchased one of Roman Abramovich’s yachts, the 377-foot Pelorus, for $300million. Forbes ranks the University of Texas dropout’s net worth at $5.5billion. He began his career sorting mail at the William Morris talent agency, the magazine reports, and worked his way up from there. He parted ways from his much younger boyfriend, Jeremy Lingvall in February, the Post said. Lingvall, 28, is a graduate of the University of Santa Barbara.

Children are being exposed to banned artificial food colourings that can trigger hyperactivity –because they are still in medicines prescribed by GPs. The damaging E numbers are no longer in most sweets, but the restrictions do not extend to many medicines designed for children. Drugs which include the substances include banana-flavoured penicillin to treat infections and an antibiotic which contains a red food colouring. Under EU law, all products containing the additives must carry a health warning because of their links to hyperactivity and attention problems. But although they are banned in the US, Australia and across Europe, the UK’s Food Standards Agency implemented a voluntary ban only in 2008 that asked the industry to remove the additives. Most have complied, but many medicines still use them. Gem Durham, from Birmingham, discovered the additives in banana-flavoured liquid penicillin prescribed to daughter Elizabeth, three, to treat a throat infection. Mrs Durham, 34, said: ‘As soon as Elizabeth started taking it she was dancing around and singing silly songs. There was no talking to her and she was incapable of listening to instruction. ‘I read the packet and saw it contained the bright yellow colour E104 Quinine. I phoned the GP and asked for an alternative, but it contained E124 Ponceau 4R red colouring. ‘If sweet manufacturers can use natural colourings, why can’t the pharmaceutical industry? A child needs to rest if they’re ill, not effectively be drugged up twice.’ A spokeswoman for the FSA  said: ‘The agency encourages manufacturers to work towards finding alternatives to these colours.’","Drugs such as banana-flavoured penicillin can contain them .

An archaeologist in Belize has sued the makers of the Indiana Jones movies, alleging that the latest and final film of the franchise made millions off an actual artifact he believes was stolen nearly a century ago. Dr Jaime Awe, the director of the Institute of Archaeology of Belize, claims that the ancient object featured prominently in 2008's Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is a direct facsimile of an actual artifact. Dr Awe is a noted professor of archaeology and an adventurer like the real Indiana Jones, famously played by Harrison Ford onscreen. Stolen? Dr Jaime Awe claims that the ancient object featured prominently in 2008's Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is based on an actual artifact that originated in Belize . Despite the use of the skull's likeness, the nation of Belize - where Dr Awe claims the skull came from - was not given a cent of the film's . profits, which totaled nearly $800million worldwide. The lawsuit, filed in Chicago on December 5, states that Dr Awe is acting on behalf of Belize, according to The Hollywood Reporter. The Walt Disney Company and George Lucas' Lucasfilm are listed among the defendants in the suit. In it, Dr Awe claims the crystal skull was stolen from Belize 88 years ago by the treasure-hunting Mitchell-Hedges family. There are three other crystal skulls on earth, and they are displayed at the British Museum in London. Along with unspecified damages, Dr Awe demands that the skull be returned to Belize, according to The Hollywood Reporter.

Older people taking aspirin have double the risk of an eye disease that can cause blindness . Older people taking aspirin have double the risk of an eye disease that can cause blindness, say researchers. A new study found a link between regular use of aspirin and age-related macular degeneration (AMD) - the most common cause of sight loss in people over 50. The link could not be explained by a history of heart disease or smoking, which are both risk factors for the disease. Millions of heart patients take daily low-dose aspirin on doctor’s orders to ward off a second heart attack or stroke, while others who have not been diagnosed with cardiovascular disease take it as ‘health insurance’. Recent findings also suggest regular low dose aspirin cuts the risk of dying from a range of common cancers. Researchers from Australia said there was ‘insufficient evidence’ to advise patients against taking aspirin, although some should be advised of the potential hazard if they already had AMD in one eye. The wet form of the condition, caused by leaking blood vessels in the eyes, leads to vision loss in the centre of the eye’s field of vision. The dry form is more common and less severe, although people still suffer visual impairment. Around 200,000 Britons each year suffer AMD and there is no preventative treatment, although laser surgery and drugs can limit damage caused by the disease. The new study compared rates of wet AMD among more than 2,000 regular and non-regular users of aspirin over a period of 15 years. Regular use was defined as taking aspirin once or more per week, says a report in the US journal JAMA Internal Medicine. Failing eyesight: Age-related macular degeneration affects a quarter of over-60s in the UK and more than half of over-75s . Among non-regular users, rates of wet AMD rose from 0.8 per cent at five years to 1.6 per cent at 10 years and 3.7 per cent at 15 years. Corresponding rates for regular aspirin users were 1.9 per cent, 7 per cent, and 9.3 per cent. It found that aspirin users -- regardless . of their heart health or smoking history -- were at greater risk of the . more serious type of vision loss. Dr Gerald Liew, from the University of Sydney in Australia, who led the study, said: ‘Currently, there is insufficient evidence to recommend changing clinical practice, except perhaps in patients with strong risk factors for neovascular AMD.. in whom it may be appropriate to raise the potentially small risk of incident neovascular AMD with long-term aspirin therapy.’ Any decision on whether to stop aspirin treatment was complex and should be done on an individual basis, said the researchers. An eye affected by wet AMD. It causes rapid central vision loss, which cannot be restored . US experts Dr Sanjay Kaul and Dr George Diamond, from Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, said in a comment that more research was needed before patients could be advised to change the status quo. ‘From a purely science-of-medicine perspective, the strength of the evidence is not sufficiently robust to be clinically directive’ they said. Previous research has also suggested a link between AMD and regular aspirin use. Professor Yit Yang, of the Royal College of Ophthalmologists, said 'This tells us that patients who developed wet macular degeneration were more likely to have been put on aspirin for other health reasons. 'Those patients who were on aspirin and those who were not on aspirin may be different in other ways and may differ in terms of other risks of wet macular degeneration such as blood pressure or cardiovascular health or even family history. 'It is different from saying that aspirin actually causes the development of wet macular degeneration. However it is a small signal that there could be a direct causative link but it is not possible to confirm this at present. 'It is important not to ignore these signals of potential harm or side effects that medicines can cause but at present there is not enough evidence from these studies to justify recommending to patients that they should discontinue aspirin therapy.'","Popping the pill more than once a week increased risk .

We know them as the warriors in horned helmets who raped and pillaged their way around Europe. But when the Vikings were not at war, Scandinavian society was deeply concerned about their ‘anti-social behaviour’ according to experts. Dr Tarrin Wills, of the University of Aberdeen, said medieval chroniclers ‘profiled’ notorious criminals by giving detailed descriptions of their build, hair and facial features in a similar way to today’s police mugshots. A 17th-century Icelandic manuscript of Egill Skallagrimsson, who was a Viking described as having a 'lifelong interest in homicide' After returning from treasure-grabbing raids – of which Britain was a particular target – there was concern that Viking pirates were attacking their neighbours’ farms and going on killing sprees. Dr Wills who analysed 13th century Icelandic legends, written down from stories passed down the generations, said they read like a precursor of ‘Crimewatch’. One notorious warrior they describe is Egill Skallagrimsson, a tenth century terror who committed his first murder aged seven ‘after what sounds like a rugby game’, Dr Wills said. The manuscript details his full beard, bushy eyebrows, and wide forehead, ‘very broad’ chin and jaw and ‘thick neck and broad shoulders’. Dr Wills said: ‘This was text was not created so much as a record of achievement in battle, but to address what was seen as a problem at home. ‘A good Viking should be aggressive and dominant, he should go abroad, rape and pillage. But many of these guys end up back home and having to settle down to farming and family life. ‘The kind of guys who are good at rape and pillage, are not very good husbands and farmers, and the society was sensitive to a whole range of indicators of anti social behaviour.’ Dr Tarrin Wills, of the University of Aberdeen claims the records of descriptions of Vikings may be a first example of criminal profiling . Dr Wills, a historian, believes the Vikings were aware that physical characteristics such as facial hair and muscle - now associated with high testosterone levels - were linked to aggressive behaviour. Physical descriptions were unusual in medieval manuscripts and are usually only mentioned if relevant to the plot, or describing their dress or complexion to reflect their wealth, he said. But in these tales - known as the Icelandic sagas - he found a strong link between physical descriptions suggesting high testosterone, in dominant and aggressive people such as outlaws and killers. His study, in the journal Viking and Medieval Scandinavia also linked individuals described as having narrow shoulders and small facial features to low testosterone behaviour, such as having straying wives or failing in battle. Those writing the texts, thought to be wealthy farmers whose territory was at risk from raiders, were concerned with helping to spot people who might behave in violent ways. Dr Wills told the British Science Festival in Aberdeen yesterday: ‘These early Viking authors pinpointed the physical markers of testosterone, including them in descriptions of great warriors. ‘In this sense they were perhaps the first to begin criminal profiling. As a result they served as mugshots of likely offenders and a warning to wider Viking Society.’ Egill was a typical warrior, who went raiding in England and elsewhere.

The position you choose while sleeping reveals a startling amount about your personality, according to body language expert Robert Phipps. Mr Phipps has identified four positions and says the foetal – most favoured by worriers – is by far the most common. Sleeping like a log: More than half of us in the UK sleep curled up in the foetal position, left, suggesting we are a nation of worriers, while the second most common position is the log, right, which indicates a rigid personality . More than half of us (58 per cent) adopt it and sleep with knees up and head down. The more we curl up, the more comfort we’re seeking, he says. The second most common position is the log (28 per cent). A straight body, with arms and legs by the side, apparently indicates stubbornness and they can wake up stiffer than when they went to sleep, says Mr Phipps. The 25 per cent of us that are a yearner – arms stretched out in front – are either chasing a dream or being chased. Yearners are their own worst critics says Mr Phipps, always expecting great results. They wake up eager to face the challenges of the day. Freefallers – face down, arms outstretched – make up 17 per cent and feel they have little control over their life. Physically this is the least comfortable position. Mr Phipps’s survey asked people to record their most common sleeping positions, with some naming more than one. He said: ‘A good night’s sleep sets you up for the following day and our sleeping positions can determine how we feel when we wake.’ Nap-time: 'Yearners' sleep with their arms outstreched, left, while 'freefallers' sleep on their stomachs with their arms at right-angles, right .","More than half of people in the UK curl into the foetal position as they sleep - a sign they are seeking comfort - according to new research .

A former Nazi soldier is to demand compensation at the High Court claiming he was tortured by British interrogators using ‘Gestapo methods’ after the Second World War. Gerhard Menzel, 89, was arrested in Hamburg in June 1946 by British intelligence officials who suspected he was a Communist spy. He was taken to the British-run Bad Nenndorf prison near Hanover where he claims to have been tortured with thumb and shin screws seized from a Gestapo cellar. Gerhard Menzel, 89, is taking his claim to the High Court after he said he was tortured while imprisoned at Bad Nenndorf by the British . Mr Menzel says he was also punched in . the face, had his hands chained behind his back for up to 16 days at a . time and was drenched in iced water every half an hour, according to magazine Focus. He said he is taking legal action now, almost 70 years after the event, because he is the jail’s last surviving prisoner. The engineer, from Lindau in South Germany, will have his case heard at the High Court in what is thought to be the first ever claim from a representative of the Nazi armed forces. The case is expected to begin next month. Mr Menzel said: ‘I deserve to be financially compensated for what I suffered. Prime Minister David Cameron will understand me. He is a gentleman.’ Former Nazis, members of the SS, associates of Adolf Hitler and suspected Communists were interrogated by the British at Bad Nenndorf between June 1945 and July 1947. It is claimed mock executions were held at the facility, and several inmates committed suicide or died from hunger or exhaustion. Locals claimed to hear screams coming from the prison which became known as das verbotene dorf – the forbidden village. The treatment of 372 men and 44 women prisoners led to an investigation by a Scotland Yard detective, Inspector Tom Hayward. Four of Bad Nenndorf’s officers were brought before a court-martial in 1948. One was convicted on charges of neglect. Mr Menzel, who is 6ft, was 23 when he was arrested. Documents show he was 10st 3lb then, but after eight months at Bad Nenndorf he was 7st 10lb. Mr Menzel said he was tortured using shin and thumb screws used by the Gestapo, pictured being inspected by chief Heinrich Himmler . He was transferred to another British-run camp where a doctor noted he was ‘only skin and bones’ and his chances of survival were slim. The notes from the doctors add: ‘He could neither walk nor stand up without assistance, and could only speak with difficulty because his tongue and lips were swollen and broken open.’ Mr Menzel was one of 12 inmates transferred from Bad Nenndorf. All were described as being emaciated and dressed in rags. Previous arrivals had also been half-starved according to notes taken at the time, and some had scars apparently as a result of beatings and torture with shin screws. Mr Menzel said: ‘Anything I win would be a token towards acknowledging that hundreds of other people were cruelly and senselessly tortured in this place. ‘It is a long time in coming. They said I was a Communist spy, but it was rubbish. I was a victim of paranoia about Stalin.’","Gerhard Menzel, 89, says he was tortured at Bad Nenndorf near Hanover .

At first glance these images could be mistaken for an imminent alien invasion, but the mysterious 'UFOs' seen floating over a mountain range are in fact clouds. The rare formations - known as lenticular clouds - have been mistaken for UFOs thanks to their smooth, flying saucer-like shape and orange glow. The clouds, which form in areas of high altitude, often baffle onlookers and have sparked fears of alien attacks. Eerie: The rare cloud formations are often mistaken for UFOs because of their saucer-like shape and orange glow . Despite their sinister appearance, the cloud formations are a natural weather phenomenon created when moist air flows over a mountain or mountain range. If the temperature in the air drops, the moisture condenses forming a spiral-shaped lenticular cloud. These stunning pictures were captured in Chile by Russian amateur photographer Dmitry Dubikovskiy while he was travelling with friends. The 47-year-old was 'euphoric' when he spotted the rare cloud formations in the skies over Torres Del Paine National Park. 'It was a really stunning view,' he said. 'Lenticular clouds always look unusual and against teh light of a sunset they look even more magnificent. 'Whenever I go out for dinner with my friends, they all want to see the pictures and talk about how unique they are. 'I've only seen this sort of phenomenon a few times in my life but each time I see it I think it's amazing,' the photographer added.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 15:00 EST, 2 August 2011 . William Hague has said there was 'not a remote possibility' of UN-backed military action against Syria despite the violence that has left up to 140 protesters dead. President Bashar al-Assad’s tanks yesterday battered the city of Hama  as the country’s government waged ‘full armed warfare’ on its own people to crush demonstrations. The attacks came in response to protests that have raged for several months against his rule, pleading for political reform. But the Foreign Secretary ruled out confronting the regime, saying there was no international appetite for military action. Bloodshed: A man on a stretcher is carried to Al Badra Hospital in Hama . Smoke rises over Hama during the assault in which at least 45 people were killed . Anger: Britain's Foreign Secretary William Hague condemned the violence in Syria . Forces began their brutal co-ordinated assault on Hama at dawn yesterday, having besieged it for the past four weeks. Security forces backed by tanks and . snipers yesterday launched a ferocious assault on defiant cities and . towns, leaving scores dead. Utilities were cut off and main exit routes were closed before the troops moved in. Reports said forces were . firing in unarmed residential districts where inhabitants put up . makeshift roadblocks to stop them. The government troops then encountered armed resistance from rebel militias. Estimates of the death toll, which were impossible to verify, ranged from around 75 people to nearly 140 on a day when the attacks began before dawn. Medical staff said hospitals were . overrun by the wounded, suggesting the death toll could rise sharply, witnesses said. Bodies lay uncollected in the streets last night . after the tanks pulled out, having failed to take control of the city . centre. The shelling prompted condemnation around the world. US President Barack Obama called the reports ""horrifying"" and said Assad was ""completely incapable and unwilling"" to respond to the legitimate grievances of the Syrian people. But Mr Hague has said he simply wants 'additional sanctions' to ratchet up the pressure on President Assad's regime. Tanks roll into Hama, Syria, as part of a brutal crackdown on anti-government protesters . Flames are seen rising next to a military tank during today's dawn raid . At least 45 people were killed and dozens wounded in the in the major tank assault this morning . 'We want to see stronger international pressure all round,' said Mr Hague. 'To be effective that can't just be . pressure from Western nations - that includes from Arab nations, it . includes from Turkey, which has been very active in trying to persuade . President Assad to reform instead of embarking on these appalling . actions.' He added: 'I would also like to see a . United Nations Security Council resolution to condemn this violence, to . call for the release of political prisoners and call for legitimate . grievances to be responded to.' Speaking on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme, Mr Hague admitted that . agreeing a resolution would be 'quite difficult', saying: 'There are . nations on the Security Council opposed to any resolution - or they have . certainly been in recent weeks. We will revisit this in the coming hours and days.' Mr Hague said UN-backed military . action against Syria was 'not a remote possibility', describing the . situation as different from Libya when the UN passed a resolution . endorsing armed intervention. 'It is a very frustrating situation. The levers we have are very limiting,' he added. Italian Foreign Minister Franco .

President Assad’s father, President . Hafez al-Assad, sent in troops to Hama to smash an Islamist-led uprising . in 1982, killing up to 30,000 Syrians. The operation was led by the president's brother, Rifaat. Current . President Bashar Assad has turned to his own brother, Maher, who . commands the army's elite Fourth Division, to deal with the unrest. Activists said killings and attacks . took place in other parts of Syria yesterday, although the uprising has . yet to engulf the two main cities of Damascus and Aleppo. A resident said bodies were lying uncollected in the streets and so the death toll would rise. Army snipers had climbed onto the roofs of the state-owned electricity company and the main prison, he said. It . has been reported that electricity and water supplies had been cut in a . tactic regularly used by the army when storming towns to crush . demonstrations. Residents . of northern Hama told Reuters that tank shells were falling at the rate . of four a minute there. They also confirmed deaths in the area. In southern Syria, rights campaigners . said security forces killed three civilians when they stormed houses in . the town of al-Hirak, 20 miles northeast of the city of Deraa. The . government has blamed armed terrorist gangs for most killings during the . revolt but reports suggest the protests have been largely peaceful, . with only isolated cases of people arming themselves against the . military assault. Most foreign media have been banned from the area, making it difficult to verify reports of the fighting. A Western diplomat who said he saw several tanks enter the suburb said: 'The regime thinks it can scare people before Ramadan and make them stay home. 'But especially the people of Hama have shown themselves to be resilient,' he said, referring to the Muslim holy month, which starts in Syria today. Thousands took to the streets during a protest against President Bashar al-Assad after Friday prayers in the city centre of Hama in July . Shelling: Smoke rising in the city of Hama in video as Syrian army tanks firing shells and machineguns stormed the city . An estimated 1,600 civilians . have died in the crackdown on the largely peaceful protests against . President Bashar Assad's regime since the uprising began more than four . months ago. Assad is trying to end an uprising against . his 11-year rule that broke out in March, inspired by the Arab Spring . revolutions in Tunisia and Egypt, and which has spread across the . country. Most of the dead were killed in shootings by security forces on anti-government rallies. In early June, security forces shot . dead 65 people there, and since then it has fallen out of government . control, with protesters holding the streets and government forces . ringing the city and mounting overnight raids. One person is disappearing in Syria every hour, according to online campaign group Avaaz.org. The website states that 3,000 people have been . arrested by regime forces and 'disappeared' into secret jails since the . start of the uprising against President Bashar Assad more than four . months ago. More than 1,600 people have been reported killed, most of them unarmed protesters. Although the uprising began in mid-March with calls for reform, the steadily climbing death toll and slow pace of reform has enraged the protest movement now calling for Assad's removal. Terror: A vehicle burns in the city of Hama as at least 45 civilians were killed by Syrian government forces . It appeared the regime was making an example of Hama, a religiously conservative city about 130 miles north of the capital, Damascus. The city, with a population of 800,000, has largely fallen out of government control since June as residents turned on the regime and blockaded the streets against encroaching tanks. The United States and France enraged the government earlier this month when their ambassadors travelled to Hama in a trip designed to demonstrate solidarity with demonstrators. And yesterday's deadly siege only ignited more calls for defiance among protesters. The Local Coordination Committees, which helps organise anti-government protests, urged people to take to the streets and start a general strike to protest the killings. An escalation in violence during Ramadan, a time of heightened religious fervour for devout Muslims, would bring a new dimension to the unrest in Syria, which has reached a stalemate in recent weeks. There have been credible reports of army defections, although it is difficult to gauge how widespread they are. Assad, and his father before him, stacked key military posts with members of their minority Alawite sect, melding the fate of the army and the regime. The army has a clear interest in protecting the regime because they fear revenge attacks and persecution should the country's Sunni majority gain the upper hand. The Turkish Prime Minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has said there must not be 'another Hama', meaning another massacre.

With audiences lapping up the sprawling and grandiose homes in TV shows like Grand Designs, it's clear that many of us aspire to bigger houses with breathtaking views and endless gardens. But Polish architect Jakub Szczesny has positioned himself at the other end of the spectrum - by creating a home that is so narrow there is not even room for a staircase. At less than five feet at its widest point, and a pinch over three feet at its narrowest, the Warsaw house - built in an alley between two other buildings - does not even have room for windows. It is claimed it is the skinniest house in the world. There's not even enough room for a window - sunlight comes through small holes in the bedroom. Slimmed down: Front and back views of the house in Warsaw which has no windows. Sunlight comes . through two holes in the bedroom wall so you can tell when it is day . time . Technical challenge: The framework for the house was constructed off-site and slotted into place by a team of builders . Because . there is only a total floor space of 46 square feet in the two-floor . iron structure, residents have to use a ladder to go up a level. The project is called the Keret house - named after Israeli writer and filmmaker Etgar Keret, who has headed the art project and will live in the property, on-and-off, . for six months. It does not offer much in terms of luxury. The bathroom is nothing more than a toilet with a shower head installed almost directly above it. Aspiring cooks will also have a tough time in the Keret house. There is minimal space for cutting, washing and cooking. It is best to use fresh food in the home. The fridge only offers space for two drinks. At just a metre-and-a-half wide the Keret House is thought to be the narrowest in the world. It was built as a comment on the lack of housing being built in Poland . Slender: The building is designed to make the most of the very small amount of usable space . Israeli writer and film director Etgar Keret will live in the home for six months, on-and-off. Inviting friends for dinner is not really on the cards. There are only  two fixed seats at the dinner table. That sticks out of the wall. The bedroom is no less spartan. It is functional though, featuring a tiny bed and desk. Books can be stored in an alcove behind the bed. 'Research shows we are approaching a social disaster because too little living space is built,' the architect said. 'You don't need that much space to live in, so it is worth considering building smaller scaled, cheaper housing.' When Keret moves out of the property he will give it to a colleague. One of the buildings next to the house dates from before the war while the other was built after it. Before the Second World War most of Warsaw's architecture was brick based. But with the city almost completely destroyed by Nazi Germany, the communist rulers of Poland rebuilt the city in concrete. The house is located at the point where the Nazis established the largest Jewish ghetto in occupied Europe. It is officially opened tomorrow.","Ultra thin home is just five feet at its widest point and three feet at narrowest .

A jury heard today that Jodi Arias called her ex-boyfriend's cell phone four times after she  stabbed him to death in his shower. Prosecutors say the latest evidence in the ongoing trial about the murder of Travis Alexander shows that Arias was trying to cover up her tracks by listening to- and potentially deleting messages on his phone- after she killed him, which Arias admits to committing but says that she stabbed him 27 times in self defense. An expert from phone company Verizon took the stand in Phoenix, Arizona, saying that Arias placed a call at 11.37pm- just six hours after Alexander was killed. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Watching her lies: The court saw videos of Jodi Arias' various police interrogations (right) in the months following Travis Alexander's June 2008 murder . Breaking it down: The tapes show that she used several different stories throughout the interrogations, ranging to say that she was not at his apartment, or later that she was there but they were attacked by a masked couple . The she made her last call on June 15- a week after she killed Alexander. Prosecutors argue that she left the voicemail messages in an effort to cover her tracks. The phone expert said that one call shows that Arias dialed into Alexander's voicemail system after his death and stayed on the line for 16 minutes. Because she did not leave any message, prosecutors argue that she was listening to and potentially deleting messages from the dead man's cell phone. On the opposite end, the defense attorneys suggested that she didn't actually delete messages but she was simply recording and deleting her own message that she was going to leave for her dead ex before finally giving up and not leaving one in the end. 'On Verizon, is it possible to change your voice mail, to erase it and do it over again? Could someone have been doing that for a 16 minute phone call?' defense attorney Kirk Nurmi said. 'Yes,' Verizon Wireless records expert Jody Citizen testified in court. Different versions: Arias has changed her story a number of times, and is now pleading not guilty saying that she killed Alexander in self defense even though she initially said she was never in his apartment on the day of his death . Throughout the day on Tuesday, the jury was shown hours of footage of Arias in the interrogation room with the lead detective over the course of multiple interview sessions in 2008. At one point- clearly before she admitted that she killed Alexander- she pleads with the detective, saying: 'If I killed Travis I would beg for the death penalty.' 'I have to maintain my innocence but I can't admit to something I haven't done,' she said at another point. During one of the earliest questionings, she asked the detective how many times Alexander was stabbed, and Detective Esteban Flores said 'more than I want to remember'. In the courtroom, Arias was visibly moved by the footage and had to cover her face at points as she cried. 'Obsessed': Arias, 32, allegedly stabbed Travis Alexander, pictured, 27 times and shot him in the head . Happier times: She met Travis Alexander, a Mormon and motivational speaker, at a Las Vegas conference . The footage showed the vast series of different stories that Arias told in the months following Alexander's brutal June 2008 murder, including one where a male and female attacker were the ones who killed Alexander while they were together in the shower. At another point, she explained her reticence of telling the detective any details came because she 'has seen the Sopranos' and feared that Alexander's supposed killers would come after her mother and younger brother as retribution if she talked. The review of the interrogation footage signals that the prosecution is winding down in terms of their evidence before the defense takes their turn. Arias is expected to testify, if nothing else than to simply clarify why she would need to make up so many stories her claims of self defense are true. She faces the death penalty if found guilty.

Prince Charles pinned a CBE on Catherine Zeta-Jones’s lapel with the minimum of blushes. For the actress it was undoubtedly a symbol of how far she had come since her humble beginnings in the Welsh valleys and the picture taken showed her beaming with delight. However, when she was recently shown the image again she finally told the truth. Scroll down for video . Big day: Catherine Zeta Jones was made a CBE in 2011 for services to the film industry . Appearing on the David Letterman show in New York, she told her host: ‘Look at his hands. 'Check out his hands, I dunno. I love the royal family but he is being a little saucy.’ Mr Letterman asks Miss Zeta-Jones: ‘Is that to do with the award?’ To which she replies: ‘I just think that it’s my breast actually.’ Miss Zeta-Jones, 43, continued with the tongue-in-cheek theme to tell the television host that her award meant she could expect him to ‘get on his knees every time I stand’. ‘I am a Commander of the British Empire,’ she said, ‘and basically that entitles me to David Letterman getting on his knees every time I stand.’ Just starting out: Catherine Zeta-Jones shot to fame after starring in The Darling Buds of May . Miss Zeta-Jones, who was made a CBE for services to the film industry and charity in February 2011, described the recognition as ‘a great honour’. She was accompanied at the royal presentation by her husband, U.S. actor Michael Douglas, 68, and their two children, Dylan, 12, and Carys, nine. Now a fully-fledged member of Hollywood royalty through her marriage to actor Michael Douglas, Miss Zeta-Jones also revealed she is proud of her Welsh roots and that her children are eager to watch their father in Basic Instinct. Mr Douglas,68, co-starred with Sharon Stone in the erotic thriller which was popular in the 1990s. She said: ‘My kids are not interested in plots of films but they are desperate to see Sharon Stone and my husband…They are desperate. All the kids talk about my movies and their dad’s movies. One day the curtain will go up though.’ Miss Zeta-Jones also touched upon her failed attempts at skiing: ‘I am like an old age pensioner slowly coming down. I look cute in my ski outfit though. That is all I can do.’ Miss Zeta-Jones’ latest film is Broken City, in which she is cast the wife of the ‘corrupt beyond belief’ New York Mayor, played by Russell Crowe. ‘We had Thanksgiving dinner with Mayor Bloomberg. We went to Bermuda and he asked me about the part,’ she said. ‘I said I am married to the Mayor of New York. This was over turkey and cranberry sauce. ‘I told him Russell’s character was corrupt beyond belief, and he wants to kill me and the Mayor turns to me and says “That would work”.’ The film is set for UK release at the beginning of March.","Hollywood actress declares she loves the royal family on Letterman show .

Syrian president Bashar Assad and his family are living on a warship guarded by the Russian navy, it has been claimed. The embattled dictator is said to have moved with his family and a select band of aides to the warship off Syria's coast. The move, which is said to have come about after the president lost confidence in his own security detail, sees Assad travel by helicopter to Damascus to attend meetings in his presidential palace. Syria's embattled President Bashar al-Assad, pictured here making a public address last week, is living on a warship guarded by Russian naval forces, according to reports . Intelligence sources told the Saudi daily paper al-Watan the president was being protected by Russia, which effectively amounted to political asylum, The Times of Israel has reported. Al-Watan was told Assad's fear of advances by the opposition in the capital was one of the reasons why he has moved to the ship. His current position is also thought to allow a quick evacuation to Moscow if it became necessary. Russia has remained an ally of the regime since the popular uprising in March 2011, during which time the UN estimates more than 60,000 people have been killed. Russia also endorsed a speech by Assad last week where he offered an end to the crisis by calling national elections and forming a new government. In his first public speech in six months last week, the dictator urged Syrians to mobilise in a 'war to defend the nation'. The dictator, pictured here with his wife Asma Al-Assad, is said to have moved with his family and aides to the warship because of his fear of advances by the opposition in the capital . His defiant call to arms came in an hour-long speech to cheering loyalists in the opera house in the capital Damascus. Assad unveiled what he claimed was a peace initiative to end the violent uprising against his rule. But he declared he would not talk to those he called extremists ‘who only understand the language of terrorism’ or to ‘puppets’ of the West. People gather at a site hit by what activists said was missiles fired by a Syrian Air Force fighter jet from forces loyal to Syrian president Assad, at the souk of Azaz, north of Aleppo, on Sunday . Meanwhile, as the death toll continued to grow steadily in Syria, an aid agency working in the conflict zone has said that doctors are being murdered to stop the wounded getting treated. In a report released by International Rescue Committee's Commission on Syrian Refugees, they said that partner organisations which provide emergency medical services and supplies say the health care system has been decimated. Physicians described 'intimidation, torture and the targeted killing of doctors and other medical staff in retribution for treating the wounded'.","Syrian president Bashar Assad moved on to warship with family and aides .

Ahead of the pomp and decorum of the 57th presidential inauguration next Monday, the president will hold a private swearing in from the White House the day before. President Barack Obama will take his oath shortly before noon on Sunday in the Blue Room of the White House, administered by Supreme Court Justice John Roberts. This is in accordance with the Constitution, which dictates that the president's term begins at noon on January 20. Since that falls on a Sunday, the public inauguration will then be held on Monday. Taking oath: President Obama, pictured four years ago taking the oath, will first take a private oath on January 20 ahead of Monday's official inauguration, as the Constitution dictates . Location: The private oath will take place shortly before noon on Sunday, January 20 in the Blue Room of the White House . White House spokesman Jay Carney said that the event will be sparsely attended ahead of Monday's grand ceremony. The Constitution's 20th Amendment, passed by Congress in March 1932 and ratified by the necessary states the following January, sets the inauguration date as January 20 at noon. Because that's a Sunday this year, Obama will take the official oath of office that day in a private ceremony. A public ceremony will be held January 21 on the west front of the U.S. Capitol. This is the seventh time the inauguration date has fallen on a Sunday. Inaugural ceremonies, however, are not traditionally held on Sundays because courts and other public institutions are closed. Before 1933, the president had been sworn in on March 4, typically the final day of the congressional season. But the stretch between the November elections and the March 4 inauguration led to a lengthy lame-duck sessions of Congress and became a concern during times of national crisis. Sen. George Norris, R-Neb., suggested the 20th Amendment, which called for a new Congress to begin on Jan. 3 and for the president to be inaugurated on January 20. President Franklin Roosevelt's first inauguration, in 1933, was the last swearing-in ceremony held on March 4. Source: AP . Among those in the White House's Blue Room will be Obama's family will, along with a few reporters. However, Mr Obama isn't expected to make a speech. The Constitution requires the president's term to start on January 20, but because that falls on a Sunday this year, Mr Obama will have two ceremonies: one on Sunday and a larger, public ceremony on Monday, followed by a parade and inaugural balls. The presidential oath, as outlined in Article II, Section I is as follows: 'I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States.’ He has elected to use two Bibles for Monday's event – one belonging to Dr Martin Luther King, Jr. and the other belonging to Abraham Lincoln. Vice President Joe Biden will be sworn in during a separate ceremony Sunday morning at the Naval Observatory. Mr Obama's first inauguration marked many firsts. He was the first Hawaii-born citizen to hold the office, the first African-American to be president, and Sen. Dianne Feinstein became the first woman to emcee the ceremony. Set up: Preparations at the reviewing stand continue today for the inauguration on Monday the 21st . Swearing in: Obama, pictured placing his hand on the Lincoln Bible, will use that Bible and one owned by Dr Martin Luther King Jr . Following the quiet ceremony Sunday, Mr Obama and his family will welcome in the next four years with considerable more pomp. The first family will lead a parade of clanging bands, elaborate floats and marchers, including costumed dancers, prancing horses and military units, down Pennsylvania Avenue. The president will dance with the first lady, whose dress seems destined to be most anticipated fashion statement of the second Obama administration. A new element of the inaugural events will be announced next week, with the appointment of around half a dozen 'citizen co-chairs,' community leaders from across the country chosen because they represent the president's accomplishments and commitments. They will take part in inaugural events throughout the weekend. Estimates of turnout are 600,000 to 800,000, compared with the 1.8million in the record crowd on the National Mall four years ago to see the first swearing in of a black president.","Constitution requires that the president be sworn in at noon on January 20 .

The dog was discovered emaciated and with overgrown claws in September last year by the RSPCA. A mother and her two daughters starved a Staffordshire bull terrier, pictured, until it was so hungry it started to eat its own bed. Pictured is the caged room where the dog was kept and the bed made of plastic which has been bitten into . It had been digesting its own bed - which was made of plastic - and plastic was found to be in its faeces. Inspector Virgina Ross visited the family home in Tottenham, north London, to check on the pet's condition. She found a baby gate had been placed across the door of the room to prevent the dog from escaping from the foul-smelling room. Ms Ross could see the animal's hips, ribs and spine protruding from underneath its fur, Highbury Corner Magistrates heard. An RSPCA inspector discovered Akita, pictured, emaciated and with overgrown claws in September last year . Prosecutor Mark Jones said: 'It was frantic to get out of the room. There was child gate across the door which the dog was trying to climb over.' He added that there was a soiled bed for the dog in the middle of the room which was covered in faeces, and that there was no clean space for the animal to get some respite. Chloe told the inspector that Akita had belonged to her sister's ex-boyfriend and that he had left it with them. She admitted that she had been concerned about the conditions it was being kept in, saying: 'I wouldn't like to live like that.' Mr Jones said the intention had been to sell the animal which had been looked after before Amy and her boyfriend split up. The defendants then 'turned a blind . eye' to Akita's care and neglected her for a month until she was taken . away by Ms Ross on September 18. A forensic veterinary surgeon examined the dog and found that she weighed just 5.7kg - almost half her normal body weight. He added that the dog was so desperate to find food that it had started trying to digest her bed. Mr Jones said: 'Whilst at the surgery the animal was passing plastic in its faeces. 'What . the vet is saying is that this dog was eating abnormal matter. It is a . common finding in dogs that have been deprived an adequate diet and were . so hungry they would eat anything. 'It doesn't get any worse than that.' He added: 'Quite frankly, if left any longer the dog might have died.'

She was born in Singapore to a Chinese mother and a Thai father but she was brought up in England when her mother remarried a Briton. Vanessa-Mae, whose full name is Vanessa-Mae Vanakorn Nicholson, would be only the second Thai to compete at a Winter Olympics if she qualified. Academic Prawat Nagvajara represented .

Vanessa-Mae, the world famous violin prodigy, continues to delight audiences the world over. Her family moved to London from Singapore when she was just four and she started to learn the piano and later violin. At the age of seven she won a prestigious competition for 'Young British Pianist of the Year' but decided to concentrate exclusively on playing violin. When she was 11, she passed entrance exams for a one-year course at Royal College of Music and had already begun making concert appearances. She played with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra in London as the youngest soloist in history to play Bach's, Mozart's and Kabalevsky's concertos with the orchestra. The success of The Violin Player justified a bold creative gamble she wanted to take - a new synthesis of classical and pop sounds. The albums that followed confirmed this success - worldwide sales have topped 8million units so far, earning more than 40 international platinum awards. She has collaborated with pop legends including Janet Jackson and Prince, performed on the soundtrack of the Disney animated feature Mulan, played Bach for the British Royal Family on the 250th anniversary of the composer's death and performed as she modelled a wedding dress on the runway of a Jean-Paul Gualtier fashion show in Paris.

Julie Green-Jones has raked in £2.7million in the past three years as the head of one of Britain's largest bailiff companies - Rossendales. The 50-year -old, from Lancashire, began her career as a fashion model, touring the world as she was booked for various shoots. Julie Green-Jones has raked in £2.7million in the past three years as the head of one of Britain's largest baillif companies - Rossendales. Now she earns almost £1million a year, lives at a £2million country estate, and is in charge of 200 debt collectors at Rossendales - one of Britain's eight largest bailiff companies. The companies have seen their combined annual turnover rise to £106.7million, breaking the £100million barrier for the first time. Last year’s biggest earner was Marston Group, with a £25.8million turnover, followed by Equita, with £20.1million. Rossendales, raked in £16.2million — . an increase of almost ten per cent in two years — and JBW, which earned . £12.8million, was up 80 per cent. But the news comes as a recent report has launched heavy criticism at some parts of the industry for using 'unscrupulous' tactics such as inflating charges and inventing fees. A report by the Local Government Ombudsman, which looked at use of bailiffs by councils, found some were employing practices which could see families pushed deeper in debt. In one case, a £105 fee on a parking ticket was increased to £405, and in another a woman was charged a £250 so called van fee. It is supposed to cover the cost of bringing a vehicle to a property but the maximum charged should be £100. The eight top bailiff firms have not been implicated in any wrongdoing and the report does not name companies individually. Ms Green-Jones turned to the debt collecting business in 1989 after a marriage break-up left her as a single parent with no income. She bought the company in 2007 . Between April 2011 and March 2012, Citizens Advice received more than two million requests for help on matters relating to debt. Gillian Guy, chief executive, told the Sun: 'We are seeing more and more evidence that some bailiffs are intimidating people in their own homes.' She said the system was in urgent need of reform as many who sought the organisations advice were already struggling with poverty and did not know their rights or what do when a bailiff comes to the door. Bailiffs body the Civil Enforcement Association said it disputed the findings of the report. It said it had a robust complaints process and bailiffs accused of intimidating people or charging illegally high fees were 'investigated rigorously.' But a spokesman agreed that the system governing the industry needed reform — and said the Government was 'avoiding the issue'. Ms Green-Jones turned to the debt . collecting business in 1989 after a marriage break-up left her as a . single parent with no income. After climbing through the ranks she said she took a risk and bought out Rossendales in 2007. She defended the company's practices when an employee was  filmed allegedly threatening debtors and breaking industry guidelines in a 2011 TV exposé. His contract was later terminated for his 'inexcusable behaviour. ' Later that year she said in an interview bailiffs collected money 'critical for front line services'. She said:  'That is all money for the public purse. It’s not only what we collect, we also serve as a deterrent.' Last year’s record earnings for . bailiffs come as experts predict a triple dip recession and as several . high street chains announce that thousands of workers could lose their . jobs. Official growth figures due on Friday are expected to show the British economy shrank in the final quarter of last year. Many experts predict there will be another fall in the three months from January to March, plunging the nation into its third recession in five years. Employees in the shadow of the axe include 800 staff at  Honda’s Swindon plant, 1,300 at collapsed camera chain Jessops,  760 at movie rental business Blockbuster and more than 4,000 at HMV. It will mean more families face losing their main earner and could struggle to pay bills.

Squeezed in between the gleaming Ferraris, Range Rovers and Aston Martins at Manchester City’s training ground on Friday mornings is a battered two-door VW Golf. It belongs to the Reverend Peter Horlock, the club’s chaplain. Horlock reportedly is the man who has been holding regular sessions with Mario Balotelli, Manchester City’s volatile Italian striker with a penchant for bust-ups with members of his own team and brawls with his fiery manager, Roberto Mancini. 'I’m there to provide pastoral support and friendship to the players and the staff. Sometimes the players from overseas feel homesick or have problems at home, and need someone to confide in,' says Horlock, 36, who was ordained into the Church of England in 2004  and assumed his role at Manchester City two years ago. Support: Reverend Peter Horlock is the chaplain at the Premiership football club Manchester City . Help: The Reverend also works with the business community in Manchester providing support to city workers . Poor, over-indulged rich kids, you might conclude, but Horlock and the charitable organisation he works for  - Sports Chaplaincy UK – believe that a growing number of players are turning to God, not so much to bring them three points on a Saturday afternoon but to help cope with life in the spotlight. Confrontation: Mario Balotelli clashes with Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini in a training ground bust-up . Fridays is when Horlock puts on his dog collar and heads for Manchester City’s Carrington training base. Visible on the touchline, in the club canteen and in the offices, he makes himself especially available to players who are injured and need a morale booster, or those who have lost their place in the team and want some reassurance. 'I enjoy getting to know the younger players. They are under a huge amount of pressure and although football operates by its own terms, with lots of money and privileges, when you strip it all down you are still dealing with human beings who need to be heard and supported,' he says. Horlock does not hold prayer meetings before matches – unlike at Charlton Athletic where the chaplain, the Reverend Matt Baker, gathers together as many as ten players for a 15 minute informal service in a room near the Home dressing room. He asks for any specific prayer requests, reads a passage from the Bible and then gives a short talk. 'We don’t pray for a result but we do pray that the game will be played in the right spirit, without violence on the pitch or in the stands,' says Baker. 'The overall feeling is that the players want to honour God with their talents.' Does the Addicks manager Chris Powell ever summon him at half-time to conjure up some divine inspiration? 'Absolutely not – and it’s not my place to lecture the players about their behaviour, but Chris spoke last year at our annual conference and is very supportive. He has a faith himself and sees the importance of what we do.' Controversial: Mario Balotelli in action. He has had bust-ups with team-mates and his manager . Baker, 44, who happens to be a . Charlton fan, has been chaplain of the South London club for 12 years. His official title at Sports Chaplaincy UK is Pastoral Support Director . in English Football. Currently, . 66 of the 92 league clubs in England have dedicated chaplains provided . by the charity, a number that has swelled in recent years with the . arrival of more and more players from overseas, many of whom seem keen . to demonstrate their faith by crossing themselves before running on to . the pitch or kneeling in prayerful thanks after scoring a goal. Steven Pienaar, the South African born Everton striker, regularly shows off a 'God is great' t-shirt, and Aaron Lennon, the Spurs winger, has played in boots with 'God is love' inscribed on them. At Chelsea, David Luiz, the Brazilian defender, is in the habit of placing his hands on team-mate Fernando Torres’s head and offering a prayer during the warm-up before games - even though the Almighty seems coy about helping Torres score on a regular basis. Go back a few years and footballers were reticent to wear their religion on their sleeves – or on their t-shirts for that matter. One of those who did come out as a committed Christian was Linvoy Primus, the ex-Charlton, Reading and Portsmouth player who retired at the end of 2009. Charlton fan: Matt Baker is the pastoral support director and chaplain at the Valley . He remembers a time when his team-mate at Portsmouth, Darren Moore, was the butt of jokes for praying and . reading the Bible before matches. 'When . I became a Christian I could talk to Darren and then the two of us . would meet up with the chaplain and soon others were showing an interest . and the whole atmosphere changed,' says Primus, who now heads up a . charity called Football and Faith. Service: Matt Baker holds an informal meeting for players near the home dressing room . Before long, Primus, Moore and the chaplain had introduced prayer meetings at the club, which still continue today. 'A lot of the younger players came along and were able to talk about things they couldn’t discuss with the manager and coaches,' says Primus. 'Some of them had got caught up in the bright lights and would ask whether they had done something wrong. I would tell them that ""yes you may have done something wrong but you are here now and can start again.""' Primus says that when he became a Christian he asked the club chaplain: 'Do I have to be a vicar on the pitch? ' To which the chaplain replied that it was a player’s 'motive' that was important. 'I did not want to lessen my competitive spirit and I still wanted to go in hard when tackling but I think I was more gracious with referees when they made bad decisions. 'I realised that, like me, they were trying to do their best and, like me, they made mistakes. And it helped me deal with defeat better. I still hurt but there was something else going on in my life. 'Football can distort the person you are – all the houses, the fast cars, the lifestyle – but it doesn’t actually mean anything.' A more traditional role for the likes of chaplains such as Horlock and Baker is spreading the ashes of supporters in their respective club’s Memorial Gardens. Baker conducted 12 ceremonies of that kind last year. But aren’t they sometimes nauseated by the vast sums of money players earn, often without giving much back to the community? 'The money is not the issue. There are a lot of very selfish poor people just as there are a lot of very selfish rich people,' says Horlock. 'And, actually, many footballers don’t get enough credit for what they do outside the game. 'I’m not twisting arms to get them into the Kingdom but presenting them with a chance to explore faith further when they are ready to do so.' So, has Balotelli seen the error of his ways? Is repentance in the air? “I would never discuss anyone’s personal situation. All I would say is that at a club like Manchester City there are a lot of very decent people who don’t share my faith.”","Chaplain at Manchester City provides pastoral support to players .

'I just thought I was a bit tired. I went to bed and the next morning when I woke up, I collapsed on the floor - my legs weren't working.

Alistair has now been in hospital for three months. At first, Alistair could not walk or talk and communicated mainly through facial expressions and making clicking noises to get attention. After being taken ill in mid-October, he is now recovering but does not know how long, or if, he will fully return to normal. His rehabilitation means he has to start from scratch and is using crutches to learn how to walk again. He said: 'It is like going back to being a baby again.

'But then when I couldn't speak and had trouble breathing I didn't remember much from that time. I was an average student going out meeting everyone and then I was lying in bed in a hospital. 'It was scary. I was really worried about what would happen to me. I was thinking ""Is this going to be a lasting effect?"" 'I tried not to think about it, but it is hard not to when you are just lying in a bed.' For a while, Alistair lost his speech, but he was later fitted with a contraption ???  to help him talk. He can now speak normally and use his arms, although his fingers are still not as strong as they were. His parents Jacky and Bryan moved from their village in Lincolnshire to be by Alistair's bedside when he was in hospital. Jacky, 58, said: 'He was completely surrounded by machines. But, as he started to recover, the machines slowly started to disappear one by one. 'As they went away, I started to think ""I am going to get my son back"". Alistair's father Bryan, 79, said they have found the experience of seeing their son in such a state a very difficult one, but they are proud with how he has coped. Alistair can now speak normally and use his arms, although his fingers are not as strong as they were. He eventually hopes to resume his studies . He added: 'I find it very emotional even now, thinking back to when he couldn't even speak to us.'It was so amazing to hear when he finally did speak again. They weaned him off the ventilators and machines and then we heard his voice properly for the first time. I still feel it now. 'But all the way through this, Alistair has smiled. I didn't realise until the interview with the Hull Daily Mail that he had been scared - that was the first time he told us that. 'Jacky and I and the nurses were blown away by how he responded to everything and had a smile on his face throughout. It is incredible that all the way through he has never complained.' Alistair has been cheered on with his recovery by visits from his university friends. Jacky said: 'Both the university and the hospital have been incredible to Alistair. And his friends have been very supportive. 'They have a very dark sense of humour about the whole thing and make him laugh.' Alistair now hopes to hold a sponsored leg wax to raise money for the medical teams who have helped him. Eventually, he will be moved to a ward in Nottingham, so he can recover closer to his parents' home in Lincolnshire. He will then re-start his university course when he is better. Guillain-Barre .

Symptoms include a tingly, numb sensation in the arms and legs which can result in a loss of feeling and movement. Most people who develop it have suffered from a viral or bacterial infection (such as tonsillitis) a few weeks before.

Motorists were surprised to see the bird perched on eggs in between the red and amber signals in Leicester city centre . This bird obviously thinks it has been given the green light to start nesting in January, after it chose a city centre traffic light to build its home. Baffled motorists in Leicester were surprised to see the bird perched on eggs in between the red and amber signals. Even more aptly it appeared this early bird had used some Christmas wrapping ribbon to help it make its nest. Photographer Jason Senior, 40, from Leicester, said the bird had chosen a set of traffic lights in Leicester city centre. He said: 'There were a lot of people standing around looking at this bird, I suppose it thought it had the green light to start nesting so early. 'If you look closely you can see ribbon from what might be Christmas wrapping in with the twigs in the nest . 'I was there for about half an hour and the bird seemed pretty happy and oblivious to all the commotion around it.' Gemma Hogg, from the RSPB, said the bird was likely to be either a mistle or song thrush. She said: 'Birds make their nests in all sorts of unusual places, and this isn't the first traffic light nest we've seen - in the past we've had birds nesting in, bins, hanging baskets and even an ash tray outside a pub. 'It may seem odd to us, but it's actually quite common. They see a safe, secure and cosy spot to lay eggs and raise chicks and don't care what it looks like or what the neighbours might think. 'This nest might not seem like an obvious choice, but perhaps the warmth from the lights makes it a sensible one. 'It's hard to tell if this bird is a song or mistle thrush without seeing its chest. Both are early breeders and have two to three broods a year. 'They normally start late February so this is pretty early. The mild weather towards the end of last year and beginning of this one may have prompted them to nest, but the current cold snap will have given them a bit of a shock. 'The RSPB recommends putting out high energy foods in gardens to help your birds get through the winter. A supply of unfrozen, fresh water is also really important.' Gemma said with the RSPB's Big Garden Birdwatch coming up on the weekend of January 26 and 27, keeping your feeders, tables and bird baths topped-up will not only make sure your garden visitors are well fed and looked after, it will also encourage them into your garden just in time for you to take part in the world's biggest wildlife survey.

After 36 hours of rocket attacks, a government warplane soared over the town and dropped a barrel bomb on Baraa's refuge. She said: 'The last thing I saw was a red flash like fire.

A motorist was charged by police after driving up Snowdon in a 4X4 - and then did it again just weeks later when his 'stubbornness and sheer stupidity got the better of him,' a jury heard today. Craig Williams, 40, of Cheltenham, denies driving dangerously on footpaths and the mountain railway on September 3, 2011 - and then again three weeks later. Outlining the case at Caernarfon Crown Court, where the trial started in Mr Williams' absence, prosecuting counsel Matthew Curtis said on the first occasion a Vauxhall Frontera was found parked 200 metres from the 3,560ft summit. Amazed: Hikers stop and stare at the Vauxhall Frontera 4x4 found on top of Mount Snowdon - for a second time - on September 29 2011. The mountain is the highest in England and Wales . Offroad: Mr Williams, the 40-year-old defendant, of Cheltenham, denies driving a Vauxhall Frontera up the mountain twice in 2011 . Mr Williams had approached police who went up the mountain by railway and confessed to driving the vehicle. Mr Curtis said it was alleged that it was impossible for a car to be driven solely on the footpath. 'It would have had to go on the railway track,' he said, adding there was concern that the points mechanism might have been damaged. He continued: 'Whichever way the vehicle was driven up it was dangerous. The greatest risk might have been to the defendant himself. 'The car could easily have slipped, overturned or gone over the edges.' Mr Williams arriving at Caernarfon Crown Court for an earlier hearing. He faces two counts of dangerous driving . 'In interview the defendant said he woke up early in the morning and decided to drive up Snowdon. 'He drove only on the paths and not the railway tracks.' Mr Williams said he drove up the the Llanberis path and acknowledged the weather was severe and visibility limited, the court heard. The vehicle was removed on September 8 and returned to him. But on the morning of September 29 it was found abandoned on top of the summit complex. There was some damage to the railway and summit path and the vehicle was emblazoned with signs advertising it for sale on eBay. Glued to a window was a sign saying : 'I have made it to the summit' and another stating : 'Hello everyone and welcome to the highest point in England and Wales. My name is Trusty and I am a little legend.' Mr Curtis said Williams denied driving the vehicle on this occasion. Williams claimed the Frontera had vanished while he was 'wild camping'. A note was on a bed at a Llanberis bunkhouse where he was staying which stated: 'Beat you'. However, Mr Curtis said on the night of September 14 the defendant was seen driving near to the Hebron station of the Snowdon Mountain Railway by an off-duty police sergeant. He added: 'The prosecution say this was, on the part of the defendant, clearly reconnaissance. He was there to recce the mountain to help him perhaps complete the feat he hadn't perhaps achieved on the first occasion.' The prosecution said by driving on the railway at certain points it could have caused damage with 'catastrophic consequences'. The prosecution also said it was a 'deliberate and considered' act to gain further attention and complete what might not have been achieved the first time. It was Williams' intention to return and drive it down, it was alleged. Williams had also allegedly bragged to a woman that he would go up again. Prosecutors said the ascent was 'sheer stupidity' as he could easily overturned or plunged down the mountain . Coming down the mountain: The car being taken off the peak on the Snowdon Mountain Railway on September 8 2011 . Louise Griffith, a cleaner at the summit building, said she saw Williams on September 28 and recognised him from the TV news following his first ascent of the peak in a 4x4. 'He said it took him about six hours and he didn't drive it on the railway track,' she said in evidence. 'He said the weather was terrible. The wind was blowing and he was driving sometimes on two wheels and he was hanging off the cliff with the vehicle.' The defendant said if he got away with the first incident he would do it again, she claimed. Questioned by defence barrister Brian Treadwell, Miss Griffith said : 'He was making out he was a cool guy.' Aled Taylor, a retired national park warden, said : 'Around Clogwyn station area the risks would be quite dangerous to the driver himself plus to anyone else who was walking on that path at that time.' It was a long way down to Llanberis Pass if the vehicle went over the edge, he added. He was charged with an offence after the first incident and bailed. The prosecutor added that 'his stubbornness and sheer stupidity got the better of him' and he went up again. The case continues. Mr Williams at an earlier hearing. He did not attend court today .

A woman who suffered five miscarriages in as many years has finally had her dream of a perfect family come true, after taking a daily aspirin. Nurse Dawn Paddock longed for a second child to complete her family but suffered a tragic series of miscarriages. Doctors initially carried out a series of tests on the 33-year-old but were unable to find why she could not reach full term, before she took a colleague's advice about taking aspirin and gave birth to her first child, son Shay two years ago. She then went through a further three miscarriages trying for a second child, before she remembered the daily tablet she had taken during her first pregnancy. Happy family: Mrs Paddock has finally given birth to her second child, daughter Isobel (left) to complete the family she had always wished for with son Shay and husband Christian (right) And to her surprise, doctors told her she had stumbled across the answer to her problems, as they diagnosed her with a blood clotting condition called antiphospholipid syndrome. The breakthrough meant Mrs Paddock and husband Christian, 34, were finally able to make it to full term with a second child, Isobel, thanks to the over-the-counter painkiller. The happy mother-of-two, who now works as a school nurse, said: 'I just kept thinking why - I am not a smoker and I did not drink so I could not understand why I kept having miscarriages. 'I could not face working on the maternity ward again after going through so many miscarriages. 'I had to take a big drop in pay and hours to move job, but I just could not face the heartbreak . 'The only way Christian and I could deal with the pain of a miscarriage was to try and get pregnant again. 'We never wanted Shay to be an only child.' Mother and son: Mrs Paddock gave birth to her first child, son Shay, after taking a daily aspirin following a colleague's recommendation. On holiday: Mrs Paddock's husband Christian with the couple's first child Shay . Doctors warn against self-diagnosing and taking aspirin during pregnancy. Mrs Paddock has now called for all women with a history of miscarraige to have tests for antiphospholipid syndrome, also known as Hughes syndrome or sticky blood. Following her fifth miscarriage Mrs Paddock underwent several tests as doctors desperately tried to find out what was causing her to miscarry. She was sent to Liverpool Women's Hospital where she was diagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome - a blood clotting disorder which can result in miscarriage or stillbirth. Condition: Mrs Paddock was diagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome after she gave birth to Shay, pictured, and was put on a daily dose of aspirin before the birth of Isobel . Four days after her diagnosis Dawn found out she was pregnant again. Doctors put her on blood thinning drug Heparin and she also took an aspirin every day as she had also done with Shay. In June this year Isobel was born five weeks prematurely, but healthily. She fears thousands of other women could be suffering the same pain as her when they already have the cure sat in their bathroom cupboard. She said: 'I told all the doctors I was taking the aspirin and they said it would not do any harm. 'I was going to stop taking it after the 12 week scan, but I was too scared to stop. 'Later the doctor said that Shay's birth was down to the aspirin. 'We were quite tearful when we got the test results back because the doctor said if I had stopped taking the aspirin I would never have given birth to Shay and because it was such a relief to find out we had been doing the right things. 'Just before I fell pregnant with Isobel it was getting to the point where we would have had to give up hope, because it was all getting too painful. 'I worked with people who had miscarriages and I had never heard of antiphospholipid syndrome, which shows how rare it is. 'People need to be more aware of this condition. A £35 blood test could end the agony of unexplained recurrent miscarriage. 'When I am out with the double pushchair people always say ""you are lucky to have one of each"", but I think if only they knew what we had been through to get them.' It is unnecessary to take aspirin in a normal pregnancy, says consultant gynaecologist Clive Spence-Jones, of London's Whittington Hospital. In fact, it's important not to self-medicate at all, and see your GP if you have any health concerns. The reason why aspirin is recommended for women such as Dawn is because she has a disease that can cause abnormal blood clotting. These clots can stop the blood flow between mother and baby through the placenta. Aspirin is known for its anti-clotting properties – it basically thins the blood – and so in women with this condition, it can help prevent  the clots that cause a miscarriage from forming. It may also aid blood flow to the placenta. Antiphospholipid syndrome, also known as sticky blood or Hughes syndrome, accounts for as many as one in five cases of recurrent miscarriage. Women who have suffered three or more unexplained miscarriages should ask their GP to have a test for Hughes syndrome. Treatment is simple and aimed at preventing the formation of clots. Those who test positive are usually given a daily low dose of 75mg aspirin (which is about one quarter of an adult aspirin tablet) combined with another prescription blood thinner, heparin. The combination can reduce the risk of miscarriage in women with Hughes Syndrome by around 50 per cent. Antiphospholipid syndrome can also cause deep vein thrombosis, stroke or a heart attack. THE MEDICINE CABINET STAPLE THAT'S PROVING TO BE A REMARKABLE DRUG . Humble aspirin, the staple of every medicine cabinet, is proving to be a remarkable drug. Originally derived from willow bark, but now synthetically made, it’s been used as a painkiller for years. It’s also widely taken by people with cardiovascular disease or at risk . of stroke due to its ability to cut the risk of blood clots. Most recently, research published last week in The Lancet found taking a . daily low-dose aspirin for five years cut cancer death risk by 37 per . cent. The drug appeared to stop the disease spreading and to ward off certain types of cancer, such as colon and breast.","Dawn Paddock diagnosed with blood clotting condition after miscarriages .

Tincknell likened the stampede to the start of a Harrods sale. He said: 'It really has been phenomenal. We had people queuing from 6.30am on Thursday and the London allocation sold out in days.' The most popular properties were those overlooking the Thames - which come with a multi-million tag.

The most popular properties were those overlooking the Thames - which come with a multi-million asking price . The wave of enthusiasm for the Battersea properties follows a recent surge in house prices, but drop in availability, in areas such as Kensington and Chelsea. The Battersea Power Station development will create 16.8 acres of public open space with over 400m of river frontage, of which nearly 6 acres will be a new riverside park alongside a proposed river-bus facility.The location of a new public park between the Power Station and the river will be a curated space with an extensive calendar of public events.The extensive open space around the Power Station will be known as ‘The Circus’ and is only marginally smaller than the Inner Circle of Regent’s Park.Upon completion in excess of 15,000 people will work at Battersea Power Station across retail, hospitality, commercial, service, community and creative sectors. The first flats and houses are expected to be ready for occupation by 2016 and 2017 and Mr Tincknell is now comfortable all will be sold before building starts. The redevelopment comes after nearly three decades of dereliction for Battersea Power Station. The power station was decommissioned in 1983 and has stood empty while a series of plans to redevelop it failed. It is considered a prime example of 1930s Art Deco architecture and was made famous on the cover of Pink Floyd’s Animals album. Construction work on the site will begin in the summer and will see the removal and individual rebuilding of the four iconic white chimneys of the Grade-II building, to avoid their possible collapse. Preparatory work on the site began in 2012, and the first properties are expected to be completed by 2016. Since Battersea Power Station ceased generating electricity in the 1980s, development proposals for what is Europe's largest brick building have included a Disneyland, a nightclub, a football club and just about about everything in between. Designed by Uruguayan architect Rafael . Vinoly, the complex known as Circus West comprises 1, 2 and 3 bedroom . apartments, townhouses and penthouses.

Identified: The round-faced young man in this 18th century portrait has finally been identified as Austrian composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart . For centuries the identity of the young, grey-haired man in an 18th century portrait has puzzled experts. But the mystery man has now been identified as none other than composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Experts at Salzburg's Mozarteum museum have concluded that the model is indeed the musical genius. Mozart was usually depicted in portraits wearing a powdered white wig, one reason why his identification has taken so long. The researchers said that of 14 known portraits, it is one of the only pictures to show him gazing directly at the viewer and without the wig. Expert Cristoph Grosspietch says the . museum's findings are based on examinations of the portrait and . historical records from the era. A laborious process tried to match other verified portraits of the composer with the mystery painting, produced by an unknown artist. Mr Grosspietch said that the same team of experts concluded . that another portrait, showing a youth holding a bird's nest, was not . Mozart, as had previously been believed. The Austrian is one of the most celebrated composers of the classical era, having inspired western popular music in the centuries since his death in 1971. He composed over 600 works over his lifetime. He was described by tenor Michael Kelly, in his Reminiscences as 'a remarkably small man, very thin and pale, with a profusion of fine, fair hair of which he was rather vain'.

It is marketed as the very best of British, a handbag that has become the season’s must-have accessory after capturing the heart of Pippa Middleton. But what Modalu London’s thousands of admirers may not realise is that their favourite brand has hired a firm in India to make the bags, using workers on the lowest rung  of the social ladder who are paid as little as 17p an hour for their efforts. Modalu has gone to great lengths to associate its flagship bag with the sister of the Duchess of Cambridge, naming it after her, describing her on its website as ‘our biggest fan’ and giving her four free bags to ensure she is seen as often as possible in public displaying its wares. Costly: Modalu bags soared in popularity after Pippa (pictured left) was spotted carrying them after the Royal Wedding. The people that make them in India (one worker pictured right) are paid just 17p an hour . The Hampshire company sells the Pippa bag in the UK for £195 and boasts: ‘We believe that quality and style don’t have to cost the earth.’ In reality, however, someone has to pay the price – in this instance, the workers at Modalu’s tannery in the Indian port of Madras. Anyone looking at the Modalu London name and assuming that their exquisitely hand-tooled bag is the work of British craftsmen and women can think again, because this is a bag very much made in India. Yesterday, I visited the factory that makes Pippa’s much-loved bags. The plant lies down a narrow lane in a rundown industrial area. Nearby is a nullah – a foul-smelling open drain choked with rubbish. Rundown: The tannery in Madras lies down a narrow lane next to a nullah, an open drain choked with rubbish . Many of the staff are Dalit workers – those at the bottom of the social scale. Once known as Untouchables, they are paid at rates that fall far below an acceptable standard of  living – even for India. Modalu is owned by the TLG Brands company, which has been keen to cash in on the association with Pippa. It has registering the names ‘Pippa’ and ‘Pippa by Modalu’ as trademarks. According to chief executive Mike Hiscock, Pippa’s patronage has boosted sales from £10,000 a month to £500,000. Modalu has outsourced production to two facilities in Madras in Tamil Nadu, India’s southernmost state and the centre of its leather industry. They are owned by Intan Exim Private Ltd, run by Tridip Dugar. His leather is produced by his Creative Tannery Ltd and the bags are put together at the Tanstyle factory. In the bag: Pippa Middleton carries a taupe version of the bag out the day after her sister's wedding . Modalu, like a number of UK-based handbag firms, has experienced a boom because of a craze for the traditional ‘English craftsman’ look. But surprisingly few are made in Britain because of labour costs. Only 30 per cent of Mulberry bags, whose hugely popular Bayswater sells at £795, are made in the UK. The rest come from Spain and Turkey. Smythson’s £597 tote bags are produced in the UK, Spain and Italy, while the £99 Marks & Spencer tote is made in India and Bangladesh. Although Modalu’s is not a sweatshop – the factory is clean, with  ceiling fans to cool staff – there  is no escaping the fact that some  of these people are the most  poorly paid in India. Higher castes  generally refuse to work with the hides of cattle, which are considered by many Hindus to be sacred animals. In India, the minimum legal wage differs between states but the figure for a leather worker in Tamil Nadu is low compared with those in the same industry in other states. It is 121.9 rupees for an eight-hour day, equal to £1.39, or about 17p an hour. A worker on these wages – £431.58 a year – would take five-and-a-half months to earn enough to buy a Pippa bag. Yesterday at the factory, rows of finished Pippa bags were piled up near the entrance – each worker makes an average of three a day. Although I was not allowed to interview individual workers in the  factory, Mr Dugar said that none had any idea who Pippa Middleton was. While women glued reinforcements into the panels and prepared them for stitching, some workers sat at sewing machines and others stood in lines, assembling the final product. On a table were several Pippa grab bags in violet, labelled for sale at £225. This is a special dyed leather and so more expensive, but there were plenty of others in different colours – cherry, toffee and baby blue. Demand for the Pippa range began to boom after she was spotted with  a Modalu bag after the Royal Wedding. ‘It became a craze and it was a really good reaction,’ Mr Dugar said. ‘They immediately requested to make personalised bags for Pippa.’ Mr Dugar said his highest paid workers could earn 30,000 to 35,000 rupees a month (£350-£405), while skilled cutters could earn 20,000 rupees a month (£231). But he admitted that workers start on the minimum wage of 17p an hour; the typical wage is estimated at 24p. Modalu has outsourced production to two facilities in Madras in Tamil Nadu in India. Although the factory is clean, the workers are the most poorly paid in India . The leather for the bags is produced at Creative Tannery Ltd (pictured). Surprisingly few Modalu bags are made in the UK because of high labour costs . He said wages rose year on year and depending on improvements in a worker’s efforts, but he also admitted there had not been any rise in wages as a result of the increase  in demand for Modalu bags. A study last year by the respected Asian Floor Wage Alliance calculated that the minimum living wage – the amount needed to live a basic but decent existence in India – was 12,096 rupees a month, or £138, far higher than the £35.96 which Mr Dugar’s lowest paid workers earn. Mr Hiscock said: ‘The difficulty  in finding a factory which had the capacity to meet our demand limited our options. We hope to have some manufacturing in the UK by the  end of 2013. I don’t know the exact labour costs, but we do carry out independent factory audits.’","Rate of pay falls below an acceptable standard of living - even for India .

Agatha Christie's debonaire detective leans on his cane with his top hat tucked under his arm, looking like a man who knows his own worth. Now auction bidders have been driven to distraction by the image of the legendary Belgian detective on the front of a rare edition, paying a world record price for the novel that originally cost 37p. The copy of Poirot Investigates sold for over £40,000 - smashing the world record price for a book by the author. Bidding frenzy: the dust jacket showing a picture of the Belgian detective sold for over £40,000 - smashing the world record price for a book by the author . Pulling power: The 1924 dust jacket of Poirot Investigates that drove auction bidders to distraction . The 1924 edition was worth so much because it came with its dust jacket showing a picture of the Belgian detective. Collectors and dealers were frantically bidding for the collection of short stories that had a pre-sale estimate of £3,000 to £5,000. The image bears more than a passing resemblance to Poirot as played by actor David Suchet and shows the famously egotistical detective wearing a morning suit with bow tie, spats and carrying his top hat and white gloves. The collection of Poirot stories without its valuable dust cover . When it was published, the book cost 7/6 - equivalent to 37.5 pence - but sold for a hammer price of £34,000 at auction. With premiums added on, the sum went up to £40,630. The previous record for a Christie book is believed to have been a copy of her first novel, Mysterious Affair At Styles. It sold in 2009 for £10,000 but has now been put into the shade by the sale at Dominic Winter saleroom near Cirencester, Gloucestershire. Agatha Christie, who also wrote under the name Mary Westmacott, died in 1976 having written more than 70 detective novels, most famously featuring her creations Hercule Poirot and Miss Jane Marple. Chris Albury, from Dominic Winter auction house, said: 'We had a sense that this might happen, but it really took off. 'Every once in a while a rare and collectable first edition turns up in a dust wrapper that has never been seen on the open market before, or at least in living memory of the specialists. 'This is one such book and while it may not be the first Poirot book, it is the first to feature the detective’s name in the title and the first to show a portrait of him. 'The standing, confident figure that stares out at the reader is instantaneously recognisable to anyone familiar with David Suchet’s portrayals. 'Agatha Christie had previously published Poirot books and the editor of The Sketch was a fan and commissioned some more. 'They were later published and the . Sketch’s image of Poirot was used on the dust jacket. And the fact this . had a dust jacket made it incredibly rare. Separated at birth: Poirot portrayed by David Suchet (left) and the sleuth on the 1924 book cover (right) 'There might be some others with the Christie family but for collectors this was probably the only chance they would have of owning one. 'The dust jacket was a little bit chipped but was in a remarkable fresh condition. 'Most people would have probably thrown the dust jacket away after they bought the book, which is why there are so few left.' Mr Jonkers, of Jonkers Rare Books, said: 'It is very uncommon to find this in a dust wrapper and I know of only two others in existence. 'I think I got it rather cheaply and would have paid a great deal more for it. 'The book is uncommon in its own right as are all books by Christie before she moved to Collins in 1926.

Tilly Sawford suffered 86 per cent burns to her entire body after falling into bath of scalding water . When she fell into a bath of scalding hot water at only 15 months old, doctors gave Tilly Sawford a five per cent chance of survival. Five times they warned her devastated parents Emma and Kyle that their little girl would probably not survive – and five times she pulled through. Four years and 321 operations later, Tilly is a happy schoolgirl, described as a ‘living triumph’ by her astonished doctors. Tilly suffered her horrific injuries in March 2009, when one of her brothers accidentally turned on the hot tap while she climbed on a beanbag next to the bath. Because of a fault with the boiler, the water was scalding. Mrs Sawford had left her for just a few seconds to nip downstairs. Mrs Sawford, 26, recalled: 'I was cleaning upstairs at home and my washing machine had finished running downstairs. 'Normally I put Tilly in her cot if I can't see her, but she was playing with her Princess Kitchen. I went downstairs for a few seconds. 'I heard a scream and ran back upstairs. Tilly was in the bath tub. She must have leaned over and fallen in. 'Her eyes rolled back and she went unconscious with the pain. I picked her up straight away and pulled the plug out. Her skin was coming off in my hands. 'I think I started to go into shock, I couldn't speak properly, it was awful. 'Tilly was only in the water for seconds but it was enough to cause her to pass out with the pain.' Tilly's mother Emma (pictured) found her then 15-month-old daughter Tilly lying in a bath a quarter-filled with scalding hot water. The tap had been turned on accidentally by one of her other children . Doctors have described Tilly as a 'living triumph' after they said they had never seen a child with burns as bad. She and her husband rushed Tilly to the Queen's Medical Centre . before she was transferred to a specialist burns unit at Birmingham . Children's Hospital at 3am where she underwent a 12-hour operation. 'It felt like the wind had been knocked out of me, my world started to fall apart,' said Mrs Sawford. 'I genuinely thought I'd lost my daughter. I thought several times that I would be planning a funeral. 'The fact she hadn't died is a miracle - I'm so grateful. 'We've since had to move out of that house because it brings back too many bad memories.' Doctors told the couple to expect the worst after they said they had never seen a child with burns as bad as Tilly's. But she made an incredible recovery and even took a few steps while recovering in Birmingham. She now uses a walking frame or a pair of crutches to help her get around at school, which she started last September. Tilly's injuries were so severe after the accident that doctors gave her just a five per cent chance of survival. Tilly defied the odds after having hundreds of operations - including having shark cartilage and cow collagen grafted onto her skin . Her mother said:  'She can walk a little bit, she struggles to get up the stairs but she normally gets on really well. She's so independent, she doesn't like me doing stuff for her unless she really needs it. 'Tilly absolutely loves school, she's got so many friends and she loves going. She'll go to get the register for the teacher and enjoys playing with her friends. Tilly now uses a walking frame or a pair of crutches to help her get around at school . 'She tries to do everything, you never see her upset or grumpy, it's absolutely amazing, she just gets on with it. 'I'm just thankful every day because it's just amazing that she's alive. Her legs have been bad recently but we're hoping to get her into horse riding if we can, she absolutely loves it.' The smiling youngster enjoys playing with brothers Toby, eight, Kaden, six, and sister Elise, three. Mrs Sawford added: It's been a complete emotional roller-coaster. It has been incredibly hard at times. I just want her to have the best future possible. 'Her wounds mean the skin tightens and she wasn't able to straighten her leg for a long time. 'I am so grateful for the care she has received - it's because of that care that she is here today.' Tilly has made a miracle recovery after having her 321st operation . Children's burns surgeon Ciaran O'Boyle, from Nottingham's Queen's Medical Centre, said that Tilly had the worst case of burns he had ever seen. He said: 'Tilly's personality is inspiring. She has been put through a lot and it has not phased her at all. The most remarkable and surprising thing about Tilly is that she survived. 'She is a living triumph. Had she not had the right care in that first 24 hours she would have died.' Yesterday, Tilly underwent her 321st operation at the Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham. She is now recovering from at home in Strelley, Nottinghamshire. She said: 'I feel better than I used to, I can't wait to get back to school and play with my friends. I love singing too, I always sing whenever I can. School is a lot of fun, counting is my favourite thing to do.'","Tilly Sawford fell into the boiling water when she was 15 months old .

Armstrong started dating Crow in 2003 and the couple were briefly engaged before calling it quits for good in 2006. Scroll down for video . Former flame: Armstrong is pictured with Grammy-winning singer Sheryl Crow in this 2005 photo . Accusers: Frankie Andreu, left, and his wife Betsy are pictured with Armstrong in this 1995 image released by the USADA as a part of Betsy Andreu's affidavit, one that accuses Armstrong of lying about doping . Sheryl knew: The singer was previously silent over former fiance's doping scandal . Celebuzz reported that she was twice named in affidavits given to the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency by Betsy Andreu that alleged Armstrong had used performance enhancing substances. Crow herself has not spoken about the doping allegations. In an interview last year with Katie Couric, she said: I felt bad. I felt bad for [Armstrong], I felt bad for his family and I kinda felt like the rest of America.' Crow's reps did not immediately respond to a request for comment. She added: 'He is a hero that we watched and looked up to and admired.' Armstrong refrained from mentioning Crow in his landmark admission interview with Oprah Winfrey that aired last week on her OWN network. After the interview aired, Betsy Andreu spoke to CNN and was on the verge of tears as she spoke of her disbelief and disappointment that the disgraced athlete didn't come clean. Support: Armstrong, seen here at the 2005 Tour de France with Crow and his three children from his . first marriage . The disgraced cyclist battled to fight back tears as he talked about son Luke . Armstrong told Oprah that he believes he deserves to be given the opportunity to compete again . She said: 'He owed it to me. You owed it . to me, Lance, and you dropped the ball. After what you’ve done to me . and what you’ve done to my family, and you couldn’t own up to it? Now . we’re supposed to believe you? 'You had one chance at the truth, and . this was it. If the hospital room didn't happen then just say it didn't . happen. But he won't do it because it DID happen. 'That's . not being transparent. That's not being completely honest. By saying he . won't go there is just skirting around the issue. 'This exchange has made me furious. He used to be my friend and he decimated me. I was willing to give him a . chance and this is how he responds? It just doesn't make sense.' Armstrong was close to tears at times when he spoke about the impact of his drug cheating on his family during the second part of his exclusive interview with Oprah Winfrey on Friday night. Winfrey also drew Armstrong out on . his ex-wife, Kristin, whom he claimed knew just enough about both the . doping and lying to ask him to stop. He credited her with making him . promise that his comeback in 2009 would be drug-free. Ex: Winfrey drew Armstrong out on his ex-wife, Kristin, right, whom he claimed knew just enough about both the doping and lying to ask him to stop .

And I said, ""You've got a deal,'"" he replied. 'And I never would have betrayed that with her.' Armstrong has also been romantically linked to fashion designer Tory Burch, whom he dated in 200, but her knowledge of the cyclist's doping is not known. Speaking about his 13-year-old son . Luke, the oldest of his five children, Armstrong told Oprah: 'I saw my son . defending me and saying, ""That's not true. What you're saying about my . dad is not true.'"" 'That's when I knew I had to tell him.' Critics said Armstrong hadn't been contrite enough in the first half of the interview, but on Friday night he seemed to lose his composure when Winfrey zeroed in on the emotional drama involving his personal life.

My career. Whether I doped or did not dope. I've always denied that and I've always been ruthless and defiant about . that. You guys have seen that. That's probably why you trusted me on . it."" Which makes it even sicker,’ Armstrong said. 'And uh, I told Luke, I said,' and here Armstrong paused for a long time to collect himself, 'I said, ""Don't defend me anymore. Don't.'"" 'If anyone says anything to you, do not defend me. Just say my dad said he was sorry'. 'He said ""look, I love you, you're my dad, this won't change that."" Armstrong said his lowest moment was having to cut ties with his charity which he described as like a 'sixth child' to him . 'Thank God he's more like Kristin (Armstrong's first wife and Luke's mother).' Armstrong also confirmed he has been undergoing therapy to deal with his demons. Armstrong was competing in triathlons, mountain bike events and marathons before he was sanctioned and believes he deserves that opportunity in the future, suggesting a life ban is not right.

More than 5,000 soldiers are being axed in a fresh round of defence cuts – despite Britain wading deeper into the battle against terrorists in Africa. Former commanders said the controversial cuts were ‘too deep’, leaving the Army perilously overstretched and unable to take on all the major military commitments demanded by ministers. Under the latest round of redundancies, the Army will shrink to 90,000 – its lowest level since before the Napoleonic Wars began 200 years ago. Some troops currently risking life and limb on the front line in Afghanistan face the axe next year, the Government admitted. Defence Secretary Philip Hammond, pictured meeting troops in Camp Bastion, will announce the third round of job losses . Ministers revealed the bleak news just . hours after Prince Harry returned from flying attack helicopters . against the Taliban in Helmand. The announcement also came after David . Cameron said Britain would be at the forefront of a ‘generational . struggle’ to confront and destroy Al Qaeda-linked extremists in North . Africa. While he has ruled out sending combat . troops, he is preparing to deploy Sentinal R1 spy planes and special . forces in the wake of the insurgency in Mali and the Algerian terror . attack. But critics raised concerns about the . wisdom of continuing to slash the Armed Forces when the battle against . Islamic fanatics was shifting to Africa. Colonel Richard Kemp, who . commanded British forces in Afghanistan, said: ‘These cuts are too deep. On Monday the PM said we had a decades-long struggle with international . terrorism, as illustrated by recent events in Algeria and in Mali. Mr Hammond said medics in the Navy and Air Force would be cut in the next round of job losses . ‘This struggle cannot be maintained . without sufficient resources. 'The PM and his successors will continue to . commit British troops to defend the nation’s interests overseas, . irrespective of how small the forces gets. ‘Of course our troops will rise to the . challenge but in doing so they will pay a price in overstretched and . inadequate equipment. ‘The cost of our fight against world . jihad has to be paid by somebody and it should be the taxpayer – the . soldier should not be called upon to bear an unequal burden.’ This Government has been responsible for some of the most severe defence cuts ever. Under the Strategic Defence and . Security Review (SDSR), the MoD said it would cut the Army from 102,000 . to 82,000 – small enough for every soldier to fit inside Wembley . Stadium. Some 5,000 personnel each from the RAF and Navy have already . been made redundant. The Government wants to replace regular troops by . doubling the number of part-time soldiers to 30,000. Shadow defence secretary Jim Murphy . called for the ‘flawed’ defence review to be reopened because it had . been ‘exposed by world events’. He said: ‘The threats have increased and . yet the Army is being cut. The Prime Minister rightly spoke of the . urgency of the Islamist terror threat to the UK from North Africa. Captain Wales as he is known in the British Army, races out from the VHR (very high ready-ness) tent to scramble his Apache with fellow Pilots, during his 12 hour shift at the British controlled flight-line in Camp Bastion southern Afghanistan . David Cameron was challenged in the Commons yesterday by former Lib Dem leader Sir Menzies Campbell over the impact of cuts on Britain's ability to mount military operations around the world . 'But . in a “carry on regardless” strategy, the Ministry of Defence has . announced 5,000 Army redundancies. ‘There are real worries about the . military impact of a loss of skills and capability at a time of . increased threats and new global challenges. Many will fear ministers . are unprepared for threats we face.’ Defence Minister Mark Francois . insisted the Armed Forces retained the capabilities required ‘to meet . the challenges of the future’. Redundancies would not ‘impact adversely’ on operations in Afghanistan, he said. Defence Secretary Philip Hammond . added: 'The Army is actively managing recruitment to reach the target . numbers, but unfortunately redundancies are unavoidable due to the size . of the defence deficit that this Government inherited and the consequent . scale of downsizing required in the Army.’ Ministers are taking the axe to the . Armed Forces to save £4.7billion from the defence budget and plug a . £38billion equipment overspend. The latest round of redundancies . affects junior soldiers to senior ranks. Personnel preparing for, . serving on, or recovering from operations on June 18 – the day . redundancy notices will be issued – or recuperating from a serious . injury will be exempt unless they volunteer. But ministers warned that the Army . will feel one more bout of pain, with as many as 4,000 troops made . redundant next year, as well as Royal Navy and RAF medics. The prospect of more sackings will be a . blow to morale for troops who are seeing their pay, pensions and living . allowances squeezed.","Defence Secretary Philip Hammond reveals third round of redundancies .

'If I ever did an interview for the press I wasn't allowed to express an opinion on that and of course I had an opinion so it releases me now to be able to speak about it.' When one of the presenters described how they got 'really, really angry' listening to gay marriage debates in the Parliament, Ms Arnold agreed saying 'It brings out . some horrible stuff doesn’t it and it brings out some very unkind . thoughts and expressions, I think.

She originally made claims for being unemployed and later received benefits for being a lone parent after her partner left the household. During that time she failed to notify authorities that she was the registered owner of Carleton Lodge. After her arrest Moscicki claimed to have given the property to her father as she could no longer afford it. Moscicki from Pontefract, pleaded guilty to making a false statement to obtain benefit. Mitigating, Michael Smith said: 'Her father, who was a man of some means, wanted to buy the property with the aim of developing it into a block of flats.' Leeds Crown Court heard her father wanted to buy the property to develop it into a block of flats, but Moscicki had to put her name on the mortgage as her father had county court judgements against him . Mr Smith said her father was unable to obtain a mortgage in his own name as he had county court judgements against him so his daughter agreed to put it in her own name. He said: 'From day one her father paid the mortgage and she was simply the person whose name went in the documents. 'When she filled the (benefit) forms in she assumed that she had no other assets. It doesn’t make her guilty of dishonesty. It makes her guilty of failing to declare a fact.' Mr Smith said Moscicki has no previous convictions and her father had repaid the illegally claimed money. Judge Rodney Jameson QC ordered Moscicki to do 100 hours unpaid work and made her the subject of a 12 month community order. The judge told her: 'I do not regard this as a trivial matter. But someone in your position does not require me to impose a custodial sentence.'","Jo-Ann Moscicki claimed benefits while owner of house with £1m mortgage .

The son of Liverpool FC manager Brendan Rodgers was one of four footballers who sexually assaulted a drunken teenager and took pictures as a ‘permanent record of their conquest’, a court was told yesterday. Anton Rodgers and three others allegedly assaulted the 19-year-old woman in a hotel room after a night out celebrating a cup win, a jury heard. The Liverpool boss was at the Old Bailey yesterday for the opening of the trial of Rodgers, 19, and fellow Brighton and Hove Albion players Lewis Dunk, 21, and George Barker, 21. Accused: Anton Rodgers, left, and Steve Cook, right, were among the group who allegedly assaulted a drunken 19-year-old woman in a hotel room as they celebrated a victory for their club . Denial: The footballers, including George Barker, left, and Lewis Dunk, right, deny sexual assault . Former team-mate Steve Cook, 21, who now plays for Bournemouth, is also among the accused. All four men deny sexual assault. Rodgers, Barker and Dunk, from Brighton, and Cook, from St Leonards-on-Sea, East Sussex, also deny voyeurism. The court heard how the men had taken . the woman to the Jurys Inn Hotel in Brighton and allegedly waited until . she was asleep before assaulting her in a ‘deliberately humiliating . way’. The woman discovered photographs of herself on Rodgers’ phone the next morning after she had borrowed it to call her sister. She did not tell police for six months . after the alleged assault ‘through fear of repercussions’, but finally . did so after another player at the club hinted at putting the images on . YouTube. Arrival: Brendan Rodgers arriving at the Old Bailey with his son Anton Rodgers, who has been accused of sexual assault along with three other footballers . Richard Barton, prosecuting, said: ‘This is a case of a group . of men taking advantage of a woman who through a combination of drink . and tiredness, ended up unconscious.. ‘She was not in a condition to resist, . give consent or prevent things happening.’ He added that it was not a . case of a young woman who did things when drunk that she later . regretted. The players had met the woman in a . Brighton nightclub called Lola Lo as they celebrated a victory in the . Sussex Senior Cup in July 2011. Mr Barton told how the woman had woken . up semi-naked in the hotel room at 11am the following morning in a . double bed with Anton Rodgers, who was wearing only his underwear. Another player, Ben Sampayo, was asleep on a single bed in the room, which had been booked for them by the club. Hearing: The court heard the woman could remember waking up in a hotel room the next day in a double bed next to Anton Rodgers, pictured here arriving at court with his father Brendan Rodgers . Location: The Jury's Inn Hotel, in Brighton, where the offences were said to have happened . Liverpool FC manager Brendan Rodgers arrives at the court where his son Anton Rodgers is accused of sexually assaulting a 19-year-old woman . The woman had tried to telephone her . sister but her mobile phone battery was dead. Mr Barton said she asked . to use Rodgers’ BlackBerry phone. He was reluctant at first but . eventually agreed. On the phone, Mr Barton said, she found ‘a whole series of photographs of a young woman wearing a pink dress’. In some, there were semi-naked men around her, he added. ‘She looked at some of the many . photographs and then realised to her horror that the unconscious woman . in the pink dress was in  fact herself.’ The woman, now 21, gave evidence against the four players from behind a curtain. She told how she had woken up next to Rodgers, adding: ‘I felt ashamed, embarrassed. I couldn’t believe it had happened. ‘I was angry. I told him to delete them. He said he was not going  to delete them. He was not at all concerned.’ Mr Barton added: ‘The indifference . shown towards her by Rodgers and the others that morning is indicative . of the group’s overall attitude to her and the events the night before.’ The trial continues.

And as the 28-year-old prince says, the unit's Go Ugly Early motto does indeed reflect the nature of the 662 Squadron (AAC), as it navigates the £45m Apache helicopters over war-ravaged Afghanistan. But the motto might also be familiar with revellers out on the tiles up and down Britain's towns and cities every week, as it is often used by those 'on the pull'. According to some, the term is used by . those who have decided not to pursue the most attractive of potential . partners while in a bar or a club, and instead settle for 'pulling' early on. Scroll down for video . Cheeky motto: The 662 Squadron's 'Go Ugly Early' badge, worn by members of the unit including Prince Harry . 'Ugly' job: The prince does not know the history of the motto, but describes the squadron as a 'pretty ugly beast' To Prince Harry however, the 'Ugly' call sign of the 'very cool' Apaches he flew over Afghanistan on daily missions during his four-month tour of duty is a badge of honour. He said: 'I don't know the story behind that, but I've always wanted to be an Ugly.' Captain Wales, as he is known in the army, is no stranger to the firepower of the aircraft, after guiding them towards enemy locations during his first deployment in Helmand Province. 'Ever since I was a JTAC (Joint Terminal Attack Controller) back in 2009, whenever it was (2007-08), speaking to the Uglies was always the number one,' he said. 'Things have changed now. We've got no Harriers any more, the Tornados are working elsewhere, so this is the choice platform as far as we're concerned for the guys on the ground. 'I don't know where Ugly came from but it is a pretty ugly beast, and I think it's very cool.' Dream job: Prince Harry's dream has come true now he is flying the Apache helicopters .

It went overseas to Normandy in June 1944 and was active throughout the rest of the campaign in North West Europe before it disbanded on December 15, 1945. It was reformed on May 1, 1949 as the No 662 Royal Auxiliary Air Force Squadron, based at RAF Colerne. The squadron was then disbanded again in March 1957, after comprising a number of detached flights, along with all RAuxAF flying squadrons. It became part of the AAC in 1971 when they reformed as part of 3 Regiment Army Air Corps, in Soest, Germany. The regiment was then drawndown at the end of 1992. It is currently located at Wattisham, in Suffolk.","Prince Harry always wanted to be called an 'Ugly' and fly Apache helicopters .

"By . Ian Drury, Defence Correspondent . PUBLISHED: . 08:44 EST, 22 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 20:00 EST, 22 January 2013 . The RAF cannot refuel its new £650million spy planes in mid-air, it has been revealed. In a fresh humiliation for the Ministry of Defence, it emerged that Britain must rely on other nations to fill up the RC-135 Rivet Joint aircraft once it is in the skies. Military analysts warned that crucial reconnaissance missions could be jeopardised by the UK's failure to act independently. But the Ministry of Defence said fuel efficient engines allow the plane to operate for longer while avoiding the spiralling costs and delays involved in converting it. Ministers bought three second-hand Rivet Joints from the U.S. Air Force in March 2010 to eavesdrop on enemy communications. Renamed the Airseeker by the RAF, the . vintage jets are being introduced to replace the Nimrod surveillance . planes axed in 2011 after one blew up over Afghanistan, killing all 14 . men on board. Scroll down for video . The MoD is converting three former U.S.A.F RC-135s at a cost of £650m and renaming them 'Airseekers' (file pic) The aircraft, due to enter service in 2014, are currently being fitted with state-of-the-art spying equipment to gather intelligence and intercept communications including radar and voice transmissions. But the RAF has been forced to admit that it will only be able to fuel the planes while they are stationary on the ground - making it impossible for them to carry out airborne missions of more than 12 hours without begging allies for help. The problem is that the U.S. Air Force and other Nato countries use a different method of air-to-air refuelling than the RAF. The U.S. uses a boom refuelling system so a tanker aircraft would fly ahead of the Rivet Joint and pass back a rigid, hollow pipe which fits into its tank so fuel can be pumped into it - similar to how a car would be filled up at a petrol station. The MoD have purchased three RC-135 Rivet aircraft, pictured, from the U.S. Airforce which use different methods for refuelling . The £650million planes will be unable to refuel in mid-air without help from other nations . The Airseeker can hold a crew of 27 including three pilots, two navigators and 22 rear crew. It weighs 146 tonnes when fully loaded and is 136ft long with a 130ft wingspan. With a top speed of 580mph, it has a range of 3,450 miles and can hit a maximum altitude of 50,000ft. The MoD expects them to be fully operational by 2014. The RAF, on the other hand, refuels mid-air using a method called 'probe and drogue'. British military tankers trail behind them a shuttlecock-shaped basket known as a 'drogue' on the end of a hose. The plane being refuelled then places a 7-inch probe into this to fill up its tank. The tankers carry 100,000 litres of fuel which is passed to other planes at 5,000 litres a minute - 125 times the speed of garage forecourt pumps. An ex-RAF officer said: 'It seems to be a terrible blunder. The MoD attitude is we don't need to refuel it inflight but that's absolute rubbish. 'For a lot of missions, maybe you don't. But if we need to, we can't. 'We'd have to beg the U.S. or the French for help and if they don't agree with what we're doing they could turn around and say, ""No, we won't"". 'We are losing a sovereign strategic asset and that is a dangerous position to be in.' Critics claim the MoD replaced the Nimrod with Rivet Joint jets because the cash-strapped department could not stretch to buying modern aircraft. Airseekers were bought from the U.S. Airforce to replace Nimrods (pictured) which were axed in 2011 after one aircraft blew up . Nimrod planes used to be used for surveillance purposes but they had to be ditched by the MoD due to safety concerns . The spy planes are being converted from KC-135 Stratotankers, built in 1964, in Greenville, Texas. Once delivered they will be operated by 51 Squadron at RAF Waddington in Lincolnshire, . RAF sources said the Rivet Joint  can fly for up to ten hours without refuelling so commanders would rarely need to rely on their allies for assistance. But they said fitting the spy plane with RAF-friendly mid-air refuelling capabilities would have seen costs spiral 'astronomically' and delay the introduction of the aircraft for several years. One officer said: 'This is not the gold-standard but that was not possible in the time frame we wanted to have the planes in operation. 'Would we like to be able to refuel independently? Yes. Is it essential? No.' It is not the first refuelling glitch to hit the RAF. Last year, the MoD faced criticism after it emerged its new £10.5billion refuelling planes did not work on British fighter jets. Tests revealed that the new fleet of giant Voyager tankers leaked fuel when trying to fill up RAF Tornados and Typhoons mid-flight. Engineers discovered 'problems' with the connecting pipes which join the aircraft so fuel can be pumped to the warplanes. Defence sources said the MoD had opted to buy the aircraft 'off the shelf' to ensure the RAF had the operational intelligence and surveillance capability in service more swiftly. An MoD spokesman said: 'Airseeker will shortly provide the RAF with a vital surveillance and intelligence capability. 'Air-to-air refuelling is not essential for the aircraft as Airseeker's new fuel efficient engines allow it to operate for longer. Where required, it can be refuelled by the UK's Nato allies and the US.'","Three second hand RC-135 jets have been bought from the U.S Air Force to replace the RAF's Nimrod .

Prime Minister David Cameron, pictured outside Number 10 today, is due to deliver his long-awaited speech on Europe tomorrow . Dozens of Tory MPs are to launch a campaign to keep Britain in the European Union, fearing ties with Brussels could be severed almost by accident. David Cameron will use his long-awaited speech on Europe to warn Britain could ‘drift towards the exit’ without major reforms before pledging a referendum on membership of the EU. More than 30 pro-European Conservatives are preparing to back the idea of a full in/out referendum, believing the anti-EU faction of the party has dominated the debate so far. The Prime Minister has made clear he wants the UK to remain in the EU only if significant powers can be returned from Brussels. In his speech in London tomorrow he will argue that major changes to the structure of Europe among Eurozone countries present an opportunity for Britain to renegotiate its relationship. Mr Cameron had been due to deliver the speech in Amsterdam last Friday, but called it off with hours to go to focus on the Algerian hostage crisis. The PM will promise to seek ‘fresh consent’ from the British people on a new settlement with Europe in a referendum, although to date he has stopped short of promising a straight in/out choice fearing Britain could vote to leave. In a surprise poll yesterday it emerged that more people would now vote to stay that would back withdrawal. Forty per cent of people said they would vote to remain while 34 per cent would vote to leave, according to the YouGov poll carried out on January 17 and 18. Five per cent said they would not vote and 20 per cent said they did not know. The result has buoyed Tories who consider themselves ‘euro realists’ who believe Britain should remain in the EU. Mr Cameron interrupted putting the finishing touches to his speech for a meeting with Emir of Qatar Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani on the steps of Number 10 . Tory MP Laura Sandys said that for too long pro-Europeans in the party had been afraid to speak out publicly. She . told MailOnline: ‘It has been an issue that not would dare speak its . name in the Conservative party. Now things are changing. ‘There will be a lot of varying and surprising views right across the board.’ She warns against ‘Odd Man Out diplomacy’ and a referendum on staying in the EU can be won. Policing minister Damian Green last . year dismissed as a ‘fantasy’ the idea that Britain could remain in the . common market but outside the EU. He is expected to play a leading role . in the pro-European campaign. By . embracing the idea of a referendum and putting forward a positive . message for Britain staying in the EU, the co-ordinators of the campaign . want to play down recent warnings from Lord Heseltine that a referendum . was a ‘gamble’. Tory MP Laura Sandys insists a referendum on Britain staying in Europe could be won, defying warnings from fellow pro-European Lord Heseltine that an in/out vote would be a 'gamble' In the Commons today Foreign Secretary William Hague was of changing his mind over holding an in/out referendum. Shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander asked: 'If he believes that an immediate in-out referendum will cause uncertainty, why would an in-out referendum many years from now not cause uncertainty?' But Mr Hague hit back arguing that: 'No minds change more often on this subject than on the front bench opposite.' Mr Cameron's much-hyped speech was first promised in July last year, after he used a newspaper article to admit: 'For me the two words “Europe” and “referendum” can go together.' He was due to deliver the speech first in the summer, then the autumn, before admitting in December that he was taking a 'tantric' approach to policy-making. In-out question: For the first time since David Cameron became PM more people would vote to stay in the EU than leave, according to a series of opinion polls by YouGov . Extracts released last week showed that he will use the speech to warn EU leaders that Britain could leave the 27-nation bloc if three key concerns are not resolved. But Downing Street has declined to comment on weekend press reports that he will announce an in/out referendum to be held after the 2015 general election, but rule out legislation during this parliament. Lib Dem president Tim Farron today insisted his party would take a more constructive approach to Europe than the Tories. 'It is important that we clarify we’re the party in coalition that believes in a sane, mature, collegiate approach to our European colleagues rather than just throwing crockery at them,' he told BBC2's Daily Politics.","More than 30 'Euro-realists' back an in/out referendum believing British will vote to remain part of the European Union .

Philip Morton: Paedophile wrote about how he 'fell for' a 15-year-old girl in an autobiography he called The Loves And Heartaches Of My Life . A paedophile who wrote down details of his abuse of a 15-year-old girl in an autobiography he called The Loves And Heartaches Of My Life has been jailed for five years. Philip Morton, 56, documented his indecent assaults on the teenager between 1994 and 1995 in the book, which was discovered by police officers searching his house in Lincolnshire. In it Morton described giving the girl gifts of earrings and a walkie-talkie so they could speak to one another at night, and wrote: 'I found myself falling for her... I spent a lot of time with her'. Morton also said in his book - which was not a published title but a paper document he kept at his home - that his victim would sleep in his bed. Humberside Police said officers had obtained intelligence that led them to procure a search warrant for Morton's house in Immingham, near Grimsby, last February. As well as the harrowing book, officers found more than 17,000 indecent images of children on his computer - around 100 of which fell within the most offensive category. Prosecutor Mark Kendall told Grimsby Crown Court that police uncovered over a million images on a series of hard drives stored at Morton's house, but that limited resources meant it was impossible to say how many were indecent. The court heard Morton had used encrypting software to hide some of the images, as well as details of websites he visited and the words he typed into search engines. When interviewed by police, Morton claimed he had made up parts of the book and that the young girl had told him she was 16 years old. He also told officers he had ended the relationship. When police traced his now adult victim, she gave details of the indecent assaults and told them she had viewed Morton as 'a father figure'. 'Appalling breach of trust': Morton was jailed for five years at Grimsby Crown Court and placed on the sex offenders register for life . Morton admitted 14 offences of possession of indecent images and two offences of indecent assault on a 15-year-old girl. Judge Mark Bury told Morton: 'You were in a position of trust. You have breached that trust in an appalling way.' The judge said of the thousands of indecent images found in Morton's home: 'There was an organisation and sophistication which was amassed over a number of years.' Richard Butters, defending Morton, said 80 per cent of the images were in the lowest category of indecency. He said the 56-year-old was a 'medical time bomb' after suffering two heart attacks in the past ten years.Morton was sentenced to five years in prison and placed on the sex offenders register for life. A Humberside Police spokeswoman said of the investigation that led them to Morton's door almost 20 years after his indecent assault of the teenage girl: 'The search warrant was intelligence led, that is to say prompted on the basis of information gathered.'","Philip Morton, 56, documented his abuse of the teenager between 1994 and 1995 in his 'autobiography'

It was the £1.6million cocaine racket hatched by a 'gang of four' Britons that has left one of them facing death by firing squad in Bali. But on May 17 last year, when Lindsay Sandiford allegedly met two members of the syndicate at a hotel in Bangkok, she must have  appeared an ordinary middle-aged woman living a relatively mundane life. Her world was to be totally shattered by the events of the next 48 hours. At the hotel, prosecutors say she met Rachel Dougall and Paul . Beales, both 39, to arrange for her to courier the cocaine to Bali . Unmasked: Briton Lindsay Sandiford covers her face days after customs . officials found her carrying 5kg or cocaine and then showed the haul to . the press . Sentence: Today the grandmother was put on death row and another member of the gang she helped police catch could receive the same tomorrow . Beales, Sandiford claims, was the man who placed 5kg of cocaine in the lining of her suitcase. She was later to tell the police that the actual owner of the drugs was Dougall though both were later to deny these accusations. Whatever the truth, the Gloucestershire grandmother was to fly to Bali two days later carrying £1.6million of cocaine. She was intercepted at Denpasar airport, the . main airport on the Indonesian island, where customs officials X-rayed the . suitcase, found the drugs and arrested her. In custody, eating a £1 bowl of chilli fried rice, Sandiford cracked as soon as she was told she would be executed if convicted. She immediately confessed that she had been told to hand over the drugs . to Dougall and her partner, Brighton antiques restorer Julian Ponder, 43. The couple were known as the ‘King and . Queen’ of Bali as they managed to afford the £1,000-a-week rent on their . palatial villa without seemingly working. Insisting that she was just . a mule, Sandiford also claimed she was forced to be a courier because of threats against her children in Britain. Police then set up a sting operation, and followed the grandmother as she went . about contacting Dougall, Ponder, . and Beales. King and queen: Couple Rachel Dougall, 39, and Julian Ponder, 43, became well known in Bali for their lavish lifestyle but they were eventually arrested and accused of forming a drugs syndicate . Fourth Man: Paul Beales, right, was also arrested on suspicion of being the 'muscle' of the group and given four years in jail last month . They sent Sandiford to a £25-a-night hotel room, where she was . accompanied by an undercover police officer while she waited to be . contacted by one of the others in the alleged syndicate. Police claim Ponder turned up at the . hotel while Beales, whom they believe was the . gang's 'muscle', waited nearby. Both were arrested and Dougall was also taken into custody. All three denied the charges and despite Sandiford's evidence, the . case against Dougall and Beales was soon to crumble when officers failed . to find any concrete evidence connecting the suspects. Police sources said that all . conversations between Dougall and Sandiford were carried out through . mobile phones. But officers had failed . to retrieve a SIM card during a raid on Dougall’s Bali villa, . meaning there was no physical evidence. Dougall received a one-year jail sentence in the Denpasar District Court . last month for hiding the crime. She could be on her way back to the UK by April, to be . reunited with her daughter, because she had already been in jail for . eight months awaiting trial. At the time of her arrest, Dougall insisted she was the victim of a 'fit-up', . Beales, a long-time Bali resident, was also spared a harsh sentence when . judges gave him four years for possession of a small amount of . hashish. Case: This is the villa in Bali used as the home of Rachel Dougall and Julian Ponder, Britons also arrested and accused of drug smuggling £1.6million of cocaine . The fourth Briton, Ponder, is accused of being one of the lynchpins in a crime syndicate supplying the drug to rich tourists on the island. Ponder . said he simply thought Mrs Sandiford was bringing a present for his . daughter’s sixth birthday. ‘Julian . Ponder believes 100 per cent that he was trapped by Lindsay,’ his . lawyer said at the time. Ponder reportedly said he thought the gift-wrapped . packages, bearing the words 'Enjoy Sweet Candy' were sweets for his . little daughter. 'I was the subject of entrapment by Lindsay, who knew my daughter was going to be six shortly after her arrival,' he said. 'Having . been caught she aided the police surveillance and brought the cocaine . to me wrapped as if it was a present for my daughter. I never touched . the drugs.' Today Lindsay Sandiford burst in to tears and cried 'no, no, no' as she was sentenced to death in a Bali court. A . verdict is expected in the trial of Ponder as early as tomorrow, where . he could be given the same sentence, which would make him the 13th . Briton abroad facing the death penalty.

But one school is spending £32,000 to . send 40 pupils and six teachers a little further afield next month – on . an all-expenses-paid trip to New York. Skegness Academy said the lucky . pupils were selected on the basis of attendance records, study records . and attitude – and an application letter outlining how the trip could . ‘support the subjects they are studying’. But the four-day, taxpayer-funded . ‘holiday’ was criticised by teaching unions and a local councillor . yesterday, who accused the Lincolnshire academy of using the expedition . to make the school more attractive to prospective pupils and their . parents. The academy defended the trip as an . opportunity to broaden the horizons of pupils who may otherwise be . unable to afford to visit the American city. Ian Stephenson, of the National Union . of Teachers, said the cost of the trip could pay the annual salary of . an extra teacher at the academy, rated ‘good’ by Ofsted.

'This is a great opportunity for some children but it means other . children will miss out. The money being spent could easily fund another . teacher. 'Schools are now very competitive and I . can understand how schools would see these trips as a high profile event . which may attract pupils in a very competitive environment. 'It is an issue about taxpayers money. The amount that is being spent on a number of pupils going to New York could be spent on another teacher.'

The Skegness Academy in Skegness, where 40 pupils have been offered a trip of a lifetime to New York courtesy of the tax payer . 'It links very, very closely to their sixth form studies. We have students who will be looking at architecture, art, music, terrorism and politics while they are in New York. 'We believe it really will enhance and enliven their learning. 'Our . money comes directly from the Government and because of the way . Greenwood Dale Foundation Trust operate there are economies and . efficiencies of scale.' The school, which has 1,190 pupils, became an Academy in 2010. It is part of the Greenwood Dale Foundation Trust which sponsors 13 . secondary and primary schools across the East Midlands. The Skegness . site is currently undergoing a £20 million rebuilding project. The Academy was rated as good in an Ofsted inspection in October with its leadership and management described as 'outstanding'. GCSE . and A level results have improved since it became an Academy despite . the fact that it is in an area of selective education with the cream of . the pupils going to the nearby Skegness Grammar School. The Ofsted report said: 'The academy offers students an excellent range of enrichment activities to broaden their horizons. 'The sixth form is good. This represents an impressive improvement in teaching and achievement since it opened two years ago. The pass rate is 100% in nearly all subjects at A and AS level. This represents a significant improvement on the results in 2011. 'All the students who left the sixth form in July 2012 have embarked on further training, education or employment.' Parents have not been asked to contribute to the cost of the trip. It is thought the travel company may have an arrangement with helping out the cost of the teachers. Greenwood Dale Foundation Trust said . in a statement: 'Next month (6-10 February 2013) a group of 40 sixth form pupils . (a mixture of year 12 and 13) from the Skegness Academy will be taking . the trip of a lifetime to New York. 'Pupils wishing to go on the trip had . to submit a letter of application to the Head of Sixth Form. 'Pupils had . to highlight a specific area of interest and demonstrate how the trip . would support the subjects that they are studying. For example, a pupil . on the media studies course is keen to explore America’s film industry . and a pupil studying sport is keen to research America’s sporting . history. In addition, a number of other criteria were applied such as . attendance, attitude and whether the pupil was up to date with their . studies. 'On their return the pupils will write a piece about their chosen topic . which will be formally assessed. 'Pupils are covering a range of topics . covering sport, music, photography, tourism and fashion. The pieces of writing will then be showcased at a celebration evening . for parents along with photographs and films that the pupils took during . the trip. 'The Greenwood Dale Foundation Trust only works in areas of social and . economic disadvantage and often pays for pupils to go on trips that they . would not normally be able to afford to broaden their experiences and . to enhance their studies.'","40 sixth form students and six teachers will be flown to the Big Apple .

Bad teacher: RE teacher Catherine Reynolds told students to 'p*** off' As an RE teacher it was her job to enlighten pupils about Christian values and the beliefs of other religions. Instead, Catherine Reynolds encouraged her class to have lots of sex and ‘sleep around’ before marriage. In expletive-ridden lessons, she told . pupils to ‘stop bloody talking’, ‘sit on your a***’ and warned them: ‘If . you don’t want to learn RE, you can p*** off’. An investigation into her behaviour . also found she posted offensive comments on her Facebook page. Following . a parents evening she wrote: ‘That was the most f****** horrendous . evening of my life’, and branded parents ‘retarded’. Yesterday Reynolds, 27, was banned . from the classroom for five years after Michael Gove decided she was a . disgrace to the profession. Describing her conduct as . unacceptable, the Education Secretary declared it fell seriously short . of that expected of a teacher and added that a disciplinary panel had . struggled to identify any ‘understanding, insight or remorse’. Reynolds taught RE at Saddleworth . School near Oldham, having joined the state-run secondary as a . newly-qualified teacher in 2008. The Manchester University graduate . initially showed promise, and was feted by pupils on a ‘rate my teacher’ website. However, she got into trouble after her Facebook comments of . September 2010 came to light, a report by a Teachers Agency panel found. These included: ‘F****** retarded parents’ followed by: ‘That’s because only eejits pick RE’. Further complaints followed in January and March 2011, the panel said. Reynolds made numerous references to . ‘sex from a personal perspective’ and told one pupil ‘not to get married . because then you can’t sleep around’ and that ‘you should have sex all . the time’. In one lesson, she recounted a visit . to Amsterdam in which she saw a sex show involving a horse and a woman . and revealed she had been for a naked massage. She used inappropriate . language on a regular basis, the report found, including a string of . swear words used to describe various people. One pupil was apparently . told to ‘F*** off’. Reynolds, who is married with a . one-year-old daughter, told her class of taking a morning-after pill and . of having a relationship with an older man. She also showed pupils the tattoos on her lower back and her thigh and played them ‘inappropriate videos’. Inappropriate: Catherine Reynolds told her RE students at Saddleworth School in Oldham to sleep around and not get married . One pupil claimed Reynolds did so when . she ‘couldn’t be bothered teaching’ and others said she was hindering . their progress. One said: ‘I don’t feel I am taught anything.’ Reynolds was suspended by her headteacher in March 2011 and resigned four months later. Recommending a ban, the panel said she . had ‘singularly failed to act as a role model to her pupils’ and had a . ‘deep-seated attitude that can lead to harmful behaviour’. Mr Gove said the five-year ban would give her the ‘opportunity to consider whether she wishes to teach again’. Reynolds could not be contacted last . night but her mother, Debbie, said at her home in Tyldesey, Greater . Manchester: ‘Catherine is no longer a teacher. She has to earn a living . as she has a little girl to care for now. ‘She will be devastated by this report . which is very one-sided.

Fight for survival: Giving CPR to heart attack patients for around 30 minutes could save more lives according to research . Giving CPR to patients in hospital for around half an hour could save more lives, claim researchers. Conventional thinking is that cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or CPR, performs miracles in medical dramas - but in real life is pointless after 20 minutes. Some doctors believe prolonged CPR is more likely to end in the patient's death than survival, and could result in brain damage. But new research from The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia shows that extending CPR longer than previously thought could be useful saves lives in both children and adults. Two studies found hospital staff should persist for at least 25 minutes, and maybe even longer than 35 minutes. CPR is an emergency technique that will supply blood to the brain and other organs of a person who is suffering a cardiac arrest and the heart has stopped beating. Trained staff do chest compressions and may use an automated external defibrillator (AED) to deliver a shock if needed. In the latest study published in the journal Circulation, researchers analysed hospital records of 3,419 children in the US and Canada from 2000 to 2009. It found among children who suffered in-hospital cardiac arrest, more than expected survived after prolonged CPR-defined as lasting longer than 35 minutes. Of those children who survived prolonged CPR, over 60 per cent did not suffer brain damage. Dr Robert Berg, chief of Critical Care Medicine at the hospital, said: 'These findings about the duration of CPR are game-changing, and we hope these results will rapidly affect hospital practice.' Resuscitation: Part of the CPR process often involves the use of a shock using an automated external defibrillator (AED) The overall results from the children's study follows an adult study of 64,000 patients with in-hospital cardiac arrests between 2000 and 2008 by experts from the same research group. Patients at hospitals where CPR was likely to persist for 25 minutes on average had a 12 per cent higher chance of surviving cardiac arrest, compared to patients at hospitals where CPR duration was shortest, at around 16 minutes on average. Survivors of prolonged CPR had similar neurological outcomes in terms of brain function to those who survived after shorter CPR efforts. The conventional thinking has been that the technique is futile after 20 minutes, but Dr Berg said these results challenge that assumption. 'Taken together, the adult and paediatric results present a clear and hopeful message: persisting longer with CPR can offer better results than previously believed possible' said Dr Berg. The next steps for CPR researchers are to identify important risk and predictive factors that determine which patients may benefit most from prolonged CPR, and when CPR efforts have become futile, he added.","Giving CPR for longer than 30 minutes may save more lives .

Nearly five years after their colors, banners and history were packed away into storage and their franchise relocated, the SuperSonics are one significant step closer to returning to Seattle. And the Kings are on the edge of leaving Sacramento. All that appears to stand in the way now is approval by NBA owners. The Maloof family has agreed to sell the Kings to a Seattle group led by investor Chris Hansen, the league confirmed in a statement Monday morning. New owners: Chris Hansen's group will buy 65 per cent of the franchise, which is valued at a total price of $525 million, and move the team to Seattle and restore the SuperSonics name, said a person familiar with the decision . Selling the team: In this April 26, 2012 photo the Maloof brothers, Phil, left, George, center and Gavin, co-owners of the Sacramento Kings, watch the Kings against the Los Angeles Lakers at game in Sacramento . The deal is still pending a vote by the NBA Board of Governors. A person familiar with the decision said that Hansen's group will buy 65 per cent of the franchise, which is valued at a total price of $525 million, and move the team to Seattle and restore the SuperSonics name. The deal will cost the Hansen group a little more than $340 million. The Maloofs will have no stake in the team. The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the deal was waiting approval. The sale figure works off a total valuation of the franchise, which includes relocation fees. Hansen's group also is hoping to buy out other minority investors. The Maloofs will get a $30 million non-refundable down payment by February 1, according to the deal, the person said. They will still be allowed to receive other offers until the league approves the sale. The Kings sale price of $525 would surpass the NBA record $450 million the Golden State Warriors sold for in 2010. The plan by Hansen's group is to have the team play at least the next two seasons in KeyArena before moving into a new facility in downtown Seattle.

The deadline for teams to apply for a move for next season is March 1. The office of Seattle Mayor Mike McGinn confirmed Monday it is already working with Hansen on an agreement for using KeyArena, including scheduling and short-term upgrades to the arena. ‘While we are not at liberty to discuss the terms of the transaction or our plans for the franchise given the confidential nature of the agreement and NBA regulations regarding public comments during a pending transaction, we would just like to extend our sincerest compliments and gratitude toward the Maloof family,’ Hansen said in a statement. ‘Our negotiations with the family were handled with the utmost honor and professionalism and we hope to continue their legacy and be great stewards of this NBA franchise in the coming years and decades.’ Hansen was not available for further comment. Momentum was building toward a sale agreement after word of talks between Hansen and the Maloofs leaked nearly two weeks ago. Sacramento will get its chance to counter with Mayor Kevin Johnson already receiving permission from NBA Commissioner David Stern to present a counteroffer to league owners from buyers who would keep the Kings in Sacramento. Johnson, himself a former All-Star point guard in the NBA, said in a statement that the city remained undeterred. ‘Sacramento has proven that it is a strong NBA market with a fan base that year in and year out has demonstrated a commitment to the Kings by selling out 19 of 27 seasons in a top 20 market and owning two of the longest sellout streaks in NBA history,’ Johnson said. Yet Johnson will be fighting an uphill challenge trying to pull together an ownership group in a small window of time while Seattle begins preparing for the return of the green and gold. Piece of history: The SuperSonics became a historic footnote when owner Clay Bennett moved the franchise to Oklahoma City in 2008 . The SuperSonics became a historic footnote when owner Clay Bennett moved the franchise to Oklahoma City in 2008. It was the conclusion of a contentious two years of lawsuits, broken leases, negotiations and ultimately a settlement that allowed 41 years of pro basketball history in Seattle to be moved away. While Seattle was excited about Monday's news, there was an air of caution as well, with many fans still stung about the Sonics previous departure not wanting to believe in their return until everything is signed and delivered. Others in Seattle have wanted an expansion franchise rather than taking a team from another city. ‘It tore the hearts out of the city when the (team) left the first time and it's just wonderful news to get a team back,’ said Jerry Brown, who was at KeyArena Monday buying college basketball tickets. ‘I feel sorry for the people of Sacramento, they have good fans there, but we want our team back.’Ironically enough, it will be Bennett that has a say in whether Seattle returns to the NBA portfolio as the head of the league's relocation committee. Moving on: The Maloofs backed out of a tentative $391 million deal for a new downtown venue with Sacramento last year (TV personality Adrienne Maloof pictured) Caught in an awkward spot is the Kings' basketball team itself, some of whom have Seattle ties. Guard Isaiah Thomas grew up in Tacoma, Washington, and before the Kings played in New Orleans on Monday was already feeling the discomfort of being wedged between two cities. ‘It's just a little weird (but) at the same time I love Sacramento, I love everything about it. Love the fans, the organization just brought me in with open arms. That's all I really know in this league is Sacramento,’ Thomas said. ‘But then I am from that area back home, it's just kind of a different situation. Whatever I say about Seattle, Sacramento fans might be mad at me and whatever I say about Sacramento, Seattle fans might be mad at me. I just love both cities. ‘It's out of my control,’ he said. The saga of the Kings' future in California's Capitol city has dragged on for nearly three years and now faces its most daunting challenge. Hansen, a Seattle native and San Francisco-based investor, reached agreement with local governments in Seattle last October on plans to build a $490 million NBA/NHL arena near the city's other stadiums, CenturyLink Field and Safeco Field. No construction will begin until all environmental reviews are completed and a team has been secured. The arena also faces a pair of lawsuits, including one from a long-shore workers union because the arena is being built close to port and industrial operations. Fans: King's fans head to the Team Store at the NBA's Sacramento Kings home at Sleep Train Arena (formally ARCO Arena) in Sacramento, California . Hansen's group is expected to pitch in $290 million in private investment toward the arena, along with helping to pay for transportation improvements in the area around the stadiums. The remaining $200 million in public financing would be paid back with rent money and admissions taxes from the arena, and if that money falls short, Hansen would be responsible for making up the rest. Other investors in the proposed arena include Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer and two members of the Nordstrom department store family. ‘While there is more work ahead, this is a major step toward bringing the Sonics home,’ McGinn said.Sacramento fans hope this is not the final chapter in their quest to save the Kings. Johnson has once already saved the Kings from relocation when he made a pitch to the Board of Governors and bought the city time to broker a deal that appeared to solve the team's arena woes. But the Maloofs backed out of that tentative $391 million deal for a new downtown venue with Sacramento last year. Johnson said recently he's heard from various parties interested in trying to put together an ownership group that would keep the team in Sacramento, but only with a new arena. ‘We have always appreciated and treasured our ownership of the Kings and have had a great admiration for the fans and our team members. We would also like to thank Chris Hansen for his professionalism during our negotiation. Chris will be a great steward for the franchise,’ Kings co-owner Gavin Maloof said in a statement on behalf of the family.

James Hassell was the man chosen to teach the future King of England how to fly a helicopter . A distinguished pilot who taught Prince William to fly a helicopter died in a high-speed motorcycle crash after he attempted to overtake a lorry, an inquest heard today. James Hassell, 36, was pronounced dead at the scene of the accident on the A417 near Faringdon, Oxfordshire on March 10 last year. The respected Army Air Corps Lynx helicopter pilot was selected to teach the prince on a fast-track flying course five years ago. The inquest into Mr Hassell's death, held at Oxford Coroner's Court, heard the helicopter pilot, known as Jim, was also a keen motorcyclist who enjoyed going for long motorbike rides around the countryside at weekends with his friend and colleague Matthew Coverley. Mr Coverley told the hearing the pair had just left the village of Faringdon and were travelling down the narrow country lane when they noticed a green truck travelling about 300m in front of them at around 9.35am on the Saturday. He said Mr Hassell was around 6 to 10m in front of him, with his own motorbike staggered to the left of his bike. As they approached the vehicle he said they both accelerated to between 70-80mph in order to overtake it but the truck then began to turn right into a farm entrance without indicating, slowing down or appearing to notice them. Mr Coverley said: 'I didn't see any indication on the truck, neither prior to or as it turned. 'Jim steered towards the left of the carriageway to attempt to avoid the truck. 'The truck was traveling in a continual motion, as if it has not seen Jim. 'In my mind it was all in slow motion. Prince William (pictured in a Griffin helicopter at RAF Shawbury in Shrewsbury) extended the 'deepest sympathy' to the family of James Hassell after his death . 'I saw Jim's body hit the truck. I continued to break hard, stopping at the side of the road.' Mr Coverley said he was sure that the driver of the truck had not used his indicator. 'Both Jim and I are experienced riders and we always look for indications and we would not even attempt to overtake if we thought the truck was turning,"" he said. But giving his own evidence, the truck's driver, Polish national Marek Kucala, told the inquest that he had seen one of the motorcycles and had indicated that he was turning. He said: ""I indicated much earlier, before the entrance to Manor Farm as I knew where I was about to turn. 'The first time I checked my mirrors I didn't see anyone. 'When I moved to the centre of the road I checked the mirrors for the second time and I noticed the motorcycle."" Speaking through an interpreter, he said that as he saw the motorcycle was trying to overtake him he then tried to swerve back to the left side of the road to let him pass. 'It's really difficult to describe as all of it happened in a fraction of a second,"" he added. Giving evidence, Terry Anderson, a collision investigator with Thames Valley Police, said he arrived at the scene of the crash later that morning. He told the inquest that when he tested the truck's indicators he found them to have a much dimmer output than they should have had and were dirty which also made them harder to see. 'Certainly not what you would expect of a well maintained vehicle,' he added. The A417 in Oxfordshire where James Hassell died after he attempted to overtake a lorry at 70mph . He also found the Isuzu rigid goods vehicle's battery was flat and needed to be jump-started although the breaklights and indicators still worked. Further tests two days later found further levels of deterioration and the indicators would not work at all. Coroner Darren Salter recorded a verdict of accidental death. He said: ""As often is the case there is some conflicting evidence to areas in particular concerning the indicators. 'Mr Kucala says he indicated. Mr Coverley says he didn't see any indication. He doesn't believe there was any. 'All I can say about that is there is conflict in that. 'We don't know how bright the indicators would have been at the time of the collision, if indeed there was indication from Mr Kucala. 'One thing that is clear is that this accident happened very suddenly and very quickly. 'It has become apparent that perhaps we're talking not about a fraction of a second, but a few seconds. 'Clearly speed was a significant factor.' Pilot stayed cool when colleagues tried to disrupt tutoring of prince . James Hassell was playfully teased by his colleagues after he was put in charge of Prince William's helicopter training . Mr Hassell's close friend and fellow pilot Matt Webb, 36, said he managed to stay calm when colleagues played pranks on him during his tutoring of Prince William. The helicopter pilot was based at RNAS Yeovilton . in Somerset and lived in Middle Wallop, Hampshire, and gave the Duke of . Cambridge helicopter flight training five years ago. Mr Webb said: ‘He had carefully prepared a day’s presentation for the prince when one of his friends wiped it from his computer as a practical joke – but he still managed to deliver the mission orders perfectly from memory. Nicknamed ‘Safe Hands’ due to his goalkeeping skills, he taught William about the tactics and skills required by military pilots when he joined the RAF on a four-month attachment. A military funeral for WO2 Hassell from Chipping Campden, Gloucestershire, was held on March 26 last year. At the time of Mr Hassell's death, the . Duke of Cambridge extended his ‘deepest sympathy’ to the grieving family . of Mr Hassell. A spokesman for the Prince said at the time: ‘The Duke of Cambridge has been informed of the sad news and his thoughts are with Mr Hassell’s family.’ At the time of the accident WO2 Hassell and his wife of 12 years, Lily, were about to buy their first home together. Mr Hassell's stepfather, Pat Salter, from Taddington, Gloucestershire, said: ‘When we found out our lad was teaching the future King we were shaking in our boots. ‘At the funeral I asked his captain “Why James?” and he said, “We couldn’t afford a cock-up and he was the only one for the job”.’","Inquest held today into death of James Hassell, 36, who was hand picked to help the future King learn to fly .

Likening sexual assault in the Air Force's ranks to a cancer, the service's top officer resolved Wednesday to tackle the problem by screening personnel more carefully and putting an end to bad behaviors like binge drinking that can lead to misconduct. But Gen. Mark Welsh, the Air Force chief of staff, underscored the challenge by telling a House oversight committee that the service recorded a disturbing number of reports of sexual assault last year even as it worked to curb misconduct in the wake of a sex scandal at its training headquarters in Texas. Dozens of young female recruits and airmen at Lackland Air Force Base near San Antonio were victimized by their instructors who sexually harassed, improperly touched or raped them. Scroll down for video . Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Mark Welsh likened sexual assault in the Air Force's ranks to a cancer at a hearing before Congress . Most difficult, Welsh said, is transforming a culture in which victims are often reluctant to report what happened because of guilt, shame or fear they won't be believed. 'Why, on what was undoubtedly the worst day of a victim's life, did they not turn to us for help?' Welsh said during testimony before the House Armed Services Committee. 'We are missing something fundamental in the human-to-human interaction that will allow them to feel safe enough to come to us and report.' An Air Force veteran who was sexually assaulted while serving — but not at Lackland — described how intimidating it is for young enlisted personnel to speak up. 'You're stuck,' Jennifer Norris told the committee. 'If you want a career, you don't want to say anything because you get retaliated against.' Norris, who said she medically retired in 2010 with post-traumatic stress disorder, said the Air Force and the other military branches have a sexual assault epidemic and a broken system of justice. The scandal at Lackland, now known as Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland, continues to unfold nearly two years after the first victim came forward. All U.S. airmen report to Lackland for basic training. The base has about 500 military training instructors for about 35,000 airmen who graduate every year. About 1 in 5 recruits is a woman; most instructors are men. Retired Air Force Technical Sgt. Jennifer Norris, left, grew emotional as she testified about being repeatedly sexually assaulted during her first two years of active duty . The initial results of Air Force investigation released in November described abuses of power by instructors who took advantage of a weak oversight system to prey on young recruits. The inquiry has found that 32 military training instructors allegedly engaged in inappropriate or coercive sexual relationships with 59 recruits and airmen at Lackland, according to the Air Force. Three of the most recent alleged victims are males. Six instructors have been convicted in courts-martial on charges ranging from adultery, rape and conducting unprofessional relationships. Nine more instructors are awaiting courts-martial. Two more received nonjudicial punishments. Fifteen 15 instructors remain under investigation. The Air Force has changed the way it selects officers and instructors who train new recruits and reduced from four to three years the amount of time they can spend as instructors, said Gen. Edward Rice, head of the Air Education and Training Command. Rice, who testified along with Welsh, said more women are being placed in supervisory roles within the training command. The Lackland scandal has not affected recruiting, Rice said. 'I'm not in any way ready to declare victory,' Rice said. The preliminary figures for 2012 show there were nearly 800 reports of cases, ranging from inappropriate touching to rape, according to Welsh's testimony. That would be a nearly 30 percent increase from 2011, when 614 cases were reported. The number could be much greater, Welsh said, because many cases are never reported. 'It's astonishing, really,' Welsh said. 'Eight hundred is not acceptable, 600 is not acceptable. 300 is not acceptable. Zero is the only answer.' The 2012 figures are being audited and reviewed before being included in a report the Defense Department will submit to Congress in April, according to Welsh. Welsh said he has stressed to the Air Force's officer corps and senior enlisted ranks the importance of eliminating sexual misconduct. As part of that effort, Welsh issued a 'Letter to Airmen' this month that said images, songs and stories that are obscene or vulgar are not part of the Air Force heritage. Not everyone who commits sexual assault is a predator, but there are predators in the ranks and they have to be found before they act, Welsh said. The Air Force also has to identify and stop the activities that can lead to inappropriate actions. 'A young man who routinely binge drinks and loses control of himself is going to conduct bad behavior,' Welsh said. 'That bad behavior could result in sexual assault. Let's stop the binge drinking.'","There were nearly 800 reports of sexual assault cases, ranging from inappropriate touching to rape in 2012 .
