"By . James  Nye . In his first interview since 2011, when he was exposed as fabricating large parts of his best-selling book Three Cups of Tea - author Greg Mortenson has claimed that he did it because he was willing to 'kill himself' to raise money for impoverished people. Speaking to NBC's Tom Brokaw for an interview that will air on Tuesday, Mortenson, 56, said that while he admitted to hearing the 'alarms' over his 2006 work, he refused to acknowledge them in case they deflected from his goal of boosting his humanitarian projects. Famously claiming that he had met Mother Teresa, although she had died three years previously, Mortenson begs for a second chance in the exclusive interview and claims that he has settled all the allegations he mis-spent money from his charity flying around the world in his own private jet. New beginning: Greg Mortenson speaks with NBC's Tom Brokwa and claims that he told falsehoods in his book because of his dramatic zeal to raise money for his humanitarian projects . Claiming in his interview with Brokaw that events did transpire in Three Cups of Tea as he wrote them - just not in the order he outlined them - Mortenson said that he ignored the warning signs in his own mind not to do this and promised not to repeat his mistakes. 'It still just has puzzled me and why there wasn't, at some point, in your mind, an alarm that went off and said, 'this just isn't right in some way,' Brokaw asked in the interview. No more lies: Tom Mortenson said that he is interested in the public granting him a second chance after the lies he told in his best selling memoir Three Cups of Tea . 'There were alarms, Tom,' Mortenson said. 'I didn't listen to them. I was willing to basically kill myself to raise money and help the projects.' After its release in 2006, Three Cups of Tea became a best seller and it, along with Mortenson's tireless promotion that included more than 500 speaking engagements in four years, resulted in tens of millions of dollars in donations to the Central Asia Institute - the charity he ran. Mortenson himself reaped financial benefits at the expense of the CAI, including the free promotion of Three Cups of Tea and his later book, Stones Into Schools. He also pocketed the royalties from thousands of copies CAI bought to donate to libraries, schools, churches and military personnel, a 2012 report by the Montana Attorney General said. After that investigation Mortenson was ordered to reimburse his charity to the tune of more than $1million under a settlement agreement. Three Cups of Tea details how Mortenson resolved to build schools in Central Asia after he became lost and wandered into a poor Pakistani village, then follows him as he expands his school-building efforts there. The book was originally conceived as a way to raise money and tell the story of the Central Asia Institute, which Mortenson founded in 1996 with a $1million donation from Dr. Jean Hoerni, a Swiss physicist and mountaineer. Charity: Greg Mortenson with local businesswomen in Gojal Hunza, in Pakistan - where his charity worked to improve the quality of life for people ther . The books came under scrutiny in 2011 when reports by 60 Minutes and author Jon Krakauer alleged that Mortenson fabricated parts of both and that he benefited financially from the charity. Mortenson is alleged to have made up stories about how he built the schools and one particularly famous wrong recollection published is how he held Mother Teresa's hand while her body was lying in state in 2000. Mother Teresa passed away in 1997 - the same week that Princess Diana lost her life in car crash in Paris. Another claim, that he was kidnapped by Taliban on a visit in July 1996, was said to be untrue. Also noted as questionable was Mr Mortenson's account that he wandered lost into the village of Korphe in Pakistan after trying to climb the world's second-highest peak, K2, then decided to build a school there. His previous writings made no mention of his being lost or wandering into Korphe, and he also previously indicated that he originally planned to build that first school in another village. The 2006 book Three Cups of Tea, which sold millions of copies, was conceived as a way to raise money and tell the story of his institute, founded by Mr Mortenson in 1996, and resulted in tens of millions of dollars in donations. Mortenson has been accused in past lawsuits filed against him by readers of racketeering, fraud, deceit, breach of contract and unjust enrichment. Shamashatu, Pakistan: Greg Mortenson from Bozeman, Montana the former executive director of the Central Asia Institute, listens as newly arrived refugees from Afghanistan tell their stories on break from making bricks . However, in the aftermath of the 60 Minutes investigation Mortenson was accused of mismanagement of the non-profit organization he co-founded to build schools in Pakistan and Afghanistan and spent millions of dollars of charity money on charter flights, family vacations and luxury personal items. Mortenson's control of the Central Asia Institute went largely unchallenged by its board of directors, which consisted of himself and two people loyal to him, the report prepared by the Montana Attorney General's office said. Fabrications: Mortenson's 2006 book ""Three Cups of Tea: One Man's Mission to Promote Peace...One School at a Time"" chronicled his failed attempt to climb K2 . When an employee would question his practices, Mortenson either resisted or ignored the person. The result was a lack of financial accountability in which large amounts of cash sent overseas were never accounted for. Itemized expenses listed as program-related were missing supporting receipts and documentation. Employees and family members charged items such as health club dues and gifts to CAI credit cards. In 2012, Mortenson was told he must reimburse the charity more than $1million under a settlement agreement - according to Montana's Attorney General. The attorney general's probe focused only on the charity's finances and operations, and did not examine the books' contents. The yearlong investigation from 2011 to 2012 concluded that the Central Asia Institute took in far more donations than it spent, and had $23million in reserves. The charity was judged to need better oversight so that too much control is not in one person's hands, the audit found. ‘Mortenson's pursuits are noble and his achievements are important. However, serious internal problems in the management of CAI surfaced,’ Attorney General Steve Bullock said in the report. ‘Despite the severity of their errors, CAI is worth saving.’ Mortenson was permanently removed as CAI's executive director in November, 2012. Tragic: David Oliver Relin (right), who co-wrote the best-seller Three Cups of Tea with Greg Mortenson (left), about how Mortenson set up schools in Afghanistan and Pakistan, has killed himself, aged 49 . Following the stresses and strains in the wake of the 60 Minutes piece, Mortenson had heart surgery. The investigation by Montana's Attorney General also found that CAI spent $4.93million on advertising and promoting Mortenson's books, costs that the charity and the author had agreed to split but never did. CAI paid $2million in charter flights for Mortenson to keep his rigorous speaking engagement schedule before he started paying for his own travel in 2011. The investigation found that in many cases he was ‘double-dipping,’ where CAI paid for his travel to a speaking engagement and the host of the event also paid him a fee or honorarium for his travel, which Mortenson pocketed. Scrutiny: The book follows the adventures of co-author Greg Mortenson, pictured in Wakhan, northeastern Afghanistan in 2009, as he set up schools in Pakistan and Afghanistan . 'Dishonest': But critics claimed some parts of the book had been fabricated and Mortenson, left, later admitted some facts were wrong. Relin suffered emotionally and financially in the aftermath . Mortenson and his family also charged personal items to CAI in 2009-2010 amounting to $75,276 that included ‘LL Bean clothing, iTunes, luggage, luxurious accommodations and even vacations,’ according to the report. The controversy became tragic in November of 2011 when co-author of Three Cups of Tea, David Oliver Relin committed suicide. Relin suffered emotionally and financially after readers and critics doubted facts in the book. Mortenson, 52, lives in Montana with his wife, a clinical psychologist, and their two young children. His biography describes him as 'a living hero to rural communities of Afghanistan and Pakistan, where he has gained the trust of Islamic leaders, military and militia commanders, government officials and tribal chiefs from his tireless effort to champion education, especially for girls.'","Greg Mortenson has given his first interview since huge controversy over false claims in his best selling 2006 memoir Three Cups of Tea .

"Google is to start selling a humanoid robot which can walk, climb, use tools and even drive a car. Call Schaft, the robot was developed by a Japanese firm bought by Google. It recently won a military 'robo-olympics' - but Google has revealed the machine is being pulled from future rounds of the contest so it can be developed into the firm's first commercial robot. Scroll down for video . Call Schaft, the 1.48m robot was developed by a Japanese firm bought by Google, and is now set to be turned into a commercial product. During the recent 'robo olympics' team Schaft's machine carried out all eight rescue-themed tasks - including scaling a ladder, opening a door, removing debris and clearing debris - to outscore its rivals by a mechanical mile, taking 27 of a possible 32 points. Schaft's 1.48m (4ft 11in) tall, two-legged robot entered the contest the favourite and lived up to its reputation. It makes use of a new high-voltage liquid-cooled motor technology that uses a capacitor, rather a battery, for power. Its engineers say this lets its arms move and pivot at higher speeds than would otherwise be possible, in effect giving it stronger 'muscles'.

It makes use of a new high-voltage liquid-cooled motor technology that uses a capacitor, rather a battery, for power. Its engineers say this lets its arms move and pivot at higher speeds than would otherwise be possible, in effect giving it stronger 'muscles'. The announcement came as the next round of the robo-contest was revealed. 'The first-place finisher, SCHAFT, has elected to withdraw from the Finals to focus on the development of its first commercial product,' organisers said. California will be the stage for the DARPA Robotics Challenge (DRC) Finals. Teams from around the world will meet at Fairplex in Pomona to compete for the $2 million prize to be awarded to the team that best demonstrates human-supervised robot technology for disaster response. The DRC is a competition of human-robot systems developed to help emergency personnel respond to natural and man-made disasters. Participating teams from some of the most advanced robotics research and development organizations in the world are designing hardware, software, sensors, and human-machine control interfaces to be tested in a series of tasks selected by DARPA for their broad relevance to disaster response operations. 'Six months ago at the DRC Trials, we began physically testing human-supervised robots against disaster-relevant tasks. 'Their impressive performance gave us the confidence to raise the bar,' said Dr. Gill Pratt, DRC program manager. 'A year from now at the DRC Finals we will push the technology even further' 'Anything you can do, humans!': Japanese robot Schaft completes one of the eight DARPA challenges - climbing a steep ladder . The  robot developed by a Japanese start-up that was recently acquired by Google has left 15 rivals for dead at a two-day competition hosted by the Pentagon to see which machine could cope best in the event of a nuclear meltdown. Team Schaft's machine carried out all eight rescue-themed tasks - including scaling a ladder, opening a door, removing debris and clearing debris - to outscore its rivals by a mechanical mile, taking 27 of a possible 32 points. However NASA's entry Valkyrie, a $3 million creation, failed to score a single point, in an embarrassing blow to the U.S. space station. The machine was seemingly designed to much in an astronaut sense, weighing a clunky 125kg, rather than being to help out in a crisis. Schaft' s closest competitor was IHMC Robotics - which used the Google/Boston Dynamics ATLAS robot - which scored 20 points. Three of the other 15 teams that took part failed to secure any points at the event near Miami, Florida, with NASA one of them. The robot can also operate tolls - and is seen here closing a valve with a spanner . Clean-up: Another task required clearing debris from an entry way. DARPA said the motivated to do the competition are realizing how little robots were able to help during the 2011 Fukushima nuclear meltdown . Four countries took place in the competition - United States, Japan, Korea and China. Darpa said it had been inspired to organise the challenge after it became clear robots were only capable of playing a very limited role in efforts to contain 2011's Fukushima nuclear reactor meltdown in Japan. 'What we realised was ... these robots couldn't do anything other than observe,' said Gill Pratt, programme manager for the Darpa Robotics Challenge. 'What they needed was a robot to go into that reactor building and shut off the valves.' In order to spur on development of more adept robots the agency challenged contestants to complete a series of tasks, with a time-limit of 30 minutes for each. Among the challenges were driving a utility vehicle along a course, climb an 8ft-high ladder, remove debris blocking a doorwar and cut a triangular shape in a wall using a cordless drill. More than 100 teams originally applied to take part, and the number was whittled down to 17 by Darpa ahead of Friday and Saturday's event. Schaft is also capable of opening a door. The two-legged humanoid out-mastered rivals by seven points . The googlebot driving a car as part of the test . Some entered their own machines, while others made use of Atlas - a robot manufactured by another Google-owned business, Boston Dynamics - controlling it with their own software.

Virginia Tech's Thor-OP The robots had to attach a hose pipe as one of their challenges . The machine was developed by a spin-off from the University of Tokyo's Jouhou System Kougaku lab, which Google recently revealed it had acquired. In case of an emergency, Schaft unhooks a fire hose . Google's robot currently has power cables and tether attached - but future versions could be wireless . The team scored 27 points out of a possible 32, putting it seven points ahead of second-placed IHMC Robotics, which used Atlas. Scores were based on a system that awarded three points for completing a task's primary objectives, and then a bonus point for doing so without any human intervention. Schaft's robot behaved almost perfectly, but lost points because 'the wind blew a door out of their robot's hold and because their robotic creation was not able to climb out of a vehicle after it successfully navigated an obstacle course,' reported the Japan Daily Press. Four countries took part in the DARPA competition, including United States, Korea, China and of course Japan .","Machine has already won Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) 'robogames'

"By . Victoria Woollaston . There may be times when you really want to tell your colleagues what you think of them, but are left biting your tongue. Knozen offers a solution. The free app lets you anonymously pit co-workers against each other based on how good they are at their job, and their personality traits - and will rate them on each quality. The Knozen app pits two people against each other using a range of questions. Some are work related, while others assess personality traits, such as 'Who would leave work early for a date?' (pictured left) and 'Who would pack for a trip way in advance?' Each time a user is rated (pictured right), they are sent a notification . Examples include ‘Who would leave work early for a date?’, ‘Who is more assertive?’ and ‘Who would pack for a trip way in advance?’ Researchers at the University of Illinois and University of Pennsylvania recently discovered that people who moan a lot may be better at their jobs. This is because the so-called 'haters' may be more skilled because they spend time on fewer activities. In contrast, people with a sunny disposition tend to spread their time over lots of activities. This, the researchers claim, makes them a 'Jack-of-all-trades' and a master of none. The user then selects the best match, before being given another question and two possible colleagues. Colleagues are selected at random. Each of the questions are designed to be ‘positive and upbeat’ – meaning users can't be brutally honest with people they don’t like. However, they could rate other colleagues higher at the detriment of those they don’t get on with. Each time a user is rated, they get a notification saying what they were rated for. These ratings are saved and shown on their profile, which reveals their strongest traits, based on the answers.

"By . Ryan Gorman . The U.S. Men’s Soccer Team returned home heroes to a crowd gathered Friday morning at Los Angeles International Airport, even in defeat. Members of the team took the time to pose for pictures and sign autographs for the fans greeting them after their flight from Brazil landed at 6.00 a.m. Experts are divided over whether the Americans’ advancement from the ‘group of death’ constituted any major progress, but what is clear is that the American public is starting to embrace the sport. The Secretary of Defense: Hero goalkeeper Tim Howard poses for a picture with some young fans after arriving Thursday morning in Los Angeles . ‘It was a long flight, but I'm happy to be back,’ defender Omar Gonzalez told KNBC. ‘I think we gave it everything we had. We left everything on that field.’ The U.S. battled through injuries to key players, including striker Jozy Altidore to a grade-2 hamstring tear, he told the ‘Mike and Mike’ radio show Thursday morning. Also part of the entourage were star goal keeper Tim Howard and team captain Clint Dempsey, both of whom shared a Wednesday conference call from President Barack Obama. Howard, who plays for English Premier League club Everton, smiled and talked to fans as their parents snapped once in a lifetime photos with their hero. ‘I think we did very well,’ said Howard. ‘We're proud of what we did. The fans were fantastic and it's good to be back home.’ Howard single-handedly kept the U.S. in a one-sided match against a more skilled Belgium team with a World Cup-record 16 saves during their quarterfinal match. Proud: Howard insisted the team did well and should build on it's successful run . Happy to be back: Midfielder Omar Gonzalez said it felt good to return to the U.S. and that the team 'left everything on the field' His inspired play caused the #thingstimehowardcouldsave meme to take over the internet even after the Americans fell 2-1 to the Belgians. It was the second-straight tournament in which the U.S. fell in the first game after escaping the group stage – but coach Jurgen Klinsmann, a former star of the German international squad, saw progress in the tournament. ‘I think they made their country proud with this performance,’ he said. Ratings for the tournament set all-time records when 24.7million people tuned in top watch the match versus Portugal, which the US tied 2-2 after a last minute goal from the Portuguese side in stoppage time. A further 16.5million watched the U.S.-Belgium match Tuesday afternoon on ESPN, and 5.1million more tuned in on Univision while almost 1.7million watched the game online, according to various sources. Those numbers easily beat out the recent NBA Finals that aired on ABC. Those numbers do not account for bars and the various watch parties that saw thousands of people jam public parks, stadiums and squares to watch the World Cup all over the country. Enthusiasm in the country for this World Cup was unrivalled by any other. The players have only now returned to what may never be the same country they left -  one filled with soccer fans.","The Americans returned home after falling 2-1 to Belgium in the World Cup quarterfinals .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . Nasa’s Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) satellite launched today at 10:56 BST (05:56 EST) after an attempt to lift-off yesterday was cancelled. The launch was cancelled 24 hours ago when mission controllers noticed a water flow problem, but the issue was resolved for today. After being taken to the correct orbit, the satellite will begin its observations of Earth in mid-August. Lift off! Nasa's OCO-2 satellite successfully took off as scheduled at 10:56 BST (05:56 EDT) today, pictured, after encountering a problem yesterday that delayed the launch. The satellite was launched on top of a Delta II rocket and will begin its observations of Earth in mid-August of this year . The satellite had to be launched at exactly the right time to ensure it enters the right orbit. Lift-off (zero seconds): Three solid rocket motors ignited. 100 seconds after launch: The solid rocket motors are jettisoned as the rocket climbs to space. Four minutes: Main engine is cut off. Four minutes and eight seconds: Rocket splits in two as the stages separate. Five minutes: Nose cone opens up. 10 minutes: Second engine cuts out (Seco-1). 11 minutes: The satellite coasts in space for 40 minutes. 51 minutes: A second engine fires to place the satellite into the right orbit. 56 minutes: Final rocket engine separates from the satellite. 45 days: First science observations of carbon dioxide levels on Earth begin. This will bring it in line with a series of other Earth-observing satellites known as the ‘A-train’. In fact, the orbit is so precise that there is only a 30 second launch window within which it can take off; any delays and Nasa will have to try again another day. 'We are in great shape for today's attempt!' Nasa Launch Manager Tim Dunn of the agency's Launch Services Program said before the launch. OCO-2 was carried into space by a United Launch Alliance Delta II rocket. It is the second of five Nasa Earth science missions to be launched this year. Nasa monitors Earth's vital signs from land, air and space with a fleet of satellites and airborne and ground-based observation campaigns. OCO-2 is Nasa’s first mission dedicated to studying atmospheric carbon dioxide, the leading human-produced greenhouse gas driving changes in Earth’s climate according to Nasa. It will collect 24 measurements every second, totaling about a million every day. Of these, about 100,000 are expected to be sufficiently cloud free to provide highly usable carbon dioxide data. The best carbon dioxide-observing satellite currently in orbit takes 4 seconds to make one such observation and collects fewer than 20,000 pieces of data per day, with about 500 of those being highly useful.That is the reason why today's launch was cancelled, as the problem delayed the rocket lifting off by more than 30 seconds. This long exposure photo shows the United Launch Alliance Delta II rocket with the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) satellite onboard, at the Space Launch Complex Two, of the Vandenberg Air Force Base, California. The launch took place at 10:56am BST today . OCO-2 (illustration shown) is Nasa's first mission dedicated to studying atmospheric carbon dioxide, the leading human-produced greenhouse gas driving changes in Earth's climate according to Nasa. It will collect 24 measurements every second, totaling about a million every day . Launch cancellations like yesterday's are not uncommon . The issue was with the pulse suppression water system. This protects the launch mount holding the rocket from the high temperatures of a launch. And it helps protect from the shockwave of ignition from the engine. The water flow would have begun at T-minus 45 seconds. But when it was found not to be working properly, the launch had to be cancelled for safety reasons. The soonest next launch could be tomorrow in what is known as a '24 hour recycle'. Rockets . are a very dangerous business, so great care must be taken before . attempting a launch and a host of safety checks must be met. Even . the most minor of faults can lead to a cancellation; after all, Nasa . and other agencies would rather delay a launch by a day or two than lose . hundreds of millions of dollars worth of equipment. Just . a week ago, for example, private company SpaceX delayed the launch of . its own Falcon 9 rocket when an issue was discovered that threatened the . success of the flight. In orbit OCO-2 will study carbon dioxide by looking at the colors (or wavelengths) of sunlight that carbon dioxide absorbs. To identify very small changes in this absorption from one wavelength to the next, the OCO-2 instrument separates light into many narrow bands of wavelengths. But OCO-2's field of view is only about one . square mile (three square kilometers) - smaller than New York City's . Central Park. This allows it to dodge clouds, which regularly cover . about two-thirds of Earth; even a tiny wisp of cloud in OCO-2's view . compromises the measurement. Six to seven weeks after launch, OCO-2 will be maneuvered into its final operational orbit in the A-Train constellation, 438 miles (705 kilometers) above Earth. And the first science observations of carbon dioxide levels on our planet are slated to begin about 45 days after launch. Technicians are seen making last minute preparations before the launch of the rocket. Nasa had said there was zero chance of the launch being cancelled today. OCO-2 will be able to pinpoint where the planet's forests and ocean are reabsorbing atmospheric carbon, a cycle that is key to Earth's temperature . Pictured here is Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. The upper levels of the launch gantry can be seen, surrounding the United Launch Alliance Delta II rocket with the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) satellite onboard, at the Space Launch Complex 2 on 29 June 2014 . 'Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere plays a critical role in our planet's . energy balance and is a key factor in understanding how our climate is . changing,' said Michael Freilich, director of Nasa’s Earth Science . Division in Washington. 'With the OCO-2 mission, Nasa will be . contributing an important new source of global observations to the . scientific challenge of better understanding our Earth and its future.' Michael Gunson, OCO-2 project scientist at Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), Pasadena, California, added: 'Knowing what parts of Earth are helping remove carbon from our atmosphere will help us understand whether they will keep doing so in the future. 'Understanding the processes controlling carbon dioxide in our atmosphere will help us predict how fast it will build up in the future. 'Data from this mission will help scientists reduce uncertainties in forecasts of how much carbon dioxide will be in the atmosphere and improve the accuracy of global climate change predictions.' The United Launch Alliance Delta II rocket with the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) satellite onboard sits at the launch pad at the Vandenberg Air Force Base. About five minutes after launch the nose cone, pictured, will open up, unleashing the satellite into space and allowing it to enter its final orbit . Dave Crisp, OCO-2 science team leader at JPL (Jet Propulsion Laboratory), left, and Annmarie Eldering, OCO-2 deputy project scientist, also at JPL, are seen during a science briefing on 29 June 2014 ahead of the launch of the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 satellite . The spacecraft will sample the global geographic distribution of the sources and sinks of carbon dioxide and allow scientists to study their changes over time more completely than can be done with any existing data. Since 2009, Earth scientists have been preparing for OCO-2 by taking advantage of observations from the Japanese Gosat satellite. OCO-2 replaces a nearly identical Nasa spacecraft lost because of a rocket launch mishap in February 2009. That was when the original Orbiting Carbon Observatory failed to separate during ascent, and subsequently re-entered the atmosphere, crashing into the Indian Ocean near Antarctica. At approximately 400 parts per million, atmospheric carbon dioxide is now at its highest level in at least the past 800,000 years, according to Nasa. The burning of fossil fuels and other human activities are currently adding nearly 40 billion tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere each year, producing an unprecedented buildup in this greenhouse gas. OCO-2 measurements will be combined with data from ground stations, aircraft and other satellites to help answer questions about the processes that regulate atmospheric carbon dioxide and its role in Earth’s climate and carbon cycle. Mission data will also help assess the usefulness of space-based measurements of carbon dioxide for monitoring emissions.

"By . Katy Winter . A teacher has managed to lose five and a half stone after her size caused a classroom chair to break beneath her - in front of an entire class of pupils. Lucy Miller, 23, sat on the chair in front of her class, only to be mortified as it collapsed under her 17st weight. Humiliated, Lucy vowed to beat the bulge. She ditched her unhealthy lifestyle and now weighs in at just under 12st. Lucy has dropped from 17st 3lbs and size 22 to 11st 10lbs and a size 12 (right) It was after breaking the chair in class that Lucy decided it was time to take action about her size . Lucy said: 'When I felt the chair legs give way beneath me I was just so embarrassed. 'As I lay in a heap on the floor I heard one of the pupils say that I was too fat for the chair. 'The little boy wasn’t being rude - he was only five - but it was the shock I needed to make me realise how big I was. 'I picked myself up, trying to pretend like it was nothing, but it was just awful. 'I left school that day determined to do something about my weight.' Lucy, from Poulton-le-Fylde, Lancs, had piled on the pounds since becoming a primary school teacher. Lucy said: 'I’ve always been a big girl, I come from an overweight family and my mum was always on diets. Lucy, who has always struggled with her weight, found that it began to creep up when she started her job as a school teacher, but now she has shed the pounds she finds it much easier to keep up with the children . 'It was normal for me to have seconds or thirds after dinner, and at high school I’d always have sweets in my pocket. 'But when I got my first job as a teacher I put on even more weight. 'I’d have pastries and sweets for breakfast, have pies as a snack on my way home from work and then eat tea too. 'After eight months my trousers didn’t fit and I was wearing my baggiest blouses. Lucy said that her determination to lose weight was in part because both her parents suffered health conditions which can be made worse by being overweight . 'Even my size 22 dress was getting tight. 'It started to become difficult to sit down on the floor with the children, and run around after them. 'I’d dread teaching P.E because I didn’t have the energy to do it - it was a nightmare. 'I was always out of breath.' Breakfast: Nothing . Lunch: Fast food like KFC or Subway . Dinner: Large portion of cottage pie or chicken curry, plus cake or ice cream . Snacks: Many throughout the day . Breakfast: Cambridge Weight Plan shake . Lunch: Chicken salad . Dinner: Small portion of chicken and vegetables . Drink as much water as possible each day . But after breaking the chair in class, Lucy decided it was time to take action. Lucy now has lots oif energy and can easily keep up with her class . She joined the Cambridge Weight Plan in May 2013 and in just six months has gone from 17st 3lbs, to a svelte 11st 10lbs. She said: 'I’d tried various diets in the past but nothing ever worked for me. 'I’d spent so much time and money on diets, but it didn’t matter. 'I’d go to meetings to get weighed but then I’d head straight out the doors into the fish and chip shop. 'But this time it was different - I was so determined that I would lose it. 'It was hard at first but as the weight melted off I gained more energy and I loved the person I was becoming. 'Whenever I wanted to give up, I had to remember the health benefits. My dad had a heart attack and my mum has been diagnosed with high cholesterol - I didn’t want to go the same way as them. 'I think even my family and friends found it hard to believe that I would do it this time, with people telling me I’d never keep the weight off, but I was determined to prove myself. 'I wear a size 12 now, and I’m much more confident.' Now, Lucy has the energy to run around after her lively class of children. 'Now I can jump about in P.E, and put together fun and energetic lessons. 'Getting down on the floor to read to the children is no problem, and everything is so much easier. 'I’m so proud of myself for losing the weight, and it’s taught me so much. 'I love the fact that I am now a good role model for the children I teach in my school. 'It’s the best thing I’ve ever done, I’m so happy.'","Has dropped from 17st 3lbs and size 22 to 11st 10lbs and a size 12 .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . A fireball originating from space has been spotted streaking over the UK on camera. The ‘bolide’ meteor was spotted over the West Country, Wales and the West Midlands in the early hours of this morning. The rock did not cause any damage – but it serves as a reminder of how vulnerable our planet is to enormous objects hurtling through space. Scroll down for video . A meteor has been spotted streaking over skies of the UK. It was caught on two camera operated by the Norman Lockyer Observatory in Sidmoth, Devon, shown here in this still from a video. It did not cause any damage but shows how vulnerable our planet can be to space rocks such as asteroids and comets . The discovery was made by cameras at the Norman Lockyer Observatory in Sidmouth, Devon at 03:04 BST. There is no official definition of a bolide, but it is generally taken to be a fireball. It comes from the Greek 'bolis', which means missile. Particularly . bright meteors, such as the one spotted in the UK today, that burn up . in the atmosphere are generally regarded as bolides. Fireballs that explode in the upper atmosphere are also known as bolides. Bolides that reach exceptional brightness are known as superbolides. Events such as this in the UK are rare, so spotting one on camera is a huge achievement. Dave Jones of the UK Meteor Observation Network (UKMON) said it was by far the largest fireball ever spotted by the observatory. Some eyewitnesses are reported to have said it was green in colour. And it was said to even cast shadows due to its brightness. Astronomers at the Norman Lockyer Observatory in Sidmouth heard reports that a massive shooting star had been spotted streaking across the sky in the early hours. They rewound the observatory’s two fixed cameras and were thrilled to find a perfect clip of a flaming meteor arcing across the sky at 3:04am before disappearing behind clouds. 'We have two cameras that watch for meteors during darkness, so upon hearing the news I logged in to check our data and see if we had captured anything,' said Jones. 'Fortunately the meteor passed in front of both of our cameras so we ended up with two videos of the same event. 'Due to cloud and raindrops on the camera lenses the image was not as clear as we would like, however the sheer size and brightness of this object burning up in our atmosphere almost overwhelmed our cameras as it was so bright.' Mr Jones said Monday’s meteor was the largest the amateur team have caught on camera since the monitoring equipment was rigged up a year ago. They are currently studying the footage to get a better idea of its trajectory. Built in 1912 and situated 15 miles south of Exeter, the Norman Lockyer Observatory is used by students, researchers and amateur astronomers. Thanks to its coastal location and the lack of light pollution, it is renowned as one of the best places in the UK for spectral analysis. This meteor comes on the 106th anniversary of the Tunguska event. On 30 June 1908 a giant explosion occurred over the Tunguska River in Russia, believed to have been caused by an asteroid or comet exploding in the atmosphere. It flattened 770 square miles (2,000 square kilometres) of forest (picture taken in 1929) Reports suggest after entering the atmosphere this meteor broke up into pieces after the huge brightening event. Meteors that enter our atmosphere often undergo this intense event as they are heated during re-entry. On occasion rocks make it all the way through and impact the ground, forming craters. More often than not though the debris merely burns up in the atmosphere, in some cases as a super-heated fireball known as a bolide. Some even explode in the upper atmosphere and, if they’re big enough, can cause widespread damage just like the Tunguska event 106 years ago.

An asteroid is a large chunk of rock left over from collisions or the early solar system. Most are located between Mars and Jupiter in the Main Belt. A comet is a rock covered in ice, methane and other compounds. Their orbits take them much further out of the solar system. A meteor is what we call a flash of light in the atmosphere when debris burns up. This debris itself is known as a meteoroid. Most are so small they are vapourised in the atmosphere. If any of this meteoroid makes it to Earth, it is called a meteorite. Meteors, meteoroids and meteorites normally originate from asteroids and comets.","An observatory in Sidmouth, Devon has spotted a meteor over the UK .

"By . Carol Driver . Monarch is to introduce non-reclining seats across its entire fleet of planes. The light-weight design, to be rolled out this summer, has been launched to create more ‘living space’ for passengers after customer research showed the existing style was unpopular. It comes after surveys revealed that nine in ten travellers wanted reclining seats banned, and voted them one of the most common causes of mid-flight anger. Scroll down for video . New design: The lightweight seats on board Monarch's fleets do no recline . Feedback: Monarch said the design was launched after passengers were unhappy with reclining seats . Using light-weight materials that also achieve ‘significant’ savings on fuel emissions, Monarch, which flies from six UK bases including Gatwick, said the new seats offer passengers more legroom. It also includes a tablet holder for the technology-savvy holidaymaker, which the airline called ‘an aviation first’. The new, non-reclining thinner design is similar to that used in the automotive industry. Tim Williamson, Director of Customer Experience and Marketing, said: ‘Our new ergonomic seats have been designed with our customers’ needs in the forefront of our minds. More legroom: The new-look non-reclining seats also boast more 'living space' for passengers . Industry first: The new seats also have tablet holders so passengers can watch iPads on board flights . ‘The new non-reclining design gives our customers far more “living space” than traditional seats, without the fear of the person in front impinging on their personal space.’ He added that as customer feedback had rated seat storage as high importance, the new non-reclining plane seats offer more flexibility than traditional ‘pockets’ – and can ‘comfortably’ fit water bottles, jackets and children’s toys. In terms of fuel savings, when compared to Monarch’s existing seats, a set of the new designs a flight to Egypt saves 255kg fuel - equivalent to 816kg of carbon dioxide saved on a single flight, according to the airline. Mr Williamson said: ‘Monarch will introduce the new seats across our fleet this summer. New look: The design of the new, non-reclining seats, which also save fuel emissions . The space on board the flights includes a tablet holder for in-flight entertainment . ‘Our customer research indicated that the reclining feature of standard seats was not popular, and unnecessary, on a short haul flight. ‘Monarch's new non-reclining design ensures that all our customers enjoy a comfortable journey without the seat in front encroaching on their space, together with additional leg room. ‘The integrated tablet holder is also a first in the industry, allowing customers to relax and enjoy the content on their tablets, e-readers or smartphones without having to hold their devices or “prop” them up against the seat in front. ‘Extensive research has been undertaken throughout the development process, examining aspects including the optimum amount of padding and seat angle, and the end result is a carefully-crafted ergonomic design delivering both optimum comfort and practical features that our customers will appreciate.’ A woman was hit over the head with a wine bottle in 2006 when she refused to put her seat upright . The announcement from Monarch, the UK’s longest-established airline which also flies from Manchester and Birmingham, comes after a Skyscanner survey last year revealed 90 per cent of travellers wanted reclining seats banned. In a separate survey, CabinCrew.com found more than 60 per cent of international cabin crew had seen an argument between passengers over reclining seats. Lightweight seats will save 562lb of fuel on a five-hour flight, equivalent to 1,799lb of carbon dioxide. Monarch has trailled prototypes over the past 11 months, but the updated version features extra padding in line with customer feedback. One customer wrote on MailOnline yesterday: ‘I have already sat in those new seats and have to say they were surprisingly comfortable. More leg room too – this is a winner!’ But another added: ‘Not comfortable at all! It was like sitting on a wooden chair.’ Budget airline Ryanair scrapped reclining seats in 2003 and EasyJet followed suit four years later.","Monarch Airlines introduces new light-weight seat after customer feedback .

"By . Daily Mail Repoter . Natalie Cochrane was brought down to earth after being told she was too fat to go on a helicopter ride over a volcano during a dream holiday to the United States. Natalie, a businesswoman from Nottinghamshire, used to tip the scales at 19.5st but decided drastic action was needed and now weighs just 10st. She was on a once-in-a-life-time holiday with her brother, Nathan, 24, and father Roger, 68, which included stops in San Francisco, Las Vegas and Hawaii, where the family had planned to take a helicopter ride over a volcano. Slender: Natalie Cochrane, 26, is now a svelte size 12 after losing more than nine stone in 12 months . This humiliation was the final straw for the former recruitment consultant from who decided to go on a radical diet, cutting her daily calorie intake from 4,000 to 500. Natalie, 26, who is now a size 12 and weighs 10st, said: 'It makes me feel a bit sick to think of all the food I used to eat. 'I was constantly shovelling junk food in my mouth, I didn’t care what it was. I was aware of my weight but I just carried on eating too much of the wrong sort of food.' Speaking about the moment she finally realised that she needed to do something about her bulk, she added: 'I was looking forward to the helicopter ride and and when I was told I couldn’t go, I was disappointed and embarrassed. 'I decided there and then I had to do something about my weight. That was in October 2012. When I switched to my new diet I felt light-headed at first and had a few headaches but it wasn’t long before I began to feel better and had more energy.' Embarrassing: Natalie was humiliated during a holiday in the US with brother Nathan (l) and father Roger (c) Transformation: Natalie now feels much happier and healthier since losing weight . But although the helicopter ride proved to be the catalyst she needed, it wasn't the first time her weight had had an impact on her life. 'I was always a big girl,' she remembers. 'When I went to boarding school I began to notice my weight more, especially when the girls were swapping clothes and I couldn’t join in. 'I remember weighing myself when I was 16 and my age was the same as my weight.' Natalie, a former recruitment consultant, from Colwick, near Nottingham, has now set up her own weight loss consultancy called Brand New You. She added: 'I want to be an inspiration to people whether they want to lose one stone or ten. If I can do it anyone can - just making a few small changes can make all the difference.' Brother Nathan said he had seen a positive change in his sister since her dramatic weight loss. Cut down: Natalie's 4,000 calorie a day diet has now been exchanged for a healthy 500 calorie daily menu . 'Natalie and I were looking through old pictures of ourselves the other day, and we hadn’t noticed before, but Natalie just looked so upset in the pictures - it’s completely different to how she is now.'I remember seeing Natalie’s face when we were on the plane to America and the meal came round.

"By . Adam Crafton . Follow @@AdamCrafton_ . As Brazil prepare to take on Germany in the World Cup semi-final on Tuesday evening, they do so deprived of the services of their talisman Neymar and shorn of the attacking spark so readily associated with the country’s brand of football. In Neymar,'s absence the burden passes to the underwhelming Fred, notable only for his Anglicised name and the increasingly exasperating Hulk. It begs the question as to just what has happened to a country famed for attacking brilliance. Here, Sportsmail charts the alarming decline of several celebrated names that should, really, have been destined to play a major part in Brazil…. Scroll down for videos . Out: Alexandre Pato . Out: Kaka . Out: Robinho . Out: Philippe Coutinho . Down and out: Neymar's spinal injury has left Brazil fans looking for alternative attacking options . VIDEO Brazilian celebration tempered by Neymar injury . Alexandre Pato . Caps: 27, Goals: 10 . As a teenager, Pato was destined to be the star of this World Cup in his native Brazil. A precocious talent of extraordinary ability, he drew comparisons with the great Zico and broke Pele’s record as the youngest goal scorer in a FIFA competition as a 17-year-old. He earned a move to Italian giants AC Milan and then the problems began. Milan’s medical experts attributed his series of injuries to a growth spurt, but his party-going exploits caused equal measures of anxiety. Things started well, with the forward scoring 48 goals in his first 105 appearances but a high-profile relationship with the daughter of Silvio Berlusconi exposed Pato to the glare of the paparazzi, with the couple playing to the hype and relishing the publicity. Forgotten man: Pato celebrates a goal for Brazil against the US less than four years ago . Return to Europe? Pato has been playing for Sao Paulo but might be on his way back to Milan with Inter . It was even alleged that she personally put a block on a move to PSG - out of love - after his form had begun to suffer. Eventually, after making just 15 Serie A appearances in his final two years at the San Siro, he returned to Corinthians in January 2013. His time at Corinthians was scarred by poor form and violence and now aged 24, a return to Europe with Inter may be on the cards this summer as he seeks to resuscitate his career. Difficulties: Pato was seen as the next world class Brazil striker but he suffered with injuries in Milan . Kaka . Caps: 87, Goals: 29 . Still only 32, Kaka, the former World Player of the Year remains an immensely popular figure in Brazil, with 20,000 supporters gathering at the Marumbi Stadium to welcome him back to Sao Paulo earlier this month. Kaka, such a magnificent talent for AC Milan as the Rossoneri won the UEFA Champions League in 2007, saw his career stagnate after a sensational £56million move to Real Madrid, mostly due a serious injury to his left knee. Playmaker: The one-time world player of the year was Brazil's big hope in 2010 but they flopped . Home from home: Kaka was back with Milan last season but now is heading for Brazil and then the MLS . VIDEO No ill-felings over Brazil snub - Kaka . Four years on, he re-joined Milan on a free transfer last summer. He netted seven times last season but was unable to win over Luiz Felipe Scolari on the occasions that the Brazilian manager came to Italy to assess his performances. Kaka is now heading to the MLS with Orlando - via a loan move to his very first club Sao Paulo. Disappointment: His form in Italy earned a £65million move to Real Madrid but he struggled in Spain . Robinho . Caps: 92, Goals: 27 . The boy wonder that once led one Spanish newspaper to declare: ‘And God created Robinho!’ is now 30-years-old. There has never been a doubt over Robinho natural talent and the show-pony step-overs and shimmies represent all that the Brazilians adore about the game. His application, however, brings his ability into question. He left both Mark Hughes and Roberto Mancini exasperated during his time with Manchester City, even if there were occasions when training would be paused so City’s young stars could applaud the latest moment of extraordinary inspiration by the Brazilian. Outsider: Robinho had been tipped by some for a place in Scolari's squad but he was eventually left out . Up there with the best: The Brazil trickster holds off Gerard Pique during a Champions League game . After scoring just six goals in his last two season with AC Milan, one of the brightest sparks from Brazil’s disappointing 2010 World Cup was omitted by Scolari. Quite simply, the 2014 incarnation of the Brazil, characterised by their high intensity and highly disciplined game-plans, do not make allowances for luxury passengers. A move for US awaits. Trend setter: Robinho was the first of the big money signings for Manchester City but he was frustrating . And what about Coutinho? Caps: 1, Goals: 0 . The Liverpool playmaker was a surprise omission to most observers that have watched Coutinho’s glittering performances at Anfield in the last twelve months. And that perception has only been amplified by the shoddy showings produced by Hulk from the left wing in Brazil. Potential: Coutinho played alongside Oscar in Brazil's successful 2011 U-20 World Cup campaign . Club form: Coutinho was brilliant for Brendan Rodgers' Liverpool as they finish second in the Premier League . Scolari opted for Hulk and Chelsea pair Oscar and Willian ahead of Coutinho and it is perhaps this decision that looks the most questionable as Brazil toil in the absence of their traditional flair at this World Cup. Coutinho’s ability to produce an eye-of-the-needle pass and counter attack with pace and quality would have been a useful addition to Brazil’s forward line but at the age of 22, he still has time to break into his national squad in the coming years. Missing link: It seems Coutinho's late-season Liverpool form was not enough to impress Scolari .","Those three Brazil stars plus Pato were all left out by Scolari .

"By . Mark Prigg . Researchers have uncovered a hidden world underneath Greenland. Beneath the barren whiteness, researchers say there are a vast series of sculptures the size of skyscrapers. Using ice-penetrating radar, researchers have discovered the ragged blocks of ice as tall as city skyscrapers and as wide as the island of Manhattan at the very bottom of the ice sheet. Using ice penetrating radar,  researchers have discovered the ragged blocks of ice as tall as city skyscrapers and as wide as the island of Manhattan at the very bottom of the Greenland ice sheet. The structures cover about a tenth of northern Greenland, the researchers estimate, becoming bigger and more common as the ice sheet narrows into ice streams, or glaciers, headed for the sea. As meltwater at the bottom refreezes over hundreds to thousands of years, the researchers believe it radiates heat into the surrounding ice sheet, making it pick up its pace as the ice becomes softer and flows more easily. The structures formed as water beneath the ice refreezes and warps the surrounding ice upwards. The newly revealed forms may help scientists understand more about how ice sheets behave and how they will respond to a warming climate, the researchers say in Nature Geoscience. 'We see more of these features where the ice sheet starts to go fast,' said the study's lead author, Robin Bell, a geophysicist at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. 'We think the refreezing process uplifts, distorts and warms the ice above, making it softer and easier to flow.' The structures cover about a tenth of northern Greenland, the researchers estimate, becoming bigger and more common as the ice sheet narrows into ice streams, or glaciers, headed for the sea. As meltwater at the bottom refreezes over hundreds to thousands of years, the researchers believe it radiates heat into the surrounding ice sheet, making it pick up its pace as the ice becomes softer and flows more easily. After Antarctica, Greenland's ice cap contains the second largest mass . of frozen freshwater in the world. The ice sheet ice sheet covers 660,000 sq miles (1,710,000 square km), or roughly 80 per cent of the surface of Greenland. Currently, melting from Greenland accounts . is thought to account for around 10 per cent of sea level rise. Since the 1970s, and as recently as 1998, researchers flying over the region mistook radar images of these structures for hills. Newer instruments flown during NASA's IceBridge campaign to map ice loss at both poles found the hills to be made of ice instead of rock. The same area, seen from above - showing no signed of the warped ice below . Bell, who had discovered similar ice features at the base of the East Antarctic ice sheet, recognized them immediately. While mapping Antarctica's ice-covered Gamburtsev Mountains in 2008 and 2009, Bell and colleagues discovered extensive melting and refreezing along ridges and steep valley walls of the range. Though researchers had long known that pressure and friction can melt the bottom of ice sheets, no one knew that refreezing water could deform the layer-cake structure above. The topography of West Greenland is shown in this graphic with hidden valleys in blue by previous research into the area. On the right is the bed topography beneath the ice sheet. On the left is the surface topography and ice velocities . In a 2011 study in Science, Bell and colleagues proposed that ice sheets can grow from the bottom up, not just from the top-down accumulation of falling snow.The current study builds on the findings from Antarctica by linking the bottom features to faster ice sheet flow. The researchers looked at Petermann Glacier in the north of Greenland, which made headlines in 2010 when a 100-square mile chunk of ice slipped into the sea. They discovered that Petermann Glacier is sweeping a dozen large features with it toward the coast as it funnels off the ice sheet; one feature sits where satellite data has shown part of the glacier racing twice as fast as nearby ice. The researchers suggest that the refreeze process is influencing the glacier's advance hundreds of miles from where Petermann floats onto the sea. 'Overall, these observations suggest that basal freeze-on is a key control on the large-scale flow of Petermann Glacier, a possibility that has not been explored previously,' writes University of Texas researcher Joseph MacGregor in the same issue of Nature Geoscience. Greenland's glaciers appear to be moving more rapidly toward the sea as climate warms but it remains unclear how the refreeze process will influence this trend, the researchers said. They expected to find bottom features in the ice sheet's interior, as they did in Antarctica, but did not expect to see features at the edges, where lakes form and rivers flow over the surface, they said. Water from those lakes and rivers appears to fall through crevasses and other holes in the ice to reach the base of the ice sheet, where some of it apparently refreezes. Their discovery indicates that refreezing and deformation at the base of the ice sheet may be far more widespread than previously thought. Bell and her colleagues believe that similar features may come to light as other parts of Greenland and Antarctica are studied in closer detail. Flying over northern Greenland during the 2011 Ice Bridge season, Kirsty Tinto, a geophysicist at Lamont-Doherty, sat up straight when the radar images began to reveal a deformed layer-cake structure. 'When you're flying over this flat, white landscape people almost fall asleep it's so boring—layer cake, layer cake, layer cake,' said Tinto, a study coauthor. 'But then suddenly these things appear on the screen. It's very exciting. You get a sense of these invisible processes happening underneath.'","Giant 'warps' in the ice caused by melting and refreezing .

"By . Ryan Gorman . A 54-year-old inmate in prison since he was a teenager for being an accomplice to one of the most disturbing murders in Michigan history has been freed from his life sentence for parole. Timothy Spytma will be released July 18 and subject to a four-year parole. His accomplice Michael Saxton was released on parole in 1986. The two men were convicted in the vicious beating, rape and murder of 42-year-old neighbor Phyllis Doctor on December 16, 1974. Both were high on drugs during the frenzied attack and ransacking of her home. Soon to be free: Timothy Spytma has been behind bars since the 1970s but will be set free on parole later this month . Both broke into the woman’s home at Spytma’s urging, according to the Kalmazoo Gazette. They originally planned only to rob her, but things took a violent turn when she came home early. Spytma grabbed and hit doctor as many as five times on the back of her head with the handle of a closed pocket knife until she was knocked out, authorities said. The duo then blindfolded the unconscious woman and brought her to a bedroom where Saxton raped her before smashing her skull with a baseball bat and a bottle, according to the prosecutor. Both men wrote on her nude body and Spytma slashed her wrists with that same pocket knife before they pilfered televisions, rifles, a stereo and other valuables into her car and sped off, officials said. Her body was discovered by her then-17-year-old son after he came home from school, according to the paper. Accomplices: Spytma, left foreground, and co-defendant Michael L. Saxton in custody after the December 16, 1974, murder of Phyllis Doctor, 42, in her Laketon Township home. Saxton was released 28 years ago . Killer: This is Spytma's original mug shot after he was arrested for the brutal murder . An accident in downtown Muskegon brought them down in a hurry. They were tried as adults and convicted of first-degree murder and burglary, which resulted in a mandatory sentence of life in prison without the chance of parole in Michigan. A 1982 court decision ruled that burglary could only be committed at night, and led to their burglary charges being overturned, according to he paper. This led to their first-degree murder convictions being reduced to second-degree murder. Saxton’s judge handed him a 20 to 40-year prison sentence and he was paroled in 1986 after only 12 years behind bars on ‘good time credit,’ according to the site. Spytma’s judge gave him a life sentence with the possibility of parole, and it had been denied every five years since 1988 – until now. The first actual parole hearing was held May 1, and the parole board agreed to let Spytma out later this year. The judge called it ‘among the most difficult decisions I have ever been asked to make as a circuit judge,’ but cited Spytma’s contrition and good prison record as reasons to free him, according to the paper. Spytma will be out from behind bars in less than two weeks.","Timothy Spytma and an accomplice were sentenced to life in prison for the 1976 beating, rape and murder of a neighbor during a robbery gone bad .

"By . Mark Prigg . With its magnetic fields swarming, solar flares erupting, and gigantic columns of material constantly on the move, researchers have always known the sun has a large and extremely active atmosphere. Now researchers have revealed in fact it stretches for five million miles - far further than previously thought. Nasa says the results are so stunning they may even have to alter future missions because of the huge protective bubble. Scroll down for video . Scientists used these observations of the sun's atmosphere (the bright light of the sun itself is blocked by the black circle at the middle) from NASA's Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory on Aug. 5, 2007, to define the outer limits of the solar atmosphere, the corona. Nasa's Solar Probe Plus will travel to within 4 million miles of the sun in 2018. The mission will directly measure the density, velocity and magnetic field of the solar material there. Nasa hopes it will allow scientists to understand how motion and heat in the corona and solar wind are generated. With direct access to the sun's atmosphere, Solar Probe Plus will provide unprecedented information on how the solar corona is heated and revolutionize our knowledge of the origin and evolution of the solar wind. Using NASA's Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory, scientists have found that this atmosphere, called the corona, is even larger than thought, extending out some 5 million miles above the sun's surface - the equivalent of 12 solar radii. This information has implications for NASA's upcoming Solar Probe Plus mission, due to launch in 2018 and go closer to the sun than any man-made technology ever has before. The observations provide the first direct measurements of the inner boundary of the heliosphere -- the giant bubble sparsely filled with solar particles that surrounds the sun and all the planets. 'Combined with measurements from Voyager 1 of the outer boundary of the heliosphere, we have now defined the extent of this entire local bubble,' researchers say. Scientists used these observations of the sun's atmosphere (the bright light of the sun itself is blocked by the black circle at the middle) from NASA's Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory on Aug. 5, 2007, to define the outer limits of the solar atmosphere, the corona. 'We've tracked sound-like waves through the outer corona and used these to map the atmosphere,' said Craig DeForest of the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado. The results were published in The Astrophysical Journal on May 12, 2014. The researchers studied waves known as magnetosonic waves, and they are a hybrid of sound waves and magnetic waves called Alfven waves. Unlike sound waves on Earth, which oscillate several hundred times per second, these waves oscillate about once every four hours -- and are about 10 times the length of Earth. Tracking magnetosonic waves showed DeForest and his team that the material throughout this extended space remained connected to the solar material much further in. That is to say that even out to 5 million miles from the sun, giant solar storms or coronal mass ejections can create ripple effects felt through the corona. A solar flare erupting: researchers have now revealed the full extent of the sun's atmosphere, which stretches for five million miles. Beyond that boundary, however, solar material streams away in a steady flow called the solar wind -- out there, the material has separated from the star and its movement can't affect the corona. Realizing that the corona extends much further than previously thought has important consequences for NASA's Solar Probe Plus because the mission will travel to within 4 million miles of the sun. Scientists knew the mission would be gathering information closer to the sun than ever before, but couldn't be sure it would travel through the corona proper. Highly processed movies from NASA's Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory show wave motions moving downward through the solar corona toward the sun.","First direct measurements of the inner boundary of the heliosphere .

Ms Oakley . was just 25 when she literally shot herself to fame as the top . attraction in Buffalo Bill Cody’s travelling Wild West show. 'f you wanted to own an Annie Oakley artifact this is as good as it gets,' an auction house spokesperson told NBC. The artifacts were cosigned by the world-famous reporter's great grandniece, the spokesperson added. Her . most famous trick was shooting a playing card facing side-on, then . hitting the pieces again as they fell to the floor –from 90ft away. She used it to wow audiences around the world for 20 years before retiring from the show to take up acting. During her time on the road she performed in Europe for dignitaries including Britain's Queen Victoria and Germany's Kaiser Wilhelm II. She was so sure of her talent that for one daring stunt she shot the Kaiser’s cigarette from his mouth. Annie Oakley's shotgun: The gun once wielded by famed the Wild West gunslinger is on sale . Annie Oakley's rifle shoulder strap: This is what the Wild West gunslinger carried her gun in .

Also up for sale is Oakley’s treasured charm bracelet boasting trinkets from her admirers including one from Buffalo Bill. Experts have tipped both the gun and the charm bracelet to fetch about $97,000 each when they go under the hammer. They are being sold by Oakley’s great grand niece Bess Edwards, 90, who in 1984 established the Annie Oakley Foundation in her memory. 'Annie Oakley is remembered as an incredibly talented trick shooter who was the star performer with Buffalo Bill’s Wild West Show for almost 20 years. Tom Slater, an expert in Americana at auctioneers Heritage, said. 'She was so popular that arguably she made Buffalo Bill’s show famous, not the other way round. 'Annie was skilled with a gun from an early age and was named Little Sure Shot by Native American chief Sitting Bull who also toured with the show. 'She would use all manner of guns in her act but she favored shotguns because their scatter-spray meant it was slightly easier to hit targets. 'She bought this gun in 1883 and there is no evidence of her owning a gun before this one. 'Parker guns were the best you could get and she used this gun throughout her time with the Wild West show.

"By . Elaine Loughlin . and Matt Chorley . Ryanair has dismissed one of its longest-serving pilots for blowing the whistle on alleged safety concerns at the budget airline. John Goss was sacked with ‘immediate effect’ and the airline issued legal proceedings against him after he appeared in a documentary about its safety policy. Ryanair said Captain Goss, who was with the firm for 27 years, had been dismissed for ‘gross misconduct’. Senior Labour MP Barry Sheerman today called for an urgent investigation into safety at the airline in the light of the revelations. Captain John Goss (left), who had worked for . the budget airline for 26 years, was sacked in the wake of a Channel 4 . Dispatches programme which investigated safety at the airline. The Dispatches programme looked into the safety of . airline Ryanair, which is headed up by chief executive Michael O'Leary (right) Ryanair yesterday said it was dismissing Mr Goss - an experienced pilot who was due to retire in October – for ‘gross misconduct’. Last night chairman of the Ryanair Pilot Group Evert van Zwol said: ‘This is a particularly difficult time for John and his family.’ The representative added: ‘We will provide every support possible to enable John to deal with this challenging situation. ‘I am sure you will understand his first priority is to look after his family and to seek legal advice on his options.’ Captain Goss had also recently received a warning from Ryanair after he gave a newspaper interview about safety issues. And in 2005 he was involved in a High Court case against Ryanair after it tried to bring disciplinary proceedings against him. The case was later settled and the pilot continued to work for Ryanair up until this week. Ryanair yesterday said it was dismissing . Mr Goss - an experienced pilot who was due to retire in October – for . ‘gross misconduct’ The survey featured in Dispatches was organised by an interim council of the Ryanair Pilots Group, which includes KLM, Aer Lingus, Southwest and Air France pilots. Of 1,000 Ryanair pilots – 94 per cent wanted regulators to conduct an inquiry into the impact of employment practices on safety. However, the Irish Airline Authority has denied all the allegations in the documentary and the authority says that Ryanair has always complied with safety requirements. But MPs called on the Civil Aviation Authority to launch an investigation. Mr Sheerman, the chairman of the Parliamentary Advisory Council for Transport Safety, told MainOnline: 'I have been in touch with the chairman of the Civil Aviation Authority and said I want an immediate inquiry into Ryanair’s safety record. 'This is serious stuff. We have got a bit complacent on air safety in this country. We have got to be vigilant. 'What Ryanair appears to be up to isn’t the way to treat staff or safety. It is not right to be sweeping safety under the carpet.’ Although a number of pilots had contributed to the programme, Captain Goss was the only one identified. A Ryanair spokesman said the company had been ‘independently confirmed’ as one of the safest airlines in Europe. ‘We will not allow a Ryanair employee to defame our safety on national television just three weeks after he confirmed in writing to Ryanair that he had no concerns with safety,’ the carrier stated. ‘We look forward to correcting Mr Goss’s defamatory claims in court in due course, but will not be commenting further.’ Captain van Zwol said the dismissal shows the ‘hollowness’ of Ryanair’s promise to legally protect the pilots who took part in the Dispatches programme, if those pilots revealed their identities. ‘The very pilot who freely identified himself on the programme, and spoke about the general lack of confidence by pilots in the broader regulatory system, has suffered instant dismissal,’ he said. The IAA insisted that Ryanair’s fuel policy is in line with EU regulations. It said: ‘The IAA is disappointed that once again Channel 4 Dispatches has decided to engage in a misguided attack on the regulation of a low-cost carrier, based upon false and misleading information, which may undermine the travelling public’s confidence in civil air transport in Europe.’ Last night Socialist TD Clare Daly called for urgent legislation to protect whistleblowers.

"By . Tamara Cohen . UKIP faces a fresh sexism row after the party's treasurer claimed women are failing to progress in the boardroom because they are 'absolutely nowhere' when it comes to competitive sports such as chess. Stuart Wheeler was accused of being sexist after suggesting in a debate that having more women was not necessarily an advantage. The UKIP donor and treasurer said: ‘I would just like to challenge the idea that it is necessarily right to have a lot of women or a particular number on a board.' Controversy: Betting tycoon Stuart Wheeler, the UKIP treasurer, suggested women were not cut out for business because they lacked a sporting competitive streak . The betting tycoon went on: ‘Business is very, very competitive and you should take the performance of women at another competitive area, which is sport where they have no strength advantage. 'Chess, bridge, poker - women come absolutely nowhere, and I think that just has to be borne in mind.’ The former Tory donor who switched to UKIP was challenged by one of the panellists Dr Clare Gerada, chair of the Royal College of GPs, who said: ‘I think that is such a disingenuous, sexist comment.’ She said her mother, who is 83, was a chess champion in Malta for several years. Mr Wheeler, 78, father of Burberry model Jacquetta Wheeler, added after the debate that he was not claiming women were less intelligent because they 'come out of the universities doing at least as well as men if not better'. But he told the Mail: 'Yet when it comes to the highest levels of those competitive sports where all that matters is intellectual ability, and determination and perhaps stamina for some reason - and I don't know what the reason is - they are nowhere. ‘I don’t accept it is sexist, it simply rings true. It may be that women are not as competitive as men, although women do well in law, they are quite successful barristers....I was just saying it’s interesting and I don’t have an explanation.’ Women make up 17 per cent of boards of FTSE 100 firms, and several of the top 100 companies do not have a single female board director. Just three per cent of chief executive are women. One of the panelists at the debate at the Institute of Economic Affairs, was UKIP MEP Godfrey Bloom who caused a storm last week by claiming Britain’s foreign aid goes to ‘bongo bongo land’. He said quotas for women in companies would come in Britain as a result of pressure from the European Union and said: ‘We have to fight this tooth and nail’, saying the idea was ‘totally patronising and archaic.’ Outspoken: UKIP MEP Godfrey Bloom, who railed against foreign aid being sent to 'Bongo Bongo land', vowed to fight plans for women on company boards 'tooth and nail' UKIP blundered further when they launched a website in Wales calling themselves the 'Black Independence party'. When trying to translate the party's name into Welsh they came up with 'Plaid Annibyniaeth y Du.' DU is the abbreviation for the UK in Welsh but 'du' means black. A spokesman said: 'It's a screw up, we have now rectified it' and said it was not a re-branding of the party. Its MEP Godfrey Bloom has been under fire for saying Britain sends foreign aid to 'bongo bongo land' - which he denied was racist or intended to be a derogatory reference to Africa. UKIP says it wants an end to 'mass, uncontrolled immigration' including a five-year freeze on permanent settlement, and any future migration strictly limited to those who can 'clearly be shown to benefit the British people as a whole and our economy'. They would not allow immigrants to apply for public housing or benefits until they had paid tax for five years. In order to achieve these goals they say Britain would have to leave the EU because there are no restrictions on other EU citizens moving to the UK while it remains a member. Mr Bloom claimed if anyone suffered . prejudice it was actually men – saying in many walks of life women are . promoted ‘beyond their abilities’. He . said: ‘If you worked certainly in the public sector or a reasonably . large company who can smell which way the wind is blowing, you are far . more likely to be advanced by being a woman in your quest for promotion . than disadvantaged. ‘Nigel . [Farage] and I can give you personal stories about how that's worked in . the [European] Commission where very, very highly qualified men have . been jumped over to get a woman into a more senior position with nowhere . near the qualifications.’ He also claimed that when he was in the army, before becoming a City pension fund manager, women were allowed to pass courses because examiners ‘didn't have the bottle’ to fail them. Mr Bloom has previously courted controversy by claiming that ‘no self-respecting small businessman with a brain in the right place would ever employ a lady of child-bearing age’. And he claimed many women do not want to be on the boards of companies as they make ‘wiser’ choices about their careers. Those who want quotas, he said, ‘sadly have no great confidence in their sisters and think women need special help.’ He has had several successful female bosses during his career, he said, saying: ‘My ultimate boss of course was her Majesty. I go home and I work for another one – Mrs Bloom. I go up to my secretary’s office and she tells me exactly what to do.’ Mr Bloom also joked that he and Nigel Farage, the UKIP leader, had been trying and failing to be invited to one of Italian President Silvio Berlusconi’s infamous ‘bunga bunga’ parties ‘for years’. He said: ‘We still hope that he somehow manages another term and he remembers us’. Dr Gerada and fellow panelists including Jo Fairley, a former magazine editor and the founder of Green and Black’s chocolate, argued that quotas were not the answer but the root causes of under-representation of women – such as flexible working hours, childcare costs and low aspirations among girls at school – could be tackled.","Stuart Wheeler accused of being sexist during debate on women on boards .

"By . Tamara Cohen . Ed Miliband is now as unpopular as Gordon Brown, with a new poll show more than six out of ten voters do not like him. His public satisfaction has plunged to its lowest level since he became leader, according to the Ipsos MORI survey. It found 63 per cent of people say they do not like Mr Miliband and only 30 per cent like him, following a summer of criticism from within his own party. Trouble at the top: Two thirds of people say they do not like Ed Miliband, who has suffered criticism of his leadership this summer . Yolks on him: The contents of the eggs splattered over passersby and journalists after cracking on Ed Miliband's head . Last October only 56 per cent of the public said they disliked him, from a high of 51 per cent in January 2011. Meanwhile David Cameron - who is consistently more popular than the Conservative party, while for Mr Miliband it is the other way round - is liked by 43 per cent of those polled by Ipsos MORI. The Prime Minister disliked by 52 per cent, while Nick Clegg is slightly more popular than the Labour leader, with 57 per cent disliking him and 33 per cent liking him. Mr Miliband’s personal rating compares with Gordon Brown’s in 2009, although at the height of the former prime minister’s unpopularity just one in seven people thought he was fit for office. The Labour leader's attempt at a political . re-launch backfired yesterday - as he was pelted with eggs while meeting . the public at a south London market. Head to head: David Cameron is ahead of Ed Miliband on net satisfaction, while Nick Clegg trails on -35 . It piles pressure on the Labour leader, who has been stung by accusation from his own MPs that he is not coming up with policies with attract voters and Labour’s message is ‘incoherent’. While the poll found only 23 per cent of Tory voters said they do not know what David Cameron stands for, 40 per cent of Labour voters feel confused about Mr Miliband, while Mr Clegg not far behind with 38 per cent. However the Labour party are still ahead in the polls, clinging on to a double digit lead on 40 per cent, with the Conservatives up one on 30 per cent, the Lib Dems remaining on 10 per cent, and Ukip down one point to 11 per cent. Labour is also still the most ‘liked’ party, and the Conservatives most ‘disliked’. Doubts: Worryingly for David Cameron, more than half of people say they do not know what he stands for. Ipsos MORI surveyed 1,007 British adults from August 10-12 . Gideon Skinner, Ipsos MORI’s head of political research, said: ‘The challenge facing all party leaders is getting their ideas across to the public. ‘It’s most acute for Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg, even among their own supporters, and isn’t helped by their low personal ratings. Despite that Labour have held onto their lead.’ A senior Labour source said: ‘The fact that Labour has a ten-point lead in this poll shows that people across the country faced with a cost of living crisis are increasingly seeking an alternative to this out-of-touch Government.’ Andy Burnham, the shadow health secretary is the most senior figure to weigh in over Labour’s woes, saying his boss needed to ‘shout louder’ and come up with a vision for the economy or Labour would lose the next election. Former minister Chris Mullin accused him of lacking a ‘strong coherent message.’ Mr Miliband slapped down his critics this week as he returned from holiday, saying: ‘If we take this area of the cost of living crisis, have Labour got answers? Absolutely we’ve got answers. ‘On rail fares, on energy prices, on payday lenders and on a fairer tax system, they’re all the things I believe the country wants and that’s what we’re going to be talking about in the coming months.’","New survey reveals 63 per cent say they do not like the Labour leader .

"By . Sam Greenhill . and Peter Campbell . Google faced renewed outrage yesterday as its latest accounts revealed that it paid less than £12million corporation tax last year on bumper UK sales of £3billion. The ‘paltry’ sum was criticised by MPs, who called for action to force the internet giant to pay more. Its tax bill is only slightly higher than the previous year, when there was outcry over the way corporations such as Amazon, Starbucks and Google all found ways to avoid paying tax. Google’s accounts show that it handed over £11.6million in corporation tax for the 2012 financial year. Yet it raked in £3billion in revenues from its UK operations. Under fire: Google has been accused of 'sleight of hand' by not including the £3billion figure in its UK accounts . Margaret Hodge, chairman of the influential Commons Public Accounts Committee, said: ‘Yet again, this is a paltry sum. ‘They have been talking the talk about paying more tax, but not walking the walk. ‘I remain of the view that the Government must engage in litigation to force Google to cough up.’ Mrs Hodge branded the company ‘calculated, unethical and evil’ when its bosses appeared before her committee in May. She said yesterday: ‘Despite all the adverse publicity and damage to their brand, they still seem to show no corporate responsibility over tax.’ Google was also accused of a ‘sleight of hand’ by not including the £3billion sales figure in its UK accounts, which suggest that it accumulated sales of only £506million, leading to profits of £36.8million. But the £3billion figure for UK sales is included in its US accounts. The online search giant has long claimed that its UK operations are a service arm of its Irish division. Repetition: Google's vice president for northern and central Europe, Matt Brittin, faced the committee in 2012 . Select committee chairman Margaret Hodge branded the company 'calculated, unethical and evil' It uses a complicated tax structure to register the vast majority of its UK sales in Ireland, in a practice branded ‘immoral’ by MPs. The structure has angered critics, who argue that the company operates in the UK and should pay full tax here. In the financial year 2011, Google paid £7.3million in corporation tax, on sales of £3.1billion. Alex Smith, from the campaign group UK Uncut, said yesterday: ‘The search continues for Google’s tax contribution – and it seems that, as another year passes, this is still as elusive as its morality. ‘The company’s slogan is “Don’t do evil” but yet again we see it doing its level best to avoid tax and maximise its profits.’ Google’s accounts show the company has been forced by the taxman to set aside a further £24million to fund back-payments, after tax officials closed one of the loopholes used by the US group. But critics said this was a small sum to pay. Tax accountant Richard Murphy said: ‘This does feel like the Revenue has come to a cosy deal with Google. 'It is an agreement to make it look as though tax is being paid, but it will leave Google off the hook over the big issue of whether it does business here.’ In 2010, HMRC began an investigation into Google’s tax affairs, which is expected to end in the coming months. The California-based internet giant paid just £10million in UK corporation tax between 2006 and 2011, despite revenues of £11.9billion. Google boss Eric Schmidt recently defended his firm’s meagre tax contribution. ‘What we are doing is legal,’ he said. ‘I’m rather perplexed by this debate. If the British system changes the tax laws, we will comply.’ Last night a Google spokesman said: ‘Like most multinationals we pay the bulk of our £1.2billion corporate tax bill where our business originated, in our case the US. 'That’s a rate of more than 19 per cent, roughly what a UK-based company would pay. ‘We’re also a significant contributor to the UK economy, having created over 2,000 jobs. 'This year alone we’ve invested more than £300million in property, and tax related to our UK operations totalled more than £150million.’","After last year's outcry, Google handed over £11.6million in corporation tax .

"By . Mark Prigg . Experts tracking a great white shark through the Gulf of Mexico say the giant killer is heading for Texas. Katherine, a 14 foot Great White, sends a signal every time she surfaces. The 2,300-pound shark is part of a pioneering programme to show shark movements live online. Click here to open an interactive version of the map . Katharine is currently off the coast of Florida, heading towards texas . Katharine, who was tagged off Cape Cod, Massachusetts, was named by Cat Products fans in honor of Katharine Lee Bates. The Cape Cod native and songwriter - best known for her poem and song 'America The Beautiful', which has been called 'an expression of patriotism at its finest.' Katharine is a 14 foot, 2,300lb Great White . Data from the group Ocearch shows another 'ping' was recorded Tuesday morning from the shark dubbed Katherine. The 14-foot shark was tagged last August off Cape Cod, Massachusetts. However, reports on Sunday put Katherine about 140 miles west of Sarasota, Florida. Katherine is one of two great whites that research teams, led by Ocearch, have been following. Another, Betsy, was tracked on June 5 about 120 miles west of Sanibel Island, Fl. Researchers say in another week the westbound animal could be past the Mississippi River and eventually reach Texas. The tag sends a signal when the 2,300-pound shark comes to the surface. Robert Hueter of the Mote Marine Laboratory in Sarasota says tags can last up to five years. 'Every track is giving us new information and going contrary to all the assumptions that we were going on,' he told the Houston Chronicle. Katharine's Route- The shark was first spotted near Miami, passing close to Key west before heading to her current location . 'Having them in the Gulf is something we thought happened in the winter time.' It means she has now traveled almost 5,000 miles since being tagged just 10 months ago. Throughout her journey she has stayed close into the coast. Beach goers can track her path via the Ocearch website and match it up with their vacations to see if she swam by them. Katherine is the larger of the two, weighing in at 2,300 pounds at the time of her tagging. Katharine up close: researchers snapped this picture of the whale when they tagger her near Maine . At that time she was 14-feet, 2-inches long but scientists following her say it's almost certain she has grown since then. The largest ever recorded great white was 21 feet long. The second shark, Betsy, is also likely to be bigger now. Tagged one day before Katherine, she weighed 1,400 pounds and measured 12-feet, 7-inches. Katharine the great white shark even has her own Twitter profile . Earlier this year, a great white shark heading for British waters – named Lydia – became the first tagged great white shark to cross the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Scientists charting her progress have revealed that the 15ft shark might be swimming towards Europe to give birth to pups. She was just 800 miles (1,255km) off the coast of Cornwall and Ireland in the Atlantic Ocean and has now turned away from the UK.","14 foot Great White, sends a signal every time she surfaces .

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . Here's another reason to be thankful this holiday season - the cost of putting Thanksgiving dinner on the table is down slightly from last year. But don't bank on those savings for any big Black Friday splurges. The average Turkey Day dinner will cost $49.04, or just 44 cents less this year than it did in 2012. And while every penny counts, if you need to do any traveling to belly up to the big meal, increases in airline and train tickets mean that 44 cents won't get you very far. The good news is that after some steep . price hikes during the economic downturn about five years ago, food . prices have remained mostly stable this year. Poultry sum: Though the Farm Bureau found the price for a 16-pound turkey was down 47 cents on last year . It's a welcome change from 2011, when the cost of Thanksgiving dinner jumped $5.73, up from $43.47 in 2010, according to the annual informal survey of consumer grocery prices performed by the American Farm Bureau Federation. The group estimates the cost by averaging non-sale food prices around the country based on feeding 10 people a meal of turkey, bread stuffing, sweet potatoes, rolls with butter, peas, cranberries, carrots and celery, pumpkin pie with whipped cream, and coffee and milk. And yes, their estimates account for the need for those all-important leftovers. The credit for this year's slight drop in price goes to stable commodity and fuel prices, both strong drivers of the prices consumers pay at the store, says Ricky Volpe, a research economist with the USDA's Economic Research Service. He says overall grocery prices are down about one-tenth of a percent since January. One exception - poultry. Though the . Farm Bureau didn't detect a price increase in turkey since last year . (they actually found the price for a 16-pound bird down 47 cents), Volpe . says consumers shouldn't be surprised if that component of the meal . jumps as much as 5 percent over last year. Higher demand and feed prices . are to blame. Not so fun: The average domestic airfare is up 9.5 percent from last Thanksgiving to $313, according to the Airlines Reporting Corp . However, you might save a bit of cash on gas when you head to the grocer to get your turkey. At the moment, drivers are paying about 25 cents less per gallon than they were a year ago, with a national average of $3.19, according to travel tracker AAA. And while the group hasn't issued a prediction for gas prices the week of Thanksgiving, they say that in recent years prices generally have dropped in the weeks leading up to the holiday. Need another reason to drive? The average domestic airfare is up 9.5 percent from last Thanksgiving to $313, according to the Airlines Reporting Corp., which tracks tickets sold by online and by traditional travel agencies. Meanwhile, Amtrak prices in September (the most recent month for which data were available) were up more than 4 percent over a year ago. Consumers won't be able to do much about the cost of travel, but there's always plenty of ways to spend less - and a lot more - on food. The Farm Bureau estimate budgets $2.18 for a dozen brown-and-serve dinner rolls. But if you're willing break out a recipe and bake your own, a home cook could cut almost a dollar off that price. On the flip side, if you'd prefer to leave the cooking to others and purchase a ready-to-eat meal from a grocer, expect to pay a premium for the convenience, maybe $75 or more. Likewise, if your tastes lean to the organic or heirloom end of the food spectrum, you won't find turkey for $1.36 a pound as the Farm Bureau did. Budgeting two or three times that is a safer bet. And since it's impossible to escape holiday creep, we might as well break the bad news about your Christmas roast. Beef prices are at or near record highs this year, so you can expect to pay as much as 2.5 percent more than last year for that succulent rib roast you've been waiting all year for.","Research comes from a survey by the American Farm Bureau Federation .

"By . Mark Prigg . One of Facebook's first investors has bailed out of the firm and sold 20 million shares. PayPal billionaire Peter Thiel, one of Facebook's earliest investors and a member of its board, was among the insiders selling stock in the social network after a lockup expired last week, it has emerged. As one of Facebook's initial investors, he invested $500,000 in the company in 2004. Peter Thiel, one of Facebook's first investors. Today it was revealed he has sold over 20 million of his shares in the firm as its stock price plunges. A regulatory filing said that Thiel, a former CEO at PayPal sold about 20 million shares of Facebook through affiliates such as his Founders Fund and other firms last week. Thiel invests in dozens of startups through Founders Fund, and also recently backed a firm planning to grow steaks in the lab. The shares were sold on Thursday and Friday for between $19.27 and $20.69, for a total of $396 million. He also sold 16.8 million shares in the company's May initial public offering, making $640m. It is now believed he has sold most of his stock in Facebook. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has so far been unable to sell stock in the firm. It is estimated its plunging stock price has so far cost him $10bn . Thiel is expected to use the cash to fund a new investment firm set up earlier this year. With partner Ajay Royan, his latest firm, called Mithril, will invest in new firms that have already received some venture capital but need more to expand. The firm will have an office in San Francisco. Thiel also has his own foundation, and awards cash to promising youngsters who decide not to attend university. Another 1.66 billion locked-up Facebook shares will be freed up for sale over the next nine months, likely to place more pressure on the stock. One of the biggest tests will come in November when the next batch of 1.2 billion shares will be eligible for sale. As Facebook’s share price continues to plummet, critics have accused Mark Zuckerberg of being ‘in over his hoodie’ and called for him to step down as CEO. Corporate experts have suggested that the 28-year-old founder should stick to what he does best as a technological innovator and hand the CEO reins over to a more experienced executive. And any doubts about Zuckerberg were further compounded on Thursday as the company’s stock price plunged to an all-time low dropping to $19.87 – almost half its IPO price. 'There is a growing sense that Mark Zuckerberg, talented though he may be, is in over his hoodie as CEO of a multibillion-dollar public company,' Sam Hamadeh, head of research firm PrivCo, told the Los Angeles Times.","Peter Thiel invested $500,000 in Facebook in 2004 .

According to Vrooman, the female who jumped the officer was immediately arrested, and the four additional suspects were taken in after trying to spring her from police custody. The scuffle started around 4.00 p.m. when a woman protester pushed another woman and the cop tried to separate them. The angry crowd had gathered to protest the busing in of undocumented immigrants caught on the Texas-Mexico border because facilities in that region are already overflowing. 'Send them back! Send the back!' the special-meeting crowd chanted, shouting down Chief Border Patrol Agent Paul Beeson after he took responsibility for transferring the Central American children and families to Murrieta from Texas, where the numbers are too much for facilities to handle. On Tuesday, the buses were rerouted an hour south to San Diego after they were met with flag-waving protesters in Murrieta.

'If we want to keep attracting the best and the brightest from beyond our shores, we’re going to have fix our immigration system, which is broken, and pass common-sense immigration reform,' Obama said at the ceremony today, according to The Washington Times. The Wednesday night crowd gathered at a high school auditorium that seats 750 in the desert city of 100,000 people, groaned when Beeson said four of the immigrants had to be hospitalized, two with scabies and two with fevers. And Beeson conceded that he did not know where Tuesday's immigrants nor several more waves slated to arrive from Texas in coming days will end up. 'We will make decisions when they arrive where it makes the most sense to put them,' he said. The federal government is working to deal with a flood of Central American children and families fleeing to the United States. More than 52,000 unaccompanied children have been detained after crossing the Texas-Mexico border since October in what President Barack Obama has called a humanitarian crisis. Many are under the impression that they will receive leniency from U.S. authorities. Murrieta Mayor Alan Long, who urged locals to oppose the immigrant transfer plan before it began, said the city will track any spending it does over the issue and send a ""big fat bill"" to Washington.

"By . Ryan Gorman . Texas officials are renewing demands the federal government take further steps to secure the border as waves of illegal immigrants are turning military bases into makeshift settlements. House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul (R-TX) said ‘our military bases are turning into refugee camps. I never thought I'd see this in the United States of America’ during an appearance Thursday at the border near McAllen. Texas Governor Rick Perry, also a Republican, demanded ‘Secure this border, Mr. President’ in a separate speech. Now living on a military base: A temporary shelter for unaccompanied minors who have entered the country illegally is seen at Lackland Air Force Base, Monday, June 23, 2014, in San Antonio, Texas . McCaul also claimed the President’s series of executive actions have made it easier for minors to stay in the country and put them at even greater risk for harm. ‘These children are often subjected to beatings, starvation, sexual assault and are at risk of being trafficked,’ said McCaul, according to Fox News. ‘Allowing them to remain here will only encourage the next group of individuals to undertake this very dangerous,’ Perry added. Both men’s remarks came as many border towns have seen an influx of people illegally crossing the U.S. – Mexico border only to end up in temporary prisons and makeshift settlements before they are processed and either deported or sent elsewhere. A significant number of these immigrants are now unaccompanied minors who end up in lockups like the widely-publicized one at a former bus station in McAllen, or are found dead in the desert – like a young girl was this week. Too young for the journey: A young girl traveling with Central American migrants plays on the freight train they had been riding Friday, after it suffered a minor derailment in a remote wooded area outside Reforma de Pineda, Chiapas state, Mexico . Those that do survive the perilous journey are then taken to a Houston airport and flown around the country to various shelters, according to Buzzfeed. The hub, in a staging area away from the public at the Bush Intercontinental Airport… is intended to reduce the amount of time it takes to transfer custody of the minors to the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which runs the shelters, the site reported. Those children, mainly from destitute Central American countries, started being taken to military bases across the country last month, according to Buzzfeed. Some of those bases include Fort Sill, in Oklahoma, and Lackland Air Force Base, in texas, according to Fox News. Many top government officials, including House Minority leader Nancy Pelosi (D- CA), have visited the porous border carved by the Rio Grande River. Not just in Texas: The building set aside to house between 600 and 1,200 unaccompanied children, mostly from Central America at Fort Sill, Oklahoma . President Obama earlier this week sought $2billion in emergency aid to help open more detention centers across the country to provide ‘basic humanitarian needs,’ according to White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest. ‘That's why the president has asked for additional resources from Congress to open up detention facilities across the country, where these individuals can be housed in humane conditions’ Governor Perry still blasted the feds after announcing a $1.3 million-per-week program to ferry state agents to the border. Those agents are expected to bolster border patrol efforts, said Perry, according to Fox. The Governor also called for Washington to pay back the $500million Texas has spent on border security the past 10 years, Fox reported. ‘We have been fulfilling a federal responsibility,’ said Perry, whose own bid to run for president during the 2012 election fizzled out before the Republican convention. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-VA) also called for Obama to take a tougher stance on minors crossing the border without their parents ‘who are already in the United States illegally,’ he told Fox. He claimed the parents ‘had a role in smuggling the minors into the United States.’ More than 52,000 unaccompanied minors have been snagged by the border patrol since October, and the number is steadily rising.","More than 52,000 unaccompanied children have been snagged by the border patrol since October .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . A space cannon that will blast a hole into an asteroid to find out the origins of the universe has been tested by Japanese scientists. The device will be used to gather data about the composition of the asteroid, named 1999JU3, and help investigate how water and life were created on Earth. The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) said the successful test has paved the way for a launch of the space cannon as early as next year. Scroll down for video . The space cannon will be flown on board the Hayabusa-2 vehicle (pictured) towards the asteroid, which orbits between Earth and Mars. he successful test has paved the way for a launch of the cannon next year . The space cannon will be flown on board the Hayabusa-2 vehicle towards the asteroid, which orbits between Earth and Mars. Once it arrives at the asteroid in 2018, Hayabusa 2 will observe the entire surface of the asteroid using a variety of remote-sensing instruments. The spacecraft will then release a small lander called Mascot and a rover named Minerva 2 on the asteroid's surface to explore the surface in more detail. Once it arrives at the asteroid in 2018, Hayabusa 2 will observe the entire surface of the asteroid using a variety of remote-sensing instruments . Hayabusa means falcon in Japanese. Hayabusa 2 is a successor to JAXA's earlier asteroid explorer Hayabusa, which returned the first asteroid samples to Earth in June 2010. Hayabusa 2 is the third mission to land on an asteroid. Nasa's NEAR-Shoemaker mission was the first mission to touchdown on an asteroid.Hayabusa 2 is the second asteroid sample-return mission. The space cannon will, following this initial analysis, detach itself and remotely fire a 4lb metal projectile into the surface of the 1999JU3 asteroid. A probe will then land and collect debris samples from the impact to bring back to Earth. Scientists are intrigued by asteroid 1999JU3 as it is thought to have been altered very little since the formation of the solar system. Japanese researchers hope to find water and organic material from the early solar system in the material collected. The space cannon will detach and remotely fire a 4lb metal projectile into the surface of the miniature planet . This data could shed light on how planets form and life arises. The asteroid is currently scheduled to be blasted in 2018 and the probe will make its back to Earth by the end of the decade.

"By . Mail On Sunday Reporter . Veteran weather presenter  Sian Lloyd has added her voice to the fierce debate about assisted dying – and says that if she was told she had a degenerative condition like her elderly mother, she would want to be helped  to end her own life. Her mother Barbara, 81, was diagnosed with Parkinson’s five years ago. The disease affects the brain and the nervous system, causing a slow decline into disability. ‘I believe in quality of life rather than quantity, and if I was severely ill and in pain, I wouldn’t  want to be a burden on my husband,’ says Sian. Veteran weather presenter Sian Lloyd says that if she was told she had a degenerative condition she would want to be helped to end her own life . ‘I hope I would have the courage to go somewhere like Dignitas. I would rather there were places like that in this country.’ Last week TV presenters Richard Madeley, 58, and his wife Judy Finnegan, 65, revealed in an interview that they had a pact not to let the other suffer a long, undignified death. And former Blind Date host Cilla Black claimed she felt she might consider ending her own life having seen her mother battle a long-term illness. Sian, 55, who is married to motor racing entrepreneur Jonathan Ashman, says: ‘My dad is a fit 82-year-old and is a very good cook, and he copes remarkably well with looking after  my mum, but it’s difficult to see her gripped by this awful illness. ‘It has been very brave  of Richard and Judy to come out and say what they did, and I think that Jonathan and I would do the same.’ Sian adds: ‘Of course  I worry that I could get Parkinson’s even though there is no genetic link.’ Heroic work: Comic book Medikidz explains what can go wrong in the human body . A new comic book for children has been launched to help them understand the effects of a stroke. The story  follows the real-life experiences of  12-year-old Ethan King when his grandfather Ken Rudge suffers a stroke. Five superheroes explain what is happening to his body and brain. There are about 152,000 incidents of stroke each year in the UK – equivalent to one every five minutes. Survivors can be left with paralysis, fatigue and emotional difficulties. Written by leading doctors, Medikidz Explain Stroke outlines the after effects to a child. The comic is supported by the Stroke Association. ‘Until now, nothing has been available that is tailored specifically for children,’ says Peter Langhorne, president of the British Association of Stroke Physicians. Learning a second language helps delay dementia, researchers suggest. A study by a team at Harvard University of 648 people from India, all of whom had varying degrees of dementia, found that those who spoke at least two languages  developed the condition on average four years later than those who spoke just one. Researchers say that language-learning strengthens the area of the brain associated with attention. However, the benefit is not increased by learning a third language – the study found that speaking more than two made no difference to the onset of dementia. Another week, another new application for Botox. Doctors  are now using the toxin – more famous as an anti-wrinkle treatment – to repair damage to vocal cords. It has been found to help treat lesions on them, known as vocal fold granulomas. These occur as a result of irritation and inflammation caused by chronic acid reflux, or from too much talking, singing or shouting. Previous treatments included bringing reflux under control, resting the voice and surgery,  but results were mixed. Now doctors are injecting Botox into  the muscles around the vocal cords to weaken them, so reducing the force with which the folds come together. This allows the granulomas to heal. Nearly 90 per cent of lesions cleared up after three months, compared with 25 per cent treated with other therapies. Gardening isn’t just good exercise for pensioners – people in  their 20s can also reap the health benefits. A study by researchers at Konkuk University and Hongik University in South Korea showed that performing moderate to high-intensity work in the garden not only lowered their cholesterol and blood pressure but  also enhanced their psychological wellbeing. Study participants, who were all in their 20s, each performed ten gardening tasks twice a week, such  as planting, watering, harvesting, raking  and weeding.","Veteran weather presenter is positive to assisted suicide .

"By . Ryan Gorman . A retail executive is accused in a lawsuit of pilfering millions from his own company after his brother’s death in 2001. Mitchell Modell, CEO of Modell’s Sporting Goods, is being sued by brother Michael Modell’s widow Abby Modell for not equally sharing in the company’s profits per the terms of his estate, and instead splurging on extravagances like a $116,000 dinner Morton's Steakhouse in Chicago. The fourth-generation company head claims in a legal filing that he and his late brother made a handshake agreement before his death from Hodgkin’s Disease that gave him three times the profits of the family he left behind, according to the New York Post. Greedy: Abby Modell (right) claims CEO Michell Modell (left) has taken millions from her family . Mitchell Modell, 59, was put in charge of his brother’s estate after his passing, and has used his position to pad his pockets while hanging Abby Modell and her children out to dry, claims the suit. ‘Mitchell’s complete want of understanding of his duties as a fiduciary is best summed up using his own words: ‘Mitchell Modell is Modell’s Sporting Goods, and Modell’s Sporting Goods is Mitchell Modell,’ says the scathing suit, according to the Post. The brothers each controlled half of the family business started in 1889 before Micahel Modell’s death, according to Abby Modell. His passing saw Mitchell Modell made CEO of the firm – his first order of business was to raise his salary from $1.8million to $6.275million, court papers showed. Mitchell Modell also spent millions in company money on himself and his family, including $38,655 for a Canadian fishing trip, $103,000 for a Barbados vacation, $9,000 in massages at the Friar’s Club and $180,000 for a trophy that was once owned by Yankee catcher Thurman Munson. The charges on his corporate card were egregious enough that the IRS twice-audited Mitchel Modell, in 2006 and 2007, over entertainment, meals and travel expenses. ""Gotta go to Mo's"": The chain's Herald Square location on Broadway in Manhattan . The tax man found $1.5million of the ‘expenses’ to not be business related, but it is not cleatr exactly which charges were wiped from the business ledger. Mitchell Modell is also battling a lawsuit from rival Dick’s Sporting Goods in which the retail chain claims he impersonated a company executive to ‘gain access to a Princeton store’s private operations.’ Abby Modell’s lawyer cites this suit as further proof of his ‘unsuitability to run the family business,’ the Post reported. The northeast-centric chain has more than 150 stores from Virginia to New Hampshire, with the bulk of them in the New York, New Jersey, Connecticut tri-state area.","Michael Modell widow Abby Modell claims her brother-in-law has spent millions of her money after her husband died in 2001 .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A retired black cop has told of how he managed to infiltrate a branch of the Klu Klux Klan in Colorado in the 1970s, becoming so respected he was voted into a leadership position, with other members believing he was a white supremacist. Ron Stallworth was an investigator for the Colorado Springs Police Department in 1979 when he answered a newspaper ad placed by a new KKK group, who were looking for local members. Writing about the experience in a new book, Black Klansman, Stallworth explains how the hate group not only made him a member, but voted to make him the chapter's leader after only one year. 'So they took a vote, they took a unanimous vote and they wanted Ron Stallworth to become the leader of the Ku Klux Klan chapter because he was quote loyal and a dedicated Klansman,"" Stallowrth told Salt Lake City's ABC 4. Scroll down for video . Undercover agent: Ron Stallworth managed to become a member of the Ku Klux Klan in 1979 while working as an undercover investigator, conducting most of his work on the phone and then sending in a 'white cop' when he needed . The Klan trusted Stallworth with their plans to commit crimes, and threaten African Americans by burning crosses, something he put a stop to three times during his investigation. Official: This membership card was signed by  then-Grand Wizard of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, David Duke . Ron Stallworth was an investigator for the Colorado Springs Police Department in 1979 when he infiltrated the KKK . Stallworth said the unlikely undercover mission first started when he spoke to a recruiter over the phone and convinced the man he was white. Posing as an angry racist, Stallworth explained he felt victimized by minorities and sprinkled his speech with racial slurs. When it came time to meet face-to-face, he sent a 'white cop' in his place. 'They never once picked up on the fact that they were talking to two distinct voices,' Stallworth said. Stallworth said he spent about a year gaining the trust of the local hate group's leaders, who told him of planned cross burnings and other intimidation activities. Stallworth said he foiled at least three cross burnings during his time with the organization by being able to tip off police as to where and when they were occurring.

Stallworth had many phone conversations with then-KKK Grand Wizard David Duke, whose signature was on Stallworth's official KKK code of conduct card. Once, Duke boasted about how his klan would never be infiltrated by a black man under his watch, Stallworth told NBC News in 2006. 'And I asked him why. He said, ''I can always tell when I'm talking to a black man because they pronounce words and letters a certain way'',' Stallworth told NBC. 'And he said, ''I can tell that you're a pure-blooded white man, because you don't pronounce your words in that manner''.'

The Lake County Sheriff's Office says it has taken three young men into custody in connection with the apparent murder of Gary police Officer Jeffrey Brady Westerfield, one of those men has been referred to by officers as 'a person of interest.' Westerfield's body was found slumped in the driver's seat of his patrol car about 5:45 a.m. Sunday by a person driving near the intersection of Gary's 26th and Van Buren streets. The motorist noticed that the patrol car's lights were on as it sat parked on the side of the road. Scroll down for video . Tragic: Gary Officer Jeffrey Westerfield, a father of four, was found fatally shot in his patrol car Sunday morning . Response: Authorities say Westerfield had responded to a call earlier in the morning that could be related to his death . Engaged: Westerfield and his fiancee, Denise Cather (pictured right), planned to get married in August . Police say the officer had responded to a call in the area, but wouldn't say what that call was related to. 'At this time we are not in a position to elaborate on that,' Gary Mayor Karen Freeman Wilson tells ABC 7. However, Gary Police Chief Wade Ingram said at a morning news conference that Westerfield's death might be related to a call the officer answered earlier that morning. 'We don't think it was a traffic stop,' the chief said. 'It may have . stemmed from something earlier... We do have several leads.' Just hours later, at about 9 a.m., tactical teams as wells as state, local and federal law enforcement officials surrounded a house just a block-and-a-half from the intersection where Westerfield's body was found. The entire area was shut down for nearly six hours, according to ABC 7. At 3 p.m., the tactical teams moved on the house alongside an armored vehicle. SWAT: Members of the the tactical team raided a nearby house with a tank hours after the officer's body was found . When authorities emerged from the house, they had taken three of its occupants into custody. One of those arrested may have had a gunshot wound, but authorities say they were met with no resistance when they took the three men into custody. 'They're being taken into custody for interrogation,' said Lake County Sheriff John Buncich. 'More for you in a little bit.' Westerfield was a beloved member of the community. He had served in the military during Operation Desert Storm and had three daughters. He had been a police officer for 19 years. Westerfield's fiancee, Denise Cather, wants justice for the man she planned to marry less than two months from the day his body was discovered. 'I want the man or the kids or whoever it is…I want them caught,' Cather told WGN. 'I want them to look at me in the eye and tell me why they killed my fiance.' Suspects: Police arrested three men found in this house, one of whom police have described as a person of interest . Heartbroken: Cather says she and Westerfield had planned to go out to dinner for his birthday and then ride their motorcycles to a lake . The heartbroken fiancee went on to talk about Westerfield's big heart. 'My oldest daughter, he took her as his own, too. He took my . grandchildren as his own. He was a fantastic man,' Cather said. 'He . was wonderful he had a heart of gold. He’d help anybody -- . all they had to do was call.' The couple had known each other for 20 years and had been engaged for two. They planned to get married on August 24. 'We were in the middle of moving; we just bought a house,' Cather said. She says they had planned to go out to dinner for his birthday and then ride their motorcycles to the lake. 'We’d . go out there, have ice cream and look at the water,' she said. Cather says she was informed of her fiance's death shortly after she got out of bed. She also says she never liked his job. 'Wake up, look out your window, and see six squad cars outside your . house? You pretty much know what happened,' Cather said. 'That’s a way . to wake up right? 'This is senseless...I just lost my best friend,' she continued. Heart of gold:  Cather says Westerfield had a kind heart and would do anything for anyone . More details about the officer's death are expected to be revealed Monday. This is the first time in six years that a law enforcement official had been killed in the line of duty in Gary, a once-booming steel town that is part of the Chicago metropolitan area. As industry began to move out of Gary, so did much of its population - the city's population has dropped 55-percent since its peak of about 178,000 people in 1960. The town best known as the home of Michael Jackson and his musical family has been ravaged by crime in recent years, as industry continues to abandon the city. According to a 2013 article by NWITimes.com, as of October 10, of that year, the city's homicide rate was 53 per capita (the rate per 100,000 residents). That equals one homicide for every 1,900 residents. To put that into perspective, the website compares that to Hammond, Indiana, which has roughly the same size population as Gary. Hammond had a homicide rate of eight per capita.","Gary, Indiana, police Officer Jeffrey Westerfield was found fatally shot in his patrol car early Sunday morning .

"By . Darren Boyle . Food offerings left in a royal tomb in the ancient city of Ur at least 4,500 years ago have been discovered on top of a university cupboard. Researchers at the University of Bristol found the large wooden box during a clear out in the Department of Archaeology and Anthropology. The box was filled with pottery, seeds and animals bones and contained words such as 'predynastic', 'sargonid' and 'Royal Tombs' written on index cards. Researchers found the 4,500 year old food offerings while searching a box, pictured, which had been left on top of a cupboard in the University of Bristol . It is believed that the offerings were recovered from an excavation supported by the British Museum at the site of the ancient city of Ur - in modern day Iraq - during the 1920s or 1930s . The ancient city of Ur in Mesopotamia is now in the south of modern day Iraq . Further investigation revealed that these were the remains of food offerings from a royal tomb at least 4,500 years old. It is believed the remains were collected during famous excavations by Sir Leonard Wolley in the site of Ur in southern Iraq during the 1920s and 1930s. Experts say the discovery of the box is particularly exciting, as environmental finds were rarely collected in this early period of archaeological fieldwork. Dr Tamar Hodos, senior lecturer in Archaeology at the University of Bristol said it was unclear how the box had been left on top of the cupboard. 'The remaining mystery is how this material came to be at Bristol in the first place,' Dr Hodos said. 'The environmental remains themselves were published in 1978 in Journal of Archaeological Science. 'The authors of that study were based at the Institute of Archaeology, London, and at the University of Southampton, and none of them had any known connection to the University of Bristol that might explain how the material came to reside here. 'If anyone can shed light on this mystery, we would love to hear from them.' The city of Ur, pictured, is believed to have been the birthplace of Abraham and is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site . The original excavation was jointly sponsored by the British Museum and the University of Pennsylvania Museum, with finds divided between London, Philadelphia and Baghdad. After the box was discovered, Dr Hodos contacted experts from the British Museum's Near Eastern Archaeology department about where the material should be housed. The remains will now join the rest of the British Museum's collection from Ur, which is part of a digitisation programme sponsored by the Leon Levy Foundation and undertaken with the University of Pennsylvania Museum. Dr Hodos added that the box was found while researchers were emptying current laboratory spaces in preparation for the installation of a new radiocarbon dating facility, which will open next year.

"By . Mail On Sunday Reporter . Victoria Beckham and elite US Navy Seals have one thing in common – they both love working out on Woodway treadmills. The machines, which can cost up to £25,000, have a cushioned belt to absorb the impact from running, making them ideal for people who are flat-footed (Victoria suffers bunions, which can be a result of flat feet. Since turning 40, the fashion designer has increased her fitness regime and now takes classes at Barry’s Bootcamp gym in London, where she discovered the Woodway brand. But never one to do things by half, Victoria bought treadmills for her  home and her office too. Heels on: Victoria Beckham has invested in a Woodway treadmill with a customised rubber belt for her office so that she can wear her stilettos while she works out . Every morning, she runs for 30 minutes in the gym as fast as possible. Later in the day she uses a Woodway Desk-Mill to walk slowly while checking emails. This treadmill has a customised rubber belt so  that Victoria can wear her stilettos while she works out. ‘Victoria is a better runner than you’d expect,’ says a bootcamper. ‘She goes at faster speeds than a lot of the class and she’s not afraid to sweat.’ Seedy business: A glass of pomegranate juice may help boost male fertility . Drinking pomegranate juice may help  boost male fertility. Researchers have discovered that the fruit improves both  sperm quality and quantity, and now two clinical trials are under way to investigate  the links further. Previously, a study by a team from  Queen Margaret University in Edinburgh  found that drinking pomegranate juice  daily for two weeks increased testosterone levels in the saliva of both men and  women by an average of  24 per cent. And a pilot study detailed in the International Journal of Impotence Research showed that the juice may have benefits for men with erectile dysfunction and impotence. Now the new trials  are taking place at the University of California  and Israel’s Hillel Yaffe  Medical Center. It is not clear how pomegranate juice boosts sperm. One theory is that the high concentration of polyunsaturated fats in sperm cells, which are involved in growth and development, makes them vulnerable to damage from compounds called free radicals. These can damage cells and DNA, laying the foundations for disease and other problems. Lie-ins may be a pleasant way to lower blood pressure, and could help with weight loss too. An extra 35 minutes in bed may be enough for significant improvements in both, and researchers say there’s evidence that sleep could overcome high blood pressure. Getting sufficient sleep may help people stick to diets as sleep deprivation is associated with hunger. Tackling depression not only helps lift your mood, it can also protect your heart, according to a new study. Norwegian researchers examined 63,000 cases of whom 1,500 suffered from heart failure. Those with moderate depression were five per cent more at risk and those with severe depression were 40 per cent more at risk of heart failure. The authors believe the release of stress hormones during depression causes inflammation of the heart and atherosclerosis (thickening of the artery walls), on top of the fact that people with depression are more likely to lead an unhealthy lifestyle. ‘Depressive symptoms increase the chance of developing heart failure and the more severe the symptoms are, the greater the risk,’ says lead author Lise Tuset Gustad. Her findings were presented at a EuroHeartCare conference.","Victoria Beckham is a fan of the £25,000 Woodway treadmills .

The woman wasn't home, so the 19-year-old allegedly forced his way into the house and lay in ambush, waiting for her to return. When . Poole came home, she opened the Apple video chat program FaceTime on . her phone and began talking to her husband, who was stationed in . southwest Asia. A short time later, police say Moss . came out of hiding and surprised Rachel Poole from behind, repeatedly . stabbing her with a foldout stainless steel knife and beating her. According . to the affidavit, the victim instantly recognized Moss as her husband's . debtor and yelled out his name several times so Justin Poole could hear . it over the phone. Following the attack, police say Moss fled and called a co-worker to pick him up and drive him to Fort Bliss. Meanwhile, Justin Poole called Moss' colleagues to alert them of the suspect’s imminent return to the military base. The 19-year-old's co-workers intercepted him and found the knife in the car where he was riding. Fort Bliss spokesman Joe Buccino said that Army Pvt Poole has been deployed in southwest Asia for the past nine months, HLN-TV reported.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The cause of death of a man who collapsed in a San Diego Border Patrol holding cell on Christmas Eve after he was taken into custody for allegedly carrying three pounds of marijuana, is being investigated by the County Medical Examiner's office. U.S. citizen Steven Keith, 58, was stopped at a checkpoint on Interstate 8, near the Mexican border. He was arrested and taken to a holding cell at the Campo Border Patrol station after authorities said they found marijuana, drug paraphernalia and traces of methamphetamine in his car. Steven Keith even had moved to Thailand years ago but was visiting family in San Diego for the holidays when he died . Several hours after sitting in a holding cell, officials said Keith became ‘incoherent and unresponsive.’ Border Patrol emergency medical technicians performed CPR on Keith while waiting on paramedics to arrive. Paramedics took over life-saving efforts but were unable to revive Keith, officials said. Keith's sister Janet, who lives in Texas, said Steven had moved to Thailand years ago but was visiting family in San Diego for the holidays. Janet said the medical examiner told her an autopsy was done, but they couldn't release the cause of death for 90 days while toxicology tests are being completed, reports ABC10. Keith, pictured here in an old family photo, collapsed in a San Diego Border Patrol holding cell on Christmas Eve after he was taken into custody for allegedly carrying three pounds of marijuana . Janet, a former police officer, said her brother was in good health. He had no partner or children. ‘I am a former police officer myself and I definitely want some answers and I’m going to get them,’ she told UT San Diego. ‘Customs and Border Protection's San Diego Sector Border Patrol is cooperating fully with these investigators to ensure a neutral third party reviews all evidence and information surrounding this unfortunate death,’ said a statement released by the Border Patrol. The Department of Homeland Security Office of Investigator General is also investigating the incident. Alliance San Diego, a human rights organization, is monitoring the incident as well. ‘Border Patrol is under a whole lot of pressure to make sure their agents are properly trained and to make sure when cases like this happen information is properly given to the family,' said Christian Ramirez with Alliance San Diego.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A man serving 40 years for raping his eight-year-old daughter has lost his bid to be released from prison, even though the alleged victim has insisted for the past 15 years that the crime never happened, and that she only said it had because her drug-addicted mother threatened to beat her. Navy veteran David Kelly, now 54, was found guilty of raping, sodomizing and sexually abusing his daughter Chaneya in their Newburgh, New York home in 1998. He remains at Green Haven Correctional Facility and is only eligible for parole in 2018. His daughter, who is now 25, says the attack never happened - and that she lied because her drug-addict mother forced to beat her unless she said her father abused her. Chaneya, who has battled the courts to release her father ever since recanting her accusations the following year, penned a series of apologetic letters to him. Scroll Down for Video . 'Mistake': Chaneya Kelly, who is now 25, said she falsely accused her Navy veteran father of raping her as a nine-year-old because her mother threatened to beat her if she didn't . But now it appears her father has lost his review and after a thorough investigation, the CFEAJ has determined that Kelly was not wrongfully convicted. 'I’m absolutely devastated,' said alleged victim Chaneya Kelly, who first told her story to NBC News in August. 'My father didn’t rape me, and I don’t know why they just won’t believe me.' She vowed to continue fighting on behalf of her father, and has written a letter to New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo saying she was 'completely insulted' by the re-investigation. 'Every time I told them that my father did not commit any of the malicious crimes he was convicted of,” she wrote in the letter, “they treated me as if I was lying.' She explained the reason for telling the lies that ultimately put her father behind bars. 'I didn’t want to get beat so I made . up a lie that I'd take back anyday. I regret everything I said,' she . said in one letter from 2002, which has been seen by the New York Post. 'It's just that I didn't want to get beaten by a ""drunken"" mother.' She added that she should be the one serving a lengthy sentence, rather than her father. 'I feel guilty when I talk about it. I feel that I should be in prison instead of you,' she wrote. In another letter from October 2006, which is signed 'Daddy's Big Girl', Chaneya said she wished she 'could change the past'. The letters were used as part of the appeals process but the verdict remains the same. The New York State District Attorney reinvestigation included extensive interviews with nearly everyone involved in the original prosecution. 'Every conceivable effort has been undertaken to find the unvarnished truth regardless of how or whom it impacts,' the report states. Daryl Kelly’s attorney, Peter Cross, disagrees. 'Anyone who looks at the facts of this case will see that Daryl is obviously innocent,' said Cross. 'Based on information I’ve gathered since this report was written, it is provably biased.' One of the individuals interviewed by the state committee sent Phillips a letter saying the report contains 'misleading and inaccurate quotes,' and an expert he hired sent Phillips a letter calling the committee’s rejection of Chaneya’s recantation 'unscientific.' Battle: David Kelly, pictured in prison, tired to use apologetic letters written by his daughter to secure his release but failed in his attempt . The district attorney association’s report lists various reasons to support its conclusion that Daryl Kelly is guilty: . - A judge evaluated the same evidence 15 years ago and has already decided the recantation wasn’t credible. - In a recorded prison phone call, prosecutors found it disturbing that Kelly once greeted Chaneya by saying, “Hey, sexy."" - Kelly lied about being awarded a purple heart when he was in the Navy, showing his true character. - Experts caution to be wary of recantation, especially in a case like this. 'The relationship between the defendant and his recanting accuser — father and daughter — is renowned at law and in social science as one most likely to breed a false recantation,' said the report. - Most of all, the report claims that despite Chaneya’s insistence that she wasn’t raped, her story is not credible, saying she 'can neither explain why she falsely advanced such a horrible allegation, nor why she adhered to it for so long and repeated it to so many different people.' James Winslow, Kelly’s original trial attorney in 1999, is quoted extensively in the DAASNY report, suggesting that Kelly might be guilty and that the case against him was strong. Family: Chaneya, pictured as a child, accused him of rape after her mother threatened to beat her if she did not . Speaking to NBC News, Chaneya said: 'I'm 25-years-old and I made this mistake when I was nine-years-old - but it's never too late to try and right your wrong.' Her father was barred from any contact with his children after being convicted by a jury of multiple counts of rape and serious sexual assault. Kelly, who has always maintained his innocence, had never been convicted of a felony before. 'All I think is, one day the truth will set me free. All I have to do is hold on,' Kelly told NBC News. In October 1997, while Kelly was living with his wife Charade and their five children in Newburgh, he says he was attempting to rid himself of a drug habit in order to take better care of his family. But he said his wife's own drug habit had spiraled to the point where she turned to prostitution in order to feed her addiction. Denial: His conviction remained even though she recanted her statement on video the following year (pictured) after her grandmother, right, took her to authorities. A judge said the recantation seemed forced . Chaneya, the Kellys' eldest child, says that one morning before school her mother asked her whether her father had ever 'touched' her. 'I was like, ""What do you mean, did he touch me?"" And she was like, ""Did he touch you in your no-no spot?"" And I would repeatedly say no,' the now 25-year-old said. According to Ms Kelly her mother threatened to beat her if she did not 'tell me the answer that I want to hear'. She said she told her mother her father had molested her to avoid being beaten, even though it wasn't true. Kelly was taken in for questioning on . October 29 1997. There was no definitive forensic evidence to prove . Chaneya had been raped, but the little girl and her mother's story - . together with some suspect answers Kelly provided during questioning - . were enough for officers to charge the father of five. He . refused a plea deal that would have made him eligible for parole in six . years, and within a year was sentenced to up to 40 years following a . trial by jury. Old life: Her mother Charade (pictured) said she was in the grip of drugs when she made the claims . His daughter was sent to live with her grandmother, a Pentecostal minister, and six months later Chaneya told her grandmother her father had never raped her. Pat Thomas took her granddaughter to Kelly's attorney who videotaped the child's recantation. Her mother, Charade, also submitted a sworn affidavit to the court which said she threatened to beat her daughter until she said her father raped her. A judge refused to vacate Kelly's conviction, deciding the recantation appeared forced. Kelly, who remains in jail to this day, began studying law and has filed multiple appeals. His daughter visited him in prison when she persuaded the courts to allow her to have contact with him at the age of 15. 'The first thing my dad did was that he . hugged me and he told me that he loved me and... that he doesn’t blame . me for anything,' she said. Wrongful conviction? Chaneya's father Daryl Kelly as spent almost 16 years in jail for molesting her - a crime his daughter now says never occurred . Appeals: Chaneya persuaded the courts to allow her to have contact with her father again when she was 15-years-old . Dr. Roy Lubit, who interviewed Chaneya, found her for the appeal 'highly credible' and sent his report to DA Phillips. Lubit said that he believed Chaneya’s recantation, say there was 'no corroborative evidence of the alleged abuse.' He cited the lack of psychological trauma, the consistency of her recantation over time, and the lack of grooming of the alleged victim by the perpetrator. '“To a reasonable degree of medical certainty CK’s recantation of her allegation her father sexually abused her when she was 8 years of age is not only credible but true,' wrote Lubit.  'The basic scenario leaves more than reasonable doubt that the child was sexually abused by her father. Chaneya's mother has said she is now drug-free and confirms her daughter's story, blaming a drug binge for her threats. Frank Phillips, the Orange County District Attorney and chief prosecutor when Daryl Kelly stood trial, has emphasized that Kelly was found guilty by a jury. He said in an interview it was 'not unique' for the victim of a sexual crime to want to protect the abuser by withdrawing their accusation. His office and the detective behind the original police investigation in Newburgh both declined to comment.

'Secretary Clinton supports the President’s effort to enlist the Congress in pursuing a strong and targeted response to the Assad regime’s horrific use of chemical weapons,' a Clinton aide told Politico. Eric Cantor, the number 2 House Republican, echoed Boehner hours earlier.

With support from the UK evaporating . and France saying it will wait to act until the U.S. determines Syria's . fate, the Obama administration is no longer calling for Bashar . al-Assad's ousting - in public at least. ‘I . think Assad must go – and I believe he will go,’ Obama said on March 20 . during a joint press conference in Jerusalem with Israeli Prime . Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. But in recent days his administration has been far less enthusiastic about throwing Assad out of Damascus. Speaking . in the White House Rose Garden on Saturday, Obama said only that he was . ‘confident we can hold the Assad regime accountable for their use of . chemical weapons, deter this kind of behavior, and degrade their . capacity to carry it out.’ The strength of those military . strikes, and the length of any resulting armed conflict, is on clearly . Obama’s mind as he battles to convince a skeptical House of Congress and . public who have little appetite for another drawn out conflict. ‘The . key point that I want to emphasize to the American people,’ the . president said Tuesday, is that ‘the military plan that has been . developed by the joint chiefs and that I believe is appropriate is . proportional.  It is limited.  It does not involve boots on the ground. This is not Iraq and this is not Afghanistan.’ Ready to go: An F/A-18F Super Hornet prepares to launch from the flight deck of the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz in the Red Sea today. The Nimitz was due to leave the region but has been ordered to stay . Limited? The president has said that any military action in Syria will be 'limited' and not 'involve boots on the ground' Gen. Jack Keane, a former Army Vice Chief of Staff, indicated Tuesday that Obama’s ambitions may be broader. Speaking . after talks with senators including Republican John McCain of Arizona, . who emerged Monday in support of Obama’s plan after a personal White . House briefing, Keane told BBC Radio 4’s Today program that ‘the . president has decided to deter the use of chemical weapons but also to . degrade military capacity of the Assad regime. ‘At . the same time he has upgraded the capacity of the opposing forces,’ he . added. ‘And it’s the opposing forces that hopefully would be able . eventually to topple the Assad regime.’ Nancy . Pelosi, the House minority leader, was at the meeting today at the White House and used her five-year-old grandson as a . case for pushing towards war after the meeting. He was against war. She . said she told him: 'He said, 'I think no war.' I said, 'Well, I . generally agree with that but you know, they have killed hundreds of . children, they've killed hundreds of children there. ' And he said, five . years old, 'Were these children in the United States?' And I said, 'No, . but they're children wherever they are.' She . added: 'Humanity drew a line decades ago that I think if we ignore, we . do so to the peril of many other people who can suffer. ‘We’re . going to be asking for hearings and a prompt vote,’ the president said . Tuesday. ‘And I’m very appreciative that everybody here has already . begun to schedule hearings and intends to take a vote as soon as all of . Congress comes back early next week.’ Three . different national polls conducted in the past week indicate that . Americans may not have the stomach for another round of military . intervention in the Middle East, even if it's limited and doesn't . involve ground forces.And the level of support for President . Obama's plan has decreased with each successive poll, first by six . percentage points, and then by another seven.In a Pew Research survey, . just 29 per cent of adults asked between August 29 and September 1 said . they would favor military air strikes against Syria 'in response to . reports that the Syrian government used chemical weapons.' A . near-majority of 48 per cent said they would oppose such missions.That 48 per cent number was the lowest among the three polls. A Washington Post/ABC News poll . conducted during the same period found that 59 per cent of Americans . oppose 'the United States launching missile strikes against the Syrian . government.' Just 36 per cent said they were in favor of the strikes.And when NBC News polled . the question of whether the U.S. should 'take military action' against . Syria, 50 per cent said it should not. That poll registered 42 per cent . support for military strikes, but it's the earliest of the three public . opinion surveys. Innocents: According to U.S. estimates, of the 1,429 killed in the attack, 426 were children . Calculations: Obama has enlisted the support of Arizona Republican John McCain, left, as part of the campaing to corral support led in recent days by Secretary of State John Kerry, right . Secretary . of State John Kerry, Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel and Chairman of . the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Martin Dempsey are scheduled to make the . president’s case Tuesday afternoon before the Senate Foreign Relations . Committee. A top-secret and . more candid briefing will follow Wednesday morning, before a noon . hearing in the House featuring Kerry and Hagel. Meanwhile, . French president Francoise Hollande today said he would to wait for the . US Congress decision on military action in Syria before deciding on any . action France might take. No . doubt playing on the fears of lawmakers, Syrian strongman Bashar Assad . warned that the middle East is a 'powderkeg and fire is approaching . today' in an interview with French newspaper Le Figaro published . overnight. Proof: Syrian President Bashar al-Assad yesterday challenged the U.S. and France to prove he used chemical weapons. (Pictured with his British-born wife Asma Assad) Into the darkness: Many members of Congress fear that strikes on Congress may suck the U.S. into an open-ended conflict like Iraq, Afghanistan or Vietnam . 'You can’t only talk about what the . Syrian response will be, but what could happen after a first strike. And . no one knows what would happen', he said. 'Everyone will lose control of the . situation when the powder keg explodes. Chaos and extremism will be . widespread. The risk of a regional war exists.' The dictator also challenged the U.S. and France to produce proof that chemical weapons were used to kill 1,429 - including 426 children - on the outskirts of Damascus. Political . handicappers agree that with the support of McCain and Lindsey Graham . of South Carolina, two powerful Republicans, the U.S. Senate will easily . pass a resolution authorizing Obama to strike against Assad. Boehner’s . support may push a resolution across the finish line in the House, . although passage is by no means certain.  The president’s backers will . have to overcome opposition from liberal doves and libertarian-leaning . isolationists – many of whom are eager for payback over the president’s .

"By . Meghan Keneally . Hannah Anderson is set to speak for the first time about her terrifying kidnap ordeal where her captor zip-tied her, forced the teenager to play Russian roulette then murdered her mother and brother. The 16-year-old from California says she feels 'shocked, sick and angry' following her abduction by neighbor James Lee DiMaggio. The teenager spoke to the Today show with her father in an interview to air on Thursday. She traveled to New York for the taping from which she excitedly posted pictures on her Instagram account, including several close-ups of Miley Cyrus' live performance. Scroll down for video . First interview: Hannah Anderson talks to Savannah Guthrie about her kidnapping ordeal at the hands of James DiMaggio and said she feels 'shocked, sick and angry' Ordeal: Hannah said that DiMaggio handcuffed and zip-tied her feet and told her in detail how he was going to abduct her and take her to Idaho . Hannah Anderson, 16, who was kidnapped by a neighbor who murdered her mother and brother, posted this selfie picture on Instagram while in New York to talk to the Today Show about her ordeal . The teenager has regularly posted to her public Instagram account in the wake of her mother and brother's tragic deaths. She added this picture on Monday from the airport in New York . Miss Anderson told presenter Savannah Guthrie that things took a horrifying turn when DiMaggio brought her to his home on August 3. DiMaggio handcuffed and zip-tied her feet, telling her in detail how he was going to abduct her and take her to Idaho. The schoolgirl added that her role was to carry her kidnapper's backpacks and that he would 'get me home afterwards'. The teenager described her fear when DiMaggio forced her to play a game of Russian roulette with a gun while her mother and brother were in the house. When she started to cry, he said they could stop the game. Her mother and little brother were killed when DiMaggio's house burst into flames after he rigged it with explosives. Never forgotten: The teenager posted this picture in tribute to her little brother Ethan who would have celebrated his 9th birthday on Monday . Remembering the other victims: Hannah regularly posts old pictures of her mother Christina and brother Ethan, both of whom were killed by her captor before he fled with her to Idaho . After a week of extensive searches, Miss Anderson was rescued by FBI agents in . Idaho on August 10 after DiMaggio was killed in a shootout. One of the riders who alerted authorities after coming across the . teenage girl and her captor in the wilderness told the Today Show that there was . 'pure fear' in the girl's eyes. During . her short trip to New York City this week, the San Diego school girl updated her followers on . Instagram with pictures of her hotel room and a montage of photos and video . clips of Miley Cyrus. She . told the followers that she got a hug from the singer. The teenager paid tribute to her little brother Ethan on Monday on what would have been his 9th birthday. As . part of a longer message, the grieving teenager wrote: 'Sorry for . blowing up your instas but I wanna say happy birthday to little E. Today . he would have turned 9. And it breaks my heart to think how excite he . was to celebrate it. He was always ready for his birthday and knew his . plans a year before. I love you Ethan there's not a day I don't go . without missing you.' Hannah Anderson excitedly shared a montage of Miley Cyrus pictures from the Today Show on which she is set to appear on Thursday . Hannah Anderson has come under fire since being rescued from her horrifying ordeal as she made a semi-public re-entry to the world via social media. She began answering questions from . friends and strangers on social media site Ask.fm, and in some remarks . the strain of the continued interest in the case is beginning to show. When . one woman asked Anderson why did she 'never run' away from her captor . James DiMaggio- saying that 'he never have you handcuff or anything- . Anderson snapped back. 'How do you know he never had me . handcuffed? Because there you are wrong. Don't assume things you don't . know. Just stop,' she wrote. In . another, a user accused her father of 'mooching off other people' and . she responded: 'Why don't you shut the f*** up and get the facts right. He's trying a******. Why don't you get a life instead harassing people? (sic)' Memories: Hannah Anderson has posted pictures of her family on Instagram following her ordeal where her young brother and mother (right) were killed . Signs of trouble: She regularly posts inspirational messages hinting at her inner anguish . Anderson is an active user on Instagram, regularly posting smiling selfies with friends to her nearly 9,000 followers. There have been hints of emotional struggles, however, as she regularly posts old pictures of her mother Tina and brother Ethan, both of whom were tied, beaten and their bodies burnt. 'Just because i am strong enough to handle PAIN doesn't mean i deserve it [sic],' read one recent post. Some of that pain is self-inflicted, as she admitted to reading the autopsy report about the deaths where the medical examiner detailed the way in which they were beaten before DiMaggio set the house on fire and drove off with Hannah. She said that 'I need to know what happened to them'. The question-and-answer style social media site Ask.fm is popular among teens but it has been gaining a larger audience as it has been cited in a number of cases of bullying that have resulted in suicides. Happier moments: Anderson shared these pictures of herself and her boyfriend at their homecoming dance . Grieving: Hannah posted this picture with her brother Ethan and this message: 'Can't get you off my mind tonight. Miss you so much. I just wanna see you so bad. It's not the same and it never will be. I love you with all my heart' Anderson's conversation shows that she is a target for such internet trolls as well, with a number taking issue with the smiling, cheery photos that she has posted in the days and weeks following the family tragedy. Another told her to 'stop editing your pics, it's not a good looks for you'. Dead: FBI agents shot and killed Jim DiMaggio after they discovered him with Hannah in Idaho days after kidnapping her from California . 'Sad that you don't even know me and run your mouth but I give you props for having balls to talk s*** over ask lol,' she responded. Another talking point was the optics of how she walked into the memorial fundraiser for her mother and brother wearing short jean shorts and holding a cup from Starbucks. 'My friend randomly showed up with Starbucks and I guess she got me one,' Anderson wrote in one post, and continued by saying in another: 'Yeah it's stupid what was I suppose (sic) to do? Just throw it away when she gave it to me? People just find the littlest reasons to bash on me (sic).' Her social media presence shows that in spite of days where she says it ‘just doesn’t feel real’, there have been some more light-hearted moments in her life of late. Anderson attended her school’s . homecoming dance in an embellished pink dress, and posted pictures of . herself kissing her new boyfriend that she started dating a month ago. Those . moments of teenage milestones hide the apparent pain that she continues . to go through, she says that she regularly breaks down in the evenings . and uses her happiness during the day as a way to project a better . image. Adored: Hannah posted these pictures of her little brother Ethan with the words 'miss you' and 'my angel' Watching her back: Anderson has faced critics online and at school, as many have raised questions about her behavior in the days and weeks following her return . Timing: Anderson said that the reason she had Starbucks at her mother and brother's funeral was because a friend got it for her. 'What was I suppose (sic) to do? Just throw it away when she gave it to me?' ‘I break down all the time. I don’t like crying I front of people [sic]. I’m the type of person that makes sure everyone else’s feelings are ohkay [sic] before I take care of mine. Sorry I don’t take pics of me crying? That makes me a bad person I guess,’ she wrote on Ask.fm. DiMaggio was killed by the agents when they found he and Anderson in the woods of Idaho. He has been ruled as the sole suspect but questions arose when investigators found correspondence between he and the teen prior to the kidnapping. San Diego Sheriff Bill Gore reiterated that in spite of the unexpected evidence, Anderson is ‘a victim in every sense of the word’.

"By . Emma Innes . Record numbers of health-conscious men now take vitamins every day, according to new figures out today . Cod liver oil, omega-3, zinc and magnesium – sales of strange-tasting supplements are booming. And the surge is being caused by record numbers of men worried about their health and appearance, according to figures published yesterday. The report, compiled by analysts Mintel, found that the UK market for dietary supplements aimed directly at men grew by 25 per cent last year, from £4.1million to £5.1million. Although they have traditionally been the preserve of children, pregnant women and the elderly, supplements are now being regularly taken by 38 per cent of men, close behind the number of women, on 46 per cent. Men's health supplements usually contain vitamins A and D as well as zinc and magnesium which boost bone strength and help with memory loss and prostate problems. The market for vitamins and supplements aimed at men has seen the biggest growth of all sectors in the past few years, said Mintel. A spokesman said: ‘Despite the rise in sales of men’s vitamins, the number of male-specific launches remains fairly low in this category. ‘Taking greater confidence from maintaining a well-groomed appearance now defines what it is to be a “man” in today's society. ‘Men who buy grooming products to boost self-esteem or feel more attractive are now in the majority, however, there have been few vitamin launches targeted at men, particularly when it comes to vitamins with appearance benefits. Nearly four in 10 men take vitamins or supplements on a regular basis, prompting a 25 per cent boom in sales in the past year . ‘As 27 per cent of men agree that . vitamins and supplements are important for improving your appearance, . this market has great potential.’ The report found that 42 per cent of all adults regularly take vitamins or supplements to boost their health. Women are the higher users of vitamins and supplements, with 46 per cent taking them on a daily basis. One in five men have taken vitamins 'occasionally' in the past 12 months, mostly when they are feeling run down. Thirteen per cent of men have taken cod liver oil on the same basis, 15 per cent vitamin D and 14 per cent fish oil or omega-3. Men say they take vitamins to boost their health in general, 56 per cent to improve their immune system, 40 per cent to keep bones healthy and 24 per cent to boost energy levels. Fourteen per cent take vitamins to combat ageing and 22 per cent to improve their brain function and memory.","There has been a 25% increase in sales of men's vitamins in the last year .

"By . Mark Prigg In Las Vegas . It has confused scientists for decades - how how do Monarch butterflies manage to navigate 2,000 miles from breeding sites across the eastern United States to fir trees in central Mexico. Researchers first found they used the sun - but then found they could still navigate on overcast days. Now they believe they have finally solved the mystery - the insects have an internal magnetic compass. A Monarch butterfly eats nectar from a swamp milkweed on the shore of Rock Lake in Pequot Lakes, Minnesota: Researchers say the insects use an internal magnetic compass to help navigate on their annual migrations from North America to central Mexico. Each fall millions of monarch butterflies use a sophisticated navigation system to transverse 2,000 miles from breeding sites across the eastern United States to an overwintering habitat in specific groves of fir trees in central Mexico. Tagged insects have shown they can travel over 250 miles in a day. The new research in the journal Nature Communications was carried out by scientists at UMass Medical School and Worcester Polytechnic Institute. 'Taken as a whole, our study reveals another fascinating aspect of the monarch butterfly migratory behavior,' said author Steven Reppert. 'Greater knowledge of the mechanisms underlying the fall migration may well aid in its preservation, currently threatened by climate change and by the continuing loss of milkweed and overwintering habitats. 'A new vulnerability to now consider is the potential disruption of the magnetic compass in the monarchs by human-induced electromagnetic noise, which can also affect geomagnetic orientation in migratory birds.' Co-author Robert Gegear, PhD, assistant professor of biology and biotechnology at WPI, said: 'Our study shows that monarchs use a sophisticated magnetic inclination compass system for navigation similar to that used by much larger-brained migratory vertebrates such as birds and sea turtles.' Monarchs use a time-compensated sun compass in their antenna to help them make their 2,000 mile migratory journey to overwintering sites. During the absence of daylight cues, such as under dense cloud cover, migrants have been, surprisingly, seen flying in the expected southerly direction. It’s been hypothesized that monarchs use geomagnetic cues to help navigate when day light cues are unavailable to them during migration. The nsects also use the sun to get their route right . Using flight simulators equipped with artificial magnetic fields, Patrick Guerra, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow in the Reppert lab, examined monarch flight behavior under diffuse white light conditions. He found that tethered monarchs in the simulators oriented themselves in a southerly direction. Further tests in the simulator revealed that the butterflies used the inclination angle of Earth’s magnetic field to guide their movement. Reversing the direction of the inclination caused the monarchs to orient in the opposite direction, to the north instead of the south. Monarch butterflies are collected in a net to be tested for the ophroyocystis elektroscirrha parasite that inhibits their flight, at El Capulin reserve, near Zitacuaro, Mexico. Further work suggested the compass is in the antennae. 'For migratory monarchs, the inclination compass may serve as an important back up system when daylight cues are unavailable,' Guerra said. 'It may also augment hand-in-hand with the time-compensated sun compass to provide orientation and directionality throughout the migration process.' The next step for Reppert and colleagues will be to evaluate the molecular and genetic mechanisms of magneto-reception in the monarch butterfly and the involvement of CRYs.","Compass used to navigate 2,000 miles from United States to central Mexico .

"By . Press Association . Dolly Parton works from Nine to Five - but she might have to find time to be a pet owner too after she offered to adopt a dog left behind at Glastonbury. The country legend said she would take in the white lurcher if her owner is not found. The canine was discovered in a tent during a clean-up after thousands of festival-goers left the site.She was named Dolly after the star, who stole the show with her first ever performance at the event a week ago. Scroll down for video . Abandoned: The white lurcher was found in one of the 5,000 tents that were left discarded in the fields of Worthy Farm, Somerset after the festival. A crew of up to 800 were responsible for tidying up the camp site . A hit: Dolly Parton may be taking an unlikely fan home with her from her trip to the UK in the form of Dolly the dog who was left behind . Discarded: Dolly was found in a tent on Tuesday as the cleaning crew began transforming the site back to a working dairy farm. The process, which involves litter pickers, tractors and volunteers, could take six weeks . The dog was taken in by the Happy Landings animal shelter, which is close to the Glastonbury venue at Worthy Farm in Somerset. Parton, . 68, said: “I had my manager call the Happy Landings animal shelter to . make sure the dog is being treated and cared for properly. 'At . this time, nobody has claimed the dog and the dog is in great hands at . the shelter. I will take the dog home to America if nobody claims her . within a reasonable amount of time.' She also sent a video message saying she is 'very honored and flattered' that the dog had been named after her. Ain't she cute? Dolly Parton tweeted about dog Dolly, saying she'll take her home if no one claims her . It is not the first time the singer has had an animal named in her honor. After . Dolly the Sheep became the world’s first successfully cloned mammal, . doctors revealed she was so-named because she was derived from a mammary . gland cell - and they said they could not think of a more impressive . pair of glands than Parton’s.

"By . Mia De Graaf . A 10-month-old boy who suffers from a rare form of epilepsy is being treated with cannabis. Oliver Osborn has migrating partial epilepsy, provoking up to 100 seizures a day. Victims rarely live beyond the age of seven. However, in a desperate bid to find a cure, his parents are raising money to afford a new treatment from America - that involves liquid marijuana. Life line: Oliver Osborn, 10 months old, has a rare form of epilepsy that his parents hope to treat with liquid cannabis. He has up to 100 seizures a day but US patients claim the treatment reduces fits by 90 per cent . Oliver's mother Danielle (pictured together) and father are fundraising to bring the medicine to the UK . Sufferers are given a drop of the strain under their tongue once a day to quell their fits. The formula has been dubbed Charlotte's Web after Charlotte Figi, a five-year-old patient whose condition improved after just one dose. Also called Realm Oil or Alepsia, is high in cannabidiol content but reportedly does not induce the psychoactive reaction commonly associated with marijuana. The unconventional practice has drastically reduced the amount of seizures in children - some by up to 90 per cent. Although the treatment is not yet . available in the UK, Oliver's parents Rik Osborn, 29, and Danielle . Coils, 28, are hoping fundraising efforts will help bring it here. Desperate: Rik Osborn (left with his son) is sure the treatment can help Oliver, whose condition carries a life expectancy of seven years old. If they can afford the liquid, he will receive one drop a day under his tongue . The strain is a liquidised version of cannabidiol, which makes up 40 per cent of a cannabis plant. It is called Charlotte's Web, Realm Oil or Alepsia. Doctors claim it does not provoke the psychoactive reactions that cannabis does. American patients claim to have seen their fits reduced by up to 90 per cent. Mr Osborn said: 'Hopefully it could be a step forward. 'I've read about a little girl out there, similar to Oliver, who it has been used on. 'It . is a strange route to take, but at the end of the day, when you're up . against the wall, when surgery is not an option, it's got to be . something to consider.' Mr Osborn, of Peterlee, County Durham, added: 'People say that ""if it's not legalised why would you give it to children?"" 'But when other medication isn't working, it's something we've got to go for. 'At the end of the day you want what's best for your child and for them to be with you for as long as possible. 'Little things like that give you hope.' To . help raise money for the alternative treatment, Rik is taking part in a . three day 140-mile Coast 2 Coast bike ride with family and friends . hoping it will help research to take off.

"By . Associated Press . Detectives believe a boy charged with stabbing 21 other students and a security guard at his Pittsburgh-area high school threatened two students by phone before the attack, according to a search warrant. Neither was one of the victims. The warrant, obtained from the home of Alex Hribal hours after last Wednesday's rampage, said two students received 'threatening phone messages and completed calls' from someone believed to be Hribal. It said the threat of violence contained an expletive. Scroll down for video . Warning signs: Suspect Alex Hribal, 16, is led from his arraignment after he was charged with four counts of attempted murder as an adult. Authorities believe he threatened two students before carrying out the attack on April 16 . Terror: Twenty one students were injured in April 16's blood bath, as well as a security guard. The two students Hribald allegedly threatened were not injured . Evacuation: Students at Franklin Regional High School were evacuated after the stabbing. District Attorney John Peck said the two male students who got the calls were not among those stabbed or slashed in the attack, which occurred minutes before the start of classes at Franklin Regional High School. Neither Peck nor the warrant say when the calls were made. Murrysville police Chief Thomas Seefeld previously said investigators were looking into a threatening phone call the night before the assaults. 'The caller is believed to be the actor because of the subsequent conduct of the actor coming to school and attacking numerous individuals,' the warrant said. Seefeld noted Monday that police had not definitively linked the calls to the 16-year-old suspect but were seeking phone records to determine if they came from a phone he could have used. Sophomore student Alex Hribal, 16, (pictured here in his high school yearbook) will be charged as an adult on several attempted murder charges . Transported: Hribal is driven away from a district magistrate in a Westmoreland County Sheriff's car after he was arraigned . Defense attorney Patrick Thomassey did not return calls Monday from The Associated Press. But he told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, which first reported the contents of the search warrant: 'I don't know of those phone calls.' He had previously told the AP that Hribal's parents weren't aware of any threatening calls the night before the attacks. The warrant indicates detectives seized three video game systems and games, a wooden kitchen knife-holder, some notebook paper believed to contain Hribal's handwriting and two computers. Four students remained hospitalized Monday, three in critical condition. The fourth was upgraded to fair condition. The high school's teachers attended a counseling session at a nearby church before returning to the school for the first time Monday, part of a three-day effort by school officials and a hired crisis management team to fully reopen the school for classes Wednesday. School spirit: A group of students tapes up a sign supporting their school near the entrance to Franklin Regional High School . Prayers: Ashlin (L) and Jude Burkhart, from Murrysville, hold candles during a prayer vigil for victims of the Franklin Regional High School stabbing rampage, at Calvary Lutheran Church in Murrysville, Pennsylvania on April 9, 2014 . On Tuesday, students and parents will get a chance to see that hallways have been cleaned up and other steps taken to return the school to normal. Some parents said their children are eager to get back to school. 'That's where he wants to be, to be with his friends,' Jeff Mauro said of his son, Jamie, a ninth-grader who witnessed some of the stabbings. 'This has been a learning experience that we have to love each other — all of us.' Laura Thompson said her children 'seem to think they're going to be fine. But I think it's going to be different when they're back in that environment.' Thomassey has said he plans to waive Hribal's right to a preliminary hearing next week. After that, he said he would ask a judge to move the case to juvenile court, a move prosecutors are expected to contest. Thomassey said that request will be based largely on a mental health evaluation by a doctor he's hired.","Alex Hribal, 16, went on a stabbing spree at Franklin Regional High School last Wednesday .

An activist has succeeded in filming the barbaric slaughter using ‘spinal spikes’ – and the footage is now set to ignite international outrage. It was shot in a cove during the notorious Taiji ‘drive-hunts’ and shows a fisherman repeatedly stabbing a metal rod into the base of a dolphin’s head behind its blowhole. Another man then rams a wooden plug hard into the wound to prevent the sea turning red with blood, thus  alerting marine conservationists. Grim: This picture shows evidence of the horrific deaths dolphins suffer at the hands of Japanese fishermen. This  undercover footage shows a fisherman repeatedly ramming a metal rod into the base of the dolphin's head . The Japanese Fishing Ministry has maintained for more than a decade that this method is more humane than killing dolphins using traditional spears and clubs. However, the fishermen have been obsessed with ensuring the slaughter takes place out of sight.Before driving the animals into the shallows of a chosen cove, they erect elaborate scaffolding on surrounding cliffs and hang tarpaulins to shield their activities. But one intrepid conservationist managed to find a vantage point to capture the barbaric reality of the slaughter. He hid a remote camera in the cliffs long before the ‘curtain of  horror’ was erected and managed to film a killing at close quarters. Upset: Protestor Hannah Fraser, left, and American actress Hayden Panettiere take part in a protest against the slaughter of dolphins by Japanese fishermen . The dolphin slaughter at Taiji was first exposed in the Oscar-winning 2009 film The Cove, and it has long been seen by marine conservationists as an exercise in mass cruelty. However, The Cove was unable to gain footage as useful to conservationists as this current video and many of the film’s more gruesome scenes were cut out for fear they were too upsetting for audiences. A spokesman for the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society said the new video provided the first footage of dolphin spike killings at such close proximity. It has enabled a senior British veterinary scientist to write a devastating report on the slaughter in which he says the animals suffer a ‘profoundly distressing, traumatic and painful’ death. Study leader Dr Andrew Butterworth believes the spinal puncture actually prolongs their suffering to an unimaginable four minutes or more. Dr Butterworth, of the University of Bristol Veterinary School, concludes: ‘This killing method does not conform to the recognised requirement for “immediate insensibility” and would not be tolerated or permitted in any regulated slaughterhouse process in the developed world.’ A WDC spokesman said of the film: ‘This is what has allowed a proper scientific assessment. It is the first time this killing method has been independently analysed.’ It is the scientific analysis of the  footage which, the WDC believes, puts mounting pressure on Japan to ban the method. Since uploading the images along with an online petition to its website last week, the WDC has recorded more than 100,000 hits. Among those re-tweeting the link are comedian Stephen Fry, who urges his followers: ‘Help stop the horror behind the killing of dolphins in Taiji. Check out the shocking footage. Sign the petition.’ Horrific: Whales are pictured being killed nearby in Taiji , Wakayama . Louie Psihoyos, director of The Cove, which won an Oscar for best documentary in 2010, told The Mail on Sunday that he cut out much of his own covert footage of the slaughter. He said: ‘What we showed in The Cove, no matter how difficult that was for people to watch, was still a Disney version of what actually happens. ‘Having seen first-hand how the Taiji dolphin-hunters treat dolphins while the world is not watching, and having viewed more than  40 hours of covert footage which my team filmed under the secrecy of their tarpaulins, I can safely  say that there is nothing remotely humane about the way in which they kill these creatures with their spinal spikes. ‘If we showed the world what actually went on there … nobody should have to suffer through watching that. ‘These creatures, with bigger brains than us, are sometimes tied up by their tail for hours before they are spiked, geysers of blood spraying with every heartbeat. It sometimes goes on for minutes until they are drained of blood. ‘They thrash and bleed while their mates swim through the blood to try to rescue them.’The WDC’s campaigns manager Courtney Vail said scientific analysis of the latest footage had ‘confirmed our worst fears’. Awful: This shows a scene from the documentary The Cove (2009) which won an Oscar for best documentary in 2010. It highlighted the slaughter of dolphins . She added: ‘It verifies the unspeakable cruelty taking place behind the tarpaulins.’ Dr Butterworth said fisherman began using the spinal puncture method 13 years ago after two  Japanese scientists claimed it ‘reduced time to death’. However, the covert video, which was neither dubbed nor cut, shows a dolphin still alive four minutes and 14 seconds after the first rod is plunged repeatedly into his back. Animal welfare groups estimate that around 900 dolphins were killed at Taiji during the eight-month season. All will be sold for their meat. Matt Brash, president of the British Veterinary Zoological Society, said at least dolphins were killed comparatively quickly when using traditional hunting practices of clubbing and spearing. ‘This method supposedly severs the spinal cord – assuming the fisherman manages it,’ he said. ‘That will stop the dolphins swimming away but then they’re just going to bleed to death and drown. ‘I can see there’s going to be less blood about because the fishermen are plugging the holes. But that’s just a cosmetic way of concealing an atrocious and unacceptable act. Dolphins are beautiful, intelligent and sentient animals and they will know what is happening.’","Activist has succeeded in filming barbaric slaughter using ‘spinal spikes’

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Iran has threatened to sue search engine Google over omitting the name 'Persian Gulf' on its Google Maps service. Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Ramin Mehmanparast said that, if Google did not restore the name of the Persian Gulf - the body of water between Iran and the Arabian Peninsula -  it would face 'serious damages'. Mr Mehmanparast told the semi-official Mehr news agency today that Tehran had already warned Google of possible legal action. Gulf of 'omit': Google Maps does not name the Persian Gulf, the body of water between Iran and the Arabian Peninsula. But the Gulf of Oman is labelled . What's in a name? Wikipedia's map of the same area has the Persian Gulf clearly labelled, as well as the Strait of Hormuz . He said: 'Toying with modern technologies in political issues is among the new measures by the enemies against Iran, [and] in this regard, Google has been treated as a plaything.' But Google reacted to the comments, saying that its maps service had never labelled the Persian Gulf. When asked by MailOnline if Google planned to include the title in the wake of Iranian threats, a spokesman said there were no plans to include the title on any amended map. A separate company insider told Mail Online that it was 'definitely not' a political decision not to have Persian Gulf on Google maps, and Iran's assertion that Google had had the label removed was 'simply wrong'. It's there if you really look: Typing 'Persian Gulf' into Google Maps an then clicking on the resulting 'A' marker will bring up the body of water's title . Threats: Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Ramin Mehmanparast . He added that, even in the wake of the Iranian threats, there were no plans to include the Persian Gulf label on Google maps. And he said that the label Persian Gulf AND Arabian Gulf were included in the more detailed Google Earth app. Iranians are highly sensitive about the name of the body of water, which has historically and internationally been known as the Persian Gulf. Some Arab states insist on calling it the Arabian Gulf. The issue has stirred up tensions between Iranians and Arabs. While Google Maps annotates the nearby Gulf of Oman, it also omits the name of the Strait of Hormuz - the narrow body of water that separates the two gulfs. Typing Persian Gulf into Google Maps takes users to the body of water in question, and clicking on the red 'A' marker shows 'Persian Gulf' as the address. The Persian Gulf has been so known since the 5th century BC, when Darius the Great of the Achaemenid dynasty called the body of water 'The sea which goes from Persian'. Around the same time, Greek writers also called it 'Persikonkaitas', meaning Persian Gulf. Other names have included 'Persicus Sinus', 'Aquarius Persico', 'Bahr-i-Fars', 'Daryaye-i-Fars', 'Khalij al-'Ajami' and 'Khalij-i Fars' - all translating into Persian Gulf or Persian Sea. During the time of the Ottoman Empire, it was sometimes referred to as 'Basra Kurfuzi', meaning the Gulf of Basra - but it was only during the rise of Arab nationalism in the 1960s that the name become disputed. The United Nations has requested that only the term Persian Gulf be used to describe or name the body of water, confirmed most recently as the official title of the body of water at the 23rd session of the UN in 2006.","Iran accuses search engine of removing historical title for political reasons .

"By . Luke Garratt . Cervical Cancer story. Charlotte Brown,37, who survived cancer, is suing the NHS after she was given the all-clear to a smear test - and got cervical cancer two years later . A mother-of-two who was diagnosed with cervical is suing the NHS because she was hit with the disease two years after getting the all clear from a smear test. Charlotte Brown, 37, from Pucklechurch, south Gloucestershire was one of the thousands of women who went to the doctors for a smear test as part of the 'Jade Goody effect' caused by when the Big Brother star died from cervical cancer in 2009. She was given the all clear two years ago, when her results came back as 'normal' and she continued her day-to-day life. But two years later Brown went to the doctor with worrying symptoms, and was later diagnosed as cervical cancer. Brown then had to undergo several weeks of radiotherapy and chemotherapy, followed by surgery, before being told she was in remission. Now, she is taking legal action against North Bristol NHS Trust after saying her test was wrongly reported as clear when there were abnormalities. She also wants new rules to be introduced which will mean stricter double-checking of test results. Brown said: “I passed out when the doctors told me, I was very scared. 'I had two children aged five and four at the time and I had separated from my husband so I was worried about who would look after my children. 'The whole ordeal has had a huge physical and emotional impact on me. 'I go for regular smear tests and it’s distressing to know that abnormalities were there but they were not reported. Brown with her children Madeline, 8 and Billy, 10. Because of the cancer she has had to undergo radiotherapy and chemotherapy and will not be able to have children again . 'I know that mistakes will always happen but making the screening system safer by ensuring tests are thoroughly double checked could help to capture more cases where errors have been made. 'This in turn could help to ensure more women at risk of cervical cancer get the treatment they urgently need.' One of Brown's first tests was five years ago after Jade Goody's case hit the news. Like Goody, Brown claims that despite having the correct examination clear signs were missed. She says her treatment of radiotherapy, chemotherapy and surgery has caused her to have long-term health problems, including not being able to have any more children, and lymphoedema, a condition that causes her legs to swell. As a result, she has mobility problems, and has been forced to give up her job as an elderly support worker. Angharad Hughes, Charlotte’s medical negligence solicitor at firm JMW said: 'The screen process does involve some smear tests being doubled-checked. 'However the second ‘rapid review’ check is done very quickly, meaning there is greater room for error. 'As a safety net to pick up cases that were missed on the first check it is not ideal.' A spokeswoman for North Bristol NHS Trust said: 'We are aware of Ms Brown’s case but due to ongoing legal proceedings it would be inappropriate for us to comment on the matter at this time.' Cervical screening is about 80 per cent to 90 per cent reliable and can prevent 60 to 80% of cervical cancers, and there are several factors at play in the taking and reading of cervical screenings which makes it impossible for it to be 100 per cent accurate. In addition, a cervical screening will not give a final diagnosis, as it is just a screening test used to detect early abnormalities, not cancer as a whole. Public Health England recommends women attend as many screenings as they are invited to and take the advice they are given at these screenings.","Charlotte Brown, 37, of, Pucklechurch, Gloucestershire was given all-clear .

"By . Ian Drury . A family whose lives were put at risk from an armed stalker because of a string of Home Office blunders are set to receive £130,000 compensation. Immigration officials failed to act on warnings about convicted criminal Al Amin Dhalla, 44, which they received months before his campaign of harassment. His ex-girlfriend’s parents told border staff the Canadian-born bank auditor was dangerous and had obtained a British visa under false pretences, but no action was taken. Jilted: Dr Alison Hewitt (left) ended the one-year relationship with Al Amin Dhalla (right) after she found out he had lied about his past. Dhalla went on to carry out a campaign of harassment against Dr Hewitt and her family . Dr Alison Hewitt ended the one-year relationship when her stepfather, David Gray, discovered Dhalla had lied about his past. In revenge for uncovering his criminal background, he pursued the doctor and her parents with crossbows and an air rifle before torching their home. Police said catching Dhalla had saved the family’s lives. Today a watchdog is set to order the Home Office to make the six-figure payout. A damning report by the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman said the department had missed ‘vital opportunities to protect the family’. Dr Hewitt’s mother Pamela, a former probation officer, said their ordeal had been ‘like a horror movie’, adding that while they were pleased with the report’s findings, ‘the sad reality is this has taken so long the Home Office has not started to … close the loopholes that allowed Dhalla into the country.’ Stalker Al Amin Dhalla dressed as a doctor searches the Princess Royal Hospital . Mrs Hewitt said the Border Agency – replaced by the Border Force – should ‘hang its head in shame’. ‘We came to them with important information … but they did nothing … Unless that man is deported we will be looking over our shoulders for the rest of our lives.’ Mr Gray, a missiles systems engineer, said: ‘This shows our Government does not take seriously the security and safety of its citizens.’ Dhalla and Dr Hewitt met online in 2009. He told her he was 35, an orphan and had been in the UK for many years – all lies. Suspicious at inconsistencies in his account, Mrs Hewitt and Mr Gray hired a private investigator and found Dhalla had served a jail term for assaulting his uncle, used three aliases and had a ten-year gun ban in Canada. They emailed immigration officials – while Dhalla and Dr Hewitt were in Canada in 2010 – revealed his criminal past and explained he had obtained his British visa illegally. They gave details of his flight back to Britain but he was not questioned at Heathrow.

Letters to Home Secretary Theresa May were not answered. After the relationship ended, Dhalla waged a campaign of terror, stalking the family with texts, emails and phone calls, sending malicious letters to her colleagues and neighbours in Brighton and hiring a detective to watch her. In April 2011 he was arrested on weapons charges. Police informed the Home Office but were told he had permission to be in the UK. While on bail he set Mrs Hewitt’s Buckinghamshire cottage on fire and later posed as a doctor at the Princess Royal Hospital in Haywards Heath, West Sussex, where Dr Hewitt worked. He was arrested there by armed police who found weapons including a loaded crossbow in his car.Dhalla was convicted of offences including arson, harassment, theft and damage to property, and jailed for a minimum of six years. He faces deportation when released. Ombudsman Julie Mellor said the family’s ‘living nightmare …would not have happened without the Home Office’s serious mistakes’. She ordered the Home Office to carry out three reviews into how officials check a visa applicant’s background. A Home Office spokesman said the department had apologised to the family.","Officials failed to act on warnings about convicted criminal Al Amin Dhalla .

"By . Mark Prigg . Instagram users were locked out of the picture sharing site today as it experienced server issues. The site, which is owned by Facebook, was forced to apologise to users after many took to Twitter to complain of the problems. The site is believed to have hit problems for around an hour from 4:30Pm ET. Users of Instagram's app found them selves unable to log in this afternoon as the site suffered technical problems . Users were hit with an error message saying the 'login server' could not be reached. 'Sorry, we couldn't complete your request,' an error message on the site read. 'Our team has been notified and will investigate as soon as possible.' The firm soon took to Twitter to acknowledge the problem. 'We're aware of an issue affecting Instagram, and should have a fix shortly. 'Thanks for your patience!' the firm tweeted. Users took to twitter to vent their displeasure - while others immediately began making jokes. #instagramnotworking also became a trending hashtag as the firm worked on a fix. 'Instagram is down - describe your lunch to me' one popular picture proclaimed. One of the images which quickly appeared in Twitter following the crash . Instagram was forced to take to Twitter to reassure users it was working on the problem . The firm is locked in battle with Twitter for the lucrative photo sharing market. Earlier this year, Twitter overhauled its photo system in a bid to compete with Instagram, allowing up to four pictures in each tweet. The firm has also added to ability to tag up to ten friends in a photo, without using up any of the tweets 140 characters. The move is the latest in the battle between the social networks, and comes after Instagram owner Facebook revealed it was buying virtual reality firm Oculus. Twitter now allows us up to four photos to be attached to a single tweet . Friends can be tagged in Twitter's mobile apps. If you’re the one being tagged, you’ll get a notification. You can adjust notifications, as well as who can tag you, in your Settings. 'We’re rolling out two new mobile features that make photos on Twitter more social,' the firm said. 'One is photo tagging, which lets you tag the people in your photo; the other is the ability to include up to four photos in a Tweet.' The move is seen as a direct move to compete with Faceebook and Instagram's photo features. Twitter also revealed that the added photo capabilities wouldn't eat into the number of characters users have. 'Tagging doesn’t affect character count in the Tweet — you can tag up to 10 people in a photo and still have all 140 characters at your disposal, making it easier to connect with your friends.' The new design follows a number of changes. In March, for example, Twitter posted a blog announcing a new range of photo options. Users can now add up to four pictures in each tweet. The firm also added the ability to tag up to ten friends in a photo, without using up any of the tweets 140 characters . The multiple picture feature is also automatic. 'You can also share a series of photos that automatically create a collage. 'Just tap on a preview to get the full image and slide through the group.' The ability to upload multiple photos is starting to roll out today on iPhone, and is coming soon to Android and twitter.com, the firm said. Instagram (pictured) was acquired by Facebook in 2012 for $1bn and has over 200million users across the globe.

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . The family of a two-year-old girl who was killed when a stone fireplace fell on her at her home have today paid tribute to their 'little princess'. Trinity Liliana Coward was found with serious injuries at her house in Lakenham, Norwich, at about 5pm on Sunday. She was taken to the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital but died shortly after arrival. Parents Kelly, 31, and dad Shaun, 35, today paid tribute to their child. Trinity Liliana Coward, 2, (pictured) died when a stone fireplace fell on her at home, police said today. She was taken to Norfolk and Norwich hospital with serious injuries and died a short while later . They said: 'Our little princess. Your gorgeous smile and those dimples forever etched on our hearts. 'Daddy's . little baby girl shine bright like a diamond in the sky. Mummy's little . angel so loving and cuddly. Can't wait to have snuggles xxx. 'Till we see you again all our love from Mummy, Daddy and your brothers and sisters xx' Neighbours today said the family moved into the council house about two years ago. Colleen Seeley, 71, said she heard a 'huge crash' and 'screaming' before emergency services rushed to save the little girl. She said: 'I came home on Sunday at 4.15 and at 4.45 I heard this crash like scaffolding falling down, it was very loud. I heard the girl's mother scream, she really screamed. 'Outside the dad was on his phone, calling the ambulance and he left the others inside. 'Other neighbours must have heard it along the road. A man said his son had heard it as he got in the van to go to work. A lot of neighbours were running across to help. Today Trinity's parents paid tribute to their little girl, pictured, saying: 'Your gorgeous smile and those dimples forever etched on our hearts' 'Paramedics came and she was put in the ambulance before they brought her out again to do some sort of procedure behind screens. 'They were doing CPR on her and then then they rushed off with her to hospital. I know the little girl has brothers who are 16 and four and a sister who is 10. 'She is a really nice little girl, really pretty, it's very sad. 'I'm not sure how it could have happened. I know the man who used to live in the house didn't have a fireplace so it must be quite new. They moved in around two years ago.' A neighbour, who did not want to be named, said she heard a loud 'crash' before a woman started screaming. She said: 'The paramedics were dealing with her on the side of the road. They did CPR on her in the street. 'They put the little girl in the ambulance. She was in there a little while. The 2-year-old pictured at home. In a touching tribute, Trinity's parents added: 'Daddy's little baby girl shine bright like a diamond in the sky. Mummy's little angel so loving and cuddly. Can't wait to have snuggles' 'After a while they got her out of the ambulance again and the paramedic did something with her throat. 'They were holding a sheet up so people couldn't see. They then went off and had a police car in front and a police car behind.' Her death, which is not being treated as suspicious, comes just days after a tradesman was jailed for eight months after a fireplace he fitted fell and killed a six-year-old girl. Isabella Pritchard - known as Bella - suffered massive head injuries after the heavy stone fireplace installed by Christopher Elmer, 39, of Greenford, west London, crashed on top of her. The girl, who attended £10,000-a-year Maltman’s Green School in Gerrards Cross, Buckinghamshire, was taken to hospital where she died from her catastrophic injuries. Trinity was killed when a stone fireplace fell on her at her home in Norwich, pictured. Neighbours said today the family had lived in the council property for two years . James Curtis, three, of Birkenhead, Merseyside was also killed by a falling fireplace at his home in April last year. Matthew Green, four, died in 2005 when a 50kgs mantelpiece collapsed on him at his family's new home in Towcester, Northamptonshire in October 2005. Stonemason Kristian Childs, 42, was fined £7,500 at Northampton Crown Court last June after he admitted health and safety offences in connection with Matthew's death . Speaking today of Trinity's death, Local councillor Keith Driver said: 'It's a very sad time for the family and just tragic that these events happen. 'There's nothing you can really say to make anything any better. 'I think people around the area will . know the child as well so it will mean the whole area is sad as well. Whenever a child dies it's a tragic event.' Bert . Bremner, Norwich City Council cabinet member for housing, said: 'This . is an awful tragedy and our thoughts are with the family at this . difficult time. In another chilling case, Isabella Pritchard (left) suffered massive head injuries after a heavy stone . fireplace installed by Christopher Elmer (right), 39, of Greenford, west . London, crashed on top of her . 'Our staff are here to support them in any way we can.' Norfolk Police said: 'The circumstances surrounding the infant's death will be subject to a coroner's enquiry although early indications are that this was an unforeseen and tragic event in a family home.' An East of England Ambulance Service Trust spokesman said: 'We were called at 4.44pm to treat an injured toddler. 'An ambulance, paramedic officer and the East Anglian Air Ambulance were dispatched.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Updated: . 20:16 EST, 18 November 2011 . A landlord was left outraged after a . judge ruled that a ‘spiteful’ teenage tenant who smashed up his home . causing £20,000 of damage did not have to pay a penny in compensation. Glenn Schofield rented his . four-bedroom property to Lee Davis, 18, but problems began in June last . year when the teenager’s girlfriend moved in. First the landlord started to receive complaints about anti-social behaviour then Davis’s rent payments suddenly stopped. Nightmare: When landlord Glenn Schofield (pictured) finally managed to evict his tenants, he found the kitchen appliances and fixtures were destroyed, the windows had to be boarded up because they'd been smashed and debris covered the floors of every room . Trashed: The tenants left carpets destroyed, junk strewn across floors and extensive damage . Sentenced: Lee Davis was given an 18-month community order at Teesside Crown Court and told to carry out 300 hours of unpaid work for the community . Mr Schofield spent months going . through the courts to get an eviction order for the Darlington property . but by the time he succeeded, Davis, who has never had a job but wants . to join the Army, had smashed it up in anger at being asked to leave. The landlord spent £2,000 cleaning . the house after the pair finally left in August this year, while his . insurer quoted another £18,500 to repair further damage, including . replacing broken kitchen fittings and appliances. A toilet had also been . left blocked to overflowing. Sue Jacobs, prosecuting, told the . court that paint had been thrown over walls and the fireplace, with . ‘extensive damage’ in every room. She said police had to board up the . property on the day the couple finally moved out, adding: ‘The banister . had been completely ripped off, paint had been thrown over the walls and . fireplace, doors were smashed and windows broken.’ Judge Howard Crowson told Davis at . Teesside Crown Court this week that he wanted to make him foot the bill . but could not as the teenager had no money. Davis’s barrister, Rod Hunt, told the . court: ‘If he had been a celebrity hell-raiser or a member of the . Bullingdon Club he would have just written a cheque, but he’s not.’ Davis, who was arrested after police . traced him to a new address near Glasgow, pleaded guilty to criminal . damage and was given an 18-month community order and told to do 300 . hours of unpaid community work. Mr Hunt told the court that Davis . hoped to join the Army, and either a prison sentence or a suspended jail . term would have resulted in ‘the door being slammed shut in his face’. Destruction: Windows had to be boarded up by police when the property was vacated as it was unsafe . Squalor: Davis went on a wrecking spree, leaving every room in the house with extensive damage . Judge Crowson said: ‘I did wonder whether I was going to have to lock you up. You have admitted some quite unpleasant damage – spiteful, really. ‘I wish I could make you pay for the damage you have done. I can’t. But I note it is your intention to obtain paid employment and, perhaps, the insurers will pursue you then.’ Mr Schofield said the sentence could encourage other vandals, adding: ‘I would have liked him to do some hard labour – maybe cleaning somewhere would have been appropriate. It is a very disappointing situation.’","Lee Davis, 18, smashed windows and doors and threw paint on walls .

"By . Ted Thornhill . Cinema goers are used to looking out for warnings of nudity and violence in films. Now another category has been added to the list of movie dangers – male chauvinism. Cinemas in Sweden have introduced an ‘A’ rating to highlight films that have a shortage of ‘female perspectives’. The guidance system – named the Bechdel test after US feminist Alison Bechdel – will monitor whether at least two female characters talk to each other about subjects other than men. Feminism fail: The Star Wars films have been deemed as sexist by the Bechdel test. Pictured is Mark Hamill, as Luke Skywalker, right, and Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia . ‘The entire Lord of the Rings trilogy, all Star Wars movies, The Social Network, Pulp Fiction and all but one of the Harry Potter movies fail this test,’ said Ellen Tejle, the director of Bio Rio, an art-house movie theatre in Stockholm's trendy Sodermalm district. Bio Rio is one of four Swedish movie theatres that launched the new rating last month to draw attention to how few movies pass. Most visitors have reacted positively to the initiative ‘and for some people it has been an eye-opener,’ said Tejle, reclining in one of Bio Rio's cushy red seats. Beliefs about women's roles in society are influenced by the fact that movie watchers rarely see ‘a female superhero or a female professor or person who makes it through exciting challenges and masters them,’ Tejle said, noting that the rating doesn't say anything about the quality of the film. ‘The goal is to see more female stories and perspectives on cinema screens.’ The state-funded Swedish Film Institute supports the initiative, which is starting to catch on. Scandinavian cable TV channel Viasat Film says it will start using the ratings in its film reviews and has scheduled an ‘A’ rated ‘Super Sunday’ on Nov. 17, when it will show only films that pass the test, such as The Hunger Games, The Iron Lady and Savages. The Bechdel test got its name from American cartoonist Alison Bechdel, who introduced the concept in her comic strip Dykes to Watch Out For in 1985. It has been discussed among feminists and film critics since then, but Tejle hopes the ‘A’ rating system will help spread awareness among moviegoers about how women are portrayed in films. In Bio Rio's wood-panelled lobby, students Nikolaj Gula and Vincent Fremont acknowledged that most of their favourite films probably wouldn't get an ‘A’ rating. ‘I guess it does make sense, but to me it would not influence the way I watch films because I'm not so aware about these questions,’ said Fremont, 29. One ratings test to rule them all: The Lord of the Rings trilogy has also been rated as sexist. Pictured is actress Liv Tyler, who plays the Elven beauty Arwen in the movie . At least one Hollywood star sounded excited by the idea when asked about it by The Associated Press. ‘A feminist ratings system? That's so interesting!’ actress-producer Jada Pinkett Smith said in Beverly Hills, California, where she was attending a benefit dinner for gender equality. ‘I say, hey, let's see if it works!’ The ‘A’ rating is the latest Swedish move to promote gender equality by addressing how women are portrayed in the public sphere. Sweden's advertising ombudsman watches out for sexism in that industry and reprimands companies seen as reinforcing gender stereotypes, for example by including skimpily clad women in their ads for no apparent reason other than to draw eyeballs. Since 2010, the Equalisters project has been trying to boost the number of women appearing as expert commentators in Swedish media through a Facebook page with 44,000 followers. The project has recently expanded to Finland, Norway and Italy. For some, though, Sweden's focus on gender equality has gone too far. ‘If they want different kind of movies they should produce some themselves and not just point fingers at other people,’ said Tanja Bergkvist, a physicist who writes a blog about Sweden's ‘gender madness.’ The ‘A’ rating also has been criticized as a blunt tool that doesn't actually reveal whether a movie is gender-balanced. ‘There are far too many films that pass the Bechdel test that don't help at all in making society more equal or better, and lots of films that don't pass the test but are fantastic at those things,’ said Swedish film critic Hynek Pallas. Pallas, who moved from communist Czechoslovakia to Sweden in the 1970s, also criticized the state-funded Swedish Film Institute - the biggest financier of Swedish film - for vocally supporting the project, saying a state institution should not ‘send out signals about what one should or shouldn't include in a movie.’ Research in the U.S. supports the notion that women are underrepresented on the screen and that little has changed in the past 60 years. Of the U.S. top 100 films in 2011, women accounted for 33 per cent of all characters and only 11 per cent of the protagonists, according to a study by the San Diego-based Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film. Another study, by the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania, showed the ratio of male to female characters in movies has remained at about two to one for at least six decades. That study, which examined 855 top box-office films from 1950-2006, showed female characters were twice as likely to be seen in explicit sexual scenes as males, while male characters were more likely to be seen as violent. ‘Apparently Hollywood thinks that films with male characters will do better at the box office. It is also the case that most of the aspects of movie-making - writing, production, direction, and so on - are dominated by men, and so it is not a surprise that the stories we see are those that tend to revolve around men,’ Amy Bleakley, the study's lead author, said in an email. In 2010, Kathryn Bigelow became the first woman to win the Academy Award for Best Director for The Hurt Locker. That movie - a war film about a bomb disposal team in Iraq - doesn't pass the Bechdel test .","To get an 'A' rating movies must have at least two female characters who talk to each other about something other than men .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The deadly MERS-CoV virus has spread to a third U.S. citizen and officials believe that, for the first time, the man was infected while in the United States. Officials from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control believe an Illinois man likely contracted the respiratory disease from an Indiana man, who became infected with the disease while working as a health care worker in Saudi Arabia. MERS Co-V is viral respiratory illness first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012, with about 30 percent of people who initially contracted it dying. CDC officials said the two men met on two occasions before the original patient was found to be infected with MERS Co-V, ABC News reported. Taking precautions: Dr Emily Landon, of the University of Chicago Department of Medicine, explains theCDC's current recommendations to prevent the spread of MERS, after the first U.S. case was confirmed . No treatment: This electron microscope image shows novel coronavirus particles, also known as the MERS virus, colorized in yellow. On Saturday, May 17, 2014 the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said an Illinois man has apparently picked up an infection from the only American diagnosed with a mysterious Middle East virus . Up until now, the cases of MERS have been linked to countries in the Arabian Peninsula. This virus has spread from ill people to others through close contact, such as caring for or living with an infected person . According to the CDC, the Illinois man did not develop any symptoms of the disease and didn't seek medical treatment. Most people who have been confirmed to have MERS-CoV infection developed severe acute respiratory illness, experiencing fever, coughing and shortness of breath. There is no known treatment, cure or vaccince. 'This latest development does not change CDC's current recommendations to prevent the spread of MERS,' said Dr. David Swerdlow, who is leading CDC's MERS-CoV response. 'It's possible that as the investigation continues others may also test positive for MERS-CoV infection but not get sick.' The newly reported patient actually tested negative for an active MERS infection on May 5, but a follow up blood sample tested on May 16 found that he had antibodies to the virus, suggesting he had been infected with the disease. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the people who need to be the most careful about MERS are those traveling to the Middle East, with signs like this starting to appear in U.S. airports . Hospitals in the U.S. are now preparing to treat people with MERS by having kits, such as this one, on hand. They contain robes and masks that would prevent picking up the virus . In addition to the two men in Illinois and Indiana another man in Florida was found to be infected with the disease, after traveling to Saudi Arabia as a health care provider. The outbreak of the MERS-CoV virus, which stands for Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus, has so far been concentrated in Saudi Arabia. According to the CDC as of May 16 the virus has been found in 15 countries and a total of 572 laboratory-confirmed cases have been reported. Of those infected, 173 people have died. The virus spreads from person-to-person though close contact, but might also be transmitted to humans from animals, according to the CDC.","Illinois man has become the first known person to contract MERS on American soil after meeting with an Indiana man who was infected .

"By . Mark Prigg . Researchers have revealed a newfound alien planet might be able to support life - and say it is just 16 light years away. Called Gliese 832c, it is a 'super-Earth' at least five times as massive as our planet. The researchers say it might be the closest in terms of conditions ever found - and may even have Earth-like temperatures, albeit with large seasonal shifts. Scroll down for video . An artist's impression of the potentially habitable Super-Earth Gliese 832 c against a stellar nebula background. The planet, known as Gliese 832c, lies just 16 light-years from Earth. The Milky Way galaxy is about 100,000 light-years wide; the closest star to Earth, Proxima Centauri, is 4.2 light-years away. An international team of astronomers says the exoplanet is in the star Gliese 832's 'habitable zone,' the just-right range of distances that could allow liquid water to exist on a world's surface. Gliese 832c orbits its host star every 36 days. However, the host star is a red dwarf that's much dimmer and cooler than our sun, so Gliese 832c receives about as much stellar energy as Earth does, despite orbiting much closer to its parent, researchers said. 'This makes Gliese 832 c one of the top three most Earth-like planets and the closest one to Earth of all three, a prime object for follow-up observations,' said  Abel Mendez Torres, director of the Planetary Habitability Laboratory at the University of Puerto Rico at Arecibo. 'The planet might have Earth-like temperatures, albeit with large seasonal shifts, given a similar terrestrial atmosphere.' However, other unknowns such as the bulk composition and atmosphere of the planet could make this world quite different to Earth and non-habitable, they warn. Called Gliese 832c, the new planet is a 'super-Earth' at least five times as massive as our planet. 'So far, the two planets of Gliese 832 are a scaled-down version of our own Solar System, with an inner potentially Earth-like planet and an outer Jupiter-like giant planet,' the team wrote. 'The giant planet may well played a similar dynamical role in the Gliese 832 system to that played by Jupiter in our Solar System. ' This star is already known to harbour a cold Jupiter-like planet, Gliese 832 b, discovered on 2009. The new planet, Gliese 832 c, was added to the Habitable Exoplanets Catalog along with a total of 23 objects of interest. The number of planets in the catalog has almost doubled this year alone. The Habitable Exoplanets Catalog now has 23 objects of interest including Gliese 832 c, the closest to Earth of the top three most Earth-like worlds in the catalog. A team led by Robert Wittenmyer, of the University of New South Wales in Australia, discovered Gliese 832c by noticing the tiny wobbles the planet's gravity induces in the motion of its host star. They spotted these wobbles in data gathered by three separate instruments — the University College London Echelle Spectrograph on the Anglo-Australian Telescope in Australia, the Carnegie Planet Finder Spectrograph on the Magellan II telescope in Chile and the High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS) spectrograph, which is part of the European Southern Observatory's 11.8-foot (3.6 meters) telescope at the La Silla Observatory in Chile.","The planet, known as Gliese 832c, lies just 16 light-years from Earth .

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . Harold Camping, the California preacher who used his evangelical radio ministry and thousands of billboards to broadcast the end of the world and then gave up public prophecy when his date-specific doomsdays did not come to pass, has died at age 92. Family Radio Network marketing manager Nina Romero said Harold Camping, a retired civil engineer who built a worldwide following for the nonprofit, Oakland-based ministry he founded in 1958, died at his home on Sunday. She said he had been hospitalized after falling. Camping's most widely spread prediction was that the Rapture would happen on May 21, 2011. His independent Christian media empire spent millions of dollars - some of it from donations made by followers who quit their jobs and sold all their possessions - to spread the word on more than 5,000 billboards and 20 RVs plastered with the Judgment Day message. Scroll down for video . Harold Camping, 92, died Sunday at his home after he was hospitalized following a fall . When the Judgment Day he foresaw did not materialize, the preacher revised his prophecy, saying he had been off by five months. The preacher, who suffered a stroke three weeks after the May prediction failed, said the light dawned on him that instead of the biblical Rapture in which the faithful would be swept up to the heavens, the date had instead been a ""spiritual"" Judgment Day, which placed the entire world under Christ's judgment. But after the cataclysmic event did not occur in October either, Camping acknowledged his apocalyptic prophecy had been wrong and posted a letter on his ministry's site telling his followers he had no evidence the world would end anytime soon, and wasn't interested in considering future dates. 'We realize that many people are hoping they will know the date of Christ's return,' Camping wrote in March 2012. 'We humbly acknowledge we were wrong about the timing.' Camping graduated from the University of California, Berkeley in 1942 and started a construction business shortly after the end of World War II, according to his nonprofit's website. For decades, Camping and his family attended the Christian Reformed Church, where he served as an elder and Bible teacher, but he left the church in 1988 when he felt it no longer faithfully represented biblical teachings, associates said. Camping's claim that the world would end on May 21, 2011 was broadcast around the globe. When doomsday didn't come, he gave up public prophecy . He formed his Family Stations ministry in 1958 and eventually sold his business to become the group's president and general manager as a full-time volunteer. In 1961, Camping began hosting the Open Forum program, which was broadcast in 30 languages online and on a network of more than 140 domestic and international radio stations owned by Family Stations. Each weeknight, Camping would transmit his own biblical interpretations in a quivery monotone, clutching a worn Bible as he took listeners' calls. He first predicted the world would end on September 6, 1994 and when it did not, Camping said it was off because of a mathematical error. Followers later said he was referring to the end of 'the church age,' a time when human beings in Christian churches could be saved. After his billboards warning of pending doom popped up across the country in 2010 and 2011, Christian leaders from across the spectrum widely dismissed his prophecies while atheists and revelers poked fun at his prediction. Some also criticized Camping's use of millions of dollars in followers' donations to advertise Judgment Day. Camping had millions of followers around the world, many of whom sold off or gave away their possessions in anticipation of the Rapture . 'We're not in the business of financial advice,' he said shortly after the failed May 2011 prediction. 'We're in the business of telling people there's someone who you can maybe talk to, maybe pray to, and that's God.' Camping also offered a measured apology, adding that he felt so terrible when his prophecy did not come true that he left home and took refuge in a motel with his wife. 'If people want me to apologize, I can apologize,' he said in response to questions about some listeners' decision to give away their possessions in anticipation of the Rapture. 'I pray all the time for wisdom.' Camping wrote about 30 books and booklets over the years, many from his modest brick home in Alameda, a leafy Oakland suburb. Family Radio Network said in its statement that he is survived by a wife of 71 years. 'We know that each of us remain in God's hand, and God is the One who knows our appointed time to leave our earthly body behind,' the statement said.","Harold Camping convinced thousands of followers around the world that Rapture was coming May 21, 2011 .

"By . Alex Greig . A former police officer is being investigated by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement after he allegedly used police resources to carry out an illicit affair. Shaun Whiting quit his job at the Ocoee Police Department after his affair was discovered and before he could be disciplined. The department now wants to revoke his certification to ensure he can never be a police officer in the state again. On the job: Shaun Whiting carried out an affair with a married woman while on duty with the Ocoee police department . WFTV reports that Whiting, who is married, met the woman with whom he carried out the alleged affair during a call for service at a grocery store. The two began communicating via email and cell phone. The woman, also married, told police that she booked a hotel room and told Whiting to come while on duty. He told her he needed to be accounted for, and instructed her to make a fake 911 call so that he could be dispatched to the hotel to investigate. WFTV says the woman later requested a ride-along for the woman which was approved by the department. The two ended up in a police substation where the woman performed a sex act on Whiting while he was in uniform and on duty. New career: Investigators want to revoke his certification so that he can never be a police officer in Florida again . Whiting was a respected officer on the Ocoee force for four years before he resigned in disgrace to avoid the affair becoming public. He is the father of two young children. The affair was eventually exposed when the woman's husband discovered the betrayal and went to police. The case will go before the Florida Department of Law Enforecement board in three weeks time.","Married former cop Shaun Whiting allegedly carried on an affair while on duty with the Ocoee police department .

"By . James  Nye . Texas singer and songwriter Steven Fromholz has died in a hunting accident when a rifle fell and discharged . Singer-songwriter Steven Fromholz, who was named poet laureate of Texas in 2007 and who rose to fame writing songs for artists such as Willie Nelson has died in a freak hog hunting accident. The 68-year-old died on Sunday at a ranch near Eldorado, after the rifle he was carrying slipped out of its case, hit the ground and accidently discharged, . The respected musician was with his girlfriend at the time of the shooting and died on Sunday afternoon after being rushed to hospital for urgent medical attention. Famed for writing 'I'd Have To Be Crazy', which was covered by Willie Nelson, Fromholz also produced and wrote songs for Lylde Lovett - the country music singer once married to Oscar winning actress Julia Roberts. He was officially named at the Lone Star state's poet laureate by Governor Rick Perry in 2007 and was partly responsible for turning Austin into a live music capital for Texas. 'Steven Fromholz and his work will be remembered, enjoyed and studied as music and literature forever,' Lovett said about his friend to The Houston Chronicle. Fromholz, a Temple native, was part (and president) of the legendary Folk Music Club during his days at North Texas State in the early 1960s and wrote songs for Lyle Lovett (pictured left with Fromholz) 'His insight into human nature was equaled only by his ability to write about it in such detail that he made his listeners feel as if they were standing in the shoes of his characters, seeing what they saw, feeling what they felt.' Fromolz was born in Temple, Texas and attended North Texas State before he enlisted in the Navy.After he left the service he moved to California where he began to write poetry and was enamored with the folk music scene that grew up in the 1960s. He formed the duo Frummox with Dan McCrimmon in Colorado and released his album, Here to There - which included his widely recognized masterpiece, Texas Trilogy. The Schleicher County Sheriff's Office on Monday said the accident happened at the Flying B Ranch near Eldorado, about 40 miles south of San Angelo. Fromholz was 68 . In addition to his work as a poet and songwriter, Fromholz also worked as a river guide in Big Bend - telling stories to tourists as they navigated the popular stretch of water. He drew renewed attention in 1998 when Lovett covered Texas Trilogy as well as Fromholz's playful Bears. Fromholz, also had a decades-long partnership with Nelson, and was a frequent performer at Nelson's 'Willie Nelson Picnic' concerts which have taken place off and on around July Fourth for the past forty years. Fromholz, (pictured here in 1970) was hunting with his girlfriend. A rifle was in a case but unzipped at the bottom. The gun was being transferred from one vehicle to another. Police says Fromholz grabbed the handle, the gun partly fell, hit the ground and discharged . The Schleicher County Sheriff's Office on Monday said the accident happened at the Flying B Ranch near Eldorado, about 40 miles south of San Angelo. Fromholz was 68. Chief Deputy George Ariste says Fromholz was shot Sunday afternoon and died at a hospital in Eldorado.","Texan music legend Steven Fromholz dies in tragic shooting accident while hog hunting near his home .

"By . Tom Gardner . China's economic growth has fallen to a 14-year low - adding pressure on the government to implement sweeping reforms. The world's second-largest economy grew by 7.7 per cent over the past year, down from previous quarter's 7.8 per cent, data showed today. While the data has disappointed markets, the figures far outstrip U.S. output which rose by 4.1 per cent and dwarfs Britain's 0.8 per cent rise between July and September. Slowdown: China's economy is growing at the slowest rate for 14 years . Growth for the full year was 7.7 per cent, tying 2012 for the weakest annual performance since 1999. Those figures appeared to mask a much sharper deterioration during the three months ending in December. Factory output, exports and investment all weakened. On a quarter-to-quarter basis, economic growth dropped to 1.8 percent from the previous period's 2.2 per cent. 'The economy is slowing quite rapidly. The slowdown has accelerated during the quarter,' said economist Dariusz Kowalczyk of Credit Agricole CIB. That weakness might force Beijing to resort to state-led investment to support an expansion. That would boost debt levels that already have prompted unease about the health of China's financial system and could hamper efforts to shift to more self-sustaining growth based on domestic consumption. Economic pressure: The Chinese government has highlighted the importance of an efficient rural economy as the country's economy begins to slow down . China's growth still is far stronger than the United States, Japan or Europe. Nearly two-thirds of Chinese millionaires have emigrated or plan to leave the country in search of better quality of life abroad, new research shows. One third of the country's super rich - who are worth more than $16million - have already left, according to the report by Hurun, a wealth research firm that focuses on China. The flight is put down to people looking to give their children better educations, get away from pollution and overcrowding. But the mega-rich are also making efforts to keep their fortunes away from the Chinese state which is cracking down on tax loopholes. One estimated suggests that $658 billion is stashed in offshore assets. But an unexpectedly abrupt decline from the double-digit rates of the previous decade has raised the risk of politically dangerous job losses and increases the challenges faced by the ruling Communist Party as it tries to rebalance the economy away from reliance on trade and investment. 'A long-term accumulation of problems has yet to ease and the foundation for economic stabilization and recovery is still consolidating,' said the commissioner of the government statistics bureau, Ma Jiantang, at a news conference. A plunge in global demand for Chinese exports prompted Beijing to launch a mini-stimulus in mid-2013 based on higher spending on railway construction and other public works. Growth accelerated from 7.5 percent in the three months ending in June to 7.8 percent the next quarter but settled back as the effect of Beijing's spending faded. Since then, Chinese leaders have said there is little that additional stimulus can do to spur growth and improvements will have to come from longer-term reforms. Reform: Chinese authorities are planning a swathe of rural reforms, developing modern agriculture and maintaining agriculture as the foundation of the national economy . Healthy crop: China's economy grew 7.7 per cent year on year in 2013, reached 56.8845 trillion yuan - but still provoked calls for the government to reform . The International Monetary Fund has forecast this year's growth at 7.6 percent but private sector forecasts are as low as 7.2 percent. That would be China's weakest performance since 1990, when the economy grew by just 3.8 percent. A development blueprint issued by the party leadership in November promises to open state-dominated industries wider to private and foreign competition and to give entrepreneurs who generate most of China's growth and jobs a bigger economic role. However, it stressed that state ownership would remain a pillar of the economy. The plan promises to allow foreign companies into industries such as e-commerce, accounting and logistics and to give Chinese entrepreneurs more opportunities. Regulators announced this month they will allow the creation of five privately financed banks this year. But such changes could take years to show an impact on China's economic output. More reliance on investment financed by government borrowing might add to strains on a financial system some analysts say could already be carrying dangerously high debt levels. Economic powerhouse: China's slowdown is sending shock waves across many of the world's mayor economies who rely on trade with the country . Heavy spending by Chinese cities and other local governments as part of Beijing's stimulus in response to the 2008 global crisis and on social programs since then left them heavily indebted. An official audit released at the end of December showed the amount owed by cities and other local governments soared 70 percent over the past three years to 17.7 trillion yuan ($2.9 trillion) as of mid-2013. The central bank has said the debt level is manageable but private sector analysts warn the rapid pace of increase is dangerous. Growth for 2013 came in above the government's 7.5 percent official target but data showed many areas of the economy slowing toward the end of the year. Time for change: The Chinese government issued a policy document that underscores the importance of rural reforms, developing modern agriculture and maintaining agriculture as the foundation of the national economy . Growth in factory output slowed to 9.7 percent in December from 10.3 percent in October, the first month of the quarter. Investment in factories, real estate and other fixed assets decelerated to 17.1 percent from 19.4 percent over the same period. Growth in retail sales was steady but full-year retail sales growth of 13.1 percent was well below the 19.6 percent growth of investment, highlighting China's reliance on spending on factories, highways and other assets. 'There is no rebalancing yet. Basically investment continues to be the key driver,' said Kowalczyk. Analysts also noted that household income growth, though relatively strong at 9.7 percent last year, was lower than in previous years. That, coupled with an impending contraction of China's workforce as the population ages, will hamper efforts to promote consumer spending. 'We estimate that the share of household consumption in GDP fell again in 2013,' said RBS economist Louis Kuijs in a report.","World's second largest economy grew as the slowest rate since 1999 .

"By . Simon Tomlinson . Thirty drug smugglers have been sentenced to death in Vietnam for trafficking more than 12 tons of heroin in the communist country's largest-ever narcotics case. The 21 men and nine women, all Vietnamese, were found guilty of drug trafficking, while a further 59 defendants were handed sentences ranging up to life in prison. Each appeared flanked by two police officers at the mass trial in Quang Ninh province, which was held in the yard of a detention centre, rather than a courtroom. 'This was Vietnam's largest ever trial in terms of defendants, the number of death penalties given out and the amount of heroin involved,' presiding judge Ngo Duc said after the verdict was read out in the northern province of Quang Ninh - which borders China. Justice en masse: Some 89 defendants are each flanked by two police officers as they are sentenced for heroin smuggling after Vietnam's biggest-ever drugs trial . 'Because . of the large number of defendants and the seriousness of the case, the . trial was held at the prison,' Mr Duc added after the 17-day trial. Investigators . said the defendants belonged to four international smuggling rings . responsible for trafficking heroin and other drugs from neighbouring . Laos into Vietnam and China since 2006. 'All . the defendants are Vietnamese and most of them came from Vietnam's . northwestern provinces,' court clerk Nguyen Trung Hieu told AFP. Vietnam's . remote northwestern region, which borders both China and Laos, is poor . and populated by a patchwork of ethnic minority groups. There have been previous smuggling cases in the area, which is far from the control of Hanoi. According . to a list of the defendants' names seen by AFP, some of the 89 people . were from ethnic minority groups but court officials could not confirm . their status. Facing lethal injection: Judges condemned 30 people to death for their part in trafficking the 12-ton haul . One of the leaders of the four smuggling rings broken up by the police remains at large, state media reported. Police disrupted the rings in August 2013, making mass arrests and seizing large quantities of illegal drugs. They also confiscated 20 luxury cars and dozens of guns and other weapons during the raid, state media reported. Communist Vietnam has some of the world's toughest anti-drug laws. Anyone . found guilty of possessing more than 600 grams (21 ounces) of heroin, . or more than 20 kilograms of opium, can face the death penalty. Convictions and sentences are usually revealed only by local media, which is strictly under state control. Thirteen received life in jail and 46 were given either prison terms of up to 20 years, or warnings, the government said in a statement on its Internet site . The . 'Golden Triangle' region covering part of Laos, Thailand and Myanmar . was formerly one of the world's top producers of opium and heroin but . has been overtaken by Afghanistan. After . a two-year hiatus in carrying out capital punishment due to problems . procuring chemicals for lethal injections, Vietnam executed its first . prisoner by the method last August. The country currently now has more than 700 prisoners on death row, according to media reports and an AFP tally. Many . have been sentenced for drug offences including dozens of foreigners - . although it has been decades since a foreign citizen was executed. Although . Vietnam does not release statistics on executions, rights group Amnesty . International recorded 86 new death sentences in 2012 while it said . five executions were carried out the previous year. Amnesty . said it was 'dismayed' to learn about the sentences, which come on top . of recent death sentences handed out in high-profile corruption and . embezzlement cases. 'Amnesty . International opposes the death penalty in all cases, without . exception,' Rupert Abbott, its researcher on Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam, . told AFP. 'Rather than . continuing to hand down death sentences, the Vietnamese authorities . should be moving towards abolition, in line with the global trend,' he . added. Due to problems with . both procuring and producing domestically the chemicals required for . lethal injections, some lawmakers have called for a return to executions . by firing squad.","A total of 89 defendants convicted of smuggling heroin from 2006 to 2012 .

"By . Associated Press . A 17-year-old who shot two classmates got the gun only moments before from an ex-student who bypassed metal detectors as a 'guest' at the Philadelphia charter school, police said on Monday. Video footage shows the former Delaware Valley Charter High School student, 18-year-old Donte Walker, handing off the gun and exchanging money with an unidentified male on Friday afternoon inside the school gym. The gun then was passed to Raisheem Rochwell, who feared he was going to be targeted in an after-school assault, Lt. John Stanford said. Raisheem Rochwell, 17, charged with aggravated assault, reckless endangerment and firearms offenses after the shooting at the Philadelphia school . Within minutes, Rochwell shot the two classmates in their arms, police said. 'I would think it would be required for anyone coming into the school to go through the metal detectors. You have children's lives at stake here,' said Stanford, a department spokesman. Police believe the victims, an 18-year-old female and a 17-year-old male, were struck by the same bullet. The male student spent two days in the hospital but both have been treated and released. Rochwell was being held on aggravated assault and other charges. His lawyer insisted over the weekend that he will be vindicated. Two Philadelphia Police Department officers stand across the street from the Delaware Valley Charter High School where two students were shot and sustained non-life threatening wounds in a shooting in the schools cafeteria in Philadelphia on January 17 . Rochwell 'is not the person who will ultimately be responsible for this act,' said lawyer Amato Sanita, who added that anything that may have happened was not 'intentional'. His client remained in custody on $500,000 bond, with a preliminary hearing scheduled for February 6. School officials did not immediately . return a call for comment on Monday, when the school was closed for the . Martin Luther King Jr. Day holiday. The school will resume classes on . Tuesday. Police said they . were working with school officials to identify the person who paid for . the gun, but were proceeding slowly after the wrong student was arrested .

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie says he's 'readier' to be president than he was a few years ago and has hit back at claims he knew about Bridgegate as 'ridiculous' and 'arrogant.' He claimed in a softball interview conducted by Yahoo! News on Friday that the hardball experience of learning about incriminating emails sent by his deputy chief of staff, Bridget Kelly, was 'completely disorienting, like I got hit across the forehead with a 2x4.' Pressure on Christie has intensified in the last week as his political and campaign offices and 18 aides and political appointees received subpoenas for documents related to the George Washington Bridge fiasco. And Fort Lee mayor Mark Sokolich isn't the only Democratic city official to take pot shots at the Republican governor. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Dirty politics: Christie appeared with Hoboken Mayor Dawn Zimmer (L) following Superstorm Sandy. She now claims she was told aid cash would be cut off unless she gave support to a controversial development . Offensive: Christie's Lt. Gov. today branded Zimmer's claims 'completely false' and 'illogical' before she met volunteers during the Dr Martin Luther King Jr National Day in Union Beach, New Jersey . Christie's lieutenant governor, Kim Guadagno, was forced to defend herself Monday against claims from Hoboken Mayor Dawn Zimmer that she and Christie held Hurricane Sandy relief money hostage, pressuring her to green-light a commercial development plan in her city. Guadagno held a brief news conference where she read a statement calling Zimmer's claims 'completely false' and 'illogical.', but then refused to take questions from reporters. Zimmer fired back almost immediately. 'I am genuinely disappointed that . Lieutenant Governor Guadagno has lived up to her promise that she would . deny linking Hoboken's application for Sandy hazard mitigation funding . with expediting a private development project,' she said. A day before Zimmer made her stunning claim, the governor addressed the bridge scandal in his Yahoo! interview with uninterrupted soliloquies seemingly rife with talking points. Asked to explain how Kelly, one of his closest advisers, could have carried out the bridge traffic scheme without his knowledge, he insisted that he didn't know what she was up to on a day-to-day basis. 'Now I understand that people say, well ... this is someone in your office,' he said. But 'if someone doesn’t tell you the truth, there is often very little you can do in reaction to that.' Threat: Zimmer wrote in her diary that Guadagno: 'Pulls me aside and says that I need to move forward with the Rockefeller project. It's very important to the governor... the word is that you are against it...and you need to move forward or we are not going to be able to help you' Christie has said he and the Hoboken mayor have had a good relationship, but her journal outlines a governor-endorsed plan to use Sandy funds as political leverage -- something his administration flatly denies . Referring to banking giant JP . Morgan's loss of $ billion in 2012 by a rogue trader a continent away, . Christie compared himself to the bank's CEO. 'How . could Jamie Dimon not have known about a trade that was being put on by . a trader in London? Well, you know, I think it’s fairly safe to say . that Jamie Dimon didn’t know that a trade was being put on, and that . when people lied about it, he didn’t know they were lying. ... So I . think that’s a ridiculous criticism and kind of an ignorant one.' A . sighing Christie reflected, first to Yahoo and then later on Twitter: . 'I'm trying to get my arms around an awful situation, and understand it, . and then address it, and then resolve it.' But the governor told Yahoo that he's better prepared to be president than he was a few years ago. 'Yeah. I’m readier, if that’s a word,' Christie said. Christie . may soon have to personally address and resolve the possibility that . his lieutenant governor's interactions with Zimmer took on the flavor of . political blackmail in the months following Superstorm Sandy. Zimmer said Saturday that she had met with federal prosecutors and provided copies of her journal showing that Lieutenant Gov. Guadagno pressured her to approve a real estate development favored by Christie, saying Sandy relief dollars won't flow to Hoboken until she did. 'She pulls me aside and says that I need to move forward with the Rockefeller project. It’s very important to the governor,' Zimmer recalled in her journal. 'The word is that you are against it and you need to move forward or we are not going to be able to help you.' 'She wrote at the time that Guadagno promised: 'If you tell anyone I said it, I will deny it.' 'She said that to me – is that this is a direct message from the Governor,' Zimmer said on CNN's 'State of the Union' program. 'Readier' to be president: Despite the taint of scandal from multiple directions, Christie insists he's politically on track . A stretch? Christie said keeping tabs on Bridget Kelly, a senior aide in his Trenton, N.J. office, was as difficult as JP Morgan's CEO in New York staying on top of a security trader's activity in London . In . a statement later, she said she would be willing to 'testify under oath . about the facts of what happened when the Lieutenant Governor came to . Hoboken and told me that Sandy aid would be contingent on moving forward . with a private development project.' Guadagno – among the few top figures . in the Christie administration to remain untainted by the bridge scandal . – responded on Monday at a Martin Luther King Jr. holiday service . project. 'Mayor Zimmer's . version of our conversation in May of 2013 is not only false but is . illogical and does not withstand scrutiny when all of the facts are . examined,' she said. 'Any suggestion that Sandy funds were tied to the approval of any project in New Jersey is completely false.' 'I deny any suggestion made by Mayor Zimmer that there was ever any condition on the release of Sandy funds by me,' she added during her brief statement to the press. Zimmer shot back, saying she was 'genuinely disappointed.' The slow drip of percolating scandals surrounding Christie now seems to be an impediment to what was considered an easy road to the top tier of Republican presidential hopefuls just a few months ago. Christie aides told The New York Times that an overseas trip planned to boost his foreign policy bona fides was still 'to be determined.' Matt Mowers, Christie's man in New Hampshire, the state party leader who formerly served on his re-election campaign staff, is himself under subpoena. And former Republcian National Committee chairman Michael Steele criticized the governor for jetting to Palm Beach, Florida for a fundraising trial balloon as subpoenas flew out of a majority-Democratic legislative committee in his state capitol. 'They dropped 20 subpoenas on him, and so now that’s baggage that’s going to come into the conversation,' he said. MSNBC, the most liberal of U.S. cable . news networks, broke the Zimmer story, devoting much of its weekend . coverage to the brewing episode. Christie . spokesman Colin Reed, who is under subpoena himself in the bridge . scandal, said Saturday that 'it's very clear partisan politics are at . play here as Democratic mayors with a political ax to grind come out of . the woodwork and try to get their faces on television' 'MSNBC . is a partisan network that has been openly hostile to Governor . Christie,' he said, 'and almost gleeful in their efforts attacking him.'","New Jersey's governor sits for softball interview, claims he couldn't have known what senior staffers were up to in bridge traffic scandal .

"By . Joshua Gardner . and Ap . Another bone chilling polar plunge is coming for much of the Midwest and Northeast by Tuesday and along with painfully low temperatures will come some of the heaviest snow in years for some areas. Millions of people from Washington, DC to Long Island can expect to get out their snow shovels and heaviest winter wardrobes tomorrow as precipitation and wind chills well below zero move from the nation's interior out towards the East Coast and the nation's capital, where residents can expect what could be the most snow since an historic blizzard hit in January 2011. Light snow was already falling Monday afternoon across much of the Great Lakes and down through the Ohio River Valley, but the real headaches and potential dangers will come by evening as residents in Minnesota will experience -20F temperatures and it won't get much higher than the teens south to Virginia, through the Northeast and into New England by Tuesday. Just the start: Monday night's bitter chills in the northern plains region were expected to be as low as -31 in parts of Minnesota and the weather pattern that makes such temperature possible was expected to move east over New England and Mid-Atlantic . A drop in temperatures is expected on Tuesday night as another polar plunge hits the nation . The Midwest, Southeast and Northeast can expect another treacherous few days of uncomfortably low temperatures . 'The cold may be intense enough to cause school closings, frozen pipes and water main breaks,' according to AccuWeather.com meteorologist Alex Sosnowski. 'Heating systems may struggle to keep up, people will spend more money keeping their homes and businesses warm and ice will again build up on area rivers.' Highs will generally range from the teens to lower 20s, and the cold spell could extend as far south as the Gulf states such as Florida, which saw the lowest temperatures of the year so far on Sunday. The snow is expected to intensify as it moves past the Appalachians beginning Tuesday and mountainous areas in the region can expect an accumulation of 6 inches or so. But it's areas to the north and east that can expect to bear the brunt of the storm. Meteorologists said on Monday that snowfall in the capital had the potential to outdo the winter storm of January 2011, when five inches fell . Intensifying: From Virginia to New England, residents were told Monday to expect the snow already dusting the Midwest to intensify as the fast-moving storm moved across the Appalachians in hit the moist Atlantic coast through Tuesday . 'Even though the storm is coming during the day Tuesday, Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Roanoke and Richmond, Virginia, Dover, Delaware, Philadelphia, New York City, and Atlantic City, New Jersey, will have enough snow to shovel and plow,' Accuweather's Brian Wimer said. The southern extent of the precipitation can expect to see the most accumulation. 'For Washington, D.C.,' said Wimer, 'this could be the biggest storm since Jan. 26, 2011, when about 5 inches of snow fell.' Lows are expected to remain in the subzero range on Tuesday night. While New England could see highs of about 20 on Wednesday, the upper Midwest probably won't see temperatures above the teens. While the winter blast is expected to . be gone by Thursday, meteorologists predict it'll be followed by . another blast of cold air pushing down from Canada on Friday or Saturday. Snow . is possible as far south as Greenville, South Carolina and Reliegh, . North Carolina on Tuesday as the extent of the precipitation hits its . peak into the afternoon and later. These areas can expect up to an inch of snow by evening. To . the Southwest of the arctic chills, Americans in California and . adjoining regions can expect continued problems from the historic . drought already plaguing the region. Life will get slightly better as temperatures rise on Wednesday during the day and the arctic plunge begins to rise back toward Canada . Lingering: Wednesday night won't be a whole lot warmer than the previous two nights, unfortunately . Third time's the charm? The polar chill will start to ease up by Wednesday, when temperatures in much of the Midwest and East were expected to be closer closer to normal. However, a third bitter arctic blast of the season was expected by the weekend . Overall, temperatures Thursday will be warmer than the previous few days, however a return of the dreaded polar plunge is expected by weekend . The state is in a period of extended dry weather compounded in Southern California by repeated periods of the regional Santa Anas, dry and powerful winds that blow from the interior toward the coast, pushing back the normal flow of moist ocean air and raising temperatures to summerlike levels. The dry conditions statewide led Gov. Jerry Brown to formally declare a drought Friday in order to seek a . range of federal assistance. The . statewide water content was about 20 percent of average for this time . of year. The snow water equivalent on Thursday was just 17 percent of . normal for the day. Satellite photos taken this week of the Sierra . Nevada snowpack - an important source of water come spring - shows a . skinny snake of white in a stark brown landscape. On the same day last . year, the region was a fluffy, swirling blanket of white. Elsewhere: While spared from the bitter winter chills, the Southwest and much of California remained in the midst of one of the worst droughts in history. Here, Leon Stout, of Orland shows the area that was once Black Butte Lake . Comparison: Satellite images from over California in 2013 (left) and 2014 (right) show the lack of snowfall and parched land of this year's drought-plagued winter versus last year's . Paired with record heat, the conditions have also helped lead to a ring of fierce wildfires around Los Angeles. The Los Angeles County Fire Department said the fire was 78 percent contained by Sunday, with full containment expected Wednesday. The California Conference of Catholic Bishops asked people of all faiths to join in prayers for rain. Sacramento Bishop Jaime Soto, president of the bishops' conference, suggested a prayer for God to 'open the heavens and let His mercy rain down upon our fields and mountains.' He suggested prayers for relief and for the wellbeing of those most at risk from a water shortage. Mosques in the Central Valley also prayed for rain earlier this month.","The Midwest will get hit by frigid temperatures return starting Monday as the Polar Vortex's little brother forces wind chills past -10F .

"By . Lizzie Parry . Avian flu experiments risk unleashing an accidental global pandemic putting the lives of millions across the world at risk, public health experts have today warned. Scientists are taking part in controversial tests to create and manipulate strains of bird flu to try and understand how they evolve into more dangerous forms and pass between different species. But public health experts at Havard and Yale universities in the U.S. have warned the experiments, which aim to track mutation in a bid to better protect against them, pose a risk to the public, if the strains are released accidentally or deliberately. The report, published on Tuesday, saw experts argue that the dangers of conducting the Potential Pandemic Pathogens tests far outweigh the benefits. A study has claimed experiments into new strains of bird flu pose a risk to public health if the virus is accidentally released, unleashing a global pandemic (file picture) Havard professor of epidemiology Marc Lipstitch and Yale professor Alison Galvani collaborated on the study Ethical Alternatives To Experiments with Novel Potential Pandemic Pathogens', that appeared in journal PLoS Medicine. The pair have called for greater scrutiny of such experiments, urging countries across the world to consider an international agreement on the potential risks. Lipstitch and Galvani's research state the 'dangers are not just hypothetical', citing the theory that the H1N1 influenza strain responsible for 'significant morbidity and mortality around the world from 1977 to 2009 is thought to have originated from a laboratory accident'. The report adds: 'There is a quantifiable possibility that these novel pathogens could be accidentally or deliberately released.' The study estimates that in the type of containment labs these experiments are carried out in, the number of laboratory-associated infections occur at a rate of two per 1,000 laboratory years in the U.S. Lipstitch and Galvani say a moderate research programme involving 10 laboratories over a decade would run a 20 per cent risk of at least one instance when an infection is released, risking the threat of it spreading across the world. The report said: 'The probability that a . laboratory-acquired influenza infection would lead to extensive spread . has been estimated to be at least 10 per cent. The report, published on Tuesday, saw experts argue that the dangers of conducting the Potential Pandemic Pathogens tests far outweigh the benefits. Picture shows a strain of avian flu . 'Simple branching process models . suggest a probability of an outbreak arising from an accidental . influenza infection in the range of 5 per cent to 60 per cent.' The report comes after a U.S. biosecurity panel ruled in 2012 that two separate studies on mutant bird flu were too dangerous to publish, the Guardian reported. The studies revealed new mutant strains that spread among ferrets - a proxy for humans. The panel was concerned the recipe for the influenza strain could fall into the hands of bioterrorists. The authors of the research - which was eventually published months later - Ron Fouchier at Erasmus medical centre in Rotterdam, and Yoshihiro Kawaoka at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, criticised Tuesday's report. They said their work had full ethical, safety and security approval, Ian Sample at the Guardian reports. Kawaoka said: 'The authors imply that gain-of-function studies are going on without proper reviews. 'This is not so and suggests they do not understand how highly regulated this work is and the approvals and planning required to conduct this research. 'This commentary lists many experiments they think we should be doing. We are doing many of those experiments already.'","New report was compiled by experts at Havard and Yale universities .

"By . Bel Mooney . Yesterday, my baby son reached the grand old age of 40. How did that happen? You know, one minute you're looking at your first child and wondering what to do with 'it' - and the next you're watching him blow out a very large number of candles. We've been through a lot together, my boy and I and, in truth, I owe the greatest gift of my life to him. All of us read a lot (too much?) about the stresses and strains of motherhood, about mums who feel bored by the chores and long to get back to work. Fathers and mothers are rightly concerned about what they can and should teach their children, and manuals for parenthood proliferate on the shelves. Birthday boy: Bel Mooney with her son Daniel on his 40th . But what of those instinctive lessons our babies teach us? It was my Daniel who taught me how to be a mother before he could speak - and I rejoice that those lessons in love have never ended. I'd be lying if I said I wanted to be pregnant. In fact, when I got the news, I felt like a plane that had been hijacked and was heading for an unknown, scary destination. Back in 1973, I'd been married to my first husband, Jonathan, for five years already but was enjoying my life as a journalist-about-town, wild at heart and eager to pack a bag and travel when the story needed it. I'd never held a baby and didn't want to. When I discovered I was pregnant, and on the hunt for tips, I watched my sister-in-law change her daughter Kate's nappy. I thought the whole business daunting and revolting in equal measure. Refusing to acknowledge what was happening, I took risks. Though pregnant, I still took a job as a presenter at the first British commercial radio station, LBC. Reluctant mother: But Bel embraced her role once Daniel arrived . It was very chaotic and I'd never presented a live radio show before, but I accepted the stress because I refused to give in to the changes in my body. Not for me relaxing into pregnancy: I drank wine because nobody told me not to, and stayed up as late as I ever had. How stupid I was! Unhappy, exhausted and irresponsible, I felt entirely unready for motherhood. Then it happened. The everyday miracle. Dan was born on January 8, 1974, weighing just 4lb 13oz. With his low birth weight and jaundice, he was in the Special Care Unit, keeping me (somewhat weepy) in hospital for 12 days. I believed it was all my fault, but remember wanting to do everything for him. I surprised myself, confidently bathing his tiny slippery limbs as if I'd been doing it all my life. Or perhaps the bookish girl turned tough-talking lady journalist had actually been practising in her dreams for the role that fitted with surprising ease. 'Nobody ever tells you how hard it is to bring up a child - and how anything that goes wrong feels entirely your fault' I fell in love with my son in a way . that was entirely new. You've loved your parents and then that First . Love and then the man you married... but nothing like this! The apricot . smell of Dan's head melted my heart into a different shape, like wax in . the hands of an artist. Alone . for much of the time, because my husband's job as a television reporter . took him far away for weeks on end, I became fascinated by nappies, . bottles and baby clothes. Each . day I would put Dan in his carrycot and push him all the way across . Clapham Common simply to visit the good chemist and pore over dummies . and jingling toys. Who would have thought it? I'm . not saying I never chafed, never wished I could meet friends to smoke . and drink too much in a Fleet Street pub in the old way, never wanted to . kick over the traces and be free. Of course I did. But the rebellious . voice was drowned by the coos and cries of my son. I felt somehow that I . was getting it right with him - and that seemed as great an achievement . as my degree or my first big byline in a national paper. His ready smiles were my reward, his first word - 'Mumma' - like music. Even though I was unavoidably living like a single mother a lot of the time, thanks to my husband's job, and missed him terribly (he was as besotted with our son as I), I discovered that a baby can be a real companion. Some days it felt like just Dan and me against the world. He was my consolation, too. In November 1975 I gave birth to my second son, who was stillborn after a long, grim labour. I'd been hospitalised for two or three weeks and so my parents had taken Dan. When my mother arrived after I had been released, I sobbed to her: 'I want my baby.' At that very moment, Dan, who was not yet two, toddled into the room and his face lit up as he said, 'Mummy!' with an air of purest wonder. 'Here is your baby,' said my mother. And so he was. But nobody ever tells you how hard it is to bring up a child - and how anything that goes wrong feels entirely your fault. Devoted: Bel with her son when he was aged five . I look back over the years of the adorable, smiling, trouble-free baby, the sweet little boy, the insecure 12-year-old who was so helpful at home - and wonder how he became that rebellious teenager and even more wayward young man. Gosh, they put you through it! My beloved baby became a wild, bad, lazy creature and behaved appallingly at one time, yet somehow or other he'd deliver that enormous grin and careless apology, and be forgiven. As the mothers of East End gangsters might say: 'My boy was always good to 'is muvver.' Not academic at all, he dropped out of university with various problems and this was a very tough time indeed, but his father and I were determined he shouldn't feel a failure. So he did a chef's course, which led in time to a trial as a runner on the television programme Ready Steady Cook. Willing to take on the most mundane tasks with that ready grin, Dan worked his way up the ladder to become a producer-director, working with Jamie Oliver among others. Oh yes, mothers remember all the anxiety and some of the heartbreak, too; you can still remember the anguish at failed relationships; you can wax sentimental over treasured keepsakes yet still feel a spurt of angry frustration at his wasted chances and poor judgment. I can still feel irritated by his failings, like his inability to give up nicotine, but he is still impossible to be angry with . But then you realise that all those stages created the whole person, transforming him into the man he is. And when my marriage broke up in 2003 it was my children who shared the grief and offered the most comfort. They took care of me - and that doesn't come from nowhere. That's a result of the whole miraculous process of mothering: the learning and loving that is a two-way street. Therefore, I would change nothing. Sometimes I tell Dan I am proud of him, and he looks amused and disbelieving as he wonders why. It's because he's always had the courage to remake his life - earning the love of a wonderful girl (now his wife) and becoming a devoted father, even though he once told me he didn't want children. Through the years: Mother and son when Daniel was 17 . When he realised that his life at the sharp end of TV was harming him and possibly his new relationship, he came up with a brilliant idea for reinvention. Passionate about VWs and food in equal measure, he located a very rare 1964 ice cream van and set up his own business. Now he and his wife are the Splitscreen Ice Cream Company, living a carefree but hardworking life serving delicious ice-cream at festivals, events and weddings, and expanding each year. And 40 years after that baby boy took over my life, he is still making demands. We share space at home, since he and his wife and baby son live next door to us in the countryside outside Bath. I have to tolerate his growing fleet of vehicles, just as I once had to put up with the toy cars that littered the house. I can still feel irritated by his failings, like his inability to give up nicotine, but he is still impossible to be angry with. And, hearing the ice clink into the bucket and the corks pop, I know he is still the person with whom, apart from his sister Kitty, I most like to party. What more can a mother say? So happy birthday, Dan - and thanks for teaching me so much. And for the fun.","Bel hadn't planned to fall pregnant .

But take a closer look and you’ll see a second community of critters – one that hides away in the darkness among rocks, corals and seaweed. With camouflage as their main defence, these creatures are masters of disguise, capable of transforming their colour and shape whenever danger lurks nearby. A pygmy seahorse is shown here blending in with the fan coral it lives on. The image was taken by British photographer Ed Brown in Indonesia. The area is known for having the best 'muck diving' in the world . Berkshire-based photographer, Ed Brown, has been able to capture this incredible sea life in action during his recent visit to the Lembeh Strait in Indonesia. The area is well-known for something known as muck diving, which gets its name from the sediment that lies at the bottom of muck dive sites. ‘Muck diving can be characterised by the black sand and general bleakness of the seabed,’ explained Mr Brown. A crinoid squat lobster, also known as feather star squat lobster or elegant squat lobster, is pictured here. These small crabs that live among the arms of crinoids, often taking on the colours of their host to camouflage themselves further from predators. During the day, they use this camouflage to hide among the arms or feet of the crinoid, before boldly walking the surface of the arms at night to feed . A needle cuttlefish is almost perfectly camouflaged against the sand in this image. Recent research has found that cuttlefish can assess the colour, contrast and even the texture of their surroundings and emulate within seconds in total darkness . Some creatures prefer to dress up to hide themselves from predators. The Halimeda crab, (pictured) for instance, disguises itself as algae by decorating its body with pieces of Halimeda algae . ‘It doesn't look much, but it hides some of the weirdest critters you'll find underwater. The occasional coral outcrops house some of the more colourful examples.’ Brown was able to capture an image of a crinoid squat lobster, also known as feather star squat lobster or elegant squat lobster, hiding in its surroundings.

During the day, they use this camouflage to hide among the crinoid’s arms or feet, before boldly walking the surface of the arms at night to feed. Another impressive master of disguise is the needle cuttlefish, which is almost perfectly camouflaged against the sand in Brown’s image. Recent research has found that cuttlefish can assess the colour, contrast and even the texture, of their surroundings and emulate within seconds, in total darkness. Candy crab or soft coral crab - Hoplophrys oatesii, shows similar colouring to the soft coral it lives on (pictured right).

The image was taken in the Lembeh Strait in Indonesia. The area is renowned for something known as muck diving, which gets its name from the sediment that lies at the bottom of muck dive sites . The octopus is another creature that can mislead its prey through changing its colour and appearance. Among other ruses, the sea creature has been known to flatten out to appear as a poisonous sole, and change colours on on its arms to make them look like poisonous sea snakes.  This picture shows an octopus defilippi disappearing against the sandy seabed . Whip coral shrimp - Pontonides unciger, camouflages itself against the whip coral. Often if a divers hand is near to cleaner shrimps, they will attach themselves and start cleaning it .

Among other ruses, the sea creature has been known to flatten out to appear as a poisonous sole, and change the colours on on its arms to make them look like poisonous sea snakes. Brown was also able to capture the Halimeda ghost pipefish. Its disguise is so precise that it even mimics the white dead patches on the plant that it hides itself against. ‘The pygmy seahorse is being a particular favourite of mine, and only about 2cm big,’ said Brown. The pygmy seahorse blends in so well that it was only discovered by humans in 1969 after showing up with corals in an aquarium. Brown was able to capture the Halimeda ghost pipefish. Its disguise is so precise that it even mimics the white dead patches on the plant that it hides itself against . Robust ghost pipefish, also known as, Solenostomus cyanopterus is captured in this image. This cryptic species looks very similar to a drifting piece of seagrass .

Pictured is the devil scorpionfish - Inimicus didactylus, well camouflaged against the seabed . Painted frogfish - Antennarius pictus, displays identical colouring to the sponge it rests against.

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . If you love the taste of a beef burger, but hate the thought of killing animals, then you could soon be offered a guilt-free alternative. A group of Dutch scientists has come up with a design for a small-scale factory that could be used to deliver sustainable meat made from stem cells. While still a concept, the group have outlined a factory process in which the meat begins its life as a vial of cells and is grown in stages to create minced meat. A group of Dutch scientists has come up with a plan to create small-scale factories that deliver sustainable meat made from stem cells. The meat begins its life as a vial of cells taken from a cell bank and is later processed in a bioreactor to create a pressed cake of minced meat . The technology has already been proven on an individual scale. Last year, Mark Post, a professor of tissue engineering at Maastricht University, the Netherlands, presented the first lab-grown hamburger. However, the design for a larger factory is still at a proof-of-concept stage. ‘We believe that cultured meat is part of the future,’ said Cor van der Weele of Wageningen University in The Netherlands. ‘It is highly effective in stimulating a growing awareness and discussion of the problems of meat production and consumption.’ Rising demand for meat around the world is unsustainable in terms of environmental pollution and energy consumption, experts claim. The technology has already been proven on an individual scale. Last year, Mark Post, a professor of tissue engineering at Maastricht University, the Netherlands, presented the first lab-grown hamburger . The technology for culture stem cell meat has already been proven on an individual scale. Last year, Mark Post, a professor of tissue engineering at Maastricht University, the Netherlands, presented the first lab-grown hamburger. To great the burger, stem cells are cultivated in a nutrient broth, allowing them to proliferate 30-fold. Next they are combined with an elastic collagen and attached to Velcro 'anchor points' in a culture dish. Between the anchor points, the cells self-organise into chunks of muscle. Electrical stimulation is then used to make the muscle strips contract and 'bulk up' - the laboratory equivalent of working out in a gym. Finally thousands of beef strips are minced up, together with 200 pieces of lab-grown animal fat, and moulded into a patty. Around 20,000 meat strands are needed to make one 142g burger. Other non-meat ingredients include salt, egg powder, and breadcrumbs. Red beetroot juice and saffron are added to provide authentic beef colouring. A recent United Nations report concluded that a global shift toward a vegan diet is necessary to combat the worst effects of climate change. And the U.N. is not alone in its analysis. More than 50 per cent or more of global greenhouse-gas emissions are caused by animal agriculture, according to a report published by the Worldwatch Institute. To create culture meat, cells are exponentially grown during each stage by filling the cells with a sterile solution and cultivating them in a nutrient broth. Next they are combined with a binding protein which allows the cells to self-organise into chunks of muscle. The harvested cells are pressed and the cake is made into retailer-size portions of minced meat. But there will be challenges when it comes to maintaining a continuous stem cell line and producing cultured meat that's cheaper than meat obtained in the usual way. Most likely, the price of ‘normal’ meat would first have to rise considerably, Professor van der Weele. ‘Cultured meat has great moral promise,’ she added. ‘Worries about its unnaturalness might be met through small-scale production methods that allow close contact with cell-donor animals. ‘From a technological perspective, “village-scale” production is also a promising option.’ Rising demand for meat around the world is unsustainable in terms of environmental pollution and energy consumption. More than 50 per cent or more of global greenhouse-gas emissions are caused by animal agriculture, according to a report published by the Worldwatch Institute . ‘Other parts of the future are partly substituting meat with vegetarian products, keeping fewer animals in better circumstances, perhaps eating insects,’ she added. For instance, a student in Iceland has created a range of meals based on liquefied and blended insects. The Fly Factory was designed by graduate Búi Bjarmar Aðalsteinsson and during taste tests, diners were none the wiser. Aðalsteinsson's meals were inspired by a 2013 report by the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations called Edible Insects, which investigated how insects could solve food shortages. In February researchers at London South Bank University unveiled their sustainable insect snacks. Made from a mixture of dung beetles, mealworms and crickets, the researchers claimed the snacks could be developed to help feed a growing global population. Their prototypes were apparently rich in protein and included crunch cinnamon snacks that were 3D-printed using the ground bugs. Meanwhile, back in October 2013 students at McGill University were awarded $1 million (£600,000) to turn insects into flour. The goal of the project was to turn this into bread and other foods. The project, known as Flour Power, is hoped to provide a sustainable, year-round source of food as well as provide an extra business opportunity for local farmers.","The meat begins its life as a vial of cells taken from a cell bank and is later processed in a bioreactor to create a pressed cake of minced meat .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . and Sarah Griffiths . Eggs belonging to an ancient flying reptile that could grow to the size of a small aircraft have been discovered in China. It is the first time eggs laid by a pterosaur have been found fully intact, and palaeontologists claim they could shed new light on a mysterious, previously unknown species. The fossils were discovered in the Xinjiang Province, and suggest that at least some of the animals lived in large nesting colonies, much like modern birds. Discovered: Palaeontologists have found eggs laid by a pterosaur for the first time and they say that the discovery could shed new light on the mysterious ancient reptiles . The previously unknown pterosaur species, Hamipterus tianshanensis, is thought to have had a wingspan of between five and 11 feet. The Hamipterus eggs were not soft and leathery, such as those of most reptiles, nor were they hard like a bird’s. Instead they had a thin pliable shell overlaying a thick membrane. The modern rat snake lays a similar type of egg, according to the scientists. A total of five intact fossil eggs were found at the site in Xinjiang Province in north west China, along with the bones of 40 adults. They all belong to a previously unknown pterosaur species named Hamipterus tianshanensis, which had a wingspan of between 5ft (1.5 metres) and 11ft (3.4 metres). Scientists believe the thin-shelled eggs, which show signs of cracking and crazing, were not part of the same clutch. ‘The combination of many pterosaurs and eggs indicates the presence of a nesting site nearby and suggests that this species developed gregarious behaviour,’ said lead researcher Dr Xiaolin Wang, from the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing. ‘Hamipterus likely made its nesting grounds on the shores of freshwater lakes or rivers and buried its eggs in sand along the shore, preventing them from being desiccated.’ Previously the only pterosaur eggs known to science were four poorly preserved and flattened specimens, three of which were discovered in China, and one Argentina. The fossils were found in China and suggest that at least some of the creatures lived in large nesting colonies, much like modern birds. 'Hamipterus likely made its nesting grounds on the shores of freshwater lakes or rivers (illustrated) and buried its eggs in sand along the shore' the experts said . Based on skulls recovered, experts think that the ancient reptiles had head crests (illustrated) which differed in size and shape between the sexes . The Hamipterus eggs were not soft and leathery like those of most reptiles, nor were they hard like a bird’s. Instead they had a thin pliable shell overlaying a thick membrane, according to the study published in the journal Current Biology. The modern rat snake lays a similar type of egg, the scientists explained. ‘We regard the eggshell structure found in Hamipterus as a general trend for pterosaurs,’ they said. The pterosaurs are thought to have died in a large storm that hit their colony in the Turpan-Hami Basin, south of the Tian Shan Mountains, around 120 million years ago. Male and female skulls were recovered as well as vertebrae and limbs. Both sexes of the reptile had head crests, but the males’ were larger and a different shape than the females’. They palaeontologists said: ‘Sites like the one reported here provide further evidence regarding the behaviour and biology of this amazing group of flying reptiles that has no parallel in modern time.’ Pterosaurs are often confused with dinosaurs but belonged to a distinct reptilian group. Much less is known about them than the dinosaurs. They were the first vertebrates known to have evolved powered flight and showed enormous diversity. Species ranged from creatures the size of a sparrow to the monstrous Quetzalcoatlusa, which had a wingspan of 40ft (12 metres). Towards the end of their time on Earth, only the larger species remained as the smaller ones were out-competed by early birds.","The five fossil eggs were found in Xinjiang Province, north west China .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Google co-founder Larry Page has said people shouldn't work as much as they do - because there really is no need. The tech mogul, who spoke alongside fellow Google founder Sergey Brin in an interview with venture capitalist Vinod Khosla, didn't expand on how people could afford to live if they worked less. 'If you really think about the things . you need to make yourself happy - housing, security, opportunity for . your kids - it's not that hard for us to provide those things,' he said in the interview last week. He said the resources we need do not require as much effort to achieve as we think they do, and instead said that we only work to make ourselves feel needed. Scroll down for video . Speaking out: Larry Page, center alongside fellow Google founder Sergey Brin (right) and Vinod Khosla (left), said at an event last week that there is no need for people to work as much as they do . 'I think there's a problem that we don't recognize,' he went on. 'There's a social problem. 'A lot of people aren't happy if they . don't have anythings to do, so we need to give people things to do. You . need to feel like you're needed and wanted.' Instead, he suggested that we should work much less - or split jobs between more people - citing an example set by Virgin's founder, Richard Branson to battle unemployment in the U.K. 'He's been trying to get people to hire two part-time people instead of one full-time, so at least the young people can have a half-time job rather than no job,' he said. Questions: Page, left, said people should work less - without explaining how they could afford to live . 'If you have global unemployment, you just reduce work time.' While explaining his view, Page, who is worth nearly $32 billion, according to Forbes, failed to outline exactly how people would afford to live on fewer hours, and presumably a lesser wage. He added that he had asked many people if they would like to have an extra week of vacation or work fewer days in the week - and most said they would. 'Most people like working, but they'd also like to have more time with their family or to pursue their own interests,' he said. Co-founder Brin said he had to 'quibble' with Page's view. Comfortable: Page, pictured with his wife Lucy Southworth last year, is worth an estimated $32 billion . 'I don't think that in the near term, the need for labor is going away,' he said. 'It gets shifted from one place to another, but people always want more stuff or more entertainment or more creativity or more something.' Page, 41, launched Google in 1996 with Brin after they met while studying for PhDs at Stanford University before starting Google Inc. two years later. He is married to Lucinda Southworth, a former model and research scientist, and together they have two children and live in a mansion in Palo Alto, California.","Larry Page said that because it doesn't take much to achieve the jobs that we need complete, roles should be split or hours should be reduced .

"By . Sanchez Manning . The Passport Office was plunged into fresh crisis last night after it emerged that ‘under pressure’ workers are sending out travel documents to the wrong people. A Home Office investigation has been launched after passports, birth certificates and visas were posted to individuals they did not belong to. Shadow Immigration Minister David Hanson said the blunders were ‘a serious breach of security’ and tomorrow he plans to demand a full inquiry into the mistakes. Shadow Immigration Minister David Hanson is calling for an investigation into how many errors have been made because individuals receiving the wrong passport is a 'serious breach' of privacy . Mr Hanson said the likely cause of the errors was the ‘extreme pressure’ that Passport Office staff were now under to clear the backlog of an estimated 500,000 passport applications. He said: ‘I want an investigation into how many errors there are because individuals receiving the wrong passport is a serious breach of their privacy and potentially a serious breach of security. It’s something the Home Office should take very seriously. It’s likely to be because people are working under extreme pressure because of the backlog in passport applications.’ One applicant who recently received the wrong passport was Dale Grinsell, who spoke of his ‘shock’ at opening a letter containing documents belonging to a 17-year-old girl from South-East London. Mr Grinsell, 27, from the West Midlands, had applied this year to the Home Office to renew his passport and received it without any problems. But just a couple of weeks later he received a letter addressed to him that contained the passport belonging to the young woman, with documents including her personal details as well as names and addresses of her next of kin. Mr Grinsell said: ‘We couldn’t believe it. Staring back at us from the photo page was a young girl with long, curly red hair – certainly not me. ‘Luckily we are a law-abiding family, but who knows what could have happened if this had fallen into the wrong hands? ‘You certainly do not expect this from a Government department, and it does make you wonder whether anything of yours has been sent to the wrong place, or ended up in the wrong hands.’ A Passport Office spokesman said the organisation had 'robust procedures' in place to protect individuals' personal data and any suspected breach of privacy or loss of personal information is investigated thoroughly . Mr Grinsell said he returned the passport, but after an initial phone call from Home Office officials to request he send back the documents and the original envelope, he has heard nothing more. In a second case, a nursery worker from Flintshire in Wales told yesterday how she was astounded to receive a letter addressed to her containing the passport, British visa and birth certificate of a Pakistani man living in Lancashire. Sarah Threlfall, 29, received the surprise delivery just a week after her own passport arrived. She said: ‘I couldn’t believe it when I opened it up and found this man’s documents. It’s really concerning as this is important information.’ The mother of two said she has made several attempts to phone the Passport Office about the mix-up, but has been unable to get through. Passport Office chief executive Paul Hughes admitted on Friday that extra staff were being sent in to try to clear the chaos, which has left thousands of Britons at risk of missing their holidays. A Passport Office spokesman said: ‘We take the security of the passport and the safety of the passport holder’s personal information extremely seriously and we have robust procedures in place to protect personal data. ‘Any suspected breach of security or loss of personal information is investigated thoroughly.’","Investigation launched after passports and documents sent to wrong people .

"By . Ray Massey, Transport Editor . A dramatic escalation of airport anti-terror checks on electronic gadgets was announced by ministers last night. Tests on mobile phones, laptops and tablets that had been limited to passengers flying to the US will now be massively expanded to cover destinations around the world. British Airways and Virgin . Atlantic have both vowed to foot the . bill to send on any uncharged electronic devices to passengers prevented . from flying with them under the new rules. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . A dramatic escalation of airport anti-terror checks on electronic gadgets was announced by ministers . The new restrictions are understood to affect hundreds more flights to and from the Middle . East and volatile parts of Africa and Asia, including popular summer . holiday destinations such as Egypt. However, because neither airlines nor transport officials will confirm which routes are included, every single passenger must assume their gadgets will be checked, and act accordingly. Travellers will have to prove their electronic devices – some with a notoriously short battery life – are working normally, following fears that terrorists could pack the battery compartments with explosives. The development, which comes at the start of the summer holiday season, is based on US intelligence amid fears of an attack by Islamist extremists. Security officials are concerned that a booby-trapped electronic device could be smuggled onto a plane and used as a bomb by Yemen-based Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula or the Islamist Nusra Front, Al Qaeda’s affiliate in Syria. In 2009, Yemen-linked explosives expert Ibrahim al-Asiri was behind a similar plot and built an ‘underwear bomb’, used in a failed attempt to bring down a plane from Amsterdam bound for Detroit. Passengers were first warned last week . of extra checks on phones, and on Monday British Airways said it would . ban travellers from boarding US-bound flights if their electronic . devices were not charged. It . performed a partial U-turn yesterday, announcing that anyone whose . devices had a flat battery could still fly – but they would have to . leave their gadgets behind, and pay for them to be sent to their home . address. Tests on mobile phones, laptops and tablets will now be expanded to cover destinations around the world . Official advice to . travellers from the Department for Transport had previously been limited . to those ‘flying to the USA’. It now affects those ‘flying to and from . the UK’, and states: ‘Make sure your electronic devices are charged . before you travel. If your device doesn’t switch on, you won’t be . allowed to bring it on to the aircraft.’ Gadgets packed in checked luggage will . continue to be scanned as normal. Passengers whose devices are deemed . to be suspicious could be prevented from leaving them in the hold – and . could be barred from getting on flights altogether. Transport . Secretary Patrick McLoughlin  said yesterday that ‘passengers may . notice additional security measures on some routes both to and from the . UK’. A DfT spokesman added: . ‘In line with the US advice, passengers on some routes into and out of . the UK may now also be required to show that electronic devices in their . hand luggage are powered up or face not being allowed to bring the . device onto the aircraft.’ Mr . McLoughlin told the House of Commons that the new advice ‘is in line . with that issued by the US, and we have updated our official advice to . passengers accordingly’. His . written statement continued: ‘For obvious reasons we will not be . commenting in detail on the measures or the routes affected. 'We will . work with the aviation industry to minimise disruption as far as . possible.’ Mr McLoughlin stressed there was no change to the terror . threat level, which remains at ‘substantial’, but warned: ‘We face a . constantly evolving threat from terrorism and must respond accordingly.’ The escalation in security . checks came hours after British Airways ditched its own ‘no charge, no . fly’ rule, announcing that passengers whose devices had a flat battery . could still board planes – but without their gadgets. The escalation in security checks came hours after British Airways ditched its own 'no charge, no fly' rule .

'Our flights continue to . operate as normal.’ They . added: ‘Safety and security is our top priority at all times and we . continue to work closely with airports and governments around the . world.’ British Airways, Virgin, and other UK airlines, are advising passengers to arrive . at airports with devices fully charged as laid down by the new rules. BA said that passengers should arrive in good time at check in and also at the boarding gate, as there could be extra checks. BA said: 'We have in place a range of options if customers are not able to comply, when requested, with the new regulations. 'Customers . can ask to be rebooked on to a later service. If you wish to carry on . the item as part of your hand luggage, you will need to ensure that the . device can be charged ahead of your rebooked flight. 'Alternatively, . customers can leave the device behind and hand it to a member of our . customer service team.

Virgin Atlantic said it was texting all passengers . to advise them of the new arrangements and that it had charger . facilities available at airports for all the most popular devices. The airline announced today that it is now scrapping the charge it had earlier planned to make to customers for returning their uncharged phones – putting it in line with rivals British Airways who are also returning phones for free.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . As the battle for America's eyeballs heats up, theater chain AMC has announced a $600 million plan to install plush recliners in movie houses to lure viewers out of their living rooms. America's second largest theater company will remove up to 70 traditional seats to make way for fewer fully reclining Lay-Z-Boys in about 1,800 auditoriums. While analysts say AMC could lose customers by reducing the number of seats, chief executive Gerry Lopez insists the changes will attract more patrons seeking a luxurious movie experience. The bold five-year plan comes amid growing competition from video-on-demand streaming services such as Netflix, which boast cheaper monthly subscriptions than a single movie ticket. Innovation: Theater chain AMC plans to spend $600m installing recliners in 1,800 theaters across America to attract high-paying customers. Recliners have already been installed in this AMC movie theater in Braintree, Massachusetts (pictured) Wall Street Journal reported AMC, which went public last December, will spend $350,000 to $500,000 to 'reseat' each theater, with landlords bearing some of the cost. Lopez told WSJ that attendance has soared by 80 percent in the 37 AMC theaters which have already been reseated, even though they've lost about two-thirds of seating capacity. He added that box office revenue was up more than . 60 percent in those theaters, showing that quality over quantity will improve AMC's turnover. While industry analyst Eric Wold from B. Riley & Co told WSJ the move 'doesn't conceptually make sense', he admitted the attendance data was encouraging. 'Ultimate coziness': AMC has already begun rolling out its latest innovation, installing recliners in its Braintree, Massachusetts theater and promoting the 'cozy' seats on their website (pictured) Gerry Lopez (pictured) is president and CEO of AMC Entertainment . 'There are no more bodies coming through . the door,' Wold said. 'So you have to find something to get them to . come back more often or pay more.' Lopez, who joined AMC in 2009, said the jump in attendance at 'reseated' theaters was partly due to their full dine-in capabilities, offering patrons a substantial food-and-drink menu allowing moviegoers to . consolidate their evening activities. The former Starbucks executive said customers paying premium for cushy seats wouldn't tolerate poor food choices or inadequate bathroom facilities. 'If we're going to do this, we do the full monty,' he told WSJ. In addition, he expects the reseated theaters will attract more midweek audiences than normal theaters, and draw more adults who pay higher ticket prices than teenagers or young children.","Recliners to be installed in 1,800 theaters across America, replacing about two-thirds of seats .

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . A Fourth of July hot dog eating contest in western South Dakota turned tragic when a contestant choked to death. Walter Eagle Tail, 47, of Custer, died at a hospital Thursday after attempts to save him at the scene failed, Custer County Sheriff Rick Wheeler told the Rapid City Journal. 'There was someone doing CPR when we arrived,' Wheeler said. 'He probably just suffocated. It got lodged in his throat and they (paramedics) couldn't get it out. 'It all happened within minutes,' the sheriff said. Walter Eagle Tail collapsed and later died after choking on a hotdog at an eating contest on Thursday . The Custer Chamber of Commerce, which sponsored the contest, canceled a pie-eating contest scheduled for Friday. 'We are at a loss for words,' Chamber Executive Director Dave Ressler said. 'We are mourning for Walter and his family right now.' Speed-eating competitions are popular over the Fourth of July weekend. Eight-time champion Joey 'Jaws' Chestnut managed to eat 61 hot dogs in 10 minutes at an annual contest in Coney Island, New York, on Friday - eight short of the record 69 he swallowed in the 2013 competition. George Shea, chairman of Major League Eating, a competitive eating organization based in New York, said organizers do all they can to prevent casualties during contests. 'We always make sure it's in a controlled environment,"" Shea said. ""We organize the entire thing around safety. (Just as) if it's football or hockey or auto racing, we approach it as a top priority."" Funeral arrangements were pending for Eagle Tail, whom friends described as a fun-loving, kind and caring man. 'Walter was just being Walter, having fun when he entered this contest,' said Ardis McRae. 'He was just having a good time.'","Walter Eagle Tail, 47, collapsed at a hotdog eating contest in Custer, South Dakota, on Thursday .

"By . Snejana Farberov . Lupe Villanueva and Frank Ybarra have crossed paths several times over the past 20 years, but it was not until a few months ago that they found out they were siblings - and the revelation could not have come at a more critical time. Mrs Villanueva, of Oxnard, California, said reuniting with her long-lost brother was the product of divine intervention because it gave her a chance to save his life by donating a kidney to him. The surgery took place June 24 at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center. Both Ybarra and Villanueva said the life-saving operation marked the beginning of their relationship. Blood ties: Lupe Villanueva, left, pictured with her new-found brother, Frank Ybarra, shortly before she donated one of her kidneys to save his life . Ybarra, 53, and Villanueva, 54, grew up in the same neighborhood in Oxnard but never met as children. The woman was adopted and raised by a different family. She had spent 20 years searching for her biological parents, but without much success. About three years into her quest, Villanueva got a first clue about her brother, but initially misinterpreted it, reported Fox News Latino. One day at work, the woman and her colleagues were comparing their baby pictures when a friend remarked that Villanueva bore strong resemblance to her husband. Villanueva became convinced that her co-worker's husband, Frank Ybarra, was her cousin. It was not until 17 years later that she got an unexpected call from her half-sister revealing to her that Ybarra was actually her brother. The shocking discovery was compounded by the fact that Ybarra was suffering from a life-threatening medical condition and was in need of a kidney transplant. Together again: Frank and Lupe learned they were biological siblings in October 2013 . Villanueva has known since age 8 that she had been adopted, 8, but her brother had thought that the people who raised him were his biological parents . The 53-year-old Oxnard man has been on daily dialysis since 2012 when he experienced kidney failure due to diabetes. With a B+ blood type not shared by anyone in his family, Ybarra’s wait time for a donor kidney was eight to 10 years. But then came a fateful meeting with his newfound sister, who volunteered to give him one of her kidney. At first, Ybarra was hesitant. ‘I said, “Lupe, it’s not like you’re passing a shoe on to me,”’ he recalled, but Villanueva was not to be dissuaded. ‘We’re actually going to be really part of each other now,' he said. The surgery was a success, and on June 27 Ybarra celebrated his 53rd birthday. First clue: Nearly two decades ago, Villanueva first realized she may be related to Ybarra when her co-worker saw her baby picture and told her that she looked just like her husband . Lupe and Frank's story has the makings of a telenovela script, complete two adopted babies, roiling family drama and swirling rumors about siblings separated at birth. Lupe Villanueva learned she was adopted at age 8. After doing some digging, she found out that the names of her birth parents were Lala and Cliserio. As she was searching for her birth parents, Villanueva heard whispers that her parents also had a son who had been adopted out like her. When in 1996 her friend and co-worker pointed out that in her childhood picture Villanueva looked just like her husband, the two concluded that Ybarra must be her cousin because everyone thought at the time that Cliserio - Lupe's birth father - was Frank's uncle. As it emerged later on, the Ybbaras, Frank's adoptive parents, were unable to conceive, and so when Lala - Lupe Villanueva’s birth mother - became pregnant with a boy, Cliserio made the decision to give the newborn to his sister and her husband. Lala told the family that she also had had a daughter who had died in childbirth a year earlier. Some time later, Frank's adoptive mother heard of a female cousin who was trying to reunite with their family, and so she arranged a meeting between Lupe and Lala. But when the two women came face to face in the mid-90s, both remained in the dark about the fact that they were mother and daughter. Two years later, Lupe got to meet her biological father, Cliserio, but she decided to not 'open a can of worms' about the past. Both Lala and Cliserio have since passed away. Comedy of errors: The siblings thought for a long time that they were first cousins . During a family reunion in 2001, Frank Ybarra overheard some of Cliserio's other children talk about a half-sister they were hoping to meet. Ybarra remembered that his wife had mentioned to him once that her co-worker was Cliserio's biological daughter, and so he took it upon himself to arrange a meeting between Villanueva and her half-siblings. Last October, Lupe and her husband invited Frank and his wife to dinner. In the course of the evening, the two discovered they had a strong, inexplicable connection. Shortly after, Lupe and Frank were contacted by one of Cliserio's other daughters who revealed to each of them that just before he died, the father said they were brother and sister. In June, Lupe made up her mind to go under the knife to save her newfound brother's life. A blood test confirmed what they already knew – Frank and Lupe were a 99.99 per cent genetic match. ‘I don’t know how else to put it except for a miracle,’ Ybarra said. ‘She’s given me a second chance at life. You don’t pass [that] up.’","Lupe Villanueva, 54, donated one of her kidneys to her brother Frank Ybarra, 53, eight months after learning they were siblings .

"By . Snejana Farberov . A celebrity nurse starring on a popular reality show about a New York hospital has learned the hard way that oversharing on social media can have real-life consequences. Katie Duke, one of the stars of ABC's New York Med, has been fired for sharing on her Instagram account a photo depicting an empty trauma room strewn with medical supplies where a man had been brought in for treatment after he was struck by a subway train. Ms Duke, 33, accompanied the image with the caption: 'Man vs. 6 train.' Scroll down for video . It got her in trouble: Nurse Katie Duke was let go from her job at New York Presbyterian Hospital for sharing on Instagram this image of a messy trauma room where a man had been treated after being struck by a train . Reality star: The 33-year-old veteran nurse was one of the stars of the ABC show New York Med, which is currently in its second season . Her side of the story: Duke explained that the photo that got her dismissed after seven years on the job was taken by a doctor, and that she merely reposted it . Just hours after posting the image online, the nurse got a call from her superiors at New York Presbyterian Hospital informing her that she was being let go after seven years in the ER. Duke's dramatic firing has made it into the second season of New York Med, which premiered late last month. The nurse told ABC News that hospital officials pointed out to her that she was not terminated for being in breach of hospital policy, or for violating patient privacy - but rather for being insensitive. The 33-year-old medical professional claimed the photo of the trauma room that got her fired was originally taken by a doctor, and that she merely reposted it on Instagram. According to Duke, the physician in question was not punished for photographing the room. The nurse insisted that she did nothing wrong by sharing the picture, but admitted that doing so might have offended someone unfamiliar with emergency room dynamics. Branding maven: The 33-year-old 'nursing maverick' has a line of merchandise featuring her favorite catchphrase summing up her no-nonsense attitude . She's landed on her feet: Miss Duke has found a new job and launched a new website . ‘If you hung around nurse’s station and heard the way we talk about injuries, life and death you might get the wrong impression but it’s just a coping mechanism,’  she told ABC. ‘Now I check my posts so no one gets offended or thinks I am a cold-hearted person.’ Reality star: The bespectacled blonde (second right) emerged as one of the more compelling characters on season 1 of New York Med starring Dr Oz Mehmet (second left) Miss Duke described her very public termination as a 'traumatic' experiences, saying that New York Presbyterian was her 'family.' ‘Losing my job took me out of a comfortable spot,’ Duke told St Louis Post-Dispatch last month. ‘Everyone in the same situation would think, “What now?” You just have to pick yourself up, think of a plan and deal with it.’ The firing did nothing to slow down the 33-year-old nurse, who has since landed a new job along with a couple of endorsement deals. Duke also has launched a new website and a line of merchandise featuring her catchphrase popularized on New York Med: 'Deal with it.' Miss Duke, who describes herself as a 'risk taker,' 'intellectual' and 'nursing maverick,' has maintained a robust presence on social media, with nearly 25,000 followers on Twitter and over 16,000 on Instagram. Despite her unceremonious dismissal, Duke had nothing but praise for New York Med, which she said was the only program on television that shows what it's really like to work in a hospital. ‘Look at TV shows like Nurse Jackie — no way is that a good depiction of nurses,’ she said referring to the Showtime series starring Eddie Falco. ‘And Grey’s Anatomy is good drama, but it’s not real.’ Miss Duke explained that one of her main objectives is to promote a positive view of nurses. No hard feelings: Despite her firing, Miss Duke praised the ABC program for its ability to show what it's really like to work in a hospital .","Katie Duke, 33, was dismissed by New York Presbyterian Hospital for being 'insensitive' on Season 2 of New York Med .

"By . Dr Pam Spurr . Emotional eating is a big problem for many people. Seventy per cent turn to comfort food, to varying extents, for emotional reasons. And over 90 per cent of diets fail due to slipping back into emotional eating habits. You might recognise yourself from this list of key behaviours and feelings emotional eaters frequently report: . Dr Pam says that celebrations such as Christmas can see children encouraged to overeat . Children are often taught from a young age that food is a way of making you feel better when you're upset . If these, or similar, thoughts and behaviours mean you head to snacks or extra helpings to ease emotional upset or stress - then emotional eating is something you should tackle. You probably know it's a cycle that comes back to bite you because that faux-relief from eating evaporates quickly and you frequently feel worse because of guilt. Where does my emotional eating come from? The question for most emotional eaters is why do I do it, why can't I stop myself heading for comfort food? Often followed by self-defeating thoughts like I always slip up, I'm useless at controlling my emotional eating. This pattern of behaviour often has roots in childhood. Emotional eaters should never underestimate the power of how their parents treated food and how that influences them for life until they decide to change. Of course some people have a seemingly healthy relationship with food in their early life only to find after a trauma like divorce or job loss they seek extra comfort in food. But even for them there may be a heritage of resorting to emotional eating in their family. Think about these scenarios: As a child when you, e.g., fell off your bicycle your mother would say 'come on, you'll feel better after a treat.' When older and you came home from school upset over something, again you were given an 'extra special' snack to cheer you up. When your mother or father was upset you also saw them have an extra piece of cake or bag of crisps, etc. This behaviour of using food to soothe emotions is extremely common in families. It's nothing to do with being 'bad parents' it's simply unrecognised as establishing in childhood a relationship with food that turns it into comfort. Dr Pam Spurr says that the first step towards conquering emotional eating is becoming aware of what is triggering it . Even in times of celebration some families allow their children to gorge on as many helpings as they want. Not only at classic times of feasting like Christmas, or other religious holidays, but when someone does well at exams, passes their driving test, etc. Occasional feasting is fine but to take it to extremes isn't. So whether food was used in your family as comfort, as a reward, or both, this becomes the unconscious way you relate to food. It's imbedded in your mind, emotions and behaviour. Become actively aware of your emotional eating . If this resonates with your experience and you can see you might have had a lifelong relationship to food like this, take a one-day-at-a-time approach to changing it. Try learning to focus on the moment rather than always reflecting on the past or thinking ahead to the future. When you start to make it a habit of becoming mindful of the present it helps diminish your stress levels and helps you take control of the here-and-now. Don't allow yourself to go on 'autopilot' at meal times or when having a healthy snack. Think about what you're putting in your mouth, chew it slowly, and appreciate the moment. When you don't think during a meal you're more likely to eat quickly and overload yourself. Dr Pam's book, The Emotional Eater's Diet is available to buy now . Plan what you can do today in response to daily stresses instead of emotional eating. Only think about today and what change you can make. Then go ahead and try it. Don't sweep difficult feelings under the emotional carpet. If someone/something upsets you think how you can respond to it. Don't reach into your drawer at work or cupboard at home for biscuits. Dump unhealthy snacks from your workplace and home. Instead when you need to fuel your energy needs (not your emotional needs) have a banana, small portion of unsalted/fried nuts, veggie sticks with low-fat yoghurt dip, etc. Know your danger zones - if you head to the staff cafe every time you're upset by your manager plan a different strategy. Message your partner, ring your best friend, plan how to tackle their behaviour, or go for a brisk walk. Wherever possible bring your own food to work in pre-measured portion sizes. That way you're in control of how healthy your food choices are. While working at not, e.g., heading off to the newsagents to buy sweets when upset, only bring the cash you need to work. Beware of shopping temptations, particularly after a stressful day at work. Take your shopping list and stick to it, never shop when hungry, avoid the aisles with your favourite comfort foods, and check your basket at the till to make sure you haven't unconsciously thrown in some unhealthy snacks. Your emotional eating might have originated within your family but that doesn't mean you can't start understanding and managing it from today. Dr Pam Spurr is on twitter @drpamspurr .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A 22-year-old college dropout has launched an exclusive black metal credit card only available to hand-selected New York City residents. Billy McFarland, the son of real-estate developers from Short Hills, New Jersey, is behind the Magnises, a credit card marketed as the hottest way for the young elite to spend. Hopefuls have to go through a strict vetting process before they can join, but if they get in, they are privy to a wealth of perks, including a driver, a West Village townhouse and parties on yachts. Magnises is 'Latin for absolutely . nothing',' McFarland told the New York Post. 'The name . is made up, but it sounds grand, doesn't it?' Business trip: Billy McFarland, 22, is behind an exclusive credit card aimed at New York's young elite . To become . a member, applications complete an online form that asks where they . prefer going out in the city, where they shop and where they dine - . apparently to ensure that the Magnises team is only granting access to . the creme de la creme. Among . the 30 per cent of applicants McFarland and his 11 staff accept, they . seek people aged between 25 and 25 from 'all walks of life' from fashion . to finance, the team told Business Insider. But if you pass the phone interview, Google search and two weeks of vetting, you will receive your own black stainless steel card - and plenty of perks. The 1,200 users, which include DJs, tech innovators, socialites, models and Olympic hopefuls, get access to a members-only hangout at a townhouse lined with art in the West Village. They can also use a BMW 7L and . a driver; a 24/7 concierge service that arranges concert tickets and reservations at the city's top restaurants; free classes at David Barton Gym and free drinks. This summer, they are hosting yacht parties and setting up appointments for members to get custom wardrobes. 'When I get out of work early, I’ll go to the townhouse and get oysters . and cocktails,' 22-year-old Gwen Tetirick, who works in business . planning said. 'I wanted someone to curate my life for me.' Exclusive: To get the Magnises card, you have to cite New York's hottest spots as your favorite places to go . Perks: Once you're in, you can have unlimited access to the team's West Village townhouse, pictured . Luxury: The company also hosts exclusive dinner parties and cocktail evenings at the apartment . The team behind the card say that their members are handpicked to create this exclusive atmosphere. '[We like] smart people from . great schools, so they have the family background and education,' Emir Bahadir, a real estate exec and an adviser to Magnises, told the Post. Interestingly, the card isn't expensive and is simply a duplicate of a credit or debit card the user already owns - meaning it links to that bank account rather than another one. Magnises has an annual cost of just $250 and no spending requirements - compared to American Express' black . card, which costs $7,500 in starting fees and . $2,500 annually. McFarland has received $1 million from investors including former Def Jam CEO Kevin . Liles and former MasterCard International chairman Lance Weaver, the Post reported. For McFarland, who is pictured online partying on yachts with bikini-clad women, it's just the latest in a line of projects he's been dabbling with since he was a teenager. High life: The perks also include parties over the summer on a yacht and access to a BMW 7L and a driver . Party: Images from a recent party aboard the yacht give stunning views of the Manhattan skyline . Invite only: The black 'credit card' costs $250 a year and links to an existing card in your name . No complaints: McFarland, second from right, dropped out of college in his freshman year and has launched three companies since he was a teenager. He hopes to expand the card to other cities . At age 13, he launched a service that matched websites and designers before heading to Bucknell University but dropping out during his freshman year to launch a content-sharing company, Spling. From there, he moved on to Magnises. McFarland explained to Business Insider that the idea came about last summer as he spoke with friends about their credit cards. He thought they could be so much better if they were used in more personalized ways. 'Take this thing you’re using five times a day, make it more community-based, and then build perks around it that affect your everyday life,' he said. After conquering New York, the company plans to expand, with Washington D.C. next on the list.","Billy McFarland, 22, launched the Magnises credit card in March .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . NFL player DeAngelo Williams has generously given up his business class seat to a Marine on his flight - but some fans have suggested he might have been duped. The Carolina Panthers running back shared an image of his Delta plane ticket alongside a photo of the unsuspecting military man in uniform on his Twitter and Facebook pages on Monday morning. 'I always give up my seat to military if my seat is better!' Williams wrote. 'I truly appreciate our troops.' He explained that the unidentified man was not aware of his act of generosity. Kind gesture: NFL player DeAngelo Williams shared an image of his business class plane ticket and a photo of a man dressed in a military uniform on Monday, explaining he was giving up his seat to him . 'He doesn’t know it yet but he will be sitting in this seat when he boards the plane I always give up my 1st class seat! #isalutethetroops,' he wrote. After he shared the images, fans applauded him for the move - but some others questioned whether the benefactor was indeed a Marine. They suggested that he was a fake because he was wearing his hat inside and his badges were displayed incorrectly on his jacket. 'Unfortunately this guy is disrespecting the Marine Corps uniform,' one Facebook user, Eric Knight, wrote. 'NO Marine leaves a cover on indoors, and there shouldn't be a shooting badge worn with medals, and certainly not on the right breast pocket.' Doubts: Some of Williams' Facebook fans said that the man in the photograph did not look like a Marine . Another user, Justin Amos, added: 'I'm gonna be honest here. He . looks like a ""faker"". 'I'm a Marine and he is wearing his cover indoors. NO MARINE WEARS THEIR COVER INDOORS. Something is fishy DeAngelo . Williams, don't give up your seat to him!' But while some fans attacked the man in uniform, others said that Williams' kind act should not be overlooked. 'Even if he isn't really a marine, why focus on the negative?' Nicole Marie asked. 'DeAngelo did a really respectable thing by giving him his seat. It shows his character, and it's not his fault if this guy wasn't legitimately a marine.' Patriot: Williams, pictured in photos on Instagram, said he always gave up seats to members of the military . Star: Williams, who plays for the Carolina Panthers, said he was happy with his decision to give up the seat . Williams, who also came under fire for posting about his act of kindness rather than just staying quiet about it, insisted on his page that he was happy with his choice. 'I always do that and for those of you that are saying I shouldn't have posted keep calm and enjoy my page and happy 4th of July (it's called being patriotic for life),' Williams wrote. His gesture came just weeks after actress Amy Adams, whose father was in the military, traded her first class seat on an early-morning flight from Detroit to Los Angeles with a soldier. The American Hustle star said the generous move was something she had always wanted to do, so she quietly arranged the swap on the Delta airlines flight with a flight attendant. 'I didn't do it for attention for myself,' the 39-year-old told Inside Edition after landing in LA.

"By . Misty White Sidell . Christian Siriano has refuted Melissa McCarthy’s claims that she ‘couldn’t find anybody’ to make a dress for her to wear to the 2012 Academy Awards. The New York City-based fashion designer - who won the fourth season of Project Runway in 2007 - told the New York Daily News that he ‘met with her people’ and attempted to collaborate with Ms McCarthy, 43, on an Oscars gown. ‘Quite frankly she was quite difficult to work with,’ Mr Siriano said of actress, who had been nominated as Best Supporting Actress for her role in Bridesmaids. Scroll down for video . Final result: Mrs McCarthy did not wear Mr Siriano's designs to the 2012 Academy Awards and instead chose this pink gown by Marina Rinaldi . He added: ‘She wanted some specific . things that I thought would not look good on her body. And she was not . comfortable with them in the end.’ Ms McCarthy ended up wearing a pale pink dress by Marina Rinaldi for the event instead – a choice that won her mixed reviews from fashion pundits. Mr . Siriano’s comments follow those made by Ms McCarthy in the June issue . of Redbook magazine in which she said: ‘Two Oscars ago, I couldn’t find . anybody to do a dress for me. I asked five or six designers–very . high-level ones who make lots of dresses for people–and they all said . no.’ Recent looks: Ms McCarthy wore a leather dress to the LA premiere of her new film Tammy last week (left) and a sequined cardigan and jumpsuit by an unknown designer to the film's New York City premiere on June 26 (right) Since then, though, it . seems she has won over the fashion set. Just last week, she won praise . for her appearance at the Tammy premiere in Los Angeles for which she wore a . leather-and-chiffon dress with leopard print Tabitha Simmons heels. On June 26 she wore a sequined cardigan over a black silk jumpsuit to the film's New York City premiere. The designer of both ensembles has yet to be revealed. In . the interview the mother-of-two, married to Ben Falcone since 2005, . also alluded to the possibility of her creating a plus-size fashion . label. ‘When I go shopping, most of the time I’m disappointed,’ she said. Providing criticism: Mr Siriano first rose to fame in 2007 as the winner of the fourth season of Project Runway (pictured) The . venture would represent her longstanding interest in fashion. As a . teenager, she had aspirations of attending New York’s Fashion Institute . of Technology – a dream that her parents ultimately refused in favor of . a more academic education. Their . efforts appear to have been in vain though. She briefly attended the . Southern Illinois University before dropping out to move to New York . City and try her luck at a stand-up comedy career. Ms McCarthy was also friends with the now-famous footwear designer Brian Atwood and the pair remain close today.","The 2007 Project Runway winner, who attempted to collaborate with Ms McCarthy in 2012, claims that the actress ‘wanted some specific things that I thought would not look good on her body’

No, this isn’t the glitzy after-party of a Hollywood premiere, but centre court at the Wimbledon Lawn Tennis Championships 2014. Has there ever been such a starry crowd in suburban SW19? And how on earth has lawn tennis become such a fixture on the celebrity circuit? June 30: Sir Cliff Richard arrives at Wimbledon to cheer on Andy Murray, who beat big-serving South African Kevin Anderson . July 1: A monochrome suit-clad Cliff arrives to watch Roger Federer take on Tommy Robredo . July 2: Third time's a charm for Sir Cliff, who arrived to watch Andy Murray play Grigor Dimitrov in the quarterfinals .

July 6 and 2: The Duchess of Cambridge was a real royal in the royal box on two occasions at this year's tournament. Left, watching Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer in the men's finals and, right, watching Andy Murray v Grigor Dimitrov . Some stars are known to be avid fans - . seven-time visitor Cliff Richard, Anna Wintour, Bradley Cooper all have . form - but a few admitted to never having watched a match before. The answer might lie in the energetic . activities of championship sponsors Evian, whose public relations team . has gone into overdrive persuading the stars to make the trip down to . south London. The Evian Live Young VIP suite kept . the important people supplied with free Pimm's, table tennis, afternoon . tea and Sugarpova (Maria Sharapova's line of sweets, don't you know). Celebrities who passed through its . portals include Ellie Goulding, Burberry models Jamie Campbell-Bower and . new girlfriend Matilda Lowther (at the all-over-each-other stage, . according to onlookers), Pixie Lott and Oliver Chesire and Douglas . Booth, to name but a few. Tennis fans the Middletons made their presence felt throughout the fortnight. Whilst Pippa once admitted she and her sister used to have to queue with the other mere mortals for tickets, this year they took their seats again in the royal box. Kate attended twice with her husband Prince William while Pippa also went twice, once with their brother James and then with her parents and boyfriend, Nico. Carole and Michael trumped their off spring by attending three times. They were on centre court on three different days - with one of them spent in the royal box thanks to their connections to the throne. Not lucky charms: Prince William joined his wife on both of her visits. Unfortunately on their first trip, they saw Murray lose in his quarter final match against Dimitrov on July 2 . Genuine fans: The reactions of the Duke and Duchess throughout the men's final match showed how much they love the sport .

Support: Comedian Ricky Gervais joined Andy Murray's coach Amelie Mauresmo in the players' box on centre court to watch him win his third round match against Roberto Bautista Agut, left. After the match, he met the British number one to help him through his warm down on exercise bikes . Hugh Jackman watched Nadal win against Martin Klazan on June 24 and was 'thrilled' to get a picture with the champion afterwards . The X Men star returned to watch the men's final even though Nadal missed out on getting there . Meanwhile for others, befriending a top seed now seems to be the in-thing - comedian Ricky Gervais joined Andy Murray's support team this year even though the pair had previously never met. The British number one explained in his BBC blog: 'There was a new face in the gym after Friday's match as comedian Ricky Gervais came along, as I'd invited him to sit in my player box... I'd never met him before, although we've had plenty of Twitter banter and I've watched all of his shows and his stand-up.' He added that big names taking an interest in tennis can only be good for the sport as it creates more interest. Last year Murray's famous fans, who cheered him on alongside his family, included comedian James Corden and cyclist Sir Chris Hoy. But he's not the only one with well-known friends. Women's finalist Eugenie Bouchard has a fan in the Big Bang Theory star Jim Parsons. He said they have been friends for years and he watched her play four times during this year's tournament. Two visits: Suki Waterhouse and boyfriend Bradley Cooper attend the semi-final match between Novak Djokovic and Grigor Dimitrov on centre court on 4 July, left.

Free publicity: David Beckham was joined by his wife Victoria on his second visit when she wore a dress from her new collection . Having fun? She certainly didn't seem to be enjoying the match as much as her sporty husband . Too much excitement? John Bercow watched as Novak Djokovic took on Gilles Simon in week one, left, but he didn't seem quite as captivated during the men's final, right . This number of attendances was only beaten in the star stakes by the ever-present singer Cliff Richard - who attended seven times this year. Former newsreader Sir Trevor MacDonald, who is known to play tennis recreationally himself, was also there three times. There's no doubt the standard of tennis at the moment would have been a draw for many. As if the old guard of Roger Federer, Nadal, Novak Djokovic and last year's champion Murray aren't enough of a world class sporting spectacle, this year they were challenged by a number of rising talents including Grigor Dimitrov and Nick Kyrgios. Meanwhile, there were a number of stars in the women's game to keep people entertained including eventual champion Petra Kvitova. Time for tennis?

But it seems some of the celebrities weren't just there to see the tennis but to be seen at the tennis. This certainly seemed to be the case for Victoria Beckham who didn't join her sporting husband when he attended the first Saturday of the tournament - so he took his mother instead. But perhaps certain that more of the world would be watching on men's final day, she joined her husband in the royal box on that occasion, and made the most of it by showcasing a dress from her new collection. Despite not cracking a smile throughout the whole day, she later Tweeted that she had 'so much fun'. She then posted a picture of her outfit pointing out it was part of her Spring/Summer 15 range. For some of the stars, the hospitality might also have been more of a draw than the sport. Singers Pixie Lott and Ellie Goulding were among the stars pictured enjoying themselves being entertained in Evian's Wimbledon suite. They were able to grab food and drink, try their hand at table tennis - and of course be pictured by the gathered photographers. Sophie Allard, evian Senior Brand Manager said they were delighted with how many celebs they had through their doors: 'We have been really pleased with how popular the evian Live young suite has been this year, we've had more A list celebrities than ever. 'This is the eighth year we have been encouraging the stars to have fun and play at The Championships, Wimbledon and they have obviously enjoyed themselves. We are already looking forward to next year!'","Ever-present Cliff Richard attended seven times .

"By . Ted Thornhill . and Associated Press . The father of a pregnant Pakistani woman who was stoned to death and four other men have been charged with killing her after she married against the family's wishes, police said. Farzana Parveen, 25, was killed on May 27 before a crowd of onlookers near a downtown courthouse in the eastern city of Lahore. A mob beat her with bricks and killed her as she was on her way to court to contest an abduction case her family had filed against her husband, Mohammed Iqbal. Shocking: Farzana Parveen (left), 25, was killed before a crowd of onlookers near a courthouse in Lahore, allegedly by her father and four other men, displeased at her marriage to Mohammed Iqbal (right) Mourning: Iqbal praying at Farzana's grave . A Pakistani court indicted her father, two brothers, a cousin and a man who claimed he had been married to Parveen on charges of murder and torture on Saturday. All five men pleaded not guilty, according to Mian Zulfiqar, the police investigator. The trial will begin on Monday when the court has called on prosecution witnesses to appear, said Zulfiqar. Horror: Farzana was stoned to death in  broad daylight . He said police and doctors who conducted the autopsy of the victim would be among those testifying. 'We have a strong case against the suspects but it is up to the court how to take view of our investigation,' he said. The case has brought international attention to violence against women in Muslim-majority Pakistan, where hundreds of women are barbarically killed by relatives each year in so-called 'honor killings' carried out by husbands or relatives as a punishment for alleged adultery or other illicit sexual behavior. Arranged marriages are the norm among conservative Pakistanis, and Parveen's family was angry she married Mohammed Iqbal for love.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . He's just become an all American hero - but she's a patriotic Brit through and through. Tim Howard's new girlfriend is a Scottish university graduate who once went on a drunken rant on live TV about how much she loves the British royal family. Stunning model Sara McLean, 24, met the U.S. team's World Cup goalkeeper at a party about a year ago and the pair have been going out ever since. She is a former Miss Edinburgh and Big Brother contestant who shocked housemates on the reality show when she gave a tearful rendition of God Save The Queen, before going on a rant about people who hate the royal family. Howard has become the most talked about soccer player in the U.S since his team's run of results in Brazil, but in the UK - where McLean lives - he is just another top flight player. Soccer star: Despite McLean's absence from Brazil during the World Cup, Howard put in an impressive performance . Football philistine: McLean admits that she never watched 'football' before she and Howard began dating . The 24-year-old, who broke shattered her leg last year in a road accident, even admits she knows close to nothing about football, and says their connection is about a lot more than sports. Despite the U.S. team's failure to move on past the quarter-finals, McLean says £1.5million-a-year Howard, 35, is 'over the moon' with the way he played. During the last match against Belgium, the Everton star broke the record for most saves in a World Cup match with 16. 'We don’t really talk about football that much, to be honest. I didn't even watch football before we started going out,' McLean told The Scottish Sun. 'He just laughs if I ever ask him anything about football.' According to Page Six, McLean, who came second in the 2011 Miss Scotland Pagaent and later appeared on British reality show Big Brother, couldn't get time off from her job to go and support her man in Brazil for the World Cup, but says he understands. Sara McLean appeared on Big Brother in 2012. Here she is at Elstree Studios, Hertfordshire . Sara McLean spotted out in London after leaving the Big Brother house in September last year (right) and in December (left) He owns a flat in Manchester, in the north-west of England, while she lives in London after she moved down from her hometown in Scotland. But the pair are going to be seeing a lot more of each other over the next four years, after Howard signed a new contract with Everton this summer. But beauty queen McLean, originally from Newington in Edinburgh, doesn't intend to rest on her laurels and become a WAG. The former Miss Edinburgh appeared on Big Brother alongside a former porn star, a plus-size model and a one-time LA gang member, in the 2012 series of the hit reality TV show . 'I like to work and make my own money,' McLean said. 'I never like to be dependent on anyone.' The New Jersey-born Howard has a son Jacob, eight, and daughter Ali, seven, who both live with their mother, his ex-wife Laura Liebenrood in Tennessee. McLean told the Sun that she hasn't ruled out a move to the U.S. after Howard's UK contract ends. 'We’ve spoken about it a couple of times. It would depend on where in life I am, and what opportunities there would be in America for me and my job. We’ll just have to see what happens,' she said. Party girl: Scottish model Sara McLean, 24, attends a showbiz party at the Aura Mayfair in London . Last year the former Miss Edinburgh, whose 62-year-old civil engineer father Colin tragically died from lung cancer three years ago, had her leg shattered in an alleged hit-and-run. McLean was rushed to Edinburgh Royal Infirmary - where she underwent tests for brain damage - after the incident in July 2013. She later revealed her leg was broken in four places, but insisted her injuries could have been much worse.

Former beauty queen Sara McLean was reduced to tears about the Queen when she made her fellow housemates sing the national anthem after getting drunk on Big Brother two years ago. They looked on in shock as she sobbed: 'I love the Queen so much. 'She's got good humour and she works. She's worked until 86 and half the people in Britain don't even work. 'When Prince William got married it was the happiest day of my life. When Prince Philip got sick I got really emotional. 'It's the one thing in my life that I'm really passionate about. 'People like basketball or like baking cookies. I like the Queen.' McLean also blasted the antiroyalists. She ranted: 'When people say that they hate them, it's not nice. When I watch the Royal Family it makes me so proud. 'I hate the thought of people voting out the Royal Family. If something like that happened I don't know how I'd cope.' She said: 'Initially, doctors feared I had sustained brain damage but that was ruled out  morning after lengthy tests. 'My left leg is broken in four places and, although that has been agony, I'm almost thankful it's the only damage. I'm lucky to be alive.' On Big Brother, McLean appeared alongside a former porn star, a plus-size model and a one-time LA gang member, before eventually coming fourth after spending two months in the house. Before going on the Five show, McLean declared her love for Margaret Thatcher. She also admitted being argumentative and having a short temper. One downside to being there was that McLean missed her graduation in marketing management from Edinburgh's Napier University. On the show she confessed to an obsession with the Queen and left housemates baffled with a drunken rant backing the monarchy. And at one point she threatened to punch model Arron Lowe after he talked about pouring the housemates' alcohol down a drain. One of the first things she did when she left the house was to watch the Queen's cameo with Daniel Craig at the Olympics opening ceremony. McLean said: 'I watched the Queen with James Bond and it was brilliant -she proved why she's great for Britain. 'When Prince William got married it was the happiest day of my life. When Prince Philip was ill I got really emotional. It's the one thing in my life that I'm passionate about.' McLean attended Edinburgh's George Watson's College, which charges annual fees of around £9,800, before moving to another school, St Margaret's.

"By . Olivia Fleming . A group of working mothers and bloggers have decided to tackle the growing pressure women feel to snap straight back into shape after giving birth. Baring their own post-baby bodies, seven bloggers from CT Working Moms have embraced their stomachs, in an effort to liberate other women from the unattainable cultural beauty ideals plaguing today's 'bounce-back' obsessed society. In a photo shoot they have named the Goddess Gallery, the women hope to encourage new mothers to accept, and cherish, their changing bodies despite the ever-growing 'body after baby' celebrity worship, and the suffocating negativity that can come with it.

She continued: 'Those women probably worked really hard to take the baby weight off and more power to them, but we average non-Victoria's Secret models do not have the luxury of Photoshop, airbrushing, personal trainers, private chefs, nannies or several pairs of Spanx.

Mrs Fleno wrote: 'It was a completely liberating moment. Some of us started out a bit nervous and shy, but encouraging comments and catcalls from the other ladies... made it easier. 'For me, I know I am far from what I may ultimately want my body to look like, but I know I have never felt more beautiful and accepting of my body.' She continued: 'This turned out to be . more than just a photo shoot to show what real mommy bellies look like . or to help us embrace our body image differences - there are a ton of . websites out there that already do this. 'This was a gathering of Goddesses.' Post-baby stomachs: The women admit they are 'far from' their ultimate bodies, but they say they have never felt more . beautiful and accepting of their body shapes after the photo shoot . The women called the experience 'freeing, inspiring and powerful.' however they have been honest about the internal negative monologue they still struggle against. Mrs Fleno wrote: 'I will admit that when I look at pictures of myself (like I'm sure most women do), I pick apart all of the things I wish were different, more sucked in or just smaller. I end up feeling bad about myself and, instead of throwing in a workout DVD, I head to the freezer for a little therapy in an ice cream pint.

"By . Tamara Cohen . Britain has condemned the release of Taliban prisoners accused of killing and maiming Western forces in Afghanistan. To the fury of the UK, the US and victims' families, president Hamid Karzai has freed 88 dangerous militants from a jail at Bagram, the former US air base run by the Afghan government. The US wants them to be prosecuted and says 30 per cent carried out direct attacks that killed or wounded 60 coalition troops, and 40 per cent killed 57 Afghans, including police and security forces. Transfer: The prison compound before a ceremony handing over the Bagram prison to Afghan authorities, at the U.S. airbase in Bagram, north of Kabul September 10, 2012 . US soldiers stand guard beside prison cells during a media tour of Bagram prison, north of Kabul in 2009 . Last night the Foreign Office . expressed serious concerns about the mass release, which the US says . poses a major security threat, and the likelihood that the fighters . could re-join the insurgency. Tony . Lewis, whose son Conrad was killed in Afghanistan in February 2011, . said Mr Karzai showed scant concern for the lives of troops who served . there. Private Lewis, from . Bournemouth, was killed by gunfire in the Nad Ali district of Helmand . province. The 22-year-old was four months into his tour with 4th . Battalion the Parachute Regiment. Mr . Lewis said: 'We are still dealing with the impact of losing our son and . we valued his life above all else. If people like Karzai are prepared . to negotiate with these people, he clearly puts a low value on the lives . of those who tried to help his country and his people. 'Clearly, he has little regard for the sacrifices they have made. 'He . needs to explain why he is doing this and if he cannot justify it to . the US and UK, he certainly cannot justify it to any parent who has lost . their child there, or to his own people who have suffered at the hands . of the Taliban.' Relations with Afghanistan have grown particularly strained over President Hamid Karzai's refusal to sign a bilateral security deal . The US is . trying to block the release of the prisoners, which critics say is a . concession to the Taliban in the run-up to the country's first . presidential elections in April. Colonel . Dave Lapan, a spokesman for US forces in Afghanistan, said yesterday . that the Afghan Review Board, which proposed the release, had 'exceeded . its mandate'. He said it had 'ordered the release of a number of . dangerous individuals who are legitimate threats and for whom there is . strong evidence supporting prosecution or further investigation'. But the head of the board, Abdul Shakor Dadras, denied that the 88 jailed insurgents posed a threat. He said: 'In many cases, detainees were wrongly linked to certain incidents they were not involved in.' Mr Dadras has been reviewing the cases of 760 prisoners. In total, 650 are being freed. A . Foreign Office spokesman said last night: 'We share the US's serious . concerns about the release of any prisoners involved in attacks in . Afghanistan, and the concerns that they could go on to engage in the . insurgency there.' Bagram . prison, which holds 3,000 inmates 25 miles north of the capital Kabul, . is where many of the most notorious Taliban killers are held. The United States only recently transferred the prison at Bagram to Afghan control after it had become a serious source of tension with the government in Afghanistan which is fighting a Taliban-led insurgency . About 30 percent had participated in direct attacks that killed or wounded 60 U.S. and coalition troops, a U.S. official said . The US had resisted handing it over because it feared dangerous inmates would be released. The . row will fuel concerns about the legacy that Britain will leave . following the 13-year conflict in Afghanistan – less than a month after . David Cameron declared that British troops would accomplish their . mission by the time their withdrawal is completed at the end of this . year. Ex-colonel and former . Tory defence spokesman Patrick Mercer said: 'This is the unacceptable . face of realpolitik. The allies' precipitous departure from Afghanistan . is simply to mean those who have been killing our men are going to be . free in the future. It's disgusting, but we are going to have to get . used to it. 'Karzai has little choice but to negotiate with his former enemies. We have left him without support.' * Bombings and shootings in Iraq killed 7,818 civilians in 2013, the UN said yesterday. The . killings have sparked fears that the country may return to the levels . of slaughter seen between 2004 and 2007, when tens of thousands died . each year.

"By . James Chapman . With the eyes of the world on Britain, there was mounting anger last night over cynical attempts by union leaders to bring chaos to our borders and transport networks. As thousands of athletes and officials pour into the country on the eve of the Olympics, immigration and customs staff are tomorrow due to walk out at Heathrow Airport – a move which the Government could take court action to stop. And from Friday, workers on London Underground, some of whom have already secured Olympic-linked bonuses of up to £1,000, will start a work-to-rule regime. Work-to-rule:  London Underground workers have been instructed to do no more than the minimum required in their contracts from Friday . South West Trains staff, taking visitors to Olympics events in Weymouth, will also work-to-rule during the Games . Similarly, staff on key suburban rail routes to Games sites in London and Weymouth will also begin disruptive action. The moves come as a shocking new analysis reveals the number of working days lost to strikes is escalating dramatically. In 2011, 1,388,000 days were casualties of industrial action – a three-fold increase on the 456,000 in 2009, Labour’s last full year in power. It was the highest figure since 1990, when 1,903,000 days were lost. This morning, Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt told Radio 4's Today programme that he was 'very confident' in contingency plans for Thursday's planned strike by border agency staff. 'We need 550 people to maintain a full immigration desk policy at Heathrow which means we can get people through in the shortest possible time and we have 584 shifts now confirmed for Thursday, despite the strike', he told interviewer James Naughtie. He said fears Heathrow would grind to a halt because of the extra passengers attending the Games had so far failed to materialise, and he commended the situation at the hub airport as 'a tremendous success'. On the planned strike, he said: 'For an immigration officer - and I'm sure the vast majority of immigration officers feel this way - Thursday is one of the biggest days in their professional career. 'It is the day when the eyes of the world will be upon them and the welcome we are giving to the rest of the world. ""The vast majority of them will want to do a really good job and show what they are capable of.' Last night Conservative MP Dominic Raab said there was growing concern that public sector workers were being called out on the basis of tiny turnouts in strike votes. He said there was a clear case to require unions to secure the support of 50 per cent of balloted members to make industrial action legal. Conservative MP Dominic Raab fears strikes are being called as a result of tiny ballot turnouts . Ministers are now considering taking court action over Public and Commercial Services Union leader Mark Serwotka’s decision to call a 24-hour strike by Heathrow staff. Seven out of eight of members of the PCS did not vote to take industrial action in a ballot of Home Office staff. Mr Hunt told Today that Mr Serwotka 'must be losing confidence that what he's doing represents the majority of his members' after the union leader turned down the BBC's invitation to appear on this morning's programme. The possibility of an injunction to block the strike came following a letter to the union from Home Secretary Theresa May, describing the planned walkout as ‘opportunist and wholly unjustified’. And Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude has told colleagues other senior figures in the union movement had privately expressed dismay that the PCS was targeting the Olympic transport rush. Mr Raab said: ‘Mark Serwotka’s vindictive action is the latest in a wave of reckless strikes, led by a few militants who want to sabotage the economy and humiliate the nation. ‘Too often it is those union bosses shouting the loudest who have the least support from their own members. It is welcome that ministers are looking at reform. But, if the government is going to pick this fight, it must win it decisively.’ The strike action was also condemned by Mr Hunt, who said: ‘Any decision to strike during the Olympics is highly regrettable.’ He insisted contingency plans were in place, but added: ‘There will be slightly longer queues than in recent weeks.’ Yesterday union leaders announced London Underground employees are to stage a ‘work-to-rule’ from Friday in an Olympics-related dispute. The Rail, Maritime and Transport union, which represents thousands of Tube staff, said it was in dispute over implementing an Olympics pay deal as well as the use of casual workers. Axed: PCS action that would have led to huge queues at airport immigration tomorrow has been cancelled . The union has already secured Olympics bonuses of up to £1,000 for drivers, with other members of staff in line for up to £850 for the ‘massive additional pressures’ they will face during the Games. The RMT’s South West Trains members will refuse to do any overtime or work on a ‘rest day’ from Friday until August 12. South West Trains operates many of . the key train lines out of London’s Waterloo, such as trains to Eton for . the rowing, Weymouth for the sailing and Wimbledon for the tennis. Members of Bob Crow's Rail, Maritime and Transport union will refuse to work on rest days during the Games . Workers . insist they are furious they are not getting a bonus for working during . the Games. South West Trains, owned by Stagecoach, dismissed this . claim, insisting workers were given an inflation-busting pay rise of . 4.75 per cent just a few months ago. PCS officials were due to hold talks with senior Home Office officials last night over planned border strike. Military police, Whitehall officials and retired border staff are on standby to prevent chaos at the borders if the strike goes ahead. The PCS said: ‘The problem over the past 18 months has been that there has not been the political will in the Home Office to reach a solution.’ RMT secretary Bob Crow said: ‘While the likes of Jeremy Hunt, and the rest of the Government, are sitting in the well-padded VIP seats in the Olympics Stadium as a nice little bonus, our cleaners on the Tube and DLR, who work round the clock in appalling conditions, are being treated like dirt.’ Howard Collins, London Underground’s chief operating officer, said: ‘We reached agreement with all four unions at the end of May on how we can fairly reward our staff and operate services during the London 2012 Games. The fact that four-fifths of those balloted chose not to vote or voted no to industrial action shows that we have the support of our staff.’","Immigration and customs staff begin strike on eve of Olympics on Thursday .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Pushing down prices: Thousands of shoppers have flocked to discount chains such as Lidl . Discount stores such as Aldi and Lidl have forced average shop prices down at the steepest rate for eight years, figures reveal. The overall price of clothing and consumer goods fell by 1.8 per cent last month compared with the previous June. And the figures from the British Retail Consortium/Nielsen shop price index show the price of clothes was down by 13.7 per cent year-on-year. The price of food rose by 0.6 per cent in June, but this was the lowest level of inflation since the index began. Once the mainstay of the working classes, cheap discount stores now have discerning shoppers with a wide range of incomes among their regular customers. The rise of German chains Aldi and Lidl saw hundreds of thousands of customers ditch the ‘Big Four’ supermarkes, Asda, Sainsbury’s, Tesco and Morrisons, which have seen a race-to-the-bottom price slashing. It means consumers are benefiting from the fastest drop in prices since the trade association began compiling data in 2006. Helen Dickinson, British Retail Consortium director general, said: ‘June saw plenty of good news for cash-conscious customers, and confirms that retailers have continued to work hard to help budgets go that bit further over the summer. ‘This is the deepest level of deflation in non-food and the lowest rate of inflation for food since 2006 when our records began. ‘Added to this, we see that consumer confidence is at its highest level since April 2005.’ She said that the supermarket price wars, triggered when Morrisons slashed its charges for 1,200 basic products by up to 60 per cent in May to take on the German discounters, was behind the record figures. Mrs Dickinson said: ‘Fierce competition among grocers has driven food price inflation to record low levels and with some grocers having announced plans to keep prices down, consumers stand to benefit for a while to come.’ Price war: Morrisons slashed the prices of basic items by up to 60 per cent in May to take on German firms . She continued: ‘The backdrop was equally promising with  stable commodity markets  and the continued strength  of sterling suggesting inflation is set to remain low in the medium term. ‘Although of course, a strong pound is not so good for  those retailers exporting, one exciting and growing area in British retail. ‘However, it is clear that retailers are making sure these positive economic benefits in the home market are being passed on to consumers while they themselves will cheer on the very low Producer Price Index – an indication of the cost pressures they face. ‘While the economic recovery continues to gather pace it was not all good news as household disposable incomes remain under pressure. ‘Interestingly, while wage rises remain lacklustre throughout the economy, the squeeze on disposable incomes is not  coming from retail but other areas if the economy such as leisure and recreational activities. ‘With shop price inflation at a record low this is undoubtedly an excellent time to go out and find a bargain.’","Price of clothes and consumer goods fell 1.8% from June 2013 to last month .

"By . Chris Greenwood . and Sam Greenhill . Re-arrested: Veteran DJ Dave Lee Travis (pictured) has been questioned about a string of new allegations of sexual assault . Veteran DJ Dave Lee Travis has been questioned about a string of new allegations of sexual assault. The 67-year-old was re-arrested by Scotland Yard detectives when he answered bail as part of Operation Yewtree. It is understood officers quizzed him about up to 11 fresh ‘incidents’ that have come to light. They are believed to involve several new alleged victims who came forward amid the blaze of publicity surrounding his original arrest last November. In a statement the DJ said his 'conscience is clear' and strongly denied the allegations. Speaking outside his £1m Bedfordshire home yesterday, he said: 'The last four months have been extraordinary. 'Allegations which I strongly deny have been put to me by the police and to which I have given full and complete answers.' Travis already faces claims from two adult women that he molested them in the 1970s and 80s at the height of his fame as one of Britain's best-loved DJs. He said that his 'reputation had been tarnished and dragged through the mud', adding that bosses at Magic AM have said they want him 'back on air'. Since the arrest, the broadcaster said that he had 'lost faith in people' but thanked members of the public and those in the showbusiness industry for their 'amazing support'. Travis had earlier declined to comment on the new claims or his re-arrest, saying: 'I have been into a police station and I have had a chat with them and that is it. They have told me they will make a decision in April. ‘I have not been charged with anything and that is it at the moment. I have to wait until they make up their minds.’ Travis, whose Magic AM show has been taken off air, has told friends he is in ‘no man’s land’ and ‘limbo’ until police complete their inquiries. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Speaking outside his Bedfordshire home yesterday, the broadcaster said his 'reputation had been tarnished and dragged through the mud' Appalled: Travis speaks to the media shortly after his arrest last year to deny claims he molested two adult women in the 1970s and 80s at the height of his fame as one of Britain's best-loved DJs . Shortly after his arrest last year, he denied being a sexual predator and claimed he was simply a ‘man who loves women.’ The . former Radio 1 presenter, nicknamed DLT and The Hairy Cornflake, said . he was accused of ‘squeezing the boobs of a couple of women’. He said none of the allegations involve children and said he was appalled to have his name linked to disgraced DJ Jimmy Savile. Height of fame: Travis sets his alarm clock after it was announced he will be taking over the breakfast show on Radio One from Noel Edmonds in 1978 . Travis was the fourth suspect to . arrested as part of Operation Yewtree, the high-profile inquiry . kick-started by the Savile scandal. In . November, he was held on suspicion of groping former Sky presenter . Vivien Creegor, 55, while she was reading the news on Radio 4. A second unnamed woman has claimed Travis sexually assaulted her after inviting her into his studio to help him select his next music track. Speaking about the original claims, Travis said: ‘I don't even want to be mentioned in the same breath as Savile. We know about Savile - it's frightening. ‘I don't want to be in the same boat. It's too easy, just too easy to make allegations and it's also too easy to pick a target like me.’ Travis, real name David Patrick Griffin, found fame in 1978 when he took over the Radio 1 breakfast show from Noel Edmonds. The . star, who lives with wife Marianne and their two dogs, was also a . regular host of Top Of The Pops alongside Savile in the 1970s and 80s. Others . arrested as part of Yewtree include pop paedophile Gary Glitter, 68, PR . supremo Max Clifford, 69, and comedian Jim Davidson, 59. A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: ‘A man in his 60s returned on bail on Monday. ‘On . his return he was further arrested on suspicion of sexual offences in . connection with further allegations made to Operation Yewtree.’ DJ Dave Lee Travis insisted yesterday that his 'conscience is clear' and denied any wrongdoing after he was arrested for a second time over sexual assault allegations. The 67-year-old was originally arrested by Operation Yewtree detectives investigating the Jimmy Savile abuse scandal in November. He answered bail on Monday and was re-arrested in connection with further allegations, and later bailed until April. Speaking outside his home in Bedfordshire, he said: 'The last four months have been extraordinary. Allegations which I strongly deny have been put to me by the police and to which I have given full and complete answers. I have fully co-operated and my conscience is clear.' At the time of his arrest in November, Travis denied any wrongdoing and stressed that the allegations against him had nothing to do with children. Yesterday he said he is one of many people facing claims under Operation Yewtree. He said: 'It is public knowledge that they are carrying out a wide-ranging investigation concerning allegations made against many people over many decades. I'm simply one of those people. 'I ask you to take into account that I was not and have not been charged with anything by the police. I repeat that: I have not been charged on anything by the police.' The Magic AM presenter, who was taken off air in the wake of his first arrest, said those close to him have been 'extremely distressed' at the way he has been treated. He said: 'I deny any wrongdoing whatsoever, notwithstanding this my reputation has been tarnished and dragged through the mud. 'My wife and I and close friends have been extremely distressed by this treatment and I have lost faith in people who have conducted themselves in such a spiteful way, causing hurt and upset for the sake of sensationalism and for the purpose of selling newspapers. 'On the other hand, I have had amazing support from many people in the business, in the public, listeners, all over the place, for which I am truly grateful. 'I am a broadcaster who has now been off the air for the longest period ever in my 50 years behind a microphone. That's because of this current situation. 'My bosses on the Magic network have also told me they want me back on air just as soon as this is all settled and I am also obviously very grateful for their support.

"By . Jason Groves, Deputy Political Editor . Thousands of pubs have agreed to serve weaker house wine as part of a deal by the drinks industry to head off tougher alcohol laws. Industry chiefs met ministers on Monday to thrash out the latest stage in the Government’s ‘responsibility deal’ with the food and drink industry. Representatives of more than 20,000 pubs and bars said they would offer lower-strength house wines containing no more than 12 per cent alcohol. Representatives of more than 20,000 pubs and bars have said they will offer wine that contain less than 12 per cent alcohol . House wine is traditionally the biggest seller for most pubs and concern has grown at the increasing strength being offered in recent years. Wines containing 14 per cent alcohol or more are no longer uncommon. Under the new guidance a typical bottle will contain no more than 12 per cent. It means a glass of house wine will contain about 14 per cent less alcohol. However, Tory MP Philip Davies condemned the proposal as ‘nanny state nonsense’. Mr Davies said ministers should focus on cracking down on problem drinkers and yobs rather than interfering in the wider industry. ‘Why should the overwhelming majority of responsible drinkers be denied the drink of their choice because of a lunatic minority?’ he said. ‘This is a sort of nanny state measure I would expect from a Labour government – not a Conservative government.’ Health campaigners warned that the deal did not go far enough. But ministers welcomed the package, which also includes a pledge by supermarkets to reduce the prominence of beer, wine and spirits in stores and a ban on big cans of super-strength lager and cider. The drinks industry has also agreed to fund a small team to travel round schools to teach children about responsible drinking. Home Secretary Theresa May said alcohol-fuelled harm costs the taxpayer £21billion a year and the drinks industry had a responsibility to help tackle the problem. Mrs May said: ‘It is right that the alcohol industry is taking action to help reduce this burden, without penalising those that drink responsibly. We now look forward to seeing the positive impact of these pledges and continuing to work with industry to explore what else can be done to tackle alcohol abuse.’ But health campaigners condemned the backroom deal, saying it was no substitute for new laws such as a minimum price for alcohol, which was abandoned by the Government last year. They say the increasing strength of popular wines raises the risk of serious complaints such as liver disease. Persuading manufacturers and retailers to reduce the strength of wines and beers is a key part of the Government’s drive to reduce alcohol harm without resorting  to legislation. Sir Ian Gilmore, adviser to the Royal College of Physicians and chairman of the Alcohol Health Alliance, said: ‘It is frustrating to see the Government continually fail to take the action that is needed to effectively tackle increasing alcohol harms in the UK. ‘One person dies every single hour from alcohol-related causes. It is simply not good enough for the Government to rely on voluntary commitments from the alcohol industry, brokered behind closed doors, to deal with those problems.’ The agreement to curb the strength of house wine was made by the British Beer and Pub Association, whose members own more than 20,000 pubs and bars across the country. Ministers hope other pubs and restaurants will follow suit over time. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the so-called ‘responsibility deal’ would help take one billion units of alcohol out of the market in the coming years. Ministers have acted to curb the practice of below-cost selling of wine, beer and spirits by supermarkets. But they rejected plans for minimum pricing last year amid fears it would alienate cash-strapped families.","20,000 pubs and bars say they will offer lower-strength house wines .

"By . Ian Drury . and James Slack . Mark Sedwill has admitted that crucial files which could expose historical child sex abuse are likely to have been shredded . Explosive dossiers allegedly revealing the identities of a paedophile ring operating at Westminster have ‘probably been destroyed’, it was revealed last night. The Home Office’s top mandarin Mark Sedwill has admitted that crucial files which could expose historical child sex abuse are likely to have been shredded. On a day when the scandal at Westminster deepened, it also emerged that: . The late Mr Dickens planned to expose eight Establishment figures connected to child abuse. But it is now understood that there are likely to be more than eight names listed in the dossier – some of which are said to be ‘breathtaking’. Last year Mr Sedwill, permanent secretary at the under-fire Home Office, led a review into his department’s handling of child abuse allegations between 1979 and 1999. He discovered that 114 files which could have shed light on abuse – possibly involving high-ranking politicians – were missing, and four which named suspected paedophiles had never been passed to the police. The late Mr Dickens (pictured)  planned to expose eight figures connected to child abuse . During a stormy session of the Home Affairs Select Committee yesterday, he stressed that his review had failed to uncover any ‘sinister’ reason for their disappearance. But he said the files had ‘probably’ been destroyed after two years, rather than lost, and so could never be recovered. He told MPs: ‘Most of these files were probably destroyed, because the kind of topics that they covered would have been subject to the normal file destruction procedures.’ Home Office advisers in the 1970s called for the age of consent to be lowered to 14  and sought to reduce punishment for so-called ‘consensual’ sex with girls as young as 12. An internal document from 1979 reveals that officials wanted the age of consent lowered by two years from 16, and pressed for maximum life sentences to be reduced to no more than two years in cases of underage sex with 13-year-olds where ‘consent’ could be shown. In cases of ‘younger offenders’, greater leniency would apply when the ‘consenting’ victim was 12. Today, sex with a 12-year-old can attract a life sentence. Roy Walmsley and Karen White, the authors of the Home Office booklet entitled Sexual Offences, Consent and Sentencing, argued that many girls reach puberty before their 12th birthday and may initiate sex. In the booklet, obtained by The Guardian, the report’s authors state: ‘There is scope for amending the law to coincide with sentencing practice. ‘The higher penalties . . . could be available when victims/partners are under 13 (perhaps limiting them in the case of younger offenders to when girls involved are under 12).’ They add: ‘Paradoxical though it might seem to argue that [the point at which tougher sentences are applied] should be lower than the average age of puberty [13], it is not unreasonable . . . A large number of 12-year-old girls have already attained puberty and may not only be willing to take part in sexual activity but may actually initiate it.’ However despite Mr Sedwill’s suggestion that files had been shredded, a Labour MP last night made the explosive claim that the dossier had been ‘widely circulated’ around Whitehall – and is likely to have survived. It has emerged that the ten-page dossier was copied and given to civil servants in other departments, all of whom had to sign the Official Secrets Act because of the seniority of the names it contained. Today John Mann, MP for Bassetlaw, will call for the OSA to be lifted for this item only, to enable potential whistleblowers with copies to bring it into the public domain. Last night Mr Mann told the Mail: ‘There are multiple copies of that dossier which were circulated at the time across other departments. There was a meeting at the time in Whitehall where everyone had a copy.’ He added: ‘Without question, there are multiple copies out there. All it requires is for the Official Secrets Act to be lifted on this item in order for a copy to come forward. 'People will then know the evidence, and there are some breathtaking names.’ Meanwhile, MPs raised the prospect that MI5 could be storing copies of the dossier. The Security Services are tasked with finding any information which could be used to blackmail MPs into giving up State secrets. MI5 is known to have a detailed file on the allegations against Liberal Democrat MP and notorious paedophile Cyril Smith, which was passed on by police. Tory MP Michael Ellis said: ‘Files of a similar nature, which relate to the integrity of MPs, historically have been copied by the Security Services.’ Yesterday Home Secretary Theresa May said that provided there was no threat to national security, the fresh probe – led by NSPCC chief Sir Peter Wanless – would be able to access intelligence held by MI5 and MI6. And significantly the job of assisting Mr Wanless has been given to Official Secrets Act expert Richard Whittam QC, who has the highest possible level of security clearance. But the Home Secretary was yesterday criticised after it was revealed that Mr Sedwill had only shared the ‘broad conclusions’ of his review with her in June. Labour’s home affairs spokesman Yvette Cooper said: ‘There are clearly big questions for the Home Secretary to answer. Neither she nor her senior official appear to have been briefed on its contents.’ Elizabeth Butler-Sloss will head the panel . Retired judge Elizabeth Butler-Sloss was yesterday appointed to head the panel investigating the establishment’s failure to protect children from abuse by paedophiles. The 80-year-old will head a wide-ranging Hillsborough-style inquiry into historic abuses in Westminster, Whitehall, churches, children’s homes and elsewhere. Baroness Butler-Sloss led the Cleveland child abuse inquiry in the late Eighties that led to more than 100 children being removed from their families. More recently, she quit the inquest . into the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, and Dodi Fayed, admitting . she did not have sufficient experience of high-profile jury cases. Mark . Sedwill, permanent secretary at the Home Office, said she would not . pursue individual cases of abuse, but insisted that her investigation . would ‘leave no stone unturned’. Lady . Butler-Sloss will now appoint her panel and agree the terms of . reference. However, the inquiry is not expected to report before the . general election next May. It . does not have the power to compel witnesses to attend or take an oath, . but Home Secretary Theresa May said it could be converted into a full . public inquiry if necessary.","Mark Sedwill admitted crucial files are likely to have been shredded .

"By . Lee Moran . Updated: . 08:38 EST, 27 January 2012 . Two Iranian bloggers are to be executed for 'spreading corruption' - as Tehran cracks down on freedom of expression in the run up to its parliamentary elections in March. Four journalists have also been arrested, prompting the U.S. State Department to urge Iranian officials to 'protect the rights of all its citizens and uphold the rule of law'. It comes as Israel said the world must act quickly to stop Iran from developing nuclear weapons, and the UN urged the West to resume talks with the pariah state. Crack down: Two Iranian bloggers are to be executed for 'spreading corruption' as the country, whose President is Mahmoud Ahmadinejad (pictured) curbs freedom of expression in the run up to its parliamentary elections in March . Talks: Israel's defence minister Ehud Barak (left) says the world must act on Iran soon, as UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon (right) urged a resumption of dialogue with the West . And it is two days before Iran's parliament debates whether to stop exports of oil to the European Union, which if approved could start as early as next week. It would deny the EU a six-month phase-in of the embargo on Iranian oil it agreed on Monday as part of tough new sanctions aimed at forcing the curbing of its nuclear programme. It followed U.S. action aimed at limiting the country's ability to sell oil, which accounts for 80 per cent of Iran's foreign revenue. On the arrests and imminent executions, U.S. State Department spokesman Victoria Nuland said: 'We are deeply concerned by the alarming increase in the Iranian regime's efforts to extinguish all forms of free expression and limit its citizens' access to information.' Suspicions: Britain's pondering comes as Iran made its first move in attempts to gain an edge in nuclear talks with the U.S. and other world powers . Provocative? The USS Abraham Lincoln is one of the warships passing through the controversial Strait of Hormuz . She said security forces had, in the last two weeks, reportedly arrested journalists Shahram Manouchehri, Sahamedin Bourghani, Parastoo Dokouhaki, and Marzieh Rasouli. The export of Iranian oil to the European Union could be stopped as early as next week - if Iran's parliament approves a new law on Sunday. Parliament is pushing for the export ban to deny the EU a six-month phase-in of the embargo on oil that the bloc agreed on Monday. It is part of a raft of tough new Western sanctions aimed at forcing Iran to curb its nuclear programme. The EU accounted for 18 per cent of Iranian crude oil sales in the first half of 2011, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. It was Iran's second biggest customer after China. MP Moayed Hosseini-Sadr said: 'If the deputies arrive at the conclusion the Iranian oil exports to Europe must be halted, the parliament will not delay a moment (in passing the bill). 'If Iran's oil exports to Europe, which is about 18 per cent (of Iran's oil exports) is halted the Europeans will surely be taken by surprise. 'They will understand the power of Iran and will realise that the Islamic establishment will not succumb to the Europeans' policies.' And she added: 'Iranian courts confirmed death sentences for bloggers Saeed Malekpour and Vahid Asghari, both of whom were not accorded due process and now face imminent execution on charges of 'spreading corruption.' All eyes have been focused on Iran in recent weeks as fears grow Iran's enrichment of uranium could lead to the production of weapons-grade material. Iran insists its atomic programme is only aimed at producing energy and research, but has repeatedly refused to consider giving up its ability to enrich. To counter this, the West has increased sanctions and warships, including the British frigate HMS Argyll, have sailed into the strategic Strait of Hormuz - the world's busiest oil-route which Iran has threatened to close in response to the sanctions. Yesterday President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad held out an olive branch to the West when he indicated Iran was ready to revive talks with the West. With a senior UN nuclear agency team expected to visit the capital tomorrow - the first since a report in November alleged Iran was on the brink of developing a nuclear weapon - he said his country was not 'shunning talks'  and was available for discussion. But today Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak said the world must quickly stop Iran from reaching the point where even a 'surgical' military strike could not block it from obtaining nuclear weapons. He said tougher international sanctions were needed against Tehran's oil and banks so that 'we all will know early enough whether the Iranians are ready to give up their nuclear weapons program.' Curb: The EU is implementing a six-month phase-in of an embargo on Iranian oil as part of tough new sanctions . Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, he said the situation is 'urgent, because the Iranians are deliberately drifting into what we call an immunity zone where practically no surgical operation could block them'. Israeli computer hackers took a series of key Iranian websites offline, the Jerusalem Post has reported. English-language Iranian media outlet Press TV, Iranian Ministry of Health and Medical Education were all targeted. Two websites belonging to the Islamic Republic's Ministry of Health and Medical Education were also hit yesterday. The hackers, dubbed the IDF Team, said their actions were a response to a series of attacks on Israeli sites the previous day. Three other Iranian sites were hacked and their servers altered to display an Israeli flag and anti-Arab text in English. An internet feud between the two countries started earlier this month when an Arab hacker published tens of thousands of Israeli credit card numbers on the Internet. To try and defuse tensions, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon today urged a resumption of dialogue between Western powers and Iran on their nuclear dispute Friday. He also said Tehran must comply with Security Council resolutions and prove conclusively that its nuclear development programme is not directed to making arms. He said: 'The onus is on Iran. They have to prove themselves that their nuclear development programme is genuinely for peaceful purposes, which they have not done yet.' Ban expressed concern at the most recent report of the International Atomic Energy Agency that strongly suggested that the programme  has a military intent. In spite of his tough words to Iran, Ban said that dialogue with the 'three-plus-three' - Germany, France and Britain plus Russia, China and the United States - is the path forward. He added: 'There is no other alternative for addressing this crisis than peaceful... resolution through dialogue.' Ban noted that there have been a total of five Security Council resolutions so far on the Iranian nuclear program, four calling for sanctions. As tensions have been on the rise recently, some political leaders in Israel and the United States have been speaking increasingly of the possibility of a military strike to eliminate, or at least slow down, what they allege is a determined effort by Iran to obtain nuclear weapons.","Four journalists also arrested in moves to curb freedom of expression .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Entrepreneur Duncan Bannatyne said he did not plan to make any more investments on the TV show after 2014 so it was only fair to offer his seat to someone else . As the most formidable beast in the Dragons' Den, he has chewed up and spat out more than a few bad ideas. But after considering business propositions for 12 series of the BBC2 show, Duncan Bannatyne has had his fill, telling producers: 'I'm out.' The health club boss was one of the original team of business experts when the programme launched nine years ago and his departure leaves just Peter Jones from the starting line-up of Dragons. He announced today that the forthcoming series - beginning on July 20 - will be his last as he leaves the programme 'due to other business commitments'. In the programme Bannatyne, 65, and the other judges invest their own cash in ideas pitched by budding entrepreneurs. He said: 'I have had the time of my life as a Dragon, I have made numerous investments and taken part in a landmark TV programme that has promoted entrepreneurship to an entire generation of Britons. 'However, after the 2014 recordings I do not plan to make any further investments on the programme so I thought it fair to ask producers to offer my seat to somebody else. There are only so many times I can say 'I'm out'. 'The series that is about to be transmitted is my final season and I'm delighted that it is full of exciting, high quality pitches. I have made a number of investments and it really is must-see business TV.' Bannatyne, who had a health scare two years ago, built up his fortune with nursing homes and nurseries before founding his health club and spa chain in 1997. He was awarded an OBE for his support of charities. Mark Linsey, the BBC's controller for entertainment commissioning, said: 'Duncan has been the most formidable Dragon and we are going to miss him enormously. He has inspired many entrepreneurs to come on the show and helped make Dragons' Den a huge success for BBC2. Bannatyne, pictured at his Covent Garden home, was one of the most formidable and long serving 'Dragons' 'His seat is going to be a difficult one to fill, but he leaves the show on a high, with this next series being the best yet.' Bannatyne, who has earned a reputation as a no-nonsense and tough negotiator on the show, is expected to remain on screen until early next year.","Dragons' Den star Duncan Bannatyne steps down after 12 series with show .

"By . James Slack . The failure of Britain’s school system is putting huge strain on society by forcing businesses to turn to millions of foreign workers to fill low-skilled jobs. Too many school leavers lack even the most basic skills to ‘look people in the eye and get out of bed’, according to immigration experts. They are also given little incentive to work by the benefits system, the government-appointed Migration Advisory Committee claimed. Too many school leavers lack even the most basic skills to ¿look people in the eye and get out of bed¿, according to immigration experts . As a result, businesses have had to turn to workers from overseas who are better qualified, more reliable, confident and – unlike young Britons – have the good ‘manners’ needed to work in shops. However, MAC said there were significant downsides of adding so many foreign workers to the population since 1997, with schools, hospitals and roads ‘struggling to cope’. In a 350-page report, MAC said foreign-born workers now fill 16 per cent of low-skill jobs, compared with 7 per cent in 1997. At the same time, the number of British-born workers in low-skilled jobs has fallen by around one million. It blamed a target-driven regime that is interested only in the academically gifted, at the expense of the less able. There are now around 1.3million 16- to 24-year-olds who are not in full-time education or working, of whom around 600,000 have no ‘identifiable barrier’ to employment. where they are from.jpg . The panel also confirmed the wages of the low-paid Britons who do have jobs have been driven down, and cohesion and national ‘wellbeing’ are suffering. There is also evidence that, in areas where there has been a large influx of migrants, house prices are falling as British people choose to move out. The MAC, headed by Sir David Metcalf, carried out an investigation of the impact of low-skilled workers on British life and the reasons so many have arrived. Between 1997 and 2013 there was a 1.1million expansion in the low-skilled immigrant workforce, filling jobs in shops, factories and processing plants, and taking the total to 2.1million. One million of them have come in the past ten years, half from central and eastern Europe. MAC said it did not believe the ‘recent deterioration in the youth labour  market was a direct consequence of increased competition for jobs following the inflow of migrant workers, especially after 2004’. Sir David Metcalf instead laid much of the blame at the door of the education system, which focused on the brightest students, to the detriment of the less academically gifted. He said: ‘Schools presently have an incentive to boost the number of A*-C grades in GCSE exams. ‘This may imply insufficient attention is given to those towards the bottom of the ability range. Many apprenticeships do not stretch the individual sufficiently and have too little employer input. ‘Greater attention needs to be given to raising the awareness of, and adjusting aspirations towards, available opportunities and improving the soft skills of those at the lower end of the ability range.’ The committee interviewed a string of major employers who suggested that migrant workers meet their requirements, ‘while British workers either do not or would not apply for the job in the first place’. Sir David said many school leavers lack even the ability to ‘look people in the eye and get out of bed in the morning’. Last night, immigration minister James Brokenshire told the Mail: ‘This report is a depressing indictment of Labour’s record, not just on immigration but right across the board: an education system that failed to equip too many people for the world of work, a skills policy that failed to help people with basic literacy and numeracy, and a welfare system that failed to help people off the dole. ‘The result was a reliance on low-skilled migrant labour and an immigration system that was out of control. ‘This is why it’s so important for government not just to reduce and control immigration, but to reform schools, reform welfare and get more people into training and apprenticeships.’ The MAC report said it had found no significant evidence of migrants forcing Britons out of the jobs market or leading to a rise in crime. But it concluded that the winners of mass immigration were the migrants themselves, who earn higher wages than are available at home. Their impact on GDP per head, productivity and prices – the crucial battleground between the two sides in the immigration debate – was ‘very modest’. In response, Sir Andrew Green of Migrationwatch said: ‘This is a remarkably comprehensive report. It finds that the impact of low-skilled immigration on both GDP per head and productivity is “tiny”. ‘It also acknowledges additional pressures on housing, health and education. So one has to ask why some people are so keen to promote mass immigration in the teeth of public opinion.’ The MAC also warned that future expansion of the European Union must be handled carefully.Standards in schools are a recurring concern among business leaders, several of whom have publicly aired their views. Sir Stuart Rose, the former Marks and Spencer boss, said too many school leavers struggled with reading, writing and arithmetic. The experts found wages of the British low-paid have been driven down and there is little enforcement of the payment of the minimum wage to migrants. Overall, just a quarter of councils have absorbed three-quarters of the 2.9million rise in the non-UK born population since 2001, putting pressure on education, health, and the housing market and potential problems around ‘cohesion, integration and wellbeing’. The biggest increases have come in Lincolnshire, Cambridgeshire, Northamptonshire and London. The report said the composition of many local areas had ‘altered rapidly’ creating ‘congestion’. This includes pressure on maternity services, transport and schools, particularly from ‘churning’, where the children of migrant workers arrive or leave mid-term.","Businesses have had to turn to workers from overseas .

"By . Peter Campbell . Court appearance: Taxpayers have already paid out half a million pounds in legal fees to defend Fred Goodwin . Taxpayers have forked out almost half a million pounds in legal fees to defend disgraced former Royal Bank of Scotland boss Fred Goodwin, it emerged last night. Costs of £400,000 have already been racked up by law firms representing four former directors of the bank against a lawsuit brought by its shareholders – even though the case has still not reached court. If it does, the final bill will run to millions of pounds. Mr Goodwin’s legal fees are being paid by the bank, despite the fact he draws a £342,500-a-year pension. RBS is 82 per cent owned by the taxpayer after being bailed out during the financial crisis. It means that the bank is effectively being subsidised by public funds to defend bosses who led it to the biggest state rescue in British corporate history. The Mail revealed last year that taxpayers would end up footing the bill for the lawsuit, because it is normal for companies to pay the legal fees of former directors. Leading City law firm Herbert Smith is representing RBS and the former directors, but it is understood that other firms have also been drafted in. Banking sources last night said it was ‘absolutely impossible’ to estimate how much the suit would end up costing. RBS has previously said that the total could reach an eye-watering £42million. The revelations of the scale of the costs so far caused fury. Labour MP John Mann said: ‘This is a disgrace. It’s a staggering amount of money and will only climb higher. It shouldn’t be happening, especially when the taxpayer owns this bank.’ Almost 400,000 shareholders, including many retail investors, have joined the RBS Shareholder Action Group, which is bringing the case. RBS is 82 per cent owned by the taxpayer after being bailed out during the financial crisis . During 2008 investors were asked to spend £12billion buying new shares to help the bank fund new deals. The bank held large breakfast gatherings for interested shareholders, in which directors assured them of the health of the business. But in the months that followed the value of the shares collapsed as the bank came to the brink of financial ruin. In total, there are four cases being brought against the bank, which will be wrapped into one hearing expected to start next year. Mr Goodwin, who was stripped of his knighthood, is expected to appear in court. The other directors named in the case are former chairman Sir Tom McKillop, ex-finance chief Guy Whittaker and former investment banking boss Johnny Cameron. RBS refused to comment on the cost. A spokesman said: ‘We believe we have strong defences to the claims that are being brought against the bank.’","Costs of £400,000 have already been racked up by law firms .

"By . Helen Pow . Utah Supreme Court justices have deemed a 13-year-old girl and a 12-year-old boy both sex offenders and victims for having sex with each other. The Ogden girl and her boyfriend were each found guilty of violating a state law that prohibits sex with someone under age 14, after the 2003 encounter which resulted in the girl becoming pregnant. The unnamed girl, who is now 23, is asking the high court to overturn the juvenile conviction, claiming the consensual sex shouldn't qualify as a crime because it doesn't for 16 or 17-year-olds who have sex with someone in their own age group, and she has a right to be treated equally under the law. Oral arguments on the motion began this week and on Tuesday, the justices acknowledged they were struggling with the concept that the girl could be both victim and offender. Offenders and victims: Utah Supreme Court justices have dubbed a 13-year-old girl and a 12-year-old boy both sex offenders and victims for having sex with each other (stock photo) 'The only thing that comes close to . this is dueling,' said Associate Chief Justice Michael Wilkins, . referring to two people who take 20 paces and then shoot each other. According to the Salt Lake Tribune, Chief Justice Christine Durham labelled the predicament a 'peculiar consequence' and wondered if legislators had intended it. State authorities filed delinquency - the term used for juvenile convictions - petitions in July 2004. These . alleged the boyfriend and girlfriend had each committed sexual abuse of . a child, a second-degree felony if committed by an adult. The girl appealed the petition, saying that because her boyfriend was the same age as her she shouldn't be penalized. Children . aged 14 or 15 can be charged with unlawful conduct with a minor if they . have sex with a peer, but mitigation renders the offense a misdemeanor. Appeal: The girl has brought a motion to dismiss the conviction, and justices at Utah Supreme Court, pictured, were perplexed by the case on Tuesday . But for juveniles under 14, there is no mitigation as the law deems them incapable of consenting to sex. A juvenile court judge denied the motion brought by the girl and the Utah Court of Appeals last December upheld the judge's refusal to dismiss the allegation, saying the law had to protect minors from each other as well as from older teens and adults. The girl then appealed to the state Supreme Court. During Tuesday's hearing, assistant Utah attorney general Matthew Bates argued that the law was designed to prevent sex with children who are 13 and younger, even if the other person is in the same age group. He said legislators were sending a message with the law that sex with or among children is unacceptable. However, Randall Richards, the girl's attorney, claims prosecuting children under a law meant to protect them doesn't make sense. 'A child (victim) cannot also be a perpetrator in the exact same act,' Richards said, according to the Tribune. The Utah Supreme Court will issue a ruling at a later date.","The two Ogden, Utah minors had consensual sex in 2003, which resulted in a pregnancy .

Local politicians want to follow police clampdowns on potential licensing breaches by bars and unruly behaviour by tourists with a costly publicity push targeted in the UK to persuade tourists Magaluf is not all sex and cheap alcohol. Party capital: Magaluf, popular for its cheap clubs and bars, has earned its reputation as one of the top places for drinking and clubbing holidays in Europe.

"By . Corey Charlton . Speculation is mounting that giant panda Tian Tian is pregnant after staff at Edinburgh Zoo confirmed they were 'pretty sure' she is expecting. Tian Tian was artificially inseminated with samples from the zoo’s male panda, Yang Guang, in April, after introductions between the pair were attempted but unsuccessful. Keepers have been raising hopes that it will be third time lucky after the couple failed to mate in 2012 and Tian Tian lost a foetus late in pregnancy in 2013. Although she has conceived, her pregnancy is not yet certain as fertilised giant panda eggs do not immediately implant on the mother’s uterine wall - but instead 'float' around in the reproductive tract for varying lengths of time. Scroll down for video . Tian Tian, based at Edinburgh Zoo, could soon be the mother of the first ever giant panda cub born in Britain . But urine tests have revealed she has successfully conceived, which means a major hurdle has been cleared in the zoo’s bid to add to its panda family. And if the embryo has successfully implanted into Tian-Tian’s womb, a baby panda could arrive as early as next month. If successful it will make history as the first baby giant panda born in the UK. However, keepers will not know for sure until just before the panda gives birth. lain Valentine, director of Giant Pandas for the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland, hoped pregnancy would begin in 20 to 30 days. 'A technique called a CP test - ceruloplasmin to give it the proper name - was performed using urine samples at seven to ten days after artificial insemination in April and this indicates that Tian Tian has conceived.' Tian Tian pictured relaxing in her compound in Edinburgh Zoo after her first round of artificial insemination . Mr Valentine said: 'It is important to stress that this test tells us only that she has conceived, not that implantation has occurred, as pandas practise delayed implantation. 'After this, if successful, Tian Tian would give birth roughly around late August. 'At this stage the embryo is still in diapause or rest, so technically pregnancy has not occurred yet. 'There are many more significant developments still to happen. Tian Tian is in great health - very relaxed, at a great weight and eating well and keepers and scientists continue to monitor her.' Panda expert Jeroen Jacobs said the positive test was 'a good thing', and made a pregnancy more likely. He said: 'She has conceived, but that doesn’t mean it’s sure that she is pregnant. 'It’s . always a wait until the final minute, so it’s not certain that . something will happen this summer in Edinburgh - but it makes it . possible. It’s already a good thing, but it’s still early.' The . artificial insemination was carried out in April and pregnancy would be . expected to come to term in late August or early September. Keepers will now be looking for signs of changed behaviour in Tian-Tian, particularly in terms of how she is nesting. Giant . panda Tian Tian, which means Sweetie, and Yang Guang, which means . Sunshine, became the first to live at a UK zoo in 17 years when they . arrived in December 2011. Both pandas are currently ten years old and on loan from China until 2021. A zoo spokeswoman added: 'There is no definitive information, but we are obviously very hopeful for it.' Tian Tian, pictured left, previously failed to reproduce with the zoo's male panda Yang Guang, right. Zoo bosses were hopeful the two would mate but moved to artificial insemination after her hormone levels started to fall . Zookeepers will now be on the lookout for signs of a change in behaviour for Tian Tian, particularly in how she is nesting.

"By . Lydia Warren . and David Mccormack . An online fundraising page for a three-year-old girl who was allegedly kicked out of a Mississippi KFC because of her facial scars has been removed amid doubts over her family's claims. The GoFundMe page, which had raised more than $135,000 towards Victoria Wilcher's care, was removed on Tuesday after an investigation found no evidence that the girl's family had been to fast-food restaurant as they had claimed. 'In lieu of the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the 'Victoria's Victories' online fundraising effort, GoFundMe has temporarily suspended the campaign until the full truth is made clear,' GoFundMe CEO Brad Damphousse said in a statement. Hoax? Victoria Wilcher's grandmother claimed they had been asked to leave a KFC because of the girl's facial scars - but amid doubts the story is true, online fundraising for the girl has been suspended . Shut down: When you visit Victoria Wilcher's fundraising page, it no longer exists . Damphousse said a hold has been placed on the account balance in the meantime and that donors can request a refund via the website if they so wish, ABC News reported. A Facebook page, 'Victoria’s Victories', that was set up for the little girl has also been removed. The page had claimed that the three-year-old girl, who had lost an eye and suffered facial scars after she was attacked by her grandfather's pit bull in April, had been asked to leave a KFC. The grandmother previously told WAPT that she ‘ordered a sweet tea and mashed potatoes and gravy’ at the restaurant before they were asked to leave because her scars were making other customers feel uncomfortable. After posting the claims on the Facebook . page, KFC immediately apologized and pledged to donate $30,000 towards . the little girl's medical bills. KFC has said it intends to honor its . commitment despite the findings of the investigations. Two different investigations failed to find any evidence that an employee asked the girl and her grandmother to leave. Victoria's grandmother, Kelly Mullins, left, continues to stand by her story, despite an independent inquiry finding no evidence to back up her claims . No . shows: After reviewing surveillance tape from the . branch the investigators have found that the girl and her grandmother, . who claimed they had been asked to leave, didn't even visit the . restaurant that day . Hannon . Food Services, which operates the KFC restaurant, also issued a . statement in which said it said it was deeply troubled by the . allegation. As . part of its investigation, Hannon said it spent hundreds of hours . reviewing surveillance video, interviewing employees and hired the . outside investigator. The company said it would reach out to the child's . family for additional discussions. An unnamed source involved in the investigation told the Laurel Leader-Call that all the evidence in the case suggests the story told by Victoria's grandmother, Kelly Mullins, on May 15 was a hoax. After . reviewing surveillance tape from the Woodrow Wilson Drive branch – and . another in Jackson - investigators found that the woman and the little . girl didn't even visit the restaurant that day. A . review of transactions on May 15 at both Jackson locations found the . items the grandmother had claimed to have bought weren’t included in the . same order at any point. And no one . matching the description of Mullins or Victoria visited either . restaurant, the Leader-Call reported. 'It just didn’t happen,' the . source told the newspaper. KFC . spokesman Rick Maynard said on Tuesday the company considered the . matter closed after an internal investigation by the franchise . restaurant in Jackson, Mississippi, and an independent probe. Attack: Victoria is pictured left before the . attack in April. Right, she is pictured the hospital six hours after her . grandfather's dogs attacked her - claiming her right eye in the . incident and causing facial paralysis . Getting better: She is expected to undergo several more surgeries in the future as she heals from the attack . ‘Like the . rest of America, the KFC family has been moved by the story of . Victoria's injuries and recovery,’ Maynard said. ‘We hope everyone keeps . Victoria in their thoughts and prayers. She will certainly be in ours.’ According . to a statement issued on Tuesday by the family’s attorney Bill Kellum, . Victoria's grandmother, Kelly Mullins, stands by her claim of what . happened at the restaurant. 'Victoria's . family appreciates the actions of KFC in their investigation of this . matter. They look forward to assisting KFC in what we hope will be an . ongoing investigation,' he said. 'It is deeply disappointing that other parties have taken opportunity to attack Victoria through social and news media outlets. Victoria is an innocent child with very real physical and emotional scars. 'The focus . of her family has always been, and will always be on Victoria and . making her whole again,' Kellum said. He said the child's family is . grateful for outpouring of concern for her. The . family-maintained Facebook page also issued a statement on Tuesday . denying that the whole thing was hoax, although just hours later the . page was taken down. Denial: In a statement posted on Facebook on Tuesday, the family denied they had made up the story and said the investigation was ongoing . 'I promise its not a hoax, I never . thought any of this would blow up the way it has. ... Please do not . believe untrue media. I have personally watched this family go without . to provide for Victoria. They have not and would not do anything to hurt . Victoria in any way,' read the statement. Victoria had been injured in April when three of her grandfather's pit . bull dogs ran into his home in Simpson County by ripping through the back door of the home before jumping on her. She was rushed to the emergency room. She suffered a shattered top and . bottom jaw, broken cheekbones and eyesockets, a broken nose, lost her . right eye, and lost the ability to move the right side of her face. Her grandfather was arrested on charges of child endangerment and their eight surviving pit bulls were seized by Animal . Control officers. It is unclear if Kelly Mullins will face criminal charges if found to have made up the incident.","KFC intends to honor its commitment to donate $30,000 towards Victoria Wilcher's medical bills .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . An Afghan presidential candidate today made veiled threats of civil war as he claimed election results had been distorted by voter fraud. Abdullah Abdullah told thousands of supporters at a rally in Kabul he had been called by both Barack Obama and John Kerry after he refused to accept the preliminary results. Although he asked supporters for a few days to negotiate, there were fears that Mr Abdullah could ignore the result and declare victory, something he hinted at during his speech. Afghan presidential candidate Abdullah Abdullah addresses supporters in Kabul, where he told them he would not accept the preliminary result of the election which placed his rival Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai well in the lead . Mr Abdullah's supporters cheer their candidate at the packed rally. He told them he had been called by both Barack Obama and John Kerry and expected a visit from the U.S. Secretary of State on Friday for talks . He said: 'People across the county call on us to announce our government and I can't not say no to people's wish, we don't want civil war, we don't want crisis. 'All of our lives we defended this country. We do not want crisis, we want national unity. We don't want separation, we don't want civil war.' The Afghan Independent Election Commission released preliminary election results yesterday showing former finance minister Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai well in the lead for the presidency. But officials added that no winner could be declared because millions of ballots were being audited for fraud. Preliminary results showed that Mr Ahmadzai had about 4.5million votes, or 56 per cent, while Mr Abdullah had 3.5million votes, or 44 per cent, according to the commission. Turnout was more than 50 per cent. 'We do not want crisis, we want national unity. We don't want separation, we don't want civil war,' said Mr Abdullah, whose comments stocked fears he may spark a crisis by unilaterally declaring victory . One of Mr Abdullah's supporters leaves her seat to shout slogans for him during the heated meeting today . Supporters shout and wave flags from the mezzanine level of the meeting hall as he told them he wouldn't accept what said is a fraudulent result which placed him nearly 11 percentage points behind the winner . A woman speaks on the phone amid the hubbub of the meeting. Election officials have admitted that they have not declared a final result because millions of ballots are being audited for fraud . Many of Mr Abdullah's supporters, who packed into a meeting hall in Kabul for the rally, were angry over the result. Mr Abdullah told them: 'We denounce and do not accept the results of fraudulent vote. I assure you people of Afghanistan that I will sacrifice for you, but I will never accept a fraudulent government. 'We announce that only the government elected through clean votes will come to power.' He told them he was expecting Mr Kerry to fly into the Afghan capital on Friday for meetings to help defuse the crisis, a trip State Department officials would not confirm. The turmoil came as violence escalated around the country. An Afghan official says that at least 16 people, including four Czech soldiers, were killed Tuesday in a suicide attack near a clinic in eastern Afghanistan. The Czech defence ministry confirmed the loss of its soldiers and added that another was badly wounded by the blast. The ministry said it will release more details later in the day. Wahid Seddiqi, spokesman for the governor of Parwan province, said the soldiers, at least 10 civilians, and two police officers were killed when the bomber detonated his bomb near Charakar, the provincial capital. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement sent to the media .

Another Czech was badly hurt in the explosion . The shoes of some of the victims are lined up near the scene of the attack. Ten civilians were killed in the blast . A NATO truck tows away a vehicle damaged in the attack. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack . The announcement came as Mr Ahmadzai was locked in a standoff with Mr Abdullah, who has refused to accept any results until all fraudulent ballots are invalidated. A spokesman for his campaign rejected the results and called the decision to release them 'a coup.' The election commission acknowledged that vote rigging had occurred and said ballots from about 7,000 more of the nearly 23,000 polling stations would be audited. Mr Abdullah charged that outgoing President Hamid Karzai, Ahmadzai and the election commission were colluding. 'President Karzai, the election commissions and Ashraf Ghani's team are all one. They ignored us and announced the fraudulent results,' he said. Mr Abdullah accused outgoing President Hamid Karzai, right,  of colluding with Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai, left . U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said during a visit to Tokyo that any action to seize power illegally in Afghanistan would lead to the end of U.S. financial and security support. Kerry said suggestions of a 'parallel government' in Afghanistan were a grave concern and added that he expected Afghan electoral institutions to conduct a full review of all reasonable allegations of irregularities. He said there was no justification for violence or threats of extralegal action. 'President Obama called me today saying John Kerry is coming to Kabul on Friday. President Obama and Kerry both called me this morning, promised to help us in cleaning up votes,' Abdullah told the crowd. 'John Kerry phoned me before the announcement and told me that his envoys would seek a legal solution for the problems created in here.'","Abdullah Abdullah told supporters he had been called by Obama and Kerry .

"By . Graham Smith . The husband of an Iraqi-American woman who was found bludgeoned to death with a threatening note lying beside her yesterday made an emotional appeal for justice. Shaima Alawadi, 32, was taken off life support on Saturday, three days after she was attacked with a tyre iron at her home in El Cajon, California. Kassim Alhimidi, the mother-of-five's husband, last night made a plea direct to her killer. Appeal: Kassim Alhimidi (right) speaks during a memorial service for his murdered wife Shaima Alawadi at the Imam Ali Ibn Abi Talib Center in Lakeside, California, yesterday. He is flanked by his son Mohammed Alhimidi . Attack: Mrs Alawadi (left) was found close to death by her 17-year-old daughter Fatima Al Himidi (right) at the family home in El Cajon, California, last Wednesday . Speaking in Arabic as his 15-year-old son Mohammed translated, Mr Alhimidi said: 'The main question we would like to ask is what are you getting out of this and why did you do it?' He urged anyone with information to contact police and thanked the Iraqi government for flying his wife's body to Iraq. He was addressing reporters at a mosque east of San Diego after a memorial service for Mrs Alawadi. She was found unconscious by her teenage daughter in the dining room of the family home in El Cajon, one of the nation's largest enclaves of Iraqi immigrants. Fatima Al Himidi,  17, told a television station that the note said: 'Go back to your country, you terrorist.' It is believed the attack took place after the father took the family's younger children to school. El Cajon police have declined to confirm the contents of the note but said it has led investigators to regard the killing as a possible hate crime. Final journey: Family and friends escort Mrs Alawadi's body to a waiting hearse following the memorial service in 2012 . Media interest: Surrounded by reporters, a hearse carrying Mrs Alawadi leaves for San Diego airport where her body will be flown to Iraq . Chief James Redman said there was other evidence and called the killing an isolated incident. Police said the family had found a similar note earlier this month but did not report it to authorities. But Salam Al-Marayati, president of the Muslim Public Affairs Council, said it would be irresponsible to jump to conclusions. He . spoke with reporters at the mosque after meeting with the police chief . and getting assurances from the FBI and the Department of Homeland . Security that they were committed to solving the crime. Mr . Al-Marayati said: 'We don't know the facts of this case. We don't know . if it's a hate crime. We don't know if it's not a hate crime.' He urged the public to grieve for a family that fled persecution in Iraq and found tragedy in the U.S. Crime scene: The fatal attack took place at the family's house, pictured, in El Cajon, California . The . victim and her family left Iraq in the early 1990s after a failed . Shiite uprising, living in Saudi Arabian refugee camps before coming to . the U.S. Saddam Hussain's troops hanged Mrs Alawadi's uncle. The family arrived in the Detroit, Michigan, area in 1993 and moved to San Diego only recently. Mrs Alawadi was a religious Shiite Muslim who wore a hijab; her father Sayed Nabeel Alawadi is a cleric in Iraq. The victim's body was taken to San Diego airport yesterday and is now headed for Najaf in Iraq. The FBI, which is assisting El Cajon police in the investigation, defines a hate crime as an offence motivated by a bias against race, religion, ethnicity, disability or sexual orientation. There were 1,409 hate crimes nationwide based on religion during 2010, including 186 targeting Muslims. There were 1,040 based on ethnicity or national origin, including 359 targeting groups other than Hispanics.","Shaima Alawadi, 32, was attacked in her home in El Cajon, California .

"By . Liz Hull . Lying in a hospital cot, his tiny body hooked up to a tangle of tubes and an artificial heart, Jack Morris is clinging on to life. It is a distressing picture, but one his father hopes could help save his life. Chris Morris released the image of his 15-month-old son yesterday in a desperate bid to find him a new heart. Tiny Jack Morris is desperately poorly in the Newcastle transplant centre and . father Chris is appealing for more parents to consider donating their . child's organs after death . The railway signalman said his youngest child’s only hope of survival is a donated organ. But Jack, who has a rare condition . which means his heart doesn’t pump blood around his body properly, has . already been waiting five months and will die unless a heart is found. Mr Morris said: ‘It was devastating to . be told he needed a transplant, but then you see that there is hope and . you cling to that and pray for the phone call to say they’ve found a . match. ‘If Jack isn’t giving up, then we have no right to either. His only hope now is a donated organ – or a miracle. Baby Jack, pictured before he became poorly, first showed signs of being ill at five months . Father Chris Morris, pictured with Jack's big brother Alex, four, has issued a desperate plea for an organ for his seriously ill son . A heart transplant is recommended for children who have serious heart dysfunction and will not be able to live without having the heart replaced. There are around 30 such transplants per year and these are performed at Great Ormond Street in London or the Freeman Hospital in Newcastle upon Tyne. About half the transplants in children are needed for cardiomyopathy and the other half for inborn abnormalities of the heart, so called congenital heart disease. When a suitable heart from an organ donor becomes available it is allocated to an appropriate recipient on the basis of size and blood group. A series of precise measurements are made on the function of the donor’s heart. If it is suitable it will be removed and stored on ice and transported rapidly to the transplant centre. In the meanwhile the potential recipient is anaesthetised and his or her chest is opened. Once the new heart arrives, the recipient’s heart is removed. The patient is kept alive in the meanwhile by the use of a heart lung machine. The new heart is rapidly sewn into position in the chest.  With its new blood supply the heart restarts and in due course takes over the circulation.  Most patients will spend 2 or 3 weeks in hospital after their transplant. Many transplant patients are desperately sick but nevertheless 85-90 per cent of them will survive the period after the transplant and for at least a year.  Failure of the new heart to function well immediately after the transplant is the commonest cause of early death and occurs in 5-10 per cent of patients. There is a constant although small risk of rejection and a risk of infection in patients who have the natural functions of the immune system suppressed by drugs. The biggest problem as the years go by after a transplant is narrowing of the arteries of the transplanted heart. Nevertheless about three quarters of patients survive 5 years after a transplant and more than half will be alive after 10 years. Particularly for younger patients, if the new heart fails there is the prospect of a repeat or re-transplant. For more information visit http://www.bts.org.uk/ . ‘We know that getting a new heart will . not be a cure and that Jack will have a lifetime of smaller problems, . but we hope they will be more manageable problems. ‘I just want him to one day be able . to go outside, to experience walking in the sunshine, picking up a . snowball, things you wouldn’t normally think twice about doing with your . children.’ Mr Morris, who has a four-year-old . son, Alex, with his partner Laura Campbell, 24, said he had issued the . picture to raise awareness among other parents about organ donation for . children. He said: ‘Talking about organ donation, especially when it involves children, is almost a taboo subject. ‘Obviously it is devastating to lose a . child. But if parents had that discussion about what they would do . earlier then perhaps when the time comes and they are asked the . question, they just might say yes.’ Jack appeared to be healthy when he was born, but at around five months he suddenly stopped breathing for a few seconds. Doctors at Alder Hey Children’s . Hospital in Liverpool diagnosed whooping cough and allowed him home. But . a few days later the same thing happened again. It wasn’t until he collapsed for a . third time, at the end of October, that doctors realised he actually had . dilated cardiomyopathy, which stops the left ventricle pumping . oxygenated blood properly around the body, eventually causing it to . fail. Doctors told Mr Morris and Miss . Campbell, of Anfield, that their son was unlikely to survive without a . new heart. He is now in a specialist transplant centre in Newcastle, . kept alive by a plastic artificial heart which pumps blood around his . body. Mr Morris said: ‘I’m so thankful for every second of every day that Jack is with us. ‘The thing that upsets me the most is that he may never be able to call me Dad. ‘Jack is awake most of the time, but he has never crawled, never stood up and hardly ever makes a sound, only when he cries. ‘But Jack being given the chance of life is more important than all those little things – our priority is finding a new heart.’ Sally Johnson, director of organ . donation and transplantation with NHS Blood and Transplant, said three . people awaiting transplants die each day. ‘Parents who have agreed to donate . their child’s organs tell us they gain comfort from knowing they have . saved the lives of other children and adults,’ she said.

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . and Sean Poulter . Marks & Spencer has been accused of failing older women with fuller figures who still want to look chic. Bosses were today asked to explain a lack of lingerie in large sizes, a failure to offer necklines that flatter women with bigger breasts or tops to cover expanding waistlines. Shareholders used the platform of the firm’s annual general meeting (AGM) to accuse the management of losing their way on serving their most loyal customers. Decline: Marks & Spencer have reported a 1.5 per cent fall in sales in clothing and homeware - marking the third consecutive year of quarterly decline . The attack came after the iconic chain . revealed another set of disappointing results showing that sales of . general merchandise, including clothing, have fallen for three years in a . row. Criticism focused on the failure of chief executive, Marc Bolland, to deliver results despite spending £2.3billion on improving stores, merchandise and expanding overseas. Shareholders . were unhappy with the chain’s new website, while there was also . criticism of a ‘demeaning’ TV commercial featuring model Rosie . Huntington-Whiteley wearing lingerie. Directors . were also lambasted for the fact that M&S, which has been on high . streets for 130 years, has been overtaken by Next for the first time in . terms of annual profits. The firm said the new design of the website, pictured, had been confusing to some customers - and certain sections of it would be simplified in the coming months . The . company has spent tens of millions of pounds on new fashion lines and a . celebrity based campaign featuring the likes of Annie Lennox, Emma . Thompson and Rita Ora. Yet this failed to win over investors who lined up to take a swing at Mr Bolland and the board during a question and answer session at the AGM at London’ s Wembley stadium. Teresa Vanneck Surplice, who is in her sixties, spoke for the millions of older women who have long seen M&S as their first choice for fashion. She pleaded with the M&S style director, Belinda Earl, to bring in more designers that make clothes specifically for older women, who typically have a fuller figure. ‘There . has been a huge change in the attitude of women to clothes over the . last five years. The 35-70 year olds want to look chic and have lovely . colours,’ she said. ‘Women when they are young have a fine waist line. But when we get over 35 they are not so good, so we need longer tops. Despite numerous high-profile marketing campaigns for their clothing ranges - including this Leading Ladies advertisement featuring Rita Ora and chef Rachel Khoo - clothing sales were down 0.6 per cent . ‘Also, . all your necklines are high, but when you have a generous bosom like I . do, you need a V neckline to make it look better. Older women like me . want to look smart, chic and colourful.’ She . said older women like to wear trousers, however she complained those on . offer from M&S were ‘dull’, mannish and often only available in . black. Another investor, Sharon Abrahamson, aged 57, a systems analyst from London, complained it was difficult for larger women to find underwear in stores. ‘Lingerie . in the larger sizes are very often only available online. We larger . women are also people who shop in store – why can’t we find our sizes in . store when the smaller sizes are there?’ she said. One . shareholder and former employee complained: ‘All too often, I, my wife . and friends visit stores and are disappointed with what’s on offer. The . styles, designs and colours just fail to meet our expectations.’ Another regular at the M&S AGM, John Farmer, hit out, saying: ‘When and how will this board stop complacently apologising for underperformance and start to rectify three years of falling or flagging clothing sales.’ Food sales were up for the firm, however, with like-for-like sales growing by 1.7 per cent. The firm's CEO said the company was on track to open another 150 Simply Food stores in the next three years . Before joining M&S, Mr Bolland was the successful chief executive at Morrisons. However, one shareholder pointedly told him: ‘You are a bread and butter and baked beans expert. That's your forte. Clothing is not.’ While much of the criticism was directed at Mr Bolland, the job of answering the questions was left to chairman, Robert Swannell, who charmed shareholders saying their comments kept the management ‘on their toes’. He . admitted M&S has not performed as it should, saying: ‘We didn’t . meet our expectations and we are not trying to hide that. No bonuses . were paid as a result, that’s clear. M&S's struggles with clothing - in particular womenswear - have been well documented. Despite numerous celebrity campaigns - one of which featured the likes of singer Rita Ora, Baroness Lawrence, mother of murdered teenager Stephen, and artist Tracy Emin - and World Cup collaborations, its high street neighbour Next is outstripping it in the profit stakes. In May this year, Next reported a profit of £695m for the 12 months between January 2012 and 2013. Meanwhile M&S revealed its pre-tax profits fell by 3.9 per cent to £623m in the year to March. What's more, Next - which has been selling clothes and homewear for 32 years - has reported a profit for five consecutive years. The company says it is on track to make profits of up to £770 million this year. Experts have credited the chain's success to mutli-channel marketing (i.e. to a broad range of media outlets) and easy to use technology - including a simple website that customers like. ‘As a business and a board you have to do the things that are right to build it for the long term, even if that is somewhat inconvenient. We have started creating a much stronger business and we will see it through.’ Mr Bolland insisted that the fashion press has praised its new lines and sales of women’s clothes are beginning to show signs of growth, despite what he called ‘settling in’ problems associated with the chain’s new website. ‘We believe that step-by-step we are on the right track. I'm really committed to what I'm doing,’ he said. On a more positive note, the chain’s food sales have continued to thrive. Same store sales were up 1.7per cent over the 13 weeks to the end of June, which was the 19th quarter in a row of growth and much better than most high street rivals. A spokesman for the company today told . MailOnline: 'The website is a new platform that is owned and run by . M&S. It is very different. '[the decrease] was not unexpected. Nothing has gone wrong. It was expected. 'We think the investment in the new site was worth it, despite these slight bedding in issues. 'We expect everything to be back to normal - and to be back in growth - by the peak period in November.' Profits have fallen for three years in a row and have just been overtaken by rival Next, although M&S is on track to meet City forecasts for a 2014-15 pre-tax profit of £663 million, up from £623 million in 2013-14. A spokesman for the company said today the firm had launched 700 new lines in the division in the past quarter - showing 'unparallelled' innovation in the section. Mr Bolland said . that the company's food sales continued to 'outperform the market', and . it was on track to add another 150 Simply Food stores in the UK over . the next three years. Analysts were divided over whether Mr Bolland, who joined the business in 2010, has begun to turn the retailer around. The firms Chief Executive Marc Bolland, pictured, will today face shareholders at the company's annual meeting at Wembley with the figures . Edison Investment Research analyst Neil Shah said: 'With food continuing to outperform the market, a resurgent clothing offering helping to turn the corner for general merchandise, M&S is on course to deliver one of its better all-round performances for several years with three quarters of the current financial year to play for.' But analysts at Shore Capital said: 'Overall, we deem this to be another disappointing update from the company, with general merchandising in the UK continuing to weigh heavily upon the group's growth prospects.' Shares in the retailer edged up in early trading. Marks & Spencer said its outlook for the full year remains unchanged, with the City forecasting a 2014-15 pre-tax profit of £663 million, up from £623 million in 2013-14. Today, the firm announced a 1.7 per cent increase in like-for-like sales for their food sector - the 19th consecutive quarter increase for the division. Mr Bolland said . that the company's food sales continued to 'outperform the market', and . it was on track to add another 150 Simply Food stores in the UK over . the next three years. A . spokesman for the company said today the firm had launched 700 new food . lines in the past quarter - including their Summer of Flavour range. Called Best of British summer last year, the range is already outselling its predecessor two-fold. Featuring brightly-coloured packaging, the 159-product range is a picnic-style selection of foody treats. Some of the highlights include a pulled pork and crunchy slaw sandwich and a spiced lamb and pomegranate flatbread. Sweet treats include a double chocolate wrap and a mini cupcake selection - featuring raspberry and lemon cakes. It also includes unusual desserts such as a Japanese Yuzu - a coconut milk-based pudding flavoured with citrus and chilli. Elsewhere, M&S have also recently introduced a range of Indian wines, specifically to go with their culinary range from the region, as well as a selection of game meats from Yorkshire and Northumberland.","Bosses were today asked to explain a lack of lingerie in large sizes .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . The image of the lazy student should be consigned to the history books, according to the minister in charge of the nation’s universities. Instead of ‘dossing around’ fantasising about revolution in Latin America, the new crop of undergraduates work for longer hours, miss fewer lectures and complain about homework not being marked on time. Tory minister David Willetts told MailOnline students are now ‘more-serious minded’, and willing to complain if their university is not giving them the £9,000 education they are paying through fees. Instead of skipping lectures to stay in bed, today's generation of students are demanding more from their universities to get value for money for their £9,000 tuition fees . Instead of clutching a copy of Karl Marx today’s students are more likely to be perusing the complaints procedure at their faculty, Mr Willetts claims. Mr Willetts said: ‘My experience now going to meet students is that they are not, by and large, plotting Marxist revolution in Latin America. ‘They are instead frustrated that their seminars are too crowded, it takes too long to get an academic to resound to their academic work. ‘There are always individual students who aren’t focused and who are just dossing around. ‘But overall they are more serious-minded than ever.’ Latest figures show an increase in the number of hours students spend working, albeit a modest one. Mr Willetts believes it is in part fuelled by students demanding value for money since tuition fees were increased to £9,000. The survey by the Higher Education Policy Institute of first and second year students found 29 per cent thought their course was poor value for money. ‘Universities do need to do more to raise the quality of the academic experience, Mr Willetts said. Universities minister David Willetts told MailOnline students are now 'more serious-minded' ‘The student experience in English universities has not been good enough and at last it is beginning to improve.’ The minister points out that in extreme cases the worst universities could end up in court for breach of contract. ‘The structure of fees, although they don’t pay the fees upfront, has given them a real claim on the universities,’ Mr Willetts said. ‘Students do have rights: ultimately universities have to provide them with up to £9,000 of education.’ And if they don’t, the universities could find themselves being sued. ‘Ultimately there is a legal contract for the university to deliver services. That doesn’t mean we want lots of people pursuing universities through the courts. ‘But there is this body, the Office of the Independent Adjudicator, which will try to resolve student complaints if they can’t be done through the university.’ More than 20,000 students complained to their universities last year, a 10 per cent rise on 2010-11. Top of the complaints are class sizes and lecturers taking too long to respond to questions and mark essays. Latest figures show that students attend more than 9 out of 10 lectures, and most of those they miss are because they do not think they are worth their time. Bright teenage girls should not fixate on becoming doctors because there are not enough places to study medicine, David Willetts warned. The universities minister said limits on places based on NHS demand for staff meant courses were always oversubscribed. He highlighted the problem of students, especially girls, only studying A-levels needed for medicine such as chemistry and biology. 'The subject which is most oversubscribed where people are sadly least likely to get to fulfil their ambition is medicine,' Mr Willetts said. 'Within that it is particularly girls applying for medicine. 'If they have given up physics at GSCE despite perhaps having got a good GCSE because it’s medicine that they are thinking of, it is hard for them to move across and convert to doing another form of science or engineering. 'They are all interested in science but it is medicine they are untested in so they don’t need physics for medicine so they drop the physics. 'There are lots of other ways of doing science which also make the world a better place, and not place all your bets on the medical option.' First and second year students on average had 14.2 hours of time-tabled sessions scheduled and attended 12.9 hours. Asked why they missed lectures, half said they did not find them 'very useful' and 41 per cent said they did not need to attend because they could find the notes online. Just 31 per cent of those who missed sessions said they 'couldn't be bothered to attend'. Some students are now so fed up with the quality of their courses they have carried out analysis of the amount - and quality - of the tuition they receive to see if they are getting their money’s worth. In 2010, the coalition controversially trebled the maximum amount universe is can charge in tuition fees to £9,000. To date there has been little impact on the numbers of people still wanting to go to university - in part because they only start paying it back after starting work and earning more than £21,000. Economics students in Manchester are demanding fewer multiple choice exams - which are easier to mark - and more open-ended essays which will take more time for their lecturers to assess. Some 35 per cent of students surveyed said it took more than three weeks to have an assignment marked and returned to them while a quarter complained about not always getting prompt feedback. Overall 87 per cent said they were satisfied with the quality of their course, but 13 per cent were dissatisfied . Mr Willetts added: ‘I think increasingly students are more serious minded. There is a slow and modest rise, but nevertheless the trend is the amount of hours of academic work done by students appears to be going up. ‘Talk to a student union and you are as likely to get complaints about how long it takes to get an essay back with a mark and feedback from an academic than anything about wider politics. ‘So yeah I think they are more serious.’ Despite the rise in fees, he insists it is still worth going to university. According to the latest Graduate Labour Market Brief, the average salary for graduates with one degree is £32,000, compared to £20,000 for non-graduates. ‘That kind of brings home in a vivid way the scale of the gap,’ Mr Willetts added. ‘Individuals will obviously decide for themselves. It is not the right thing for every individual. But overall yes it is the right thing.’","David Willetts says students 'more serious-minded' than earlier generations .

"Dylan Paton who died after collapsing at home. Twenty people were arrested after a brawl broke out following his funeral . Twenty people  - including a 12-year-old child - have been arrested after a massive brawl broke out following the funeral of a teenager. The large scale disturbance followed the wake for 16-year-old Dylan Paton,who died after collapsing at home in June. Hundreds of people had gathered in the street in the Craigneuk area of Wishaw, Lanarkshire, where Dylan lived with his family, and witnesses said mourners fought running battles with officers and damaged force vehicles.

Loads of people were gathered in the street because they had been at the funeral earlier in the day. 'Just after 9 o’clock something kicked off and the police were called to the street. 'It developed into a stand off between the people on the street and the police. There was fighting and bottles being smashed. 'At one point the police closed off the street and people living there couldn’t get in or out.' Hundreds of people had gathered in the street in the Craigneuk area of Wishaw, Lanarkshire, where Dylan lived with his family .

"By . Harriet Hernando . A teenager bought a cheese and tomato pizza from Domino’s - but had £179,932.32 taken from his bank account. Nathaniel Bolwell, 19, paid for the £17.99 meal from the takeaway giant with his bank card. But after checking his account, he was shocked to see it was £179,020.82 overdrawn. Teenager Nathaniel Bolwell bought a large cheese and tomato pizza and extras from Domino's in Newport, Wales for £17.99 but had £179,932.32 taken from his account when staff added an extra four digits to the price . Mr Bolwell said: 'I couldn’t believe my eyes. How did it allow Domino’s to take all that money? 'Not even the poshest meal in the poshest restaurant would cost anything like that even if I took all my friends and family out.' Mr Bolwell bought the pizza at Domino’s in Chepstow Road, Newport, Wales, and noticed nothing out of the ordinary when he paid. Mr Bolwell's statement highlighted the costly mistake. Lloyds Bank paid the money back two days later . But when his card was refused at a supermaket, he decided to check his account. He said: 'I thought I was about £400 in credit but I was massively overdrawn. 'I took a print-out of the statement and rang the bank straight away. 'I knew it was wrong - but was terrified that I might have to pay it off or be put on a credit blacklist.' Domino’s and Lloyds Bank investigated after his father made a phonecall enquiring about the bill. The money was paid back two days later. Nathaniel Bolwell, 19, was given £100 compensation from Lloyds Bank after it withdrew £179,932.32 from his account to pay for a pizza . Mr Bolwell, who works as a packer for a health food company, was told Domino's staff were given a bank card authorisation code of 3232 when he paid. But that was accidentally added to the price when the payment went through in twolots of £90,000 and £89.932.32 - adding up to £179,932.32. Mr Bolwell's father, Karl, 40, said: 'People are joking that instead of a cheese and tomato pizza it must have been made of gold leaf and diamonds. 'I know takeaways are cheap but that is crazy. I’ve told Nathaniel he can stick to home cooking from now on.' A spokeswoman for Domino’s said: 'This was immediately flagged by our merchant provider due to the amount and a reversal of funds was put in place. 'Unfortunately the payment was authorised by the customer’s bank. 'We understand that this has now been resolved and we apologise for any inconvenience caused.' A Lloyds Bank spokesperson said it would give Mr Bolwell £100 compensation - and 'sincerely regretted a significant level of distress and inconvenience'. The spokesperson said: 'We investigated this transaction as soon as it was brought to our attention and are sorry that Mr Bolwell had these funds debited from his account. 'We apologise for the inconvenience this has caused and have offered Mr Bolwell £100 in recognition of this.'","19-year-old Nathaniel Bolwell was charged £179,932.32 for a large cheese and tomato pizza and extras instead of £17.99 .

"By . John Drayton . Joey Barton has come out on top in his latest Twitter war with Piers Morgan - by correctly predicting that Germany would beat Brazil in their World Cup semi-final. The QPR midfielder had a £5,000 bet with the broadcaster which he duly won after Germany humiliated Brazil 7-1 in Belo Horizonte, with Morgan having backed the hosts to triumph. Barton expected Germany to win 2-0 while Morgan went for the Selecao to triumph. Winner: QPR midfielder Joey Barton correctly predicted that Germany would beat Brazil . Out of pocket: Morgan will have to pay £5,000 to charity after losing his bet to Barton . And the 31-year-old was keen to rub it in, tweeting Morgan: 'I've never seen anything like this. Sitting here like... #tearsforpiers @piersmorgan #5k #Freemoney.' Morgan himself was also self-deprecating, saying: 'I think #MysticMorgan needs to go on holiday.' Barton asked for the money to be split evenly between the Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool and the Official Hillsbrough Justice Campaign. The bet was just the latest in a long list of high profile Twitter battles the pair have had. Most infamously, they argued over Twitter before they both appeared on panel for BBC Question Time in May. On that occasion, Barton tweeted Morgan a picture of the book British Politics for Dummies. Morgan replied: 'I don't need to train for intelligent political debates. You however... well, best of luck.' He then called Barton a dog, saying: 'I've appeared on @bbcquestiontime 17 times, but not for 4 years, and never with a Pitbull. Should be amusing....'

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . An obsessed babysitter beat a six week-old baby to death with a shoe while the child's mother was out with her friends, a court has heard. Michael John Pearce, 33, from Nelson, Caerphilly, Wales, is on trial for the murder and manslaughter of Alfie Sullock. Pearce was looking after the newborn for the baby’s mother Donna Sullock - who he was romantically 'obsessed with'  - while she went out on her first night out since giving birth, jurors heard. Mother Donna Sullock pictured holding her baby boy Alfie - who died in August last year while in the care of Michael John Pearce, 32 . Newborn Alfie Sullock, pictured, was being looked after by Pearce (right) while the child's mother was out with friends. He suffered a brain haemorrhage while he was in the man's care and died in hospital . A jury at Newport Crown Court heard how four minutes before Pearce made a 999 call, he had texted Ms Sullock to reassure her son was doing fine. But when paramedics arrived, they found Alfie blue and lifeless - and noticed bruising to his face and chest. The prosecution told the court today marks on the defendant’s shoes 'precisely' matched injuries on the child’s face. Following a CT scan, doctors discovered the baby had suffered a brain haemorrhage and said there was no hope of him surviving. The child was put on life support - which was eventually withdrawn on August 20. Pearce denies both counts of murder and manslaughter. Donna Sullock left her newborn in the care of Pearce to go out with friends for the first time since giving birth . Opening the case today, prosecuting counsel Michael Mather-Lees QC said Alfie was gratuitously injured while in the sole care of the defendant. He said: 'This was not a moment of exasperation that can happen with a screaming child. This was a baby repeatedly beaten with objects. 'This is not a case of a baby developing sudden death syndrome. This was a child who was badly beaten and as a result the baby dies. He (the defendant) killed him. 'What possible explanation can somebody have to beat a defenceless baby and to cause them really serious harm?' Alfie was born at the University Hospital of Wales (UHW), Cardiff, on July 6 last year. The court heard that the child was healthy and that his mother’s pregnancy and labour had been uneventful. A jury also was told Ms Sullock, who lived in Fairwater, Cardiff, discovered she had become pregnant while a holiday rep in Crete. Alfie was taken to hospital  where doctors found the newborn had been 'gratuitously' injured, jurors were told . She returned home to the UK, and six months into her pregnancy she became friends with the defendant. Mr Mather-Lees told the jury although the pair went on a number of 'dates', divorcee and father-of-one Pearce was becoming a 'little bit presumptious to the state of their relationship' and displayed 'obsessive behaviour' towards her. On August 16, Ms Sullock travelled from her home in the Welsh capital to Pearce’s home. That day, the defendant asked Ms Sullock would he give her a baby - to which she replied 'no'. Before going out, she fed, winded and changed her son - who the Crown say was healthy and breathing normally. Mr Mather-Lees added: 'This was the first time Alfie’s mother had left him with anyone else. 'The baby was unbruised when his mother left. During the course of the evening various text messages were exchanged. 'At 8.16pm she received a picture message and asked if the baby had been crying as his face appeared red. 'The defendant said the baby had wind but was fine.' Pearce then sent another picture message around 15 minutes later and at 8.43pm told Ms Sullock 'you can trust me you know'. He also told her that 'everything is absolutely fine' before saying he was watching TV. The jury was today shown photographs detailing 10 facial injuries to the child, pictured. The prosecution said 'distinct' marks on the defendant's shoes 'precisely' matched injuries on the child's face . But at 9.11pm, Pearce dialled 999. The call, which lasted around seven minutes, was played to the jury in full. When asked by the operator if he had seen what happened, the defendant replied that he had given the baby a bottle and then the child had stopped breathing. He said the baby felt cold to touch, before he was instructed to carry out mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Mr Mather-Lees added: 'Plainly he says he had no idea what happened. But of course he did. Children do not go cold instantly.' The jury was shown photographs detailing 10 facial injuries to the child, as well as bruising to his abdomen. Mr Mather-Lees said the 'distinct' marks on the defendant’s shoes 'precisely' matched injuries on the child’s face. Alfie was first taken to the Prince Charles Hospital in Merthyr Tydfil before being transferred to UHW. Doctors found the newborn had been 'gratuitously' injured and the following day - on August 17 - he was found to have no brain function. Pearce, pictured, denies both counts of murder and manslaughter. The trial will continue tomorrow . On August 20, life support was withdrawn and Alfie died, the court heard. A Home Office pathologist gave a provisional cause of death as 'blunt trauma head injury'. The jury heard Pearce was interviewed by police extensively and gave 'no explanation for the injuries' Alfie sustained. Before completing the opening of the Crown’s case, Mr Mather-Lees told the jury: 'All the evidence points in one direction'. The trial, which is expected to last three weeks, will continue tomorrow.

"By . Sam Webb . 'Quiet, calm and gentle': Thavisha Lakindu Peiris, 25, was stabbed to death as he made his final pizza delivery. He was due to start his career as an IT consultant . A pizza delivery driver about to start a new career was stabbed through the heart by two thugs trying to steal his mobile phone, a court heard. University graduate Thavisha Lakindu Peiris was stabbed repeatedly in his car as he made the final delivery of his shift on October 27 last year. 'Quiet, calm and gentle' Mr Peiris - who had been persuaded to carry out a final delivery before clocking off - had moved from Sri Lanka in November 2011 to study economic engineering at Sheffield Hallam University. He was about to start a new career in IT technology before he was stabbed to death in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, a jury was told. Shamraze Khan, 26, appeared at Sheffield Crown Court today charged with his murder, while Kasim Ahmed, 18, has already pleaded guilty to the charge. Robert Smith QC, prosecuting, said it was a ‘joint enterprise’ motivated by robbery. 'The prosecution submit that the defendant Shamraze Khan and another man, Kasim Ahmed, were jointly responsible for the murder of Thavisha Peiris,' he said. He added: 'Thavisha was chosen as a target for robbery by Khan and Ahmed, just as they had selected the couple only an hour or so beforehand. 'The mobile phone had clearly been their target.' The prosecutor told the jury: 'By October last year that Mr Peiris was due to start work in the field of information technology. 'He was never able to use his studies to . his advantage to take up work in his chosen sphere, or to return to Sri . Lanka, because he was stabbed to death.' Kasim Ahmed, who has already pleaded guilty to the murder charge . Loss: Sri Lankan-born murder victim Thavisha Lakindu Peiris (right) with his father Sarath Mahinda Peiris (second left) and mother Sudarma Narangoda (second right) The student had been working at a branch of Domino's Pizza in Sheffield and was delivering an order to an address in Southey. When he failed to deliver the order, his workmates set off to find him . The jury heard that barely an hour before the pair left Thavisha in a pool of blood at the wheel of his car as they attempted to rob his mobile phone, they had already robbed a young couple in Sheffield city centre. Both Ahmed and Khan accept being responsible for that knifepoint robbery in which mobile phones were also stolen. Mr Smith said: 'Regardless of which defendant was actually responsible for inflicting the fatal stab wound [on Thavisha], they were both jointly involved in the attack and each is guilty of the offence of murder.' Grief: Sarath Peiris (left), 66, and Vajira Narangoda Peiris, 59, parents of Thavisha Lakindu Peris, who was stabbed to death during a pizza delivery in Sheffield . Crime scene: The street where Mr Peiris was stabbed to death while delivering pizzas . The court heard the pizza delivery driver had pulled up to deliver an order when he was fatally attacked. His phone was found in his car - where it had been yanked from its windscreen holder. A post-mortem examination revealed he had been stabbed once in his neck and three times in his chest - puncturing his heart. Mr Smith QC told jurors two gloves with Mr Peiris’ blood on were found in Khan’s home - while Khan’s palm print was also found on the roof of Thavisha’s car. Thavisha asked his manager at Domino¿s Pizza if he could go home because he was tired, the court heard. But his manager asked Thavisha if he would take one more order . 'Khan and Ahmed had planned to commit offences of robbery and about an hour or so before the attack, they had jointly committed an offence of robbery involving two young people at Castle Market, in Sheffield. 'During this offence Ahmed had produced a knife and injured one of the two people in question. 'After the robbery the defendants returned to the home of Khan, where they were both living, but they went out again and decided to rob Thavisha while he was trying to deliver a pizza.' The court heard that the vicitm had worked until 7am on the morning of his death, and had returned to start another shift later that evening. Mr Smith said that at 8.40pm, Mr Peiris asked his manager at Domino’s Pizza if he could go home because he was tired. But his manager asked if he would take one more order, which was to the Southey Green part of Sheffield as well as one other order. He left the pizza outlet at 9.50pm, the court heard. Mr Smith said that, while nobody actually witnessed the attack, an eyewitness saw two men in hoods stood around his car, looking in the driver’s window shortly before the attack. Other eyewitnesses saw two men running away from the murder scene in the direction of Khan’s flat, the court heard. One resident described the pair running at a 'hell of a pace', the jury heard. 'The prosecution contend that these were the defendants,' said Mr Smith. Mr Peiris' dead body was eventually discovered by a colleague. 'He opened the passenger door and touched Thavisha’s arm, but he didn’t move,' said Mr Smith. 'At that point he noticed there was blood on Thavisha’s shirt and blood in the car.' Paramedics were called but Thavisha died at hospital, the court heard. Speaking about the pathologists’ findings, Mr Smith said: 'There was a stab wound in the left side of the neck which had passed through Thavisha’s spine. 'In the central area of the chest, there was another wound which had penetrated the heart.' The court also heard that there were stab wounds to his ribs, as well as superficial stab wounds to his face and hands. Following the killing both defendants went to the home of Ahmed’s father, and alluded to family members that something serious had happened - but did not reveal what it was, the court heard. Three days later, Ahmed was discovered by police in a storage area in his girlfriend’s house and Khan discovered hiding in the loft of his parents’ house. Ahmed has already admitted two counts of robbery, which Khan also admits. The trial continues.

"By . David Kent . Manchester City remain steadfast in their determination to keep Yaya Toure despite fears that the midfielder wants to leave the club. Reports in the French Press on Tuesday repeated once again the suggestion that Toure is unhappy at the Etihad Stadium and that he is seeking a summer move away from the Manchester club, with PSG his likely destination. Indeed, the reputable Le Parisien even went as far as to suggest that fellow Premier League sides Chelsea and Manchester United were considering an approach for the 31-year-old. Wantaway: Yaya Toure reportedly wants to leave Manchester City this summer . Going down: But Manchester City are determined to hold on to one of their prize assets . However, it is understood that City do not intend to allow the player to leave the Etihad Stadium as they look to retain their Premier League title next season. It follows a series of peculiar sideshows this summer, after Toure threw his future at the club into doubt when his agent Dimitri Seluk claimed that the club should have made more of a fuss for his 31st birthday, with his representative saying that the midfielder was left ‘very upset’. City did give Toure a birthday cake and wished him happy birthday on Twitter but the player’s agent suggested he was ignored by the club’s Abu Dhabi owners when the squad visited at then end of the season. ‘None of them shook his hand on his birthday. It’s really sick,’ Seluk added. Toure later backed his agent, writing on Twitter: ‘Everything Dimitri said is true. He speaks for me. I will explain after the World Cup.’ VIDEO Joining PSG would be 'an honour' - Toure . Sticking together: Brothers Yaya (L) and Kolo Toure ahead of their opening game against Japan . Star man: Toure helped Manchester City clinch their second title in three years last season . On a more . serious note, Toure then spoke of his sadness following the death of his . brother Ibrahim and suggested that his club did not offer him . sufficient support during a period which he describes as ‘the hardest in . my life.’ The . Ivory Coast midfielder’s 28-year-old brother tragically died of cancer . in June, while Yaya was in Brazil representing his country at the World . Cup and the City talisman has stated that he felt disappointed that he . wasn’t afforded greater sensitivity by his club employers, with the . midfielder alleging that City did not allow him to leave a post-season . training camp to spend time with his brother. Toure told France Football: ‘At the end of the season, I wanted to stay for four or five days with my brother before I flew to prepare for the World Cup with Ivory Coast, except that City did not want to grant me a few days. Manchester City were left disheartened by Toure’s quotes and Sportsmail understands that Toure did not request compassionate leave to spend time with his brother.

"By . Jack Doyle . Judge Martin Joy, sitting at Maidstone Crown Court, in Kent, had three of his sentences increased following complaints they were too lenient . A judge who handed out unduly short sentences three times in a single year was yesterday branded ‘Britain’s softest’. The prison terms handed down by Judge Martin Joy to two child rapists and a drug dealer were deemed too lenient by the Court of Appeal and were increased by as much as five years. He was the only judge in England and Wales to have more than one sentence altered by the Attorney General in 2012, official figures revealed. The statistics also showed that record numbers of cases are attracting complaints about ‘unduly lenient’ sentences. A total of 435 cases were referred to the Attorney General last year, compared with 377 in 2011 and 342 in 2010. Cases may be highlighted by victims or their relatives, the Crown Prosecution Service or members of the public. They are sent to the Court of Appeal if it is thought the judge got it seriously wrong. In November last year Judge Joy, 65, who sits at Maidstone Crown Court, sentenced a 36-year-old child rapist to ten years in jail on three counts of rape, three of indecent assault and one other indecency charge against a six-year-old girl. The man had a previous conviction for indecent assault against a girl of eight. The court heard his victim was ‘severely traumatised’. He denied the charges, forcing the child to give evidence. The Appeal Court increased the jail term to 15 years. Judge Robert Juckes QC (left), at Worcester Crown Court, and Judge Daniel Pearce-Higgins QC (right), at Hereford Crown Court, both had two separate referrals each . Earlier this month, the Attorney General received complaints about the 15-month jail sentence handed to presenter Stuart Hall for a series of sex attacks, and his term is to be considered for referral to the Court of Appeal . Attorney General Dominic Grieve QC said he was pleased a record number of offenders were referred as possibly unduly lenient and said he had no concerns about any particular judges . In a separate case, Judge Joy sentenced a 69-year-old serial sex offender to ten years for repeated sexual abuse of a nine-year-old girl. The Appeal Court imposed an indefinite sentence for public protection with a minimum term of seven years, the equivalent of a 14-year jail term. The third sentence was given to Henrik Vriezen, who was caught importing a class-B drug known as 4-MEC, cannabis and amphetamine worth more than £3million. He was jailed for three years and six months, but this was increased on appeal to six years. Peter Cuthbertson, director of the Centre for Crime Prevention, said: ‘Martin Joy wins the title  of Britain’s softest judge, and the Court of Appeal was absolutely right to toughen up his soft punishments. ‘When passing down punishments, judges should always bear in mind how often criminals serve only a fraction of their sentences.’ Of the cases complained about, 82 were heard by the Court of Appeal and 62 offenders had their sentence increased. The Attorney General, Dominic Grieve QC, said there were ‘not particular judges’ he was concerned about. ‘It may just be that all judges at various times get a reference made in respect of their work and it may be purely coincidental that it’s happened more than once to a judge in a particular year,’ he said.","Judge Martin Joy had the most complaints and three sentences increased .

"By . Simon Jones . West Ham have made a £9.5million bid for Yehven Konoplyanka but face competition from Roma and Atletico Madrid. Dnipro want £12m for the Ukraine winger who missed out on a move to Liverpool in January and has been watched by Tottenham and Manchester United. Atletico, who are signing Bayern Munich's Mario Mandzukic for £17.4m, plan talks on Wednesday with the Ukrainian's father and agent while West Ham consider other options also. Done deal? West Ham have bid £9.5million for Dnipro winger Yevhen Konoplyanka . Liverpool offered Konoplyanka close to £6million-a-year in wages and he will have to become the Upton Park outfit's top earner, outstripping the £75,000-a-week deal of Andy Carroll, to join. Konoplyanka scored 13 goals in 36 appearances in all competitions for Ukrainian outfit Dnipro last season. West Ham had also considered his Ukraine team-mate Andriy Yarmolenko at Dynamo Kiev but face competition from Chelsea for him.

"By . David Kent . At first glance it looks as if David Beckham might be stepping out of retirement with Arsenal - but Gunners fans can relax in the knowledge that Becks isn't their first summer signing; it's just Aaron Ramsey going through his pre season paces. Arsenal's player of the year is back in training at London Colney sporting a style that Beckham would be proud of - given that it makes him look just like the former England captain with his slick haircut and designer stubble. And Beckham - like Ramsey - has spent time on the training fields of Arsenal's base, both as an England player and when he needed to keep his fitness up during breaks in the MLS season while he was with LA Galaxy.

Just like Beckham, Ramsey is becoming one of the best midfielders in the Premier League and will hope he can push on this season if, like Arsenal, he gets a little bit luckier with injuries. The FA Cup winners have a thread-bare squad putting in the hours at their North London base, with the likes of Per Mertesacker and Mesut Ozil still at the World Cup while Joel Campbell, Olivier Giroud and others are still enjoying an extended break after their tournament exertions.

"By . Mark Wilson . Celtic will discover on Tuesday if Scott Brown can play any part in their bid to qualify for the Champions League. The Parkhead skipper has remained at the club’s Austrian training camp after being stretchered off with a hamstring injury during Sunday’s 1-1 draw with Rapid Vienna. It’s understood Brown will now undergo a scan today to determine the exact nature of the damage, as Celtic sweat on the outcome. Major doubt: Brown could miss all of Celtic's Champions League qualifiers after injuring his hamstring . Setback: The Celtic skipper looks irritated by the injury that could rule him out for months . Bad news: Celtic captain Scott Brown suffered a hamstring injury against Rapid Vienna . The worst-case scenario is a tear that could see the 29-year-old sidelined for up to eight weeks. That would rule him out of all three rounds of games the Premiership champions must negotiate if they are to earn a £15million group stage jackpot from the continent’s elite competition. It could also potentially make the national skipper a doubt for Scotland’s Euro 2016 opener against Germany on September 7. Brown and manager Ronny Deila are still hoping the scan reveals only some form of strain. Even then, there is no realistic chance of the midfielder featuring in the opening Champions League tie against KR Reykjavik. Celtic travel to the Icelandic capital in seven days’ time, with the return at Murrayfield a week later. Ice cool: Finnish striker Teemu Pukki celebrates his goal for Celtic against Rapid Vienna on Sunday . Finnish striker Teemu Pukki, on target against Rapid, admitted Brown’s absence in the qualifiers would be a significant blow. But Pukki remains convinced the club would still have enough quality to reach the group stage – with Beram Kayal the leading contender to step in. ‘Scott is a big character in the dressing room,’ said Pukki. ‘He is our captain and a great player so obviously we are concerned he is injured. ‘He is a guy we all look up to and you definitely know he is in the team. If you make a mistake or take things easy, he is the first one to let you know. Training: Pukki said a long absence for Brown would be a huge blow for the Scottish club . ‘Everything is a bit quieter when he is not around. He’s an important player for us and has experience of playing in big Champions League games. ‘I hope he can recover in time because you want your best players available for such important matches. ‘We will have to wait and see but we have a lot of good players at Celtic and I am sure whoever comes in will do a great job.’ Watching on: Fraser Forster had 11 days off between England's World Cup campaign and Celtic pre-season . Meanwhile, Fraser Forster insists he is happy to be back at work with Celtic despite his World Cup call-up denying him a proper summer break. The 26-year-old only managed 11 days off between returning from Brazil with the England squad and heading out to join his club’s training camp in Austria. Forster, attracting attention from Atletico Madrid and Southampton, is expected to sit out Tuesday’s friendly with LASK Linz but could play against Dukla Prague on Friday. And he is keen to return to business with the opening Champions League qualifier now just a week away. Joking around: Forster and Lukasz Zaluska enjoy themselves in training with goalkeeper coach Stevie Woods . ‘We’ve all been apart for quite a bit of time so it’s good when you come back in and see people you’ve not really seen in six weeks and have a joke and a laugh,’ he told the Celtic website. ‘The serious business comes around so quickly, though, and we have competitive Champions League games two weeks into pre-season so you have to come back and hit the ground running. ‘Every day you’re preparing for that first game so it’s important you come back in good shape and give training 100 per cent every day until it kicks off.’ Rest: Forster has a lie down with Woods after a strenuous training session in Austria . Forster was thrilled to be part of Roy Hodgson’s squad, but didn’t manage any minutes on the pitch as his nation made a miserable first-round exit. ‘The World Cup was fantastic,’ he insisted. ‘I have been around the squad in the last couple of years so it was fantastic to go to a World Cup and a great experience. ‘I got another cap in the friendly in the lead up to it and it would have been nice if we had stayed in the tournament longer but that’s the way it happened.’","The central midfielder was stretchered off in the 1-1 draw on Sunday .

"By . Harcharan Chandhoke . Seasoned cricket observers in England can be forgiven if they are scratching their heads and struggling to recognise many of the names in India’s touring party. Even us Indian fans barely know who some of the players are. This must be, by some distance, the most inexperienced Indian squad to have toured England for several decades. Only three of them have played Test cricket here before, and they now find themselves facing a full five-match series in England for the first time since 1959. Leaders: India coach Duncan Fletcher (left) and captain MS Dhoni in training ahead of the first Test . In fact the last occasion India played five Tests against anyone was back in 2002, when the grizzled old captain MS Dhoni was still three years away from his debut. It is a far cry from the collection of ‘galacticos’ – Tendulkar, Dravid, Laxman et al – who last toured here in 2011. That ageing team, which arrived as the world No 1, suffered the humiliation of a 4-0 whitewash that marked a violent end to the dominance of India’s golden generation. If even that star-studded side capitulated so horribly in English conditions, then some may ask what hope there is for the current crop? Including that tour three years ago, India have been defeated in all of their last four away Test series, losing 10 of the 12 matches played. Little wonder then that the media-averse coach Duncan Fletcher, in one of the few pronouncements he will make all summer, was keen to label his charges as youthful and inexperienced underdogs. But the wily old strategist, who has been allowed to continue developing a new generation of players despite the sequence of poor results, also raised the suggestion ‘they might fire from this series’ onwards. The new star: Virat Kohli typifies the loud and brash nature of the modern India . While he was careful not to mention it, he has no doubt taken huge encouragement from England’s own dreadful tally of losing six of their last seven Tests. In reality, this is a series between two rather weak sides that are still struggling to reinvent themselves after the sudden loss of several very fine players, whether through retirement, ill-health or ill-discipline. And the main cause of India’s torment three years ago – a disciplined and relentless bowling unit led by Jimmy Anderson at the peak of his powers – is looking nothing like the force it was back then. At the very least, there should be enough strength in India’s traditional virtue – its batting  – to avoid a repeat of the 2011 whitewash. Their first aim will be to avert defeat in the opening two Tests at Trent Bridge and Lord’s, where the bowling conditions are often very much to England’s liking. As the series goes on, and if we do indeed experience the long and hot summer tentatively promised by weather forecasters, then the pitches will become more like the dustbowls the Indians know back home. Legends: Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid (right) were the bedrock of India's fearsome batting line-up . The batting hopes will rest, in particular, on the shoulders of two men who may eventually go some distance towards emulating the great names they have succeeded. Cheteshwar Pujara, a classical technician who looks like he was born to play Test cricket, is the natural heir to Rahul Dravid in the No 3 slot. With a batting average close to 60 from his 19 Tests, he has scored centuries against all five nations he has faced, including an unbeaten double hundred against England. While Pujara is something of a throwback to a bygone era, the other key batsman – Virat Kohli – typifies the brash and loud nature of modern India. Like several of his colleagues, he was a multi-millionaire and domestic celebrity before he had even played a single Test match - purely on the back of some big hitting in ODIs and the IPL. Many traditionalists probably took quiet satisfaction when Kohli initially struggled in the longer and more difficult form of the great game. But despite his rather blingy outward appearance, he has a furious work ethic and his Test average is now in the high 40s and still rising. He is starting to become a worthy holder of the number four slot vacated by Sachin Tendulkar’s retirement. Born to play Test cricket: Cheteshwar Pujara is the natural heir to Dravid . There is also considerable talent elsewhere in the batting line-up, at least on the evidence of shorter forms of cricket, although it has yet to prove itself consistently in the five-day version. The openers Murali Vijay and Shikhar Dhawan have shown genuine signs of promise, but they failed to post a single stand of 50 in their last eight attempts. The recall of veteran opener Gautam Gambhir, whose last international appearance was 18 months ago, indicates all is not right at the top of the Indian order. Lower down the order the stylish Rohit Sharma, who scored centuries in his first two Test innings, deserves to keep his place despite a subsequent dip in form. Ajinkya Rahane and the spinning all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja have also shown they can perform if handed the final batting slot. But to raise their ambitions and actually win a match or two, India will have to take 20 wickets. And it is here that the weaknesses in the squad really begin to show. In their warm-up matches they failed to make proper inroads into the batting line-up of not only Leicestershire but also a Derbyshire side placed second bottom in the second division that chose to field many 2nd XI players. The Indian pace attack, if it can be so called, will be led in the experience stakes by the shaggy-haired beanpole Ishant Sharma. He is accurate and generates good bounce but is yet to develop into a true match-winner and fulfil the huge promise he showed as a teenage debutant. The more likely source of wickets is Mohammed Shami, who has demonstrated in his six Tests that he has a precise radar and can move the ball – attributes suited to bowling in England. His new-ball partner Bhuvneshwar Kumar has similar qualities and also the useful knack of taking early wickets when there is plenty of swing in the air, but perhaps lacks the pace to do damage once the cherry has lost its shine. Spine of the team: India's Stuart Binny receives a back massage during the nets session . There is serious speed, however, in the form of Varun Aaron, who has regularly been clocked above 90mph. Nobody puts him in the shade: Kohli is India's main man with the bat . He can also trouble batsmen with movement if he lands the ball in the right place. The only problem is that he doesn’t do so very often. Much may depend on whether Fletcher – so familiar with English conditions – can get these and any other seamers he uses to capitalise on whatever help there is from the pitches and climate. It is difficult to forecast how much Fletcher will use the lead spinner, Ravichandran Ashwin, particularly in the opening matches. While often deadly at home, he failed to take a single wicket and conceded 108 runs in the sole away Test away he was selected for, in South Africa, in the last two years. The lack of penetration and experience among the bowlers means India may choose to adopt a cautious and realistic approach for much of the series rather than going for all-out attack. On their recent winter tours to South Africa and New Zealand, they got into several winning positions and competed until the end before ultimately losing both series 1-0. They will probably be pleased with their summer’s work if a similar pattern is repeated in England. But the victory of a similarly unheralded Sri Lanka team in the two-Test series last month shows there are rewards on offer for holding greater ambition and optimism. If they manage to weather the seamer-friendly conditions of the first two Tests and go into the final games with a fighting chance of a series victory, then India may yet prevail in what is likely to be a tight battle between two young sides still undergoing a process of transition.","English fans will not be able to recognise some of India's players .

'I looked to what Phil Mickelson did last year,' Rose told Sky Sports News. 'He wouldn’t have been the classic Open pick but the confidence he would have gained from winning the Scottish Open and then carrying it to Muirfield really caught my eye. 'I took inspiration from Phil’s schedule from winning there and going on to win the Open.' All smiles: Rose was victorious at Congressional two weeks ago and wants to keep that winning habit going over the coming days as he approaches The Open at Hoylake . Mickelson will be at Castle Stuart to defend his title with Rose also up against the likes of Ian Poulter, Rickie Fowler, Lee Westwood, Luke Donald and Rory McIlroy. 'It is a strong field that's been assembled,' he added. 'I've tried to play links courses and playing a tournament links course a week before the Open can only be good for how you start to see shots and you get your touch and shot selection under pressure.'

"England will hope for great things from their two most experienced bowlers. Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad have 600 Test wickets between them — and 70 of those have come at Trent Bridge. While Anderson has picked up 49 scalps in seven Nottingham Tests at 17 apiece — with six five-wicket hauls — Broad has managed 21 at 22 in five, including a  hat-trick against India in 2011. Jimmy Anderson, who almost singlehandedly beat Australia here a year ago with 10 wickets in the match, needs five more to become the leading wicket-taker in Tests in England. He currently has 225, one behind Ian Botham and four behind Fred Trueman. Expectation: James Anderson and Stuart Broad have to perform for England .

Swing spells trouble . The Trent Bridge pitch has always been batsman-friendly — but it’s the notorious swing that can cause problems and undo teams.

Alastair Cook may not see Trent Bridge as the place to kick-start his revival. In 13 Test innings he has scored only one half-century — against Australia last year — and averages just 21.

"By . James Rush . Four men have been jailed for an attack on a mosque just a day after Drummer Lee Rigby was killed. Michael Manyweathers, 49, Jeremy Rochester, 33, Robert Mullins, 35 and Trevor Mullins, 38, each pleaded guilty to racially aggravated criminal damage after windows at the Dorset Islamic Cultural Association, in Poole, were broken on May 23. Manyweathers, of Poole, Robert and Trevor Mullins, both of Shaftesbury, and Rochester, of Bournemouth, were each sentenced to four months in prison by a judge at Bournemouth Crown Court yesterday, prosecutors said. Sentence: The four men have been jailed for four months after pleading guilty to racially aggravated criminal damage at the Dorset Islamic Cultural Association (pictured) They were also each ordered to pay £150 compensation to the Dorset Islamic Cultural Association. Richard Oakley, district crown prosecutor for the Crown Prosecution Service in Wessex, said: 'Robert Mullins, Trevor Mullins and Jeremy Rochester and Michael Manyweathers went to Dorset Islamic Centre on May 23 with the intention of causing damage to the property. 'This crime was religiously aggravated as the four defendants clearly targeted the mosque. 'An off-duty police officer who was walking along Ashley Road in Poole heard the sound of smashing glass coming from the windows of the centre and walked to the back of the building to see what was happening. Tragic: The attack happened just one day after the death of Drummer Lee Rigby in Woolwich . 'Three of the defendants were present. One was carrying a piece of wood approximately 3ft long. 'The men saw him and one shouted at him ""We are English mate, who do you think you are"". 'After a short confrontation, the males walked to a stationary car and were driven off by the defendant Robert Mullins.' Mr Oakley said the incident was sparked by a conversation in a pub in Poole about the death of Drummer Rigby in Woolwich, London. He said not long before the incident the defendants were seen drinking at the Grasshopper Public House in Poole, where a man, matching the description of Trevor Mullins, expressed anger concerning Lee Rigby's death, which had occurred the day before in Woolwich. He said: 'The four men then drove to the mosque with the specific intention of causing damage. 'CCTV evidence showed Trevor Mullins, Jeremy Rochester and Michael Manyweathers causing criminal damage to windows at the mosque. 'They pleaded guilty at the first opportunity. 'We hope that with this prosecution the public will be reassured that the CPS takes very seriously any religiously and racially motivated attack and will robustly prosecute those cases when there is sufficient evidence and is in the public interest to do so.' The attack on the mosque in Dorset is one of several similar incidents that have happened across the country since Drummer Rigby died. Earlier this week swastikas and racist graffiti were painted on the walls and windows of a mosque in Redditch, Worcestershire.

Don't get up: The photographer who snapped these photos says the bear didn't seem to mind his presence as he took photos from 60 feet away . Comfy? Photographer Rafael Torres says the bear stayed in the hammock for about 20 minutes . Refreshed: After his 20 minute snooze, Torres says the bear ran back into the woods behind the home . Scary: Residents say the bear was in the neighborhood the previous night banging around in trash cans . Photographer Rafael Torres was in the area snapping photos when he spotted the bear, which presumably was the same bear that was causing such a ruckus the previous night. Torres followed the bear and watched as it walked into a person's backyard, crawled into the hammock, got comfortable and took a load off. Torres says he was about 60 feet away from the animal taking photos - and the bear didn't seem bothered by his presence. At about 8:15 p.m. - about 20 minutes after first crawling into the hammock - Torres says the bear climbed down and ran back into the woods behind the home. Torres tells NBC affiliate WESH that this is the first time he's seen a black bear in the residential area. Famous Amis: Video of this bear - named 'Famous Amis' - taking a break in a hammock was posted to Youtube in 2006 and quickly went viral . Bears love hammocks: These two baby black bears were seen playing around on this hammock in September of 2013 . And down they go: These bears are much better at getting on a hammock than they are at staying on a hammock . Black bears apparently are drawn to hammocks - in the last several years, there have been several photos and videos posted on the Internet of the animals playing in backyard hammocks. The most famous, perhaps, is a bear given the name 'Famous Amis' after video of him taking a break in a hammock was posted to Youtube in 2006. The video has been viewed nearly 340,000 times. In one of the more adorable videos, two baby black bears are shown playing around in a hammock in a person's backyard - and the only thing cuter than two baby black bears playing on a hammock is two baby black bears falling out of a hammock, which is exactly what happens in the video.","The bear was spotted in a neighborhood in Daytona Beach, Florida on Wednesday banging around trash cans .

"By . Australian Associated Press . Manly's David Williams is reportedly among a number of players facing suspension by the NRL over a betting scandal. Manly Sea Eagle David Williams has been named as the player involved in a NRL betting scandal . The Sea Eagles winger has been named as one of those understood to have broken the code's strict gambling guidelines. The report by The Daily Telegraph also claimed a big-name player from a Sydney club will be banned for six weeks for breaking the gambling guidelines. The NRL is expected to sanction a number of other players on Thursday for placing small bets on matches - often as little as $5 - following an audit by its Integrity Unit. There is no suggestion Williams, or any other player, was involved in match fixing. Late last month, the NRL said it had found no evidence of widespread involvement of players in betting on matches, with initial inquiries indicating there were less than eight players who might face penalties for breaches. NRL rules forbid any player, manager, club employee or game official taking part in gambling in relation to rugby league. The latest scandal to hit the game - which comes just a week after the Todd Carney 'bubbler' furore - has broken on the morning of State of Origin III. Williams is said to have placed a series of small $5 bets on games. There is no suggestion he was involved in match fixing .","Williams facing suspension after breaking NRL's gambling guidelines .

"By . Mark Prigg . Taiwan's Quanta Computer Inc will start mass production of Apple first smartwatch in July, and the much anticipated timepiece will be revealed in October, it has been claimed. Rumours still differ as to whether the watch will be round or rectangular. It could also come in both mens and womens sizes, will help track user's health. Scroll down for video . Google announcement comes just a week after sources revealed Taiwan's Quanta Computer Inc will start mass production of Apple first smartwatch in July, and the much anticipated timepiece will be revealed in October. Pictured is a concept design of what the iWatch may look like . Speculation . around Apple's iWatch began at the end of 2012 and a rumoured release . date was initially set for the fourth quarter of 2013. Chinese websites reported in December 2012 that the computer giant was working with chip-maker Intel on a wrist-worn gadget. It was said to have a 1.5inch screen and use Bluetooth to communicate with other devices, including an iPhone. Other . rumours suggest the iWatch will feature Siri voice controls that let . users dictate messages, rather than use the tiny screen. The watch could also be used as a remote control to change music tracks or pause video, on the phone or tablet. In July last year, reports in the Financial Times said Apple was hiring outside help to tackle design problems with its iWatch. It is claimed Apple will produce upto 5 million of the gadgets per month. The production will be a boost to Quanta, given that its work for Apple till now has focused on laptops and iPods, product lines that are in decline. While the watch is widely expected, the start date of its mass production and the extent of Quanta's involvement were not known until now. Mass production will start in July and the commercial launch will come as early as October, according to the source and another person familiar with the matter. Apple will introduce a smartwatch with a display that likely measures 2.5 inches diagonally and is slightly rectangular, one of the sources said. The source added that the watch face will protrude slightly from the band, creating an arched shape, and will feature a touch interface and wireless charging capabilities. The source said Apple expects to ship 50 million units within the first year of the product's release, although these types of initial estimates can be subject to change. The watch is currently in trial production at Quanta, which will be the main manufacturer, accounting for at least 70 percent of final assembly, the source said. Like many other smartwatches, Apple's watch will be able to perform some functions independently, but tasks like messaging and voice chat will require a paired smartphone, according to the source. The device will only be compatible with gadgets running Apple's iOS, like its flagship iPhone, one of the sources said. A third source said LG Display Co Ltd is the exclusive supplier of the screen for the gadget's initial batch of production. It also contains a sensor that monitors the user's pulse. Singapore-based imaging and sensor maker Heptagon is on the supplier list for the feature, two other sources said. But the market is growing fast, with data firm IDC saying that worldwide shipments of wearable computing devices - a category that includes smartwatches - will triple in size this year over 2013. Apple has already dropped hints of its plans in this arena, hiring the former chief executive of French fashion house Yves Saint Laurent, a unit of Kering SA, and proclaiming that it will introduce 'new product categories""' this year. Many are hoping that Apple's entry into the field of so-called smart wearables will be a game-changer that transforms the industry like the company's iPhone did in 2007. Some are foreseeing that smartphone sales, the current cash cow of the consumer tech world, will lose momentum in the years ahead as the market reaches saturation. IDC predicts that worldwide smartphone sales will increase 23 percent this year, a slowdown from the 39 percent growth of last year, and that growth will average only 12 percent annually from 2013 to 2018. Apple VP Eddy Cue’s recently hinted at the launch, saying: 'Later this year, we’ve got the best product pipeline that I’ve seen in my 25 years at Apple.' According top Nikkei, the watch will run a version of Apple's iOS software currently found on the iPad and iPhone. 'The new watch-like wearable gear will run on this OS, which will be equipped with a centralized function to manage users' biometric information via smartphones,' it said. During a trip to Taiwan, a New York tech analyst recently said an Apple supplier revealed a number of features of the much-rumoured device, including a rounded face and slim design. This would resemble how the Moto 360 looks -  and contradicts previous reports the watch would have a curved, or square screen. New York analyst Brian Blair claims an Apple supplier has revealed the iWatch will have a rounded face, similar to the Moto 360, pictured, come in male and female versions, and will go into production in July. Previous reports suggested it would have a curved, or square screen like the G Watch and Samsung's Gear range . The reports were made by Brian Blair from Rosenblatt Securities. According to his supply chain sources, the iWatch will be designed to look like a traditional watch, and move away from the chunky, square look of the G Watch and Samsung’s Gear range. Motorola announced its own plans for a round, Android-powered smartwatch earlier this year and Blair's sources claim Apple’s version will be almost identical, if not a little thinner. As Business Insider noted, Apple’s icons have rounded edges and this would suit a circular face. Blair’s source also confirmed previous rumours that the iWatch would be available in ‘his’ and ‘hers’ models, and will go into production from July. The design is similar to concepts created by Mark Bell from Belmdesigns. Bell’s concept incorporates the rumoured . Healthbook fitness features that leaked in March, but experts believe . Apple could additionally be working on a separate wristband specifically . designed to track health. By comparison, the LG G Watch, pictured, has a square, 2-inch display and runs Android Wear - a streamlined version of Google's current operating system seen on phones and tablet. The Samsung range of Gear devices similarly chose a square, rather than rounded design . The Moto 360, pictured, is expected to launch at Google's I/O in June, followed by the iWatch in September . Earlier this week, during the unveiling of its latest G3 handset, LG gave a sneak peek of its square Android-powered G Watch. All three - the Moto 360, the G Watch and the iWatch - are expected to launch later this year. It’s likely the Moto 360 will be announced at Google’s I/O in June, and go on sale for £180 in July, followed by the iWatch during Apple’s annual September event. Price-wise, an Apple iWatch may follow the same pattern as Apple’s handsets and sit at the top end of the market. Reports last month even stated it could cost ‘thousands’ of dollars. Although the smartwatches of Samsung and Sony haven’t been as popular as analysts predicted, Blair said orders for the iWatch are surpassing expectation and he forecasts 18 to 21 million iWatches will be sold before Christmas. Samsung also recently revealed a new smart wristband and announced plans to let manufacturers use the same core components - much like the mobile phone market. The new claims about a rounded design contradict previous reports the iWatch would have a curved screen, as seen in this concept by Todd Hamilton . Tag Heuer, part of luxury goods group LVMH, said on Friday its vice president for sales, Patrick Pruniaux, who had been with the brand for seven years, was leaving on Monday to join Apple - and is expected to work on the iWatch. There . is widespread speculation Apple has been working on wearable . devices, and its products tend to use proprietary technologies. However, an open system would be a departure for Samsung as well. Its Gear wristwatches and fitness devices currently work only with Samsung phones. Smartwatches from Sony and other manufacturers tend to work with a wider range of Android phones. Last night, Samsung revealed a new smart wristband and announced plans to let manufacturers use the same core components - much like the mobile phone market.

"By . Emily Crane . Four men have been arrested after police swooped on an alleged credit card skimming syndicate targeting taxi customers throughout Sydney. Officers found 800 blank credit cards, a card encoder and a laptop computer when they arrested four men at a motel at Chullora, west of Sydney, last week. The cards had the potential to fraudulently obtain hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash, products and services. Police seized a card encoder last week in an alleged credit card skimming syndicate targeting taxi customers throughout Sydney . A unit in Sussex Street, Sydney, was also raided and police seized two computers, mobile phones, and financial and identification documents. Police will allege the four men were members of a well organised, sophisticated credit card skimming syndicate and obtained credit card details from a variety of sources, including skimming devices in taxis. 'I checked my account recently and discovered that $2000 had been withdrawn two days earlier from an ATM in a suburb I'd never been to and another $2000 transaction had been made the following day in the city. My card was still in my wallet and I'm careful to cover my hand when I enter my PIN at ATM's, so I had no idea who had taken the money and how they had done it. Feeling sick I called my bank to report the unauthorised transactions and was asked whether I had used the EFTPOS facility in a taxi cab recently and whether the driver had complained that his machine wasn't working before trying a different machine. Be wary of cab drivers using two different machines to swipe your card . That had happened to me a few weeks earlier and as the bank explained is a very common method used to skim cards and PIN numbers. I was warned to only ever use my credit card in a cab, before the bank quickly refunded the missing funds - including both the ATM fees!' - Melissa Milowski . The skimmed information was allegedly then used to manufacture fraudulent credit cards, which were used to make ATM withdrawals and purchases. The Acting Commander of the Fraud and Cybercrime Squad, Detective Acting Superintendent John Watson said 'People need to be alert every time they use their credit or debit card'. He went on to warn that 'It doesn’t matter whether you’re withdrawing money at an ATM, paying for a meal at a restaurant or settling a fare in a taxi, never let your card out of your sight.' 'Some skimming devices look exactly like legitimate payment terminals, allowing criminals to skim a card’s details right under the cardholder’s nose.' The arrests came several months after Fraud and Cybercrime Squad detectives started investigating the men. A 28-year-old Sydney man was charged with directing the criminal group, dealing in identification information and possessing equipment to manufacture documents. Three other men, a Potts Point man, 28, and a Rockdale man, 24, and a Moorebank man, 29, have been charged with dealing in identification information, possessing document manufacturing equipment and participating in a criminal group. All four men were granted condition bail and will appear at Burwood Local Court later this month. Detective Superintendent Watson is encouraging any taxi drivers or customers who have information concerning the use of skimming devices in taxis to contact Crime Stoppers. 'If you are a driver and you were approached by people asking you to use a skimming device, or you are aware of other taxi drivers using these devices, please do the right thing and contact Crime Stoppers/' 800 blank credit cards were found as part of the raid and police allege they had the potential to fraudulently obtain hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash, products and services . Four men who were members of a well organised, sophisticated credit card skimming syndicate were arrested .

"By . Daniel Mills . Gerry Fortuna became a hit after an email he sent at Channel Nine about a colleague went viral . It seems the luck of the Sydney IT worker who rose to notoriety after proclaiming his love for a Channel Nine colleague on his farewell email just hasn't changed. Mr Fortuna has now confessed to 'winning' a poker machine jackpot ... of just three cents. And the 28-year-old admitted his luck with the ladies hasn't changed since he was rejected by Mia at Channel Nine, admitting he's 'still available'. The former Channel Nine worker rose to fame in March when he sent an email to more than 1000 colleagues professing his 'long term crush' on Mia. His latest turn of bad luck came while he was drinking with a few mates in Sydney's inner west, and decided to put some money in the pokies. Clearly a sucker for public humiliation, Mr Fortuna posted his 'win' on Instagram. But Mr Fortuna was still looking on the bright side on his recent tales of misfortune, telling the Daily Mail Australia: 'I know my surname is Fortuna but I'm anything but fortunate.' 'Love, gambling...the list can go on.' He did say, however, that he had plans for investing his three cents into some everyday expenses or even a 'holiday.' 'I'll probably just put it towards some fuel, that's really expensive now, or even a holiday.' 'I just thought it would be funny, taking this ticket to the counter and asking for my three cents.' 'The woman just looked at me and scratched her head, thinking 'how do I do this?' 'I think the funniest part of the night was her reaction.' Unlucky: Mr Fortuna lost $19.97 after putting in an initial investment of $20 into a pokie machine at a pub at Ashfield in Sydney's inner west . The girl believed to be Mia (centre), was part of the inspiration for Gerry Fortuna's 1,4000-word farewell email . Back in March, after six years at Channel Nine, Mr Fortuna finally summoned the courage to announce his love for a colleague when he shared a 14,000-word farewell email with 1000 Channel Nine staff. In it, he admitted he had never had the 'guts to tell anyone' how he felt, but thought what better time than his final day to let his emotions escape. 'Now I never had the guts to tell anyone at work what I’m about to say, it would be unprofessional, however I’m leaving so it doesn’t matter,' he wrote in the email. 'This may or may not come as a surprise to you as I don’t think you ever knew Mia, but now that I’m leaving it won’t matter ... I think you’re really cute in a beautiful way. In the days after the email went viral, Mr Fortuna took to Twitter to react to the public response. 'Hopefully this sudden attention does not tarnish my reputation or career! Hope Mia is doing okay... What a ride so far! Still in shock...' However, he told Daily Mail Australia on Tuesday the pair have cut ties and haven't spoken since: 'Me and her were friends ... we worked it all out but then when it went viral s*** got real, so we decided not to talk.' For those ladies wondering: 'Yes, still single,' he said. Is he looking? 'Not really looking, I mean ... I wouldn't say I'm not not looking.' At the time a A Nine spokeswoman declined to comment, saying: 'It was a personal email and we won’t be commenting.'","The 'still single' Gerry Fortuna lost playing the pokies at a Sydney pub .

"By . Emily Crane . The combined wealth of Australia's seven richest people is greater than the poorest 1.73 million households, new figures show. The Australia Institute has warned that policies being adopted by the federal government are likely to widen the gap between the extremely wealthy and the nation's poorest. Data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics shows the bottom 20 percent of households have an estimated $54 million in wealth, while the nation's seven richest have a combined wealth of more than $60 billion. Scroll down for video . Mining magnate Gina Rhinehart was named Australia's richest person last month with an estimated wealth of $20 billion . The country's richest – including Gina Rinehart ($20 billion), Anthony Pratt ($7.6 billion), James Packer ($7.19 billion), Frank Lowy ($7.16 billion), Ivan Glasenberg ($6.6 billion), Wing Mau Hui ($6.3 billion) and Andrew Forrest ($5.9 billion) – were named on the BRW Rich List last month. The Australia Institute's paper, Income and Wealth Inequality in Australia, revealed how a reduction of the top marginal income tax rate has helped the rich get richer and ‘widened the disparity between wealth and incomes in Australia', the Sydney Morning Herald reports. In an attack on the Abbott government's proposed budget cuts targeting low-income families, the institute's report suggests the gap between rich and poor will grow if payments to low-income families are reduced further. Visy packaging billionaire Anthony Pratt was the second wealthiest behind Ms Rinehart with $7.64 billion wealth . Casino magnate James Packer came in at third on the list with $7.2 billion . Gina Rhinehart: $20 billion . Anthony Pratt: $7.6 billion . James Packer: $7.19 billion . Frank Lowy: $7.16 billion . Ivan Glasenberg: $6.6 billion . Wing Mau Hui: $6.3 billion . Andrew Forrest: $5.9 billion . The paper shows tax cuts by the government over the past eight years has contributed to the wealth divide, with the top 10 percent of earners benefiting more than the bottom 80 percent of taxpayers. The government's decision to make welfare payments grow at a slower rate than wages could further increase the gap between the poor and wealth, Dr Richard Denniss, the Australia Institute's executive director, has warned. He said many Australians were unaware of wage inequality, with a recent Australia Institute survey showing most people think the average income is similar to what they are earning – those who earn between $100,000 and $150,000 believe the average Australian earns the same.

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . Almost a million 'superhuman' carers will receive an annual government 'bonus' under proposals set out by the Liberal Democrats this morning. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg  announced the party's 2015 general election manifesto would include a pledge to top up Carer's Allowance by £125 each year, rising to £250 by 2020. It would be paid to anyone who had been receiving the state help for at least 12 months - about 85 per cent of claimants. Nick Clegg, on ITV's Good Morning Britain, praised the 'superhuman' work of carers and promised to hand them an extra £125 a year . The Deputy Prime Minister said scheme would cost £130million a year, but would be 'fully costed' in the party's manifesto . But the party gave no details of how the expected £130 million a year cost of the scheme - rising to £280 million - would be paid for. A spokesman said the Lib Dems would produce a 'fully costed manifesto' before the election next May. Mr Clegg said the extra money was a recognition of the 'superhuman' work done by the 'hidden army of carers'. 'Carers are Britain's unsung heroes - up and down the country behind closed doors, you'll find a hidden army of carers doing amazing things every day,' he said. 'It is estimated that six in 10 of us will at some point in our lives find ourselves caring for someone else - an elderly relative, a sick child, a friend who needs our support. 'Obviously this makes a massive difference to the people being cared for - but Carers UK calculated that it saves us a whopping £119 billion every year - more than the entire NHS budget. 'These are people who deserve our support even in these straitened times, which is why the Liberal Democrat manifesto will include a Carer's Bonus to give them a little extra help. 'It's completely up to the carers themselves how they spend it - it's a no-strings-attached bonus from a party that is grateful for the superhuman work they do.' Mr Clegg said that carers save the NHS £119 billion every year and should be rewarded for their help . The party suggested the money could be spent on a weekend break, paying for professional care cover, a cleaner to give the house a spring clean, treats for grandchildren or a new laptop. The number eligible - also including those eligible for Carer's Premium on top of another benefit - is expected to rise from a million in 2015 to 1.1 million by the end of the Parliament in 2020.","The carer's allowance will be doubled to £250 a year under Clegg's proposal .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . New mothers should be taught about the risks of sleeping with their babies to try to cut the number of babies who die from cot death, health officials said. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) said families should learn about safe sleeping habits for babies to reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (Sids). About 250 babies die from Sids every year in England and Wales. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence said families should learn about safe sleeping habits for babies . In new draft recommendations, Nice said that all parents should be made aware of the link between cot death and falling asleep with a baby up to the age of one. Midwives, GPs and health visitors should also make parents aware that the risks are significantly higher if parents drink, smoke or take drugs, the guidance states. Babies born prematurely or with a low birth weight are at an increased risk of cot death if they sleep with their parents. 'Falling asleep with a baby, whether that’s in a bed or on a sofa or chair, is risky,' said Nice’s clinical practice director professor Mark Baker. 'It’s imperative that all parents and carers know about the association between sudden infant death syndrome and falling asleep with a child under the age of one. Nice said that all parents should be made aware of the link between cot death and falling asleep with a baby up to the age of one . 'This is especially important if parents drink alcohol, take drugs or expose their baby to tobacco smoke.' He added: 'There is no universal agreement on the causes of sudden infant death syndrome. 'We know there is a link between Sids and falling asleep with a baby in a bed or on a sofa or chair, but studies into why this happens can often give conflicting results. And other factors are likely to play a part in increasing the risk to the infant. 'We recognise that some parents may choose to share a bed with their baby because it could make breastfeeding easier, or for cultural reasons. Or they may be forced to co-sleep because they may not have the space or money for a cot. 'This is why it’s so important for parents to understand what the risks are. The recommendations we are developing aim to help healthcare professionals inform parents and carers of the likely risks associated with co-sleeping, according to the best available evidence.' The Nice guidance has been put out for consultation until the end of the month.","Nice said families should learn about safe sleeping habits for babies .

"By . Australian Associated Press . North Melbourne coach Brad Scott has looked to draw a line under Brian Lake and Drew Petrie's infamous scrap in last Friday night's AFL game. Lake was suspended for four games on Tuesday after having his misconduct charge sent directly to the tribunal. The panel was unswayed by Lake's evidence that he was not trying to grab Petrie's throat, but rather his jumper around the collarbone area. Scroll down for video . Hawthorn's Brian Lake was suspend for four games on Tuesday after choking North Melbourne's Drew Petrie in an AFL game last Friday . The tribunal's panel were unswayed by Lake's evidence that he was not trying to grab Petrie's throat, but rather his jumper around the collarbone area . Scott was unwilling to offer his opinion about Lake's ban or actions - a self-admittedly reserved approach for a coach that is known for being anything but. 'That's a question for Drew. Drew hasn't told me and it's irrelevant to me,' Scott said on Wednesday when asked if Lake had apologised to Petrie. 'It's not really for me to comment. There's going to be plenty of opinion about that (Lake's ban). 'Our concern is for our player and that's it. The footy world can debate the Lake and Hawthorn side of it. Once Drew left the tribunal I turned it off.' North Melbourne coach Brad Scott has not commented on Lake's ban and said the club's concern was for Petrie . After the rearing, Lake expressed remorse reported The Age. 'It’s been a tough couple of days for myself and my family. It's great to come here and get my point across on what happened,' he said. 'I respect the jury’s decision on the four weeks. Now, I've just got to look forward to a tough four-week period of training to get my body right. Leading into the finals I've got three game to get my match fitness and look for a big September.' Prior to Lake's case, Petrie fronted the tribunal for making unreasonable and unnecessary contact to the face of the 2013 Norm Smith medallist. The forward escaped with a reprimand for lashing out at Lake, but was not stung with any carryover points as the match review panel had intended. After the hearing, Lake said he respected the jury's decision to suspend him for four weeks . Petire explained to the tribunal that Lake's right arm had trapped him in a headlock, when he reached up with his hand to push himself out of that position for his own safety, The Age reported. Unable to see, he said he pushed Lake for only two seconds and stopped immediately when he realised he had come into contact with Lake's face. Petrie said Lake was in a 'dominant' and 'aggressive' position on his head as they wrestled. 'I knew I had to push out of that position to prevent any damage to myself,' Petrie told the tribunal. 'We wanted to defend Drew at the tribunal and make sure that he went into the back half of the year without anything hanging over his head,' Scott said. The Kangaroos face St Kilda in Hobart on Saturday, while Lake will miss games against Adelaide, Sydney, Western Bulldogs and Melbourne.

A recent study by Paul Spence, from the University of NSW's Climate Change Research Centre, has suggested sea levels may rise faster than previously estimated because climate models have failed to account for the effects of strong winds in Antarctica. Glaciers on the Antarctic west coast may have begun melting and could raise sea levels by three metres over 200-500 years, according to Dr Spence. Scroll down for video . Paul Spence, from the University of NSW's Climate Change Research Centre, says parents should purchase land metres above sea level to account for climate change . 'If you were buying land in Australia and wanting to pass it down to your kids or your grandchildren, I suggest it's a couple of metres above sea-level,' he told the Sydney Morning Herald. 'It's the first time that I looked at my science and thought, ""Oh my god, that is very concerning""! Changes to winds have already been linked to southern Australia's drying climate but now it appears they may also have a profound impact on warming ocean temperatures under the ice shelves along the Antarctic coastline. The study by Dr Spence has suggested sea levels may rise faster than previously estimated because climate models have failed to account for the effects of strong winds in Antarctica . 'When we first saw the results it was quite a shock. It was one of the few cases where I hoped the science was wrong,' Dr Spence said. When researchers included projected Antarctic wind shifts in a detailed global ocean model, they found water up to 4°C warmer than current temperatures at the base of the Antarctic ice shelves. Recent estimates suggest the West Antarctic ice sheet alone could contribute 3.3 metres to long-term global sea level rise. Glaciers on the Antarctic west coast may have begun melting and could raise sea levels by three metres over 200-500 years, according to Dr Spence . Prior to the research by Dr Spence and scientists at the UNSW and the Australian National University, most sea level rise studies focused on the rate of ice shelf melting due to the general warming of the ocean over large areas. Using super computers at Australia's National Computational Infrastructure Facility the researchers were able to examine the impacts of changing winds on currents down to 700m around the coastline in greater detail than ever before.","Paul Spence from the University of NSW says sea levels may rise faster than estimated due to strong winds in Antarctica .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A new 'reservation scalping' website which makes last-minute restaurant bookings under false names before selling them for up to $12 each has caused outrage. ReservationHop.com is the latest entrant in the pay-to-play booking wars, buying up tables at popular San Francisco restaurants and selling them back to customers for a $5 to $12 fee. While the creator says he's helping users get a spot at in-demand eateries, critics claim the site is 'unethical' because it makes money off a free service and could damage businesses if bookings aren't sold. The service: Brian Mayer launched the ReservationHop.com website (pictured) on July 4 and it currently applies to San Francisco restaurants . Richie Nakano, owner and head chef of Japanese restaurant Hapa Ramen, said the website is 'disgusting and hurtful to restaurants that already operate on razor thin margins'. 'An . app like that, while not breaking any rules or laws per se, has the . potential to be hurtful to small businesses that rely on having a . reservation book full of diners that actually show up,' he said in an email to Valley Wag. 'What happens to . the reservations that no one winds up buying? This is a perfect example . of tech trying to 'disrupt' something without thinking of the . consequences. 'I hate this idea. 'It's awful and selfish and if it was my . restaurant I would check that site everyday to see if my place were . listed there so I could delete those reservations.' ReservationHop.com creator Brian Mayer said he developed the website, which applies only to San Francisco restaurants, after waiting 30 minutes for a burrito. He said he cancels reservations that aren't purchased four hours in advance and that 'in the interest of ethics and fairness', he wants to talk to restaurants about working with them directly. Twitter users have slammed Mayer as self-interested and 'sleazy'. Observers have noted the website could make it harder for diners who don’t want to use ReservationHop.com to . get a reservation, and have compared it to apps that allow . users to sell street parking.

Inspiration: Brian Mayer (pictured left and right) said he created ReservationHop.com after waiting 30 minutes for a burrito .

Killer Rezzy- restaurants in New York and The Hamptons . Resy - New York restaurants . Shout - everything for theatre shows and cronuts to restaurants . Zurvu - restaurants . Others have commented that the website capitalizes on and exploits a free service to the detriment of customers and restaurants. Beyond Twitter, Josh Ong at The Next Web described the idea as 'sleazy' and as 'tech enabled scalping'. After receiving a torrent of abuse for his website, Mayer defended himself on his blog in a post titled, 'How I became the most hated person in San Francisco, for a day'. 'I built . this site as an experiment in consumer demand for a particular product, . and the jury’s still out on whether it will work...,' the University of Chicago history graduate wrote. 'Reservations . aren’t free. 'Restaurant tables are limited, in high demand and people . wait a good long time as walk-ins to get them.

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . First came dogs, then monkeys, and finally humans - so what's the next logical step in mankind's space exploration endeavours? Fortunately one group of amateur rocketeers in Portland, Oregon has the answer - they’ve been busy sending kegs of beer on rocket trips to the final front-beer. And in September they’re planning their most ambitious launch yet as their two-stage rocket will take beer on a short ride towards the cosmos. Scroll down for video . A group of amateur rocekteers from Portland, Oregon is planning to launch a keg of beer towards space in September. They have previously launched the rocket (shown, keg is at the top) in 2008 and 2012, but this will be the highest flight of the rocket yet, expected to reach about 20,000 feet (3.8 miles; 6.1 kilometres) The group are known as Team Numb, and have completed two successful launches before. The first came in 2008, when they sent a 15 gallon keg (68 litres) of beer on their 11-foot (3.4 metres) tall, 350-pound (160 kilograms) rocket to a height of 6,200 feet (1,900 metres). This was followed by another launch in 2012, which flew to 7,700 feet (2,350 metres). But now the team are hoping to more than double their ceiling with their later launch, which is expected to reach close to an altitude of 20,000 feet (3.8 miles; 6.1 kilometres) at a speed of 650 miles (1,050 kilometres) per hour. Admittedly it’s a small fraction of the distance to the ‘true’ boundary of space, 62 miles (100 kilometres) up, but it’s surely a step in the right direction for beer enthusiasts the world over. Total: £2,150 ($3,700) £700 ($1,200) for propellant . £580 ($1,000) for motor hardware . £465 ($800) for parachutes and electronics . £410 ($700) for rocket airframe materials . The team’s rocket has two ‘stages’, different segments holding fuel and cargo. The first stage has four of the team’s large ‘N-Class’ motors, which will provide 1,000 pounds of thrust for 3.5 seconds. For a bit of comparison Nasa’s Saturn V rocket, the largest rocket ever to fly, had a thrust of 7.5 million pounds at launch. Team Numb’s rocket is powered by a solid rocket propellant known as Alumaflame, which looks like gray Styrofoam and burns with a violet flame. After reaching its max altitude the rocket descends and a parachute brings the keg back to the ground. Here the team then tap the keg and have a drink of beer after a hard day's work as rocket scientists . The first stage of the rocket will carry a small five-gallon (23 litres) keg of beer, while the second (upper) stage of the rocket has a 15-gallon (68 litres) keg of beer. After launching and reaching max altitude, a parachute deploys and brings the beer back to a rather bumpy landing. Once reaching the rocket the team will then proceed to ‘tap’ the keg of beer and drink it, just like they’ve done on the last two launches. The team were seeking £1,160 ($2,000) on Kickstarter to help with funding for the project, but they’ve now reached their goal. And beer-lovers can look forward to the launch in September of this year, although the team warns success is not guaranteed. ‘No one else has ever tried to launch a full keg,’ say Team Numb.","Team Numb from Portland, Oregon will launch a keg of beer this September .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . What’s the best way for single men to land a girlfriend? According to one study the answer turns out to be a bit of a catch-22 - women prefer men who have had previous relationships, but having too many partners is detrimental. In fact, Australian researchers found that having too partners many was less desirable than someone who had none at all. Researchers from James Cook University in Australia have found that women prefer men who have had one or two previous partners (stock image shown). Men who had had no previous partners were less desirable, while men with five previous relationships were the least desirable of all . The study was published in the journal Human Nature and is somewhat amusingly titled ‘I want what she’s having’. Men with narrower skulls are less likely to be regarded as dominant than those with wider ones, a study has found. Psychologists from Stirling University asked volunteers to look at photographs of students with neutral expressions and rate the dominance of their personality. They also photographed the volunteers and asked them to fill out a questionnaire about their own levels of authority. The research revealed a strong link between the breadth of a man’s face compared to its height, and how dominant he was considered by himself and others. The same could not be said of women. In it, Ryan Anderson and Michele Surbey of James Cook University in Queensland, Australia looked at how human mating compared to the rest of the animal kingdom. They noted how non-human animals prefer males that have had had previous association with other females, a phenomenon known as 'mate copying'. The researchers investigated ‘whether humans also exhibit mate copying’, and if women preferred experienced men. In the study, 123 female university students rated men pictured alone or with one, two or five women represented by silhouettes. The silhouettes, or lack thereof, represented how many relationships they had had in the last four years. The act of 'mate copying', as this phenomenon is called, is something that has been observed in other animals before such as birds (two red-crowned cranes pictured in a courtship display), as well as fish. The trait apparently helps the female of a species pick more high-quality mates . The findings showed that women preferred men who had one or two previous partners, as opposed to those who’d had none. Men with five previous partners, however, were the least desirable. ‘Maybe that's an indication that he's promiscuous or unable or unwilling to commit, maybe he's a bit flaky - for whatever reason, he just can't hold down relationship so that was seen as a huge turn-off,’ the researchers told ABC. And age was also a factor - younger women were more likely to ‘mate copy’ than older women. ‘Our results suggest that women do not always make mate choices independent of one another [and] there appears to be a significant desirability advantage for men who have been previously selected as a romantic partner,’ the authors added. ‘Humans are nothing more than a really pretentious species of animal,’ Anderson added.","Australian scientists say that women take part in 'mate copying'

"By . Victoria Woollaston . There have been countless iPhone 6 concepts that show how designers would like the handset to look, but not necessarily how it will look. A Dutch industrial product design student has addressed this balance by creating a series of mockups based on leaked specifications, images of dummy models and current handsets. All the elements were modelled from scratch, and any dimensions that haven’t been leaked have been based on the iPhone 5S. The mockups (pictured) were created by Dutch design student Mark Pelin. They are based on leaked and rumoured specifications, and Pelin modelled every part from scratch, including the ports and cameras . Apple's iPhone 6 is rumoured to come in a slim 'Air' version. Up . until August last year, Huawei was the record-holder for the thinnest . phone in the world with its Ascend P6, at 0.24 inches (6.18 . millimetres). This was then replaced by the Vivo X3 at just 0.23 inches (5.75 millimetres). By . comparison, Apple’s current iPhone 5S has a depth of 0.3 inches (7.6 . millimetres), while the iPad Air is slightly thinner at 0.295 inches . (7.5 millimetres). Samsung's Galaxy S5 is 0.32 inches (8.1 millimetres) thick, while the HTC One M9 is 0.37 inches (9.4 millimetres). The concepts are the work of Dutch project design student Mark Pelin, and show a sleek, thin and rounded design. The home button is shown with a metal ring, expected to be Apple's next-generation fingerprint scanner, and the rear of the case features black stripes along the top and the bottom. Pelin told MailOnline: ‘The antenna stripes are 1mm wide - significantly thinner than on the dummy models - and have a ‘black glass’ idea to them, similar to what the 5S has on the back. ‘I modelled every part, from scratch, [including the] headphone jack, cameras, lightning port, and all the buttons. ‘As far as I can tell, the dimensions are correct down to the millimetre. 'I used the dimensions of the ‘leaked’ iPhone 6 schematics, and the dummy dimensions.’ The design (pictured) resembles the rounded edges of Apple's 3GS. Any dimensions in Pelin's mockups that haven't been leaked were based on the current iPhone 5S . Rumours suggest the iPhone 6 will be 6mm (0.2 inches) thick, which is smaller than the iPhone 5s' 7.6mm (0.3 inches) design. This has led to rumours the handset will be known as the iPhone Air. The antenna stripes on Pelin's mockups (pictured) are 1mm wide - thinner than what's appeared on the leaked dummy models . Any dimensions that haven’t been leaked or hinted at were designed as they appear on the 5S. Pelin's home button is shown with a metal ring (pictured) expected to be Apple's next-generation fingerprint scanner . This includes the lightning port, headphone jack and volume rocker, which Pelin thinks are unlikely to change. 'There are some parts where I had to take a good guess of course,' continued Pelin. ‘It's hard to model the iPhone 6 without exact dimensions for everything. 'Overall, it's extremely close to the dummy model and probably the real thing.’ Rumours suggest Apple is working on two versions of different sizes, with one being 4.7 inches (11.9cm) diagonally, the same size as the HTC One. A larger version is also expected to be released, measuring 5.5 inches (14cm) - slightly larger than Samsung's 5.1-inch Galaxy S5. A recent selection of leaked images revealed changes to button placements. The power button, usually found on the top of iPhones for example, appeared to be located on the side of the device. The volume and lock buttons, however, will seemingly remain where they are. Latest images of Apple's supposed iPhone 6 were leaked last month (shown), showing a phone with an ultra-thin design and rounded images. The power button, typically found on the top of previous iPhones, appears to have been moved to the side, making the device easier to operate with one hand . The rumoured back of Apple’s new iPhone 6 (pictured left) looks similar to that of the HTC One (pictured right) with a horizontal line at the top and bottom and curved edges. It also suggests Apple may have found a way to make its 'True Tone' flash technology smaller as the whole is different to an iPhone 5S . It is believed the iPhone 6, which some think will go by the name of the iPhone Air, will sport a 1704 x 960 resolution display, and an A8 processor. The iPhone 5S, by comparison, has a 1136 x 640 resolution, and the A7 chip. These hardware changes will be in addition to the features of Apple's latest iOS 8 software, unveiled last month, which include health monitors and smart notifications.","The mockups were created by industrial product design student Mark Pelin .

Defending Commonwealth heptathlon bronze medallist Grace Clements has been called up to Team England for the 2014 Games following Morgan Lake’s withdrawal. As first revealed by Sportsmail, 17-year-old Lake has decided to concentrate on the World Junior Championships in Oregon, USA, instead of competing in the heptathlon in Glasgow. The teenager had a difficult dilemma about whether to prioritise her age-group championships or win her first senior international vest at a multi-sport event without the support of her father and coach, Eldon, in the athletes’ village. Up for it: Heptathlete Grace Clements has been selected for Team England at the Commonwealth Games . All smiles: 2010 Commonwealth bronze medalist Clements replaces 17-year-old Morgan Lake in Glasgow . Lake said: ‘This has been an extremely difficult decision for me to take as I was honoured to be selected to Team England, but ultimately it’s right for me and my development to focus on the World Juniors. ‘I want to wish Grace and the rest of Team England all the very best and I’ll be cheering them all on.’ The sensitive nature of Lake’s withdrawal has allowed England to call up Clements to compete alongside Jessica Taylor and Katarina Johnson-Thompson. Clements, 30, won bronze behind Louise Hazel in Delhi four years ago. Clements said: ‘It is great to be back on the team having medalled four years ago. I have been through a tough four years, so this is like a dream come true - a fairy tale ending to my career. I’m very grateful for this opportunity to compete in the Commonwealth Games.’ Jan Paterson, Chef de Mission of Team England, added: ‘We would like to welcome Grace, our heptathlon bronze medallist from Delhi, into Team England and I hope her final preparations for Glasgow go well. ‘We know it was a tough decision for Morgan to withdraw from the team, but we send her our very best wishes for the World Junior Athletics Championships.’ Out in the cold: Lake withdrew from Team England's selection to focus on the World Junior Championships . No go: Lake's decision was also due to her dad and coach Eldon (right) not being allowed in the athletes' village .","Grace Clements has been called up for Team England's heptathlon .

"By . Mia De Graaf . A couple living off food grown in their back garden have become embroiled in a legal battle - because the allotment 'violates planning laws'. Amanda Wadiun, 26, and her partner Paul Garnett, 29, bought the disused plot of land behind their home from Bradford council in 2010. Reminiscent of the lifestyle on TV sitcom The Good Life, they have eaten produce grown on the land, including potatoes, onions and eggs, for four years. The Good Life? Amanda Waidun, Paul Garnett, and their two sons Reuben and Alfie live off the food grown in their allotment in Wyke, West Yorkshire - but Bradford Council claims it is a violation of planning laws . Garden: They bought the house in 2010 because it was next to a disused plot of land, which they also bought . However, they have been threatened with 'enforcement action' and a warning to demolish the wooden chicken run, shed and vegetable patch. In a letter from the council, bosses said the couple, who have two children, were not allowed to use the land as a 'garden' - despite selling the plot as 'a private garden'. Sparking a £1,000 legal battle, the council added that the family could apply for retrospective planning permission but that the council would recommend refusal. Ms Waidun said: 'When we got the letter it was totally out of the blue. I can’t tell you how shocked we were. We had just that morning gone out to by wood to build an aviary. 'We wanted the house because of that plot of land so we . could live off it. We are into rearing chickens and we wanted to teach . our children the value of self-sufficiency. 'Every document sent to us when we were purchasing this land said it was to be used as a private garden. 'We now grow everything from cabbage, beans, salad and beetroot. So much love, money and of course time goes into that land. Livestock: As well as growing potatoes and beetroot, the family keep hens and geese in their back garden . Warning: Mr Garnett and Ms Waidun were told to demolish their vegetable patches, shed and chicken coop . Conflict: The enforcement order came three years after the couple bought the land as a 'private garden' 'Even when I was pregnant with my first boy I was out there digging and planting.' Finally, after a petition from the entire village of Wyke supporting them, the family has been allowed to continue living 'the Good Life'. Ms Waidun said: 'We’re very relieved but it never should have come to this in the first place. 'If they had taken the land away from us they would have . taken away our food source and all the money and hours of labour and . love invested in that garden. 'We had to borrow the money from . Paul’s parents to fight this thing. We don’t have £1,000 lying about . just to give away at a moment’s notice. 'We wanted to teach our children the value of self-sufficiency' 'Councillors . at the meeting kept saying it was ridiculous that this had happened. One councillor, usually a staunch protector of green belt land, even . said there was no other conclusion to come to.' The couple bought their house in 2010 because of the council plot next door - following the example of Tom and Barbara Good in TV sitcom The Good life. They then bought the land the following year for £10,000 with a contract stating 'the land not to be used for any purpose other than as a private garden'. The couple spent £30,000 turning the unkempt and overgrown land into a self-sustainable private garden and play area for their two children, Alfie and Ruben. Mr Garnett erected a wall around the site, security alarms in the chicken coops and grew potatoes to soften the soil. They currently grow various vegetables in their garden including potatoes, onions, cabbage and beetroot. They also keep chickens and geese - guarded by two Alsatians dogs and two cats. However, in February, planning enforcement officers contacted the family warning them the changes to the land were in breach of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. Building: The couple spent £30,000 building a shed and chicken coop so they could save on grocery spend . Relief: After a village-wide petition, they have been allowed to continue living The Good Life . One neighbour of the couple, who has lived in the area for 20 years, signed the petition, writing: 'I don’t believe there have been any objections to their plans and feel it would be a travesty and lacking in human kindness if small-print and red tape were to cut short their dream.' Other neighbours commended the couple’s efforts to turn the ‘old dumping ground for fly tippers’ into a ‘green’ environment at their own expense. And local Independant councillor David Robinson said the situation was 'absolutely barmy'. Today a Bradford Council planning spokesman said: 'This plot lies within the Green Belt and therefore any change of its use or anything that is erected on the site requires planning permission. 'However, the Planning Panel decided that special circumstances justified granting permission for the owners to erect a greenhouse and use it as a garden, especially since it had been used as such for many years. 'The Planning Panel did stipulate that it could at no time be used as a separate, independent unit.'","Amanda Waidun and Paul Garnett bought land from council in 2010 .

"By . Mark Prigg . Flood predictions could be made far more accurate by analysing satellite data, it has been claimed. Researchers say they could have predicted floods five months in advance using the technique. The team tested their theory on the 2011 Missouri River floods - and found it could have given five months warning. Missouri River flooding in 2011: Researchers say they can predict floods five months in advance using the satellite technique. Researchers measured how much water was stored in a river basin months ahead of the spring flood season, and factored it into predictions. A case study of the catastrophic 2011 Missouri River floods showed that factoring into hydrologic models the total water storage information from NASA’s Gravity Recovery & Climate Experiment mission – including groundwater accumulation below the surface – could have increased regional flood warning lead times from two months to as long as five months. Comprehensive underground measurements are not currently part of predictive models, which typically take into account river flow rates and some snowfall amounts. The UC Irvine research was published online Sunday in the journal Nature Geoscience. Researchers measured how much water was stored in a river basin months ahead of the spring flood season. The use of such data, which capture a much fuller picture of how water is accumulating, could result in earlier flood warnings, potentially saving lives and property, researchers said. A case study of the catastrophic 2011 Missouri River floods showed that factoring into hydrologic models the total water storage information from NASA’s Gravity Recovery & Climate Experiment mission – including groundwater accumulation below the surface – could have increased regional flood warning lead times from two months to as long as five months. A review of the 2011 Columbia River floods found that warnings could have been issued three months before they occurred. Comprehensive underground measurements are not currently part of predictive models, which typically take into account river flow rates and some snowfall amounts. 'GRACE data contain important hydrologic information that is not currently being utilized to estimate regional flood potential,' said lead author J.T. Reager, who did the work as a UCI postdoctoral researcher and recently joined NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory as a research scientist. 'This could significantly increase flood prediction lead times within large river basins.' The 2011 Missouri River floods lasted for months, closing interstates, shutting down nuclear plants and scouring farmland. Inland flooding causes an average of 133 deaths and $4 billion in property losses per year in the U.S., according to the National Weather Service. Earlier flood predictions could help water managers better plan for possible water diversion and evacuation strategies. The two GRACE satellites provide a means to observe monthly variations in total water storage within large river basins based on measurements of tiny changes in Earth’s gravitational field: When the amount of water stored in a region increases, the gravitational pull from that area increases proportionately – which the satellites can detect. 'These data can show us when river basins have been filling with water over several months,” said senior author Jay Famiglietti, a UCI Earth system scientist who’s on leave to be JPL’s senior water scientist. 'We’re not talking about actual flooding but about the saturation level of the ground and its predisposition to flooding. 'When it finally rains and the basin is full, there is nowhere else for the water to go.'","Allows researchers to factor groundwater and underground storage to flood predictions using Nasa satellite data .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Facebook is often blamed for leading to affairs and divorces, but it appears Twitter can be just as detrimental to relationships. Too much tweeting leads to arguments, often about the amount spent on the social media network, as well as jealousy about who a partner is talking to, according to research. The study also found the more active a couple is on the network, the more likely they are to be unfaithful to each other, and for the relationship to eventually break down completely. A study from the University of Missouri-Columbia asked 580 adult Twitter users questions about their relationships. It found couples often fell out over the time each of them spent on the network, but also how friendly they were with other users. This was true, regardless of how long the couple had been together . PhD student Russell Clayton from the University of Missouri-Columbia studied 580 adult Twitter users, aged 18 to 67 using an online questionnaire. It has been revealed that as many as one in five cheating Britons choose to stay in contact with their lovers without their partners finding out by using a secret second SIM card. In a recent poll, 21 per cent of chose to hide their infidelity through their second SIM cards. Furthermore, 19 per cent of the cheaters felt as though they didn't need to cover their tracks as they say that their partners trust them and don't suspect a thing. The research was conducted as part of an ongoing study into the double lives that mobile phones allow us to lead. Elsewhere, 20 per cent of divorces involve Facebook, and 80 per cent of divorce lawyers have reported a spike in the number of cases that use social media for evidence, according to a survey by the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers. Most participants (62 per cent) were Caucasian, 15 per cent Asian, 12 per cent Hispanic, 6 per cent African American, and 5 per cent Native American. The majority of participants (63 per cent) were male. Clayton analysed each participant’s tweets before asking them questions about their relationships. He measured the time users spent on Twitter, conflicts arising from their use, and the impact it had on their relationship. Couples often fell out over the time each of them were spending on the network, but also how friendly they were becoming with others. However, this impact was lessened among those who shared a Twitter account, he told the journal Cyberpsychology, Behaviour and Social Networking. Infidelity was classed as emotional and physical cheating. Similar problems have been recorded among Facebook users, and Twitter may be getting worse as it becomes more like Facebook with increasing use of photo uploads and sharing, the study said. The impact Twitter had on a relationship was lessened among those who shared a Twitter account. Stock image pictured . Similar problems have been recorded among Facebook users, and Twitter may be getting worse as it becomes more like Facebook with increasing use of photo uploads and sharing, he added. Clayton said: ‘Active users of social networking who are in a romantic relationship may find that Twitter-related conflicts cause relationship problems that can become serious enough to result in infidelity or divorce.’ The length of the romantic relationship does not alter the findings, he continued, so that even long married couples can fall out over Twitter as much as newlyweds. The study added: ‘Active Twitter use and Twitter-related conflict were positively associated with an increase in emotional and physical cheating, breakup, and divorce.’ Further studies are required to see if similar problems exist with other social media sites such as Instagram, the report added.","More than 580 adult Twitter users were studied using online questionnaires .

"By . Mark Prigg . All 110 chimps from the controversial New Iberia Research Center in Lafayette have arrived at their 'retirement home'. After a year and a half of fundraising, the animal all arrived safely at Chimp Haven in Louisiana, the National Chimpanzee Sanctuary. 'We are thrilled that this great day has finally arrived,' Chimp Haven President and CEO Cathy Willis Spraetz said. Tosha, Sassy and Paula, three of the chimpanzees formerly used for biomedical research by the US National Institutes of Health explore their new surroundings at Chimp Haven, a federally funded sanctuary in Keithville, Louisiana following a $5m campaign to retire them. The 200 acre sanctuary launched Road to Chimp Haven, a $5 million campaign that would cover needed construction and care for the incoming chimpanzees. Since the start of construction last year, six play areas have been completed which enabled the sanctuary to complete the transitioning phase for the chimpanzees. Currently, several bedrooms and one large open play ground are nearing completion which will allow more room for future growth. 'Many organizations and individuals have worked tirelessly to ensure these chimpanzees would have a new beginning in a sanctuary environment. 'Our dreams have finally been realized for these amazing animals.' The campaign to bring the chimpanzees, ranging from 1 to 50 years of age, from the southern Louisiana laboratory to Chimp Haven began in November 2012 when the National Institutes of Health determined that they be retired. Initially, plans were made to only send 10 to the northwest Louisiana sanctuary and the remainder to a laboratory in Texas. 'When we learned that all of the chimpanzees would not be retired to Chimp Haven, we felt they were being robbed of what was promised to them in the CHIMP Act, signed into law in 2000 and reauthorized in 2013,' Spraetz said. 'It was necessary to devise a plan that would offer a safe and caring atmosphere, one where these chimpanzees can live the rest of their lives in large social groups and determine on their own how they will spend their days.'

Soon after Cressida Bonas attended her first official engagement with Prince Harry, shadowy ‘royal sources’ were quick to dampen expectations that it signalled an engagement announcement.

Prince Harry and Cressida Bonas at an event at Wembley Arena. A source close to Cressida claims the couple will be married and the announcement will be made 'sooner than many people think' While the secretive couple arrived to events separately in the past, at Wembley Arena they arrived together and were pictured cuddling in the crowd . One of the 25-year-old dancer’s close friends tells me: ‘Harry and Cressida will be married. It is all going ahead. It is just a matter of time.’ The daughter of aristocratic Sixties model Lady Mary Gaye Curzon and businessman Jeffrey Bonas was photographed cuddling up to Harry last month at the WE Day UK youth event at Wembley Arena, where he gave the keynote speech. While the couple have been secretive in the past, arriving separately at parties, this time they were happy to be photographed cuddling and displaying open signs of affection. The next day, she accompanied him to Twickenham to watch England play rugby. A source at Balmoral told me recently that the Prince was planning to take Cressida to the Queen’s Scottish retreat this summer. It would be her first visit and likely to involve a meeting with Her Majesty. ‘It is the talk of the estate,’ I was told.

"By . Alex Greig . The trend for curvaceous rear ends shows no sign of abating, with women across the U.S. and the world risking their lives for black market procedures to make their bottoms bigger. Deaths from black market buttocks injections have been reported in Alabama, Georgia, Florida, Pennsylvania, Nevada and New York. An interior decorator in Mississippi faces trial in the deaths of two women who were injected at her house. In Venezuela, more than a dozen  women have died from botched butt injections, but that hasn't stopped the illegal procedure being performed by practitioners such as 'Dr Gus,' who, for $300, will inject young women's rears with biopolymers in his Caracas apartment. Prepping: Dr Gus prepares to perform illegal surgery in his Caracas apartment . Great lengths: Sofia says to be beautiful, you must be strong - strong enough to endure the pain of having a foreign material injected into your body . An ABC News reporter witnessed Dr Gus performing the procedure on 20-year-old college student Sofia. He first injects Sofia's behind with anesthetic and then inserts a cannula into her flesh, through which 10 syringes full of biopolymer will be injected. 'As a child it was my dream to have a big butt,' says Sofia. Dr Gus isn't deterred from his illegal practice by the spate of deaths - 17 in Venezuela in 2013 - related to butt injections. 'Those women are dying because they are going to anyone who will inject them. I am a doctor and I know what I am doing."" he told ABC. To the maximus: Dr Gus says he is a medical professional and that his injections won't have any ill-effect on Sofia . Complications: Doctors say that the ill effects from injections like the ones Sofia underwent might not be felt for years . Biopolymer: Dr Gus uses 20 syringes of the thick substance on Sofia . Forever: Sofia will never be able to completely rid her body of the biopolymer that has been injected into her behind . 'The first thing a man sees on a woman is her butt, says Dr Gus. 'I did it many times when I was young, he says. I was looking to see if her butt had projection or not.' Dr Gus spends 90 minutes on each of Sofia butt cheeks, injecting syringe after syringe. She is clearly in pain. When he removes the last syringe from Sofia's rear, silicon oozes up back out of her body through the cannula. The material he has just injected into Sofia's body is impossible to ever completely remove. Unlike a silicone implant, the material can drift around the body, down the legs or up to the spine, causing dangerous infections. Painful: Biopolymer oozes back out from the injection site on Sofia's bottom . If America is body-conscious, Venezuela is body-obsessed. Plastic surgery is as common as a trip to the dentist. Despite being illegal in Venezuela (the . sale of silicone carries a two-year prison sentence) the country’s . Association of Cosmetic Surgeons estimates that 2,000 women each month . get illegal injections in their behinds.

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . So far the world of technology has been treated to smartwatches, augmented reality glasses and electronic t-shirts. But one area of wearable technology that no one's yet put a finger on is the humble fingernail itself. Thankfully that's all set to change, however, as Tokyo toy company Takara Tomy has released LED stickers for nails that light up when you take a phone call. Scroll down for video . Tokyo-based Takara Tomy has released 'smart fingernails' called LumiDecoNail that uses Near Field Communication (NFC) to light up when it comes near an NFC-enabled device. The Android-only technology is currently available just in Japan, but other countries fret not - the company has plans for a worldwide release if they prove popular . The 'LumiDecoNail' uses a technology called Near Field Communication (NFC), in which small amounts of power are transferred very short distances, to communicate with a smartphone. London-base CuteCircuit claims its wearable technology (right) doesn't compromise on fashion. It has designed outfits that can change colour, light up or shimmer using an iPhone app. LED lights are integrated using nylon ribbon removing the need for wires. The batteries are disguised as buttons or clasps meaning that the designs can be created with traditional fabrics. This means that when the 'smart nails' come near an NFC device, such as a phone, they will light up. It also flashes whenever the wearer uses an electronic money card such as a train pass. The product is on sale in Japan, with a set of 16 nail stickers - one of which contains the LED - costing 1,200 yen (£7; $12). The micro-thin LED sticker apparently builds on the popularity of manicure . art - where intricate patterns and small gem-like stones are stuck on . the nail. Apple users are sure to be disappointed, however, as the LumiDecoNails are currently only available for a variety of Android devices. The product is marketed mainly at young people, said company spokeswoman Misayo Aruga. 'I am now wearing it on the middle finger of my right hand,' she said in a press release. 'It blinks whenever I pass through train gates, which lifts my heart a bit.' While the product is only on sale in Japan for now, fingernail tech-enthusiasts in other countries such as the U.S. and UK need not worry. The company will consider marketing the cosmetic product overseas after seeing how consumers in Japan react.

"By . Travelmail Reporter . Two thirds of Brits are greeted by rain when they return home after a holiday in the sun abroad, according to a survey. Passengers landing at Manchester and Glasgow airports are more likely that anywhere else in the UK to face stormy skies when they fly back from a warm trip overseas. And, despite grey clouds being a usual feature of the UK skyline, some 67 per cent of holidaymakers are inappropriately dressed for the British weather. Welcome home! The poll of more than 2,000 British adults who had been on a sunshine break in the past 12 months was conducted by online travel agency www.sunshine.co.uk. When asked: ‘When your return flight home landed in the UK after your hot holiday abroad, was it raining?’ two fifths of the respondents said ‘yes’. Two thirds of these, 65 per cent, said that this was despite the fact they had returned home to the UK in a summer month of June, July or August. Anyone who returned to rain was asked what airport they had landed at when flying back to the UK, which revealed Manchester to be the most common answer, followed by Glasgow. Summer clothing: Half of Brits wear their holiday outfits on the plane home - despite being greeted by rain . And more than two thirds of the total respondents admitted that they were inappropriately dressed when they landed back at a UK airport, wearing clothes suited for their holiday but not for the British weather. More than half of these were wearing flip flops or sandals, whilst 39 per cent admitted to having either shorts, a dress or a skirt on. While 43 per cent of the respondents taking part said it took them on average seven days to adjust to the British weather again. Chris Clarkson, Managing Director of sunshine.co.uk, said: ‘When you’ve just started to get used to the scorching heat abroad, there’s nothing worse than landing back in the UK to single figure temperatures and rain, rain and more rain. ‘It’s always best to expect the worst when dressing for a flight home to the UK, meaning closed toe footwear and at least a light jacket in your hand luggage.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The Space Shuttle Independence which resides at the Space Center in Houston, Texas has been hit by vandals overnight. The graffiti reads 'Houston we are the problem.' The rest of . the message is said to be highly offensive and racist but has not been released to the media. Black paint was also sprayed on the replica's mounts. Cleanup crews worked throughout the day to remove the graffiti. Criminal damage: Vandals have sprayed racial and political graffiti on a full-size replica of the Space Shuttle Independence.

The only words that have been repeated . in the media thus far are, 'Houston, we are the problem.' .Video of the vandalism has . been caught on CCTV and police are looking at the footage to try and . track down the culprits. The people who did this would have had to climb a short fence to access the shuttle.

The three remaining space shuttles were sent to museums in New York, California and at Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Intent: The vadals woudl have had to jump over a fence and use a ladder to jump up onto the shuttles' wings to spray the offensive message . A tour bus operator was among the first to discover the vandalism as he dropped off visitors early Wednesday morning. 'To the person who did this: you really need to check yourself, because you’re making it bad for all other decent people in this town,' said the driver. 'I think probably, to the people, they thought there was a message, but no one else besides them knows, and it’s kind of pointless really,' one visitor told KHOU 11 News. 'To do it with this, it’s kind of off the wall,' said another visitor. 'It’s disgusting.' What a mess: The graffiti included at least one racial slur along with other offensive messages. Black paint was also sprayed on part of the structure that holds up the replica . Evidence: Cleanup crews and the police have CCTV evidence and should have no trouble tracking down those responsible . The Independence, a mock up that was once on display at Kennedy Space Center and called the Explorer, was sent to Houston after the home of Mission Control was snubbed from getting the real things. The Independence is scheduled to be mounted on a Boeing 747 shuttle carrier and displayed outside Space Center Houston sometime next year. Space Shuttle Independence was once a shuttle mockup used to train astronauts. When the space shuttle program ended, the three orbiters of the shuttle fleet plus the drop test article space shuttle Enterprise, were distributed to sites in Washington, New York, Florida, and Los Angeles. It stirred up controversy and bitterness in Houston, where the space shuttle astronauts were trained and where shuttle missions were controlled.

"By . Mark Duell . Only one in every five homes for sale in England is affordable to a typical working family trying to get on the property ladder, a housing charity claimed today. Shelter found just 18 per cent of more than 325,000 properties with at least two bedrooms for sale in England were within the financial reach of a household with children on an average local wage. This left the remaining 82 per cent beyond their means. Just 86 properties were found to be affordable to local families in the whole of London, compared with 16,134 in the North West. For sale: Shelter found just 18 per cent of more than 325,000 properties with at least two bedrooms for sale in England were within the financial reach of a household with children on an average local wage . But the report warned that the ‘drought’ of affordable homes for typical working families looking to get on the property ladder is not just confined to London and the South East. There, only 0.3 per cent and 4.2 per cent of properties respectively were deemed to be within their means. Even in the North East, where the highest proportion of affordable family properties was found, almost two-thirds (62.7 per cent) of homes were still found to be out of the average local family's reach. In Exeter, out of 553 homes advertised for sale, only eight, amounting to 1 per cent of properties, were found to be affordable for a typical household. In South Lakeland in the North West just 43, or 4 per cent, of the 1,069 properties being marketed were found to be affordable to families, while in Herefordshire just 3 per cent were affordable, at 46 out of the 1,751 homes for sale. Devon prices: In Exeter (pictured), out of 553 homes advertised for sale, only eight, amounting to 1 per cent of properties, were found to be affordable for a typical household . In 14 local authority areas examined by Shelter, no homes for sale were deemed affordable for young families starting out. These areas, which were dotted around . London and the surrounding commuter belt, were named by Shelter as . Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea, Camden, Ealing, Brent, Richmond . upon Thames, Kingston upon Thames, Waltham Forest, Islington, Sutton, . Slough, Epsom and Ewell, Adur and Watford. Numbers and percentages of homes on the market which Shelter found to be affordable to families with children in each region . To make the calculations, researchers trawled through thousands of properties advertised for sale on property website Zoopla during a single day in April. For a property to be deemed ‘affordable’, they assumed that the typical first-time buyer would put down an 18 per cent deposit and borrow around 3.4 times their income, in line with average figures from the Council of Mortgage Lenders' (CML) database. Using official statistics, the research also took variations in local wages across England into account. Incomes were adjusted to reflect the lower ages of first-time buyers. Researchers assumed that a family with at least one child might include one adult on a full-time wage and another working part-time. Across the country, the average full-time wage for someone aged in their 20s is just over £21,000. The . findings come despite the launch of the Government's flagship Help to . Buy scheme to make it easier for people with small deposits to move on . to or up the property ladder. Critics of the scheme have said that . as well as adding to the pressure on the demand for homes, the . initiative has also generally helped to fuel people's house price . expectations. Getting on the ladder: In Herefordshire just 3 per cent of 1,751 properties being marketed for sale were found to be affordable to families. The village of Weobley in the county is pictured . Office for . National Statistics (ONS) figures released last week show that across . the UK, house prices have leapt by 9.9 per cent annually to reach a new . high of £260,000 typically in April. This puts the average house price at around 12 times the salary of someone aged in their 20s. Expectations . have been growing that the Bank of England is poised to announce . further measures to calm the market further later this week. There are already signs that the housing . market is starting to cool, following the introduction of stricter . mortgage lending rules at the end of April, which force lenders to probe . people applying for a home loan more thoroughly about their spending . habits. 'As the pool of affordable properties shrinks ever smaller, thousands of people are being forced to wave goodbye to their dreams of a home of their own - even those who've been able to put aside a large deposit' Campbell Robb, Shelter chief executive . The British Bankers' Association (BBA) reported yesterday that mortgage approvals, both to home buyers and people re-mortgaging, have been falling for four months in a row. Campbell Robb, chief executive of . Shelter, said: ‘When a family looking to buy their first home searches a . whole town for a place to live and finds nothing they can afford, it's . clear we're not just facing a housing shortage any more: it's a . full-blown drought. ‘As the pool of affordable properties shrinks ever smaller, thousands of people are being forced to wave goodbye to their dreams of a home of their own - even those who've been able to put aside a large deposit.’ Housing Minister Kris Hopkins said: ‘Improving housing affordability for hard-working people is a vital part of our long-term economic plan. ‘That's why we've cut the deficit inherited from the last government; keeping interest rates at a record low, and why we have prioritised limited financial resources for investment in housing. ‘Thanks to our efforts the number of first-time buyers is at its highest level in five years and over 131,000 households have been able to buy or reserve a property through Government-backed home ownership schemes since 2010.’","Just 18% of homes for sale in England affordable to typical working family .

The CliMate clip-on device (pictured) looks like a cloud and can gather accurate readings of a wearer's immediate environment, to warn them of possible local climatic challenges . The CliMate is a wearable weather station. It claims to accurately track the humidity, UV rays and temperature of your immediate environment, wherever the wearer is. It is wireless, wearable, light and small. The device wireless syncs HUT information via Bluetooth to an accompanying app every 15 minutes. It shows data using an image of a plant that wears sunglasses and scarves to reflect the temperature. The device tags the location and time of a collection of data, so if lots of people are using CliMates, an accurate local weather map can be generated. The coin cell battery inside lasts for six months. The CliMate cloud uses a ‘pin-point precise’ sensor that wirelessly measures humidity, UV exposure and temperature (known as HUT). It will then send these readings to an accompanying iOS and Android app every 15 minutes, when it launches in September. The San Francisco-based creators said the device will help users create their ‘own friendly environment’. ‘Excessive humidity, UV and temperature (HUT) damage goes way beyond the skin-deep. 'It negatively affects your health through illness and allergies, your mood and often times even your work performance and personal life,’ they firm wrote on its Kickstarter website, where they are trying to raise funds to put the gadget into large scale production.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Arson: Kenneth Haskins, 58, who was left disfigured after shooting himself in the face, allegedly set fire to his own home . A resident ordered to stop performing sex acts next to his open apartment windows tried to 'burn the property to the ground in protest at the ban'. Kenneth Haskins, 58, was told by the building managers that he had to stop performing the sex acts where his neighbours could see him. But, allegedly believing he had been treated unjustly, Haskins is accused of then setting fire to his apartment in Tampa, Florida, in revenge. Fire fighters were then called to the scene at the Mar Plaza Apartments in East Temple Heights Road. They discovered smoke was billowing from one of the apartments on the first floor which was well alight. It took 20 minutes for crews to extinguish the blaze. An investigation revealed that the fire originated in two separate areas - a bedroom and the kitchen - inside Haskins' apartment, according to a police report. Fire investigators determined that flammable liquids were spread to start the blaze. A resident of one of the apartments told police that his neighbour, Kenneth Haskins, 58, admitted starting the fire, according to an arrest report. Haskins, who suffers from facial disfigurement after shooting himself in the face with a shotgun, later told detectives that he wanted to get back at the company that manages Mar Plaza because they had recently told him to stop performing sex acts in front of his open windows and front door. He was arrested and charged with arson and is being held in custody at the Orient Road Jail without bail. Protest: Haskins allegedly set fire to his apartment in Tampa, Florisa, to get revenge on building management who banned him from performing sex acts near his open windows . Fire fighters had to evacuate 28 residents from Mar Plaza Apartments in East Temple Heights Road, pictured, while they extinguished the blaze . Firefighters and police evacuated 28 other apartments after the fire broke out. No one was injured but four people were left homeless as a result of the fire, according to Tampa Fire Rescue officials. Fire and smoke damage was confined to Haskins' apartment and the one next door, fire officials said. Two other apartments on the first floor also sustained water damage. The American Red Cross was called to assist the displace residents with finding temporary housing. Mar Plaza, according to internet postings, is a community of about 80 small apartments. It caters to low-income seniors and disabled people. Haskins lived in the apartment for more than a decade, according to Tampa police. He has no major criminal history in Florida, according to state records. In custody: Haskins was arrested and charged with arson.

SNCF runs some of the fastest and most efficient lines in the world but has a dark history which saw it transport thousands of Jews to their deaths in German concentration camps. Now senators in the US state of Maryland have proposed a bill which would make it illegal for the French to apply for prestige projects. Keolis, a rail company which is majority-owned by SNCF, wants to bid for a £4 billion plus contract to build a 12 miles light railway in America over 35 years. The proposed service would run between Montgomery and Prince George counties, but more than 50,000 locals have signed a petition opposing the involvement of SNCF. Senator Joan Carter Conway told Le Monde: ‘The persistent refusal of SNCF to take responsibility for its role in the Holocaust remains an insult to its victims.’ She and other senators want SNCF to pay compensation to Holocaust survivors before they are allowed to do business in the states. Alain Leray, head of SNCF in America, in turn said his company would analyse the proposed bill for ‘possible discrimination’. Mr Leray insists that his company has as much right as any other to operate as a successful business in the USA. Four years ago, SNCF issued a public apology in Florida over its wartime conduct after bidding for a rail contract to connect the cities of Orlando and Tampa. Senators in Maryland, USA, have proposed a bill to prevent the French from bidding on the new project. Fifty thousand residents have signed a petition voicing their objection to SCNF, which was involved in transporting thousands of Jews to German death camps, including Auschwitz, above, during World War Two . And last August Senator Chuck Schumer introducing a measure that opened SNCF up to compensation suits in US courts. SNCF has continually argued that it is immune to legal action over the Holocaust thanks to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act. Mr Schumer said: ‘Survivors and family members of those who perished have long attempted to hold SNCF accountable for its active role during the Holocaust, but so far the company has succeeded in cloaking itself in foreign sovereign immunity, evading jurisdiction in United States courts.’ Mr Schumer added: ‘The Holocaust Rail Justice Act would finally enable survivors and family members to hold this French rail company accountable in a court of law for sending thousands to their death during World War II, and allow survivors and family members an opportunity for justice.’ More than 70,000 French Jews were transported to Nazi death camps during the wartime Occupation, together with other groups considered enemies of the Third Reich. Many were rounded up by French policemen and then placed on to SNCF trains at stations such as the Paris suburb of Drancy.","France's state-owned railway could be banned from bidding for a £4 billion contract to build a new service in Maryland, USA .

"By . Sam Webb . A young Scottish entrepreuner has developed a modular home that can be assembled in just three weeks for as little as £59,000. The Wee Housing Company was set up by 22 year-old Jennifer Hope, a University of Strathclyde graduate, with help from her father Ian, who has been working in the construction industry for over 25 years. The homes are constructed as modular timber units at their manufacturing base in Ayrshire and then transported to the customer’s plot of land for completion. The houses can be one bedroom or two. Scroll down for video . Adorable: The prefabricated modular homes sell for as little as £59,000 . The homes are constructed as modular timber units at their manufacturing base in Ayrshire and then transported to the customer¿s plot . The homes take five weeks to construct and three weeks to build, Pictured, a crane lowers one of the modules into place . The company claims 'Wee House' is ideal as a second building on a property for an elderly relative, holiday home or for downsizing, and can be transported to any corner of the UK. Parents with grown-up children underfoot will be glad to know they can also act as an affordable first home. The original inspiration for a Wee House came from staff accommodation cottages on rural estates. Ms Hope, who lives in a Wee House herself, said: 'The Wee House Company can handle the entire process from applying for planning permission, to the construction of the house, to installation of services, providing the customer with a self build experience for those who do not have the time to actually self build.

The business recently completed their first two bedroom Wee House in Argyll and Bute in Scotland, and is currently building a one bedroom ‘grandpa annex’ in Beith, North Ayrshire and a larger two bedroom ‘Wee House’ on the Isle of Lismore. The Lismore house will feature stained glass windows designed by an artist who lives on the Isle. A typical one bedroom and two bedroom design is around 40m sq and 68m sq respectively. They are currently working on a 30m sq design to fit with the Scottish government’s new planning policy on ‘hutting.’ Recent legislation will make it easier for people to build ‘huts’ in the Scottish countryside for holidaying and leisure activities. Pre-fab houses were first introduced to the UK in the wake of the Second World War for returning soldiers who had their houses demolished by German bombing during the Blitz. Constructed in large numbers in factories, they were then moved to pre-plumbed concrete slabs where they could be put up in less than a day. For more than 150,000 homeless, bombed-out families in Britain, these two-bedroom prefabs were designed as a temporary solution - though some still exist as permanent residences today. While the original homes were little more than wooden huts, today's designs are far more complex, featuring large amounts of glass, steel and even brickwork.

In the podcast, Mr Davidson, 60, tells fellow comedian Richard Digance: 'There was cartoon racism in them days. It was the type of stuff you'd do in front of a load of black people.' He goes on to say: 'I thought that the West Indian accent - especially Chalky White - was a vehicle to help us all really. 'I don't want to sound like a vicar and I'm certainly not apologising, but it was picking on one stupid, black West Indian accent and always making this guy loveable and the winner.'

He continued: ‘I had to make a difficult choice. I crawled from the pub to my ex wife’s bed and said ""if you don’t help me now I am going to die"". She took me to somewhere, and I met up with a guy…it was me a guy and a few other people and a bible. ‘Even though I still drink a lot, I drink in a different way now.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Northumbria Police have carried out raids at 13 properties and 12 men and two women have been arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to rape . Police have arrested 12 men and two women as part of an investigation into allegations of sexual abuse of teenage girls and young adults in north-east England. Officers carried out raids in Newcastle as Northumbria Police reacted to information they had received about a series of sexual assaults against a number of victims. As part of Operation Sanctuary, 13 properties were searched this morning and 12 men and two women were arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to rape. The police said some of the victims were in care when the alleged offending took place and that their priority now was to protect them while forensic teams secure important evidence. The alleged offenders are said to be from 'a range of communities' and police have urged against speculating about their background. Temporary Assistant Chief Constable Gary Calvert said: 'This is a sensitive investigation which is at a very early stage and moving rapidly. 'I understand that these types of allegations can cause the public concern and I want to reassure the community that police take crimes of this nature extremely seriously and will thoroughly investigate them. 'Our overarching priority is to protect any victims or potential victims and to bring any offenders to justice. 'I must emphasise that the suspects do not come from one community, but a range of communities, and it would be very wrong to speculate until we have the full facts which may take some time. 'The victims include teenage girls as well as young adults. 'We are working closely with our partners, in particular the local authorities, and are grateful for their co-operation. 'I would stress there is nothing to suggest there is any risk to the general public as we believe the victims and suspects were known to each other.' He said officers known to their communities would be on patrol and asked anyone with information to come forward. Northumbria Police have carried out raids at 13 properties and 12 men and two women have been arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to rape . The police said the investigation, which was launched a few weeks ago, was sparked after they received information from an alleged victim. But they indicated that they did not yet know the full scale of the offending and how wide it might reach. Newcastle City Council leader Nick Forbes said he was shocked and appalled at the nature of the allegations and urged people not to panic. He said as soon as they became aware that some of the alleged victims were in the care system, they acted to ensure their safety. He said: 'I'm sure I speak on behalf of the entire city when I say how shocked and appalled I am by the alleged nature of these offences. 'It's vital that communities pull together through this difficult time and co-operate with the police in what I know is going to be a very extensive investigation over the next few weeks. 'As soon as we were aware that some of the victims had been in the care system, we acted to ensure they were safe. 'It's absolutely essential that, once the full investigation has been conducted, we look at all the safeguarding procedures and whether anything could be reviewed or improved for the future. 'It's important not to panic, it's important to remember that the victims and the alleged offenders knew each other, so there are not any teenage girls or women who are at risk as a result.'

"By . Lizzie Parry . Experts in the United States have warned an assault on a Californian power station in April could have been the 'dress rehearsal to a larger terrorist attack'. On April 16, last year, as many as two gunmen stormed the PG&E Metcalf substation in California after severing phone lines and firing several dozen rounds at transformers. At . least one person, maybe two, went down multiple manholes at the . facility in a San Jose suburb and cut fiber cables leading to the . substation. Attacked: The FBI is investigating an April attack on PG&E's Metcalf substation. Experts have warned the assault could have been a 'dress rehearsal for a larger attack' This knocked out 911 and landline service to the power station, as well as mobile phone service to the surrounding area. PG&E employees had no means to call for help when, at 1am, gunmen began their attack. More . than 100 rounds were fired from high-powered rifles at many . transformers – 10 were damaged in one area and three transformer banks . in another, a PG&E spokesperson said at the time. Cooling . oil leaking from at least one transformer bank caused transformers to . overheat and shut down. This led officials to warn locals to conserve . energy, but no major power outages occurred. Former chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Jon Wellinghoff, has today called the attack 'the most significant incident of domestic terrorism involving the grid that has ever occurred'. He told the Wall Street Journal he has become 'increasingly concerned' that a larger attack could be being planned, adding he had decided to go public out of concern that national security is at risk. No major damage: Transformers were shot at over 100 times, but no serious damage was sustained, nor was anyone injured . Cables cut: At least one suspect cut communications cables along this highway and another before shooting up the substation . Energy officials in America have been concerned for some time that the country's electric grid could be vulnerable to sabotage. The grid is made up of three systems serving different areas of the country. In the past small glitches, including trees hitting transmission lines, has wrought havoc on the system, resulting in widespread blackouts. In 2003 50 million people in eastern states and parts of Canada were left without power for days after a similar minor incident. Concerns also focus on the fact many of the most important parts of the network are out in the open, often in remote locations, protected by little more than cameras and high fences. Transmission power stations, like Metcalf, are vital to the grid, making it possible for electricity to move the vast distances needed to serve the entire country. The 64-year-old, who stepped down from his role last November, said he was involved in a series of high-level private briefings with federal agencies, Congress and the White House in the aftermath of the attack. Federal . officials took over the investigation from local law enforcement after . fears were raised that the attack was linked to the Boston marathon bombing a day earlier. But an FBI spokesman in San Francisco told the WSJ they do not believe last April's attack is the work of a terrorist group, adding that investigators are still examining the evidence. However some of Mr Wellinghoff's colleagues in the utility industry share his concerns. A former official at PG&E - who own the Metcalf power station - told an industry gathering in November that he fear the attack was a 'dress rehearsal' for a larger, more catastrophic incident. Retired vice president of transmission for PG&E, Mark Johnson, said: 'This wasn't an incident where Billy-Bob and Joe decided, after a few brewskis, to come in and shoot up a substation. 'This was an event that was well thought out, well planned and they targeted certain components.' When reached by the WSJ, Mr Johnson said he could not expand on his comments at the conference. PG&E spokesman Brian Swanson said the company take all incidents seriously but would not comment further for fear of giving valuable information to copycat groups. He said: 'We won't speculate about the motives (of the attack).' But he added the group have increased security measures in the wake of the incident. Lit up: The Santa Clara Sheriff's Office released this surveillance footage of the attack which shows the gunshots going off on the grounds of the PG&E facility . Sparks flew: No one was injured and the power didn't actually go out in the area because the state grid was able to maintain it but officials fear that it was a test run . In 2009 a report by the Energy Department said that 'physical damage' to certain parts of the grid, namely transformers, could render the system debilitated, resulting in prolonged blackouts. Mr. Wellinghoff said research by the FERC found that it would only take a small number of substations to be knocked out at once to destablise the grid to such an extent that a blackout would engulf most of the whole country. But Gerry Cauley, chief executive of the North America Electric Reliability Corp, a standards-setting group that reports to the FERC, disagreed. He said he believes the grid is more resilient. 'I don't want to downplay the scenario he describes,' Mr. Cauley said. 'I'll agree it's possible from a technical assessment.' But he said that even if several substations went down, the vast majority of people would have their power back in a few hours. A spokesman for Homeland Security said it is the responsibility of utilities companies to protect the grid. The department's role in an emergency is to connect federal agencies and local police and facilitate information sharing, the spokesman said.","As many as two gunmen stormed the PG&E Metcalf substation in California on April 16 last year .

"By . Ryan Gorman . Accused tormenter: Letina Smith is accused of using a stun gun to punish children under her care as young as seven-years-old . A Florida caregiver faces child abuse charges after the relatives she looked after ratted on her use of a taser-like gun for discipline to school officials. Letina  Smith, 41, of Kissimmee, made the three children aged seven, eight and nine-years-old sit against the wall as they would in a chair with their arms out, but minus the chair – if they moved they would be zapped, she called it the ‘electric chair,’ officials said. The abuse was uncovered after one of the children was in trouble in school and became terrified when school administrators said a call home was necessary, WOFL reported. Cops told WOFL the woman made the young kids sit in that position for one hour, if they moved she’d zap them. ‘(She) explained that the punishment was to get touched with a 'taser,’ said an affidavit cited by the Orlando Sentinel. ‘The electric chair consists of the child who is in trouble holding themselves… with their back on the wall and their legs forming a chair,’ it continued. ‘They have to stay there for an hour and if they speak or move Letina will come up to them with the electrical weapon, ‘taser,’ and activate and touch them with it.’ The report saidd the children lived with Ms Smith instead of their mother, the Sentinel noted, but did not give an explanation as to why. Officials told reporters the pink, rectangle-shaped device emitted an electric charge from two points, but was not as strong as a taser. Investigators did not find any marks on the children. Ms Smith admitted to having the weapon and holding it menacingly close to the children, but insisted she never actually shocked them, sources told WFTV. When asked by police how he was disciplined, one of the children said he was put in the ‘electric chair’ as recently as Wednesday. In court: Ms Smith appeared in court Saturday on an unrelated parole violation - stemming from a previous plea deal after she passed bad checks . ‘It hurt very much and he was very afraid of it,’ the boy is quoted in the affidavit as saying. ‘(He) advised that the electrical weapon was pink and made a loud clicking noise …and he can see the electricity touch the two points at the end.’ Another of the children said the woman shocked her after he fell asleep in her car, according to the affidavit. She was booked on child abuse charges and jailed in violation of a previous parole order stemming from a previous fraud case. Her bail has been set at $3,000.","Letina Smith, 41, cares for the children in place of their mother .

"By . Lydia Warren . A heartbroken man jumped to his death from a bridge just hours after his long-term partner passed away at their Atlanta home, relatives have revealed. Mark Rhea Castleberry, 55, left a note in his car telling authorities where to find the body of 66-year-old Gregory Woodlief, who died following a long illness. Woodlief's body was later found at their home in Chamblee. The couple had worn matching rings and, before leaving, Castleberry had removed his and placed it on Woodlief's body. Castleberry, who previously worked for the Miss Atlanta Scholarship Pageant, committed suicide by plunging from the northbound 1-285 overpass to ground below during Monday's morning commute. Loss: Mark Castleberry (right), who had long been involved with the Miss Atlanta Scholarship Pageant, took his own life on Monday after his partner of 30 years, Greg Woodlief (left) passed away from an illness . 'My brother pretty much lost his mind and . leapt,' his sister Ginger Castlberry Holt told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. 'He didn't want to be in a world that Greg wasn't.' Castleberry, who had been with Woodlief for 30 years, had left a note in his car notifying authorities how to contact his sister. The note also gave Woodlief's name and their address. The DeKalb Medical Examiner is still determining the cause of Woodlief's death, but a police spokeswoman said it was not being investigated as a homicide. Authorities said they are awaiting the results of toxicology results before determining an official cause of death.

Castleberry worked for the Miss Atlanta Scholarship Pageant as the volunteer executive director from 2000 to 2013, but he resigned after he was arrested on theft charges. He admitted to stealing more than $12,000 from two professional acquaintances by writing checks in his name, the AJC reported. He emailed the colleagues about what he had done, explaining that he had been in a dire financial situation and promising to re-pay them, but police were contacted. Chamblee Police Captain Ernesto Ford said Castleberry had no previous criminal record and had found himself 'in a bind'. He said he did not know if the financial struggles were caused by Castleberry's partner's illness. Russell Kirby, the co-director of the Miss Atlanta Pageant, said the men withdrew following the arrest. 'They were both very proud,' he said. 'I would imagine he was embarrassed by the whole thing.' The DeKalb District Attorney's office spokesman said the criminal case had yet to be presented to a grand jury. The case will be dismissed after prosecutors are formally notified of the death.

Murray began the defence of his Wimbledon crown by beating world number 105 David Goffin in straight sets on Monday to progress to the second round at the All England Club. The Scot made light work of the 23-year-old Belgian, winning the match on Centre Court 6-1, 6-4, 7-5 in little more than two hours. But, speaking after saving Bode from oncoming traffic, Murray said: 'The dog was pretty strong. 'I don't think it really wanted me to grab it by the collar. The owner was happy I'd picked it up.' And owner Mary-Elizebeth was delighted with Murray's actions, labelling him a 'hero'. She said: 'He is our hero. I'm absolutely a fan. 'What Andy did was lovely. It was absolutely amazing.' Murray will face 23-year-old Slovenian Blaz Rola in the next round. Roar of delight: Murray celebrates victory over Goffin just 24 hours after saving the labradoodle .

"By . Associated Press . and James Rush . A fourth person has been charged in connection with the death of an Australian baseball player who was shot while out jogging last year. Oddesse Barnes, 22, of Duncan, Oklahoma, has been charged with accessory after murder in the death of Christopher Lane, of Melbourne, according to the Stephens County District Attorney's Office. Lane, 22, was preparing for his senior baseball . season at East Central University when he was shot along a tree-lined . road in Duncan while visiting his girlfriend's parents in August. Scroll down for video . Oddesse Barnes (left), 22, of Duncan, Oklahoma, has been charged with accessory after murder in the death of Christopher Lane (right), of Melbourne . Investigators say he was randomly targeted by 'bored' teenagers. Two teens - Chancey Luna, 16, and Michael Dewayne Jones, 18 - are charged with first-degree murder and are set to go on trial. Investigators allege that Luna fired the fatal shot from the back seat of a car Jones was driving. Another teenager who was with the pair also is facing charges. Barnes, who is accused of helping later hide the weapon, was arraigned Monday. He pleaded not guilty, and his bail was set at $150,000, according to the Stephens County Court Clerk's office. A lawyer was not yet entered for Barnes, and a public phone listing for him could not be found. Online court records were not available yesterday, and the court clerk's office said it could not provide the charging documents. But television station KWTV reports that court documents accuse Barnes of aiding Luna and Jones by hiding the weapon they allegedly used in the shooting. Michael Jones (centre) and Chancey Luna (right) face first degree murder charges for the shooting of Christopher Lane. James Edwards (left) is facing a charge of accessory after the fact . Another teenager, James Francis Edwards Jr., has been charged with accessory after the fact. Prosecutors have said they will drop a first-degree murder charge against Edwards, who is 16, if he continues to testify against Luna and Jones. Edwards has said he was rolling marijuana cigarettes in the front passenger seat of a car when Luna fired the fatal shot from the back while Jones drove. Edwards testified that Luna and Jones both said they believed the gun used in the killing held blanks, not a live round. Duncan Police Chief Dan Ford has said that the older boy told investigators that the three were 'bored' and decided to kill someone for the 'fun of it.' 'They saw Christopher go by, and one of them said: ""There's our target,""' Ford said a few days after the shooting. 'The boy who has talked to us said, ""We were bored and didn't have anything to do, so we decided to kill somebody.""' An order now prevents lawyers and others from discussing the case outside of court. Lane had been attending college on a baseball scholarship.","Oddesse Barnes, 22, of Oklahoma, charged with accessory after murder .

"EXCLUSIVE By . Rebecca English . The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have secretly set up firms to protect their ‘brand’ and intellectual property rights. In a move more often associated with celebrities such as David and Victoria Beckham, they have told lawyers to establish companies in each of their names. It will enable William and Kate to sell officially-endorsed products and take action against anyone selling items that could harm their image. Icons: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, one of the most marketable couples in the world, have secretly set up firms protecting their image. Kate's is called CE Strathearn while William's is APL Anglesey . Fame: The Royals feature in some of the most iconic images of the last few years, many on their wedding day . Kate’s firm is called CE Strathearn – from her names Catherine and Elizabeth and the Countess of Strathearn title awarded by the Queen. William’s is APL Anglesey – after his middle names Arthur Philip Louis and the Welsh island where he and Kate lived after they married. Prince Harry has taken the step too, calling his company Tsessebe – the name of an African antelope. Kensington Palace stressed last night the firms would not be ‘regular trading arms’ and were likely to remain dormant for the foreseeable future. But aides admitted they could not rule out them being used for commercial purposes at some stage, with the profits going to charity. They also confirmed the companies could be used for ‘protection’ when it came to the issue of trademarks or the couple’s brand. Protection: The couple's solicitors Harbottle and Lewis say they can stop clients' brands being exploited . Rarity: Kensington Palace said the firms would only be used on special occasions and raise money for charity . William and Kate’s solicitors, Harbottle and Lewis, have a team of experts in the field of image rights, including the couple’s legal adviser, Gerard Tyrell. He has also acted for David and Victoria Beckham, the diver Tom Daley and supermodel Kate Moss. On its website, the law firm boasts: ‘If your brand has value, image rights will form an essential part of your earning potential. ‘We can advise you on how to make the most out of your personal brand, securing intellectual property rights for names, artwork and logos as well as arranging endorsements and sponsorships.’ It helps advise on the ‘exploitation of your image/brand on traditional advertising platforms and various forms of new media’. In an interview published some years ago, Mr Tyrell gave his views of how image rights may be ruthlessly enforced in sport: ‘If you can control the copyright on a significant amount of stuff – images and the like – the idea is that you strangle everyone else at birth and make sure than anyone who wants a bit of the player comes to you.’ The Cambridges are among the most marketable couples in the world and the use of their name to official endorse a product would be worth millions. Inspiration: Prince Harry has named his brand protection firm Tsessebe after the African Topi antelope (right) John Noble, of the British Brands Group, a trade body that represents brand owners in the UK, said last night: ‘Forming companies to register and hold your intellectual property rights can be both defensive but also create huge opportunities for raising significant sums in the future for charity. ‘It will also benefit consumers in knowing that they are getting the genuine article.’ According to Paul Walsh, of law firm Bristows, intellectual property concerns the protection of creative ideas, image rights and reputation. Creating their own companies will allow William and Kate to bring out, should they ever chose to, myriad items of officially-endorsed merchandise from tea towels to coffee cups. Mr Walsh said: ‘It also means that if something is produced that they feel is very detrimental to their image that they could take action against the maker if they wished.’ It is unlikely, however, to put a stop to royal ‘tat’ – flags, ornaments and the like – traders hawk for royal births or marriages. ‘When products are clearly memorabilia – tea towels, mugs, ornaments and the like – there is little that can be done to prevent this and the Royal Family have never tried to prevent this sort of patriotic thing in the past,’ said Mr Walsh. ‘Nobody will think the product is official or endorsed by the Royal Family. It is clear that the relevant royals are not endorsing the product nor, unlike other celebrities, are they in the endorsement business.’ Image: One expert working for the couple's solicitors has advised Kate Moss, whose brand is worth millions . Stars: Gerard Tyrell, an expert in the field of image rights, also acts for the Olympic diver Tom Daley (left) and David and Victoria Beckham (right) and has said protecting a brand can 'strangle everyone else at birth' The memorial fund set up in the memory of William’s mother caused a scandal when it authorised the use of Diana’s signature on tubs of margarine. Trustees also went to court to stop the manufacture of Diana dolls, a battle they lost at a cost of almost £15million. The three royal firms were set up in October 2012, around the time the Cambridges found out they were expecting their first child. Royals including the Queen and Prince Charles already have their own official ranges of merchandise. The profits from the prince’s range, Highgrove, go to charity while Buckingham Palace’s funds the Royal Collection, art and antiques held in trust on behalf of the nation. Charles offers an eclectic mix of goods ranging from a £70 antler walking stick, to a £2,750 cow willow sculpture and an £18 garden bird mug. The Royal Collection shop offers a £90 crystal drop tiara, a £12.95 God Save The Queen tea cosy and even an £8.95 palace corkscrew. There were registered at Companies House under the holding name of Tyrolese with their registered address as Clarence House, Prince Charles’s official London residence. But according to sources, the names were changed in May to ‘mean something to them’. The directors of Kate’s company are her private secretary, Rebecca Deacon, and a member of Clarence House staff, Polly McGivern, who is also a director for William and Harry. William has appointed his private secretary, Miguel Head, as a director of APL Anglesey while Harry has chosen his principal private secretary Jamie Lowther-Pinkerton. Kensington Palace officials said they were doing the ‘sensible thing’ in protecting the couple’s rights. They insisted CE Strathearn and APL Anglesey will be used on special occasions only and any money raised would go to charity. ‘It is not intended to alter the normal modus operandi of the Duke and Duchess’s operation. Raising funds by working closely with charities etc will continue as normal,’ said a source. ‘But setting up these companies is a sensible precaution and is a pre-emptive move – not a change of working. ‘They are not a trading arm – more about creating a vehicle that could be used in future for specific situations. It is not necessarily about making money – it could be about protection such as the issue of trademarks for example.’ Both William and Kate approved the setting up of the companies, they said. A spokesman added: ‘APL Anglesey and CE Strathearn have been set up to house the intellectual property rights of the Duke and Duchess. They were formed a year ago, but remain dormant. They are not intended to be used as a regular trading arm.’","New firms protect image rights, though Palace insists they are 'dormant'

"By . Simon Tomlinson . A mother has baffled doctors by beating one of the most malignant brain cancers known to man before going on to have a healthy baby girl for good measure. Heather Knies was given just six months to live when she was diagnosed with not one, but two tumours by the age of 26 - the second one described as 'uniformly fatal'. But now, six years later, doctors are at pains to explain how there is not a single trace of the disease left on her brain. 'God had a plan for me': Heather Knies pictured with husband Joe and daughter Zoe, whom she was able to have after beating one of the most malignant brain tumours known . Mrs Knies continued to break the 'biological rules' by giving birth to daughter Zoe, now aged seven months, last year despite undergoing intense radiation that often leaves women infertile. Mrs Knies, now 32, said God 'had a plan' for her and never once thought she would succumb to the disease. She told ABC News: 'The mind is so much more powerful than anyone can imagine. I never once thought it would be the death of me.' Mrs Knies was working as a doctor's receptionist in 2005 when she was diagnosed with her first cancer after she noticed visual problems driving home one day. Amazing: On a patient profile posted online (left), Mrs Knies credits medical marijuana in aiding her radiotherapy treatment which has led to a miraculous recovery that has stumped doctors (right, file picture) Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and most aggressive malignant brain tumours. Unlike other cancers, which are more likely to strike as patients get older, GBM is just as prevalent in young patients and kills more people under 40 than any other cancer. Common symptoms include seizure, nausea, vomiting and headaches, although the most prevalent is a progressive memory, personality, or neurological deterioration becuase of its location near the temporal and frontal lobes. The average sufferer will only survive for 14 months after diagnosis and 2,500 die from their tumours annually. Glioblastoma is extremely difficult to treat for a number of reasons because the tumour cells  are very resistant to conventional therapies. Senator Edward Kennedy, above, died from the disease in August 2009. An MRI scan revealed a low-grade tumour pressing on her visual reception cord and she underwent successful surgery and chemotherapy. But less than a year later, doctors discovered a stage 4 glioblastoma - a far more aggressive tumour which killed Senator Edward Kennedy in 2009. Mrs Knies opted to have the growth partially removed as any cutting any more out left her at risk of being paralysed. This was followed by more intense radiotherapy before being given the all-clear. Dr Robert Spetzler, director of the Barrow Neurological Institute at Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center in Phoenix who operated on Mrs Knies, said he had never seen such a recovery from a stage 4 glioblastoma like it in his 35 years as a neurosurgeon. He told ABC News: 'It's one of the most malignant tumors there is and it's uniformly fatal. 'I would not feel comfortable calling it a cure, but there is no evidence of a tumor. Her survival is remarkable.' During her treatment, she met and married Joe Knies, a 54-year-old engineer. They both desperately wanted children and fortunately the radiation had left some of her eggs in tact, one of which was used in a surrogate mother to give birth to Zoe. 'There have been so many miracles,' said Mrs Knies. 'One after another, as my dad said, so many angels must be sitting on my shoulders.'","Heather Knies was diagnosed with not one, but two tumours by age of 26 .

"By . Travelmail Reporter . Two chimpanzees at a British zoo celebrated their birthday by tearing into presents and gorging on a giant cake. The chimpanzees, based at Whipsnade Zoo in London, tucked into a giant cardboard cake containing their favourite treats such as bananas and grapes. The hairy pair, named Phil and Grant after the Mitchell brothers from Eastenders, were also given colourfully wrapped presents by zookeepers. Scroll down for video . Are these really all for us? The chimps tear open some of the gifts given to them by their doting keepers . Ooh bananas, my favourite! The other chimp tears into its brightly packaged present excitedly . The gifts contained nuts, seeds and sultanas which the chimps, who were born in 1996, happily ate while monkeying around in their enclosure. Zookeeper Graeme Williamson said, 'Both Phil and Grant love investigating new things, so the party was an excellent way to encourage their natural inquisitive behaviours and celebrate their 18th birthday.' The other chimpanzees at the zoo - Nikki, Bonnie, Koko and Elvis - were also invited to the primates' birthday bash, and the whole troop was visibly grinning as they ripped into the cake and presents. 'Everyone at Whipsnade has a soft spot for the mischievous duo. They are often seen chasing one another around like rowdy teenagers,' said Williamson. 'Grant is known as a bit of a greedy chimp. He loves being the centre of attention and trying to get his hands on more of his favourite treats, especially bananas, grapes and monkey nuts. 'Phil is the smaller and shyer of the two. He can often be seen swinging from ropes in the Zoo’s ""chimpnasium"".' Now where to begin? The chimpanzee stares wonderingly at the giant cake surrounded by presents given to him by his keepers . Yay, grapes! One of the chimps scoops his favourite fruit from the giant cardboard 'cake' Check this out! Phil and Grant invite their friends to share in the spoils . I think I'll take... THIS one: One of the chimps makes off with a particularly shiny-looking present, and a second one just to make sure . Phil and Grant were named after Albert Square’s most notorious duo by Eastenders actress Pam St Clements when she visited the zoo in 1996.The two apes are not actually brothers, but both were born on the same day. The life expectancy of a chimpanzee is approximately 45 to 50 years of age, so they will have plenty of other opportunities to unwrap presents. And they seem to like it so much, chimps at Whipsnade zoo have previously been given gifts on Valentine’s Day and at Christmas.","Two chimps celebrated their 18th birthday at the zoo yesterday .

"By . Liz Hull . Victim of thugs: Grandmother of five Gillian Dudley-Smith . A retired teacher collapsed and died of a stroke after teenage thugs set fire to her car in the middle of the night, an inquest heard. Gillian Dudley-Smith, 78, a talented botanical artist, dialled 999 after a passing taxi driver alerted her to the Ford Fiesta ablaze on her driveway. As she stood helplessly watching the car go up in flames from her window, the grandmother of five suffered a massive stroke. She died a few hours later in hospital. An inquest was told two boys aged 14 and 15 were arrested in connection with the arson attack outside the £250,000 North Wales home that Mrs Dudley-Smith shared with her husband of 50 years, Eric. But they were later released without charge and no-one has ever been brought to justice for the crime. Coroner John Gittins said the stress of the blaze led to Mrs Dudley-Smith’s stroke. ‘Whoever set fire to the car on that night has played a part in her death,’ he said. The inquest heard there had been a spate of cars being set on fire in the Caia Park area of Wrexham  where the couple lived. Mr Dudley-Smith, 81, usually parked his wife’s car in the garage overnight. But he had recently had back surgery and decided to leave it in the driveway on the evening of November 13 last year. Shortly before 4am Mrs Dudley-Smith, a regular churchgoer, was woken by a taxi driver who knocked on the front door to say the car was ablaze. She dialled 999 and stood watching the fire from their window. Mr Dudley-Smith said: ‘She sat down on the chair and suddenly, without warning, seemed to subside and slipped down the chair onto the floor.’ He told the court that a few days earlier his wife, who suffered from high blood pressure, had been upset after their garage and car were broken into. Police officer Michelle Robertson, who attended the scene, said the mother of two was showing symptoms of a stroke. Mrs Dudley-Smith was taken to Wrexham Maelor hospital, where she died a few hours later. A post-mortem examination confirmed the stroke caused her death. Two youths seen running from the scene were arrested but told police they were in bed at the time. ‘Following an extensive investigation a decision was made that there was insufficient evidence to prosecute,’ said Mr Gittins, coroner for North East Wales. Returning a narrative verdict, he added: ‘It is probable that the stress of the event led to the development of this condition and hence to her death. This is a very tragic case.’ Mrs Dudley-Smith was an acclaimed botanical artist at Ness Botanic Gardens in Wirral, and had exhibited her work across the country. Her husband described her as a ‘truly wonderful wife and mother’. Last night neighbours condemned the behaviour of the yobs who set fire to her car. Louise Ban, 49, who runs her own cleaning firm, said: ‘This was a horrible incident and an indictment of our society today.’","Gillian Dudley-Smith died after Ford Fiesta was set ablaze on her driveway .

"By . Francesca Chambers . Barack Obama's campaign wanted Hillary Clinton to make a sexist attack on Sarah Palin during the 2008 presidential election, she revealed today. Clinton revealed in an interview with NBC that, 'The day [Palin] was nominated, the Obama campaign did contact me and asked me if I would attack her.' 'I said, ""Attack her for what — for being a woman? Attack her for being on a ticket that's trying to draw attention? There'll be plenty of time to do what I think you should do in politics, which is draw distinctions,"" ' Clinton recalled. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, center, greets fans at a Barnes & Noble Bookseller store in New York City during the first stop on her Hard Choices book tour . Clinton also described the run-in over Palin in her just released memoir Hard Choices. The 2008 presidential candidate writes in the book that, 'The Obama campaign suspected that her nomination was a blatant attempt to scuttle their hope of welcoming the women who had vigorously supported me. They immediately issued a dismissive statement and reached out to me in hopes I would follow suit.' 'But I wouldn't. I was not going to attack Palin just for being a woman appealing for support from other women. I didn't think it made political sense, and it didn't feel right. So I said no...'' Sarah Palin posted a picture of the passage on her twitter account last night, with the caption, 'Look who fired the 1st shot in the real ""war on women"". Hint: it wasn't the GOP. See this excerpt from Hillary's book.' In an interview with ABC News' Diane Sawyer that aired last night, Clinton confessed that she was didn't do a very good job during the 2008 presidential campaign of pointing out that 'there is a double standard' for women in the public eye. 'And I think part of what I did not do was to be more clear in saying, ""Look, this is a problem in our country. And people oughtta think about . their own daughters, their own sisters, their own mothers when they make . comments about women in public life, whether they're in politics or the . media or anywhere else,"" ' Clinton said. Hillary Rodham Clinton arriving at her Hard Choices book singing at Barnes & Noble in Union Square in New York City this morning . The afternoon before Clinton's book officially hit the shelves, Sarah Palin, who had somehow gotten a copy early, sent a tweet ridiculing the Obama administration for claiming it's her political party who has a 'war or women' Clinton is making the rounds on the major news networks this week to promote Hard Choices, which was released today. The book provides a glimpse into the last six years of at her life and the problems she and her colleagues were confronted with while she was serving as secretary of state. Her full interview with NBC will air tonight during the network's Nightly News program at 7pm EST. NBC News' Cynthia McFadden said on the Today show this morning that the former secretary of state told her during their sit-down interview that she allowed the White House to review her book before it went to print because it included accounts from the time she served in the president's cabinet. Clinton reportedly told McFadden that Obama's team did not ask her to take anything out. Based . on early reviews of the book, there wasn't much for the White House to . complain about outside of Clinton's unflattering charge of sexism within . the president's 2008 presidential campaign. Hard Choices is 'a newsless snore' that was 'written so . carefully not to offend that it will fuel the notion that politics . infuses every part of her life,' Politico's  Mike Allen charged in his morning newsletter on Monday. One of the only other hard-hitting events that Clinton discusses in the book is the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, and she spends the bulk of that chapter defending herself and critics of U.S. ambassador to the U.N. Susan Rice. Otherwise, the book is a laudatory pamphlet supporting the Obama administration's foreign policy decisions, regardless of whether Clinton agreed with them at the time or not, reviewers are saying. 'Clinton’s account is the low-salt, . low-fat, low-calorie offering with vanilla pudding as the dessert,' Slate's John Dickerson said.","Barack Obama's presidential campaign wanted Hillary Clinton to attack Sarah Palin during the 2008 presidential campaign 'for being a woman', but Clinton said she wouldn't do it .

"By . Anthony Bond . They are the horrific pictures which prove that a mysterious spate of dolphin deaths along the northern Gulf Coast of America have nothing to do with natural causes. This bottlenose dolphin was found dead along the coastline of Mississippi after being shot. When investigators examined the mammal, they found a bullet inside its body. It is one of a number of dolphins which have washed ashore along the northern Gulf Coast over the past few months. Scroll down for video . Horrific: Over the past several months, dolphins have washed ashore along the northern Gulf Coast with bullet wounds, missing jaws and hacked off fins. This is a bottlenose dolphin which was found dead in the water  - a bullet wound can be seen bottom left . Cruel: Federal officials say they are looking into the mysterious deaths. This is a close-up of the bullet wound on the bottlenose dolphin, left. This bullet, right, was found inside the dolphin . Some have had bullet wounds while others have had missing jaws and hacked off fins. The most recent case was of a dolphin found dead off the coast of Mississippi, its lower jaw missing. The situation is so serious that federal officials are now looking into the mysterious deaths. Officials from the National Oceanic . and Atmospheric Administration are asking everyone from beachgoers to . fishermen to wildlife agents to be on the lookout for injured or dead . dolphins - and any unusual interaction between the mammals and people. 'It's very sad to think that anyone could do that to any animal,' said Erin Fougeres, a marine mammal scientist for NOAA's southeast office in St. Petersburg, Florida. 'There have been some obviously intentional cases.' Fougeres said five dolphins have been found shot. In Louisiana, two were shot in 2011 and one in 2012. And in Mississippi, three were found shot this year, the most recent one last week, which was first reported by the Sun-Herald newspaper. Slain: A horrific photo of a dead bottlenose dolphin taken in late September in Louisiana shows it after shot on Elmer's Island . Investigation: The California-based Animal Legal Defense Fund said it is offering a $5,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of whomever harmed the dolphins . Besides the shootings, a dolphin in . Alabama was found with a screwdriver stuck in its head over the summer. Another in Alabama had its tail cut off, and that animal survived. Still . others were missing fins or had cuts to their bodies. 'I think it is outrageous,' said Moby Solangi, the executive director of Institute for Marine Mammal Studies in Gulfport, Mississippi. 'These animals are very docile, very friendly and they're very curious. 'They come close to the boats, so if you're out there, you'll see them riding the bows. And their curiosity and friendship brings them so close that they become targets and that's the unfortunate thing.' Dolphins are among the species protected by the 1972 Marine Mammal Protection Act. Violators can be fined up to $10,000 per violation and sent to prison for a year. The California-based Animal Legal Defense Fund said it is offering a $5,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of whomever harmed the dolphins. Increasing: The Institute for Marine Mammal Studies, seen during an unrelated dolphin rescue, says that the barbaric attacks have increased lately while having first seen early this year . The gruesome discoveries are heartbreaking for Gulf Coast scientists, who follow the population. Fougeres said that two months before the 2010 oil spill disaster off the coast of Louisiana, dolphins began stranding themselves and that there were unusually high mortality rates - possibly due to a cold winter that year. Since then, the spill and another cold winter in 2011 have contributed to several deaths within the Gulf's dolphin population, experts say. Investigators have also found discolored teeth and lung infections within some of the dead dolphins. Since February 2010, experts have tallied more than 700 recorded dolphin deaths. Experts have also found increased 'human interaction' cases, which include dolphins tangled in fishing lines - and the more violent incidents. Fougeres cautions that some of the dolphin mutilations might have happened after the animal died from natural causes and washed ashore. She said that in the case of the dolphin with the lower jaw missing, someone could have cut off the jaw for a souvenir after the animal died. 'We have to do a necropsy on the animal and collect tissue samples to try to determine whether or not the injury was pre-or post-mortem' she said. Attacks: Bodies of dolphins found with gunshot wounds, slashes, missing jaws and in one case a stabbing by a screw driver has launched an investigation along the Gulf of Mexico (file photo) She also said that the increase in cases might be due to NOAA's dolphin stranding network becoming better trained to notice cruelty cases or unusual deaths. Some have suggested that the deaths are the work of a few angry fishermen who are upset about bait-stealing dolphins. Yet the majority of fishermen say that while dolphins can be annoying, they wouldn't harm the creatures. 'I don't know who to suspect ... I was really sickened when I read about it,' said Tom Becker, of T&D Charters out of Biloxi, Mississippi., and head of the Mississippi Charter Boat Captains Association, said he's never had a problem with dolphins. The mammals tend to swim behind his boat until a fish too small to keep is tossed over the side. 'You'll see him under your boat,' Becker said, about the dolphin. 'He'll get it before it can reach the bottom. I usually leave the area if they're doing that.' Fougeres said she doesn't think the dolphins are being targeted by a gang of people or even by a lone, sick individual. 'The cases are fairly spread apart,' she said. 'I don't think there is one dolphin murderer out there.'","Other dolphins which have washed ashore along northern Gulf Coast .

"By . James Titcomb . 'Lifeline': Kate McCann outside Downing Street yesterday . Kate McCann has hailed the launch of a European hotline for reporting missing and abducted children as a 'lifeline' for families like hers. Speaking at Downing Street yesterday, she said that cases such as the disappearance of her daughter Madeleine had led to 'greater awareness' of the problem and said there had been a shift in attitudes among politicians. 'We just need to keep spreading the message. Its a big problem, and we do need the Government's backing,' said Mrs McCann at the launch of the hotline at Number 10. 'In the last few years there's been greater awareness and certainly there's been a greater political will,' she said. It is hoped the free and confidential 116000 hotline, which is available in 16 European countries including France, Spain and Portugal, will help police forces to act quickly when children disappear. A child is reported missing in the UK every three minutes. Madeleine McCann went missing in the Portuguese resort of Praia da Luz on May 3 2007, just days before her fourth birthday. British detectives said last month that there was a chance she could still be alive, more than five years after she disappeared in the holiday spot in the Algarve. Reviewing the case, they said they were pursuing 195 leads and firmly believed Madeleine was abducted. Portuguese police, however, have refused to re-open the case. A Swiss father was questioned by police earlier this month after it emerged he was seen with a blonde girl in his car just hours after Madeleine disappeared, but insisted he was driving his own daughter. The hotline is run by missingkids.co.uk, Britain's official website to help find missing children, which was also relaunched ahead of International Missing Children's Day on Friday. Madeleine McCann as she looked aged three (left), and how Scotland Yard envision her now at the age of nine . Home Secretary Theresa May hosted the reception in Number 10 for campaign groups, celebrity supporters and families of missing children. Also attending was Nicki Durbin, whose 19-year-old son Luke went missing after a night out with friends in Ipswich, Suffolk, in May 2006. She said: 'There's been a huge change in the last year, and more people are aware about all of our missing ones.'

Two London cabs sporting advertisements for the newly-relaunched website were parked outside the front door of Number 10. Martin Houghton-Brown, chief executive of Missing People, added: 'Disappearances such as Madeleine McCann's tragically demonstrated the need for co-ordination across the world when a child goes missing. '116000 is introduced so that people can call when someone disappears regardless of which EU country they are in.' Equalities Minister Lynne Featherstone said vulnerable missing children need the best support possible. 'Government has set a clear direction for this with our missing children and adults strategy, calling on local and national organisations to prevent, protect and provide support for missing children and their families,' she said.","116000 number launches in 16 countries to report missing children .

"By . James Slack . An Islamist fanatic will be freed from anti-terror controls within days despite being ‘determined’ to carry out a Mumbai-style attack in Britain. The extremist attended a terror training camp in Cumbria with four of the five attempted suicide bombers involved in the London attacks of July 21, 2005. He repeatedly tried to buy guns in what was suspected as a plot to carry out a mass-casualty attack in the UK, and has also travelled to Syria for ‘training’. The plotter, known only as ‘CD’, was put under a Terrorism Prevention Investigation Measure (T-PIM) – including a tag and strict curfew – to protect the public in January 2012. Security services believe the unnamed Islamic fanatic will revive his plans to carry out an attack in the UK similar to the one in the Chatrapathi Sivaji railway station in Mumbai in 2012 . The Security Service say that without the T-PIM there is ‘a real risk CD will seek to revive his plans to undertake attacks in the UK’. He has a number of associates in London ‘in connection with the attempted purchase of firearms’ and officials say that he would be able to quickly buy weapons. But the order will be lifted on Sunday under rules introduced to protect the ‘human rights’ of terror suspects. This is despite a judge ruling that the man has been trained in terrorism and that his ‘views and determination are unchanged’. CD is one of six fanatics who are due to be released from their T-PIMS by the end of this month. They also include a would-be suicide bomber involved in the liquid bomb plot to murder thousands by blowing up seven transatlantic planes. Experts estimate the total bill for MI5 and the police to keep tabs on the six suspects once their T-PIM restrictions are lifted could reach £20million a year. The cases will be raised in the Commons today by Labour’s shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper. She has attacked her Tory counterpart, Theresa May, for axing Labour’s control order regime and replacing it with the weaker T-PIMS. Miss Cooper said: ‘Her decision to weaken terror controls means suspects described by the courts as highly dangerous only a year ago will now face no restrictions.’ Home Office officials insist that, to comply with Labour’s Human Rights Act, there was no option but to weaken the rules. Under the old control order regime, there was no fixed time limit on how long a suspect could be monitored. But the orders were repeatedly challenged in the courts under the Human Rights Act, with terror suspects claiming their right to liberty, a fair trial and a family life had been infringed. These cases led to the introduction of T-PIMS, which have a two-year time limit. Believing that a terror suspect remains determined to carry out an attack in the UK is not sufficient for an order to be renewed after two years. There must be new evidence. Labour, which has obtained new court papers relating to the threat posed by CD and his fellow fanatics, said the T-PIMS regime had left ministers with their hands tied. The court papers on CD, who is guaranteed lifelong anonymity to protect his rights, show he was identified by the Security Service as a leading figure in a network of Islamist extremists based in London. In 2004, he attended meetings organised by the jailed fanatic Mohammed Hamid and has attended at least one of Hamid’s terrorist training camps in Cumbria. In 2006, he had extremist training in Syria before returning to London in 2009, where he was ‘involved in planning a terrorist attack on the UK, probably involving firearms’. When his T-PIM was renewed a year ago, the judge said: ‘There remains a network. His views and determination are unchanged.’ In November 2008, Islamic terrorists killed 164 people in 12 co-ordinated shooting and bombing attacks across Mumbai, India’s biggest city. Last night, Security Minister James Brokenshire said: ‘The police and Security Service have been working for some time to put tailored plans in place to manage the risk posed by these individuals once their T-PIM restrictions are removed.’","Unnamed plotter was put under a Terrorism Prevention Investigation Measure which includes a tag and strict curfew for the public's protection .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Trying to stop women having easier access to the morning-after is ‘medieval’, sexist and patronising, Nick Clegg has claimed. New guidance from the watchdog National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) suggests young women - including under-16s - should be allowed to stock up on emergency contraception. Opponents claim the move will encourage women to be more promiscuous, but Mr Clegg said he was appalled and ‘really very angry’ about the outdated attitude towards women. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, pictured icing cakes today, condemned opponents of a plan to allow women to stockpile the morning after pill . The changes mean women will be able to obtain the morning-after pill for free from GPs and family planning clinics to keep it at home or in their handbags. Norman Wells, of the Family Education Trust, claimed it risked ‘encouraging them to take a more casual attitude to sex and exposing them to increased risk of sexually transmitted infections and emotional harm’. But Mr Clegg hit back at the critics, insisting women should be given the freedom to choose what they do, and the priority was to prevent unwanted pregnancies. Speaking on his weekly radio phone-in, the Deputy Prime Minister told LBC 97.3: ‘I am absolutely appalled and really very angry on behalf of many, many women across the country about the suggestion that giving a woman the right to buy a morning-after pill will somehow automatically lead to more promiscuous behaviour. Worry: Plans to let teenagers stock up on the morning-after pill will encourage reckless sexual behaviour, experts have warned . ‘I think it is demeaning, I think it is patronising, I think it is sexist.’ Women do not take the morning-after pill lightly or casually, Mr Clegg said. ‘To say to a woman she can't have the right, in case she has unprotected sex, to have a morning-after pill available because we - the Government, society or whichever newspaper columnist is pontificating about this - think she will suddenly become terribly promiscuous, I think is an absolute insult to women across the country. ‘I believe the experts, who have quite clearly said that providing the morning-after pill and other forms of contraception - the evidence is very clear - doesn't lead to more promiscuous behaviour. It does help prevent unwanted pregnancies.’ He said the row lifted the lid on a really fundamental difference in attitudes towards women. ‘Women shouldn't be told: “We are not going to give you the freedom to buy something from a chemist because we don't trust how you will behave sexually”. ‘It's a Victorian - worse than that, medieval - approach to women.’ His comments may put him at odds with Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who is reported to have opposed the plans. Mr Clegg said he had not discussed his views on the issue with Mr Hunt, and insisted doctors should urge girls aged 16 or under who are seeking contraception to talk to their parents about it. Mr Clegg tried his hand at icing a cake with Emma Pickup in Betty's Team Room, Harrogate, during a regional tour were he attended the launch of the Tour de France festival . But he added: ‘At the end of the day, when you are faced with the reality of a teenager who is in trouble, you as a medical expert want to help them, and I think for us to decree that they can or can't help someone isn't going to alter the fact that that 16-year-old is in trouble. ‘I don't want to see teenagers - or anybody, it at all possible - suffering an unwanted pregnancy. I don't want to see the very high rates we have had in the past of unwanted pregnancies. ‘The way to deal with that is to make sure we go with the evidence that if you provide people with education and information and make contraception available on a responsible basis, that is the way we stop unwanted pregnancies, not by resorting to really out-dated attitudes towards women.’","New NHS guidelines call for teens to have easier access to contraception .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Associated Press . San Diego Padres' Alex Torres has became the first baseball player to wear a new cap designed to protect pitchers from line drives to the head. Major League Baseball approved the bulky hat in January, nearly a year-and-a-half after pitcher Brandon McCarthy suffered life-threatening brain injuries when he was struck. He has recovered. Torres said he copped some flak from team mates when he debuted the oversized cap while pitching against the Dodgers on Saturday, but insisted it was worth it. 'It could save our lives, if someone hits a ball to your head,' the 26-year-old Venezuelan told MLB.com. 'I get it for free, so I'm just gonna use it to see how it feels.' Pioneer: San Diego Padres reliever Alex Torres has became the first baseball player to wear a new cap designed to protect pitchers from line drives to the head . Adjustment: Alex Torres wore the new protective cap on Saturday when his team played the Dodgers (left). It is much bigger and thicker than the standard baseball cap he normally wears (right) The pitcher ordered the cap about a month ago and wore it while playing catch over the past week. 'The difference between how this hat and the regular hat feels isn't much,' Torres said. 'I tried it before using it in the game, playing catch. It doesn't feel really bad. It doesn't feel like how it looks on my head.' The heavier and bigger hat, introduced this year following a spate of terrifying and bloody head injuries in the last few years, was tested by volunteers. Major leaguers and minor leaguers won't . be required to wear it - comfort is likely to be a primary concern. 'Obviously, it'd be a change,' two-time Cy Young winner Clayton Kershaw of the Los Angeles Dodgers told the MLB Network. 'I'm definitely not opposed to it. I think it'd take a lot of getting used to. You don't look very cool, I'll be honest.' Designer: The safety plates made by isoBLOX are sewn into baseball cap and custom fitted . The safety plates made by isoBLOX are sewn into the hat and custom fitted, protecting the temples and forehead. They weigh an extra six to seven ounces - a baseball weighs about five ounces - and offer protection to the forehead, temples and sides of the head. They'll make the hats about a half-inch thicker in the front and around an inch wider on the sides. Several pitchers have been hit in the head by line drives in recent seasons. Brandon McCarthy sustained a brain contusion and skull fracture after being struck in 2012 and Doug Fister was hit during the World Series that October. Toronto's J.A. Happ and Tampa Bay's Alex Cobb were sidelined after being hit last year. McCarthy tweeted that he had already tried out the fortified cap and that it was 'headed in right direction but not game ready.' Arizona reliever Brad Ziegler said: 'I think they're on the right track, but the hat they approved isn't remotely close to comfortable enough to wear in games.' Injured: Trainer Nick Paparesta checks out Oakland Athletics pitcher Brandon McCarthy after he was hit in the head by a line drive on September 5, 2012 in California . Injured: Colorado Rockies' Juan Nicasio was hit in the face by a ball while pitching against the Washington Nationals on August 5, 2011 in Denver, Colorado . In an email to The Associated Press, he said, 'If you're not 100 percent focused on executing your pitches, you have almost no chance of success. And that hat is uncomfortable enough that it would be a big distraction to wear it.' 'We talked to a lot of guys who had been through this, and they provided a wealth of information to help us,' said Bruce Foster, CEO of the 4Licensing Corporation, parent company of isoBLOX. 'We went through a myriad of different designs to develop this.' Foster said the cap went through extensive testing and provided protection from line drives up to 90 mph in the front of the head and 85 mph on the side. Line drives in the majors have been clocked at even faster rates. In December 2012, MLB medical director Dr. Gary Green presented ideas on protective headgear to executives, doctors and trainers. The prototypes under study included some made of Kevlar, the high-impact material often worn by military and law enforcement and NFL players. Several companies tried without success to make a product that would be approved by MLB and the players' union, with isoBLOX the first to get the OK.","San Diego Padres' Alex Torres is first player to wear the cap .

"By . Emily Crane . Scientists have discovered a number of fish-eating spiders that can consume prey twice their size and weight. A study by zoologists in Australia and Switzerland has found that while spiders typically prey on insects, some species will supplement their diet by catching small fish. The spiders, some of which are capable of swimming, diving and walking on the water surface, have powerful neurotoxins and enzymes that enable them to kill and digest fish that often exceed them in size. A study by zoologists in Australia and Switzerland has found that while spiders typically prey on insects, some species will supplement their diet by catching small fish . Martin Nyffeler from the University of Basel in Switzerland and Bradley Pusey from the University of Western Australia observed spiders from as many as five families predating on small fish in the wild across the world. They also examined three more spider species catching fish under laboratory conditions. These so called semi-aquatic spiders typically dwell at the fringes of shallow freshwater streams, ponds or swamps. 'The finding of such a large diversity of spiders engaging in fish predation is novel,' Mr Nyffeler said. 'Our evidence suggests that fish might be an occasional prey item of substantial nutritional importance.' The spiders, some of which are capable of swimming, diving and walking on the water surface, have powerful neurotoxins and enzymes that enable them to kill and digest fish that often exceed them in size . These so called semi-aquatic spiders typically dwell at the fringes of shallow freshwater streams, ponds or swamps . Based on the results of the study, published by the academic journal Plos One, naturally occurring fish predation by spiders occurs right across the world expect for Antarctica. Most incidents have been documented in North America, especially in the wetlands of Florida, where semi-aquatic spiders have often been witnessed catching and eating small freshwater fish such as mosquitofish. In order to catch its prey, the spider will typically anchor its hind legs to a stone or a plant, with its front legs resting on the surface of the water, ready to ambush. The fish will then be dragged to a dry place before the feeding process can begin which usually lasts several hours.

"By . Emma Innes . A ‘miracle’ baby who was born at just 24 weeks and spent the first year of his life in hospital is finally thriving. Doctors would not have attempted to save Aiden McLaughlin, who weighed less than 1lb 5oz when he was born, if his birth had come just days earlier. Aiden’s father, Sean, who lives with his wife Kelly and Aiden, now 18 months old, in Middlesbrough, said: ‘Everything had been going fine during Kelly’s pregnancy. Aiden McLaughlin was born at 24 weeks weighing just 1lb 5oz and his parents, Sean and Kelly, were warned he might not survive. They family are pictured with nurse Angela Reay (back) ‘On Friday 13, in July 2012, she started bleeding and lost a clot and we actually thought it was the baby.’ The panic-stricken couple called an ambulance which took them to Middlesbrough’s James Cook University Hospital. It wasn’t until they were at the hospital that they were told the baby was still safe. Mrs McLaughlin was given two lots of steroid injections to help develop Aiden’s lungs in case he made an early arrival. ‘It was a massive relief to find out that the baby was OK,’ said Mr McLaughlin. ‘We actually also found out that Kelly was 2cm dilated.’ Aiden was born on July 16, 2012, at just 24 weeks and three days as doctors could not halt Mrs McLaughlin’s labour. Aiden was born at just 24 weeks and three days at the James Cook University Hospital in Middlesbrough, as doctors could not halt his mother's labour . Mr McLaughlin said: ‘They said to us that the baby would be out in 24 hours. They also said that the baby might not make it through. ‘They had to give him oxygen to try and make him breathe. ‘Three minutes into doing it we heard a little cry. ‘It was just overwhelming as everything had been quiet up until that point. ‘It was like looking at Tom Thumb. It was just a little miracle that he was there.’ Aiden was rushed for neonatal intensive care and spent 15 weeks there before being discharged. After a year in hospital, Aiden has finally been allowed to go home and he is now learning to walk and talk . However, he was back within days due because he developed a chest infection. Investigations also found he had a hole in his heart which meant he required an operation at Newcastle’s Freeman Hospital in December before he could return to James Cook. ‘Our life was in the hospital with our baby just trying to get him home,’ said Mr McLaughlin, who along with his wife cares for Aiden full time. In February, while still in the hospital, Aiden was struck with bronchiolitis – a lower respiratory tract infection that usually affects babies and very young children. ‘We were actually told to prepare ourselves for the worst,’ said Mr McLaughlin. ‘They did say to us that we might have to make a choice to leave the machine on or turn it off. ‘But we thought “it’s a life and we’re in it for the long term”.’ Thankfully, Aiden responded well to treatment and by March he was starting to be prepared for his release from hospital which finally took place on July 3, 2013. Mrs McLaughlin said: ‘To look at him you wouldn’t know the problems he has had. You would think he was a “normal” 18-month-old. ‘He’s crawling and he can hold himself up on his feet. ‘He’ll say “mum” and “dad”. We are just so proud of him.’","Aiden McLaughlin's mother suddenly went into premature labour at 24 weeks .

"A prehistoric cave in southern France containing the world's earliest known art has been awarded World Heritage status. The Grotte Chauvet in the Ardeche region, which survived sealed off for millennia before its discovery in 1994, contains more than 1,000 drawings dating back some 36,000 years to what is believed to be the first human culture in Europe. Delegates at UNESCO's World Heritage Committee voted to grant the status to the cave at a gathering in Doha. A prehistoric cave in southern France containing the world's earliest known art has been awarded World Heritage status . The cave in the Ardeche region, which survived sealed off for millennia before its discovery in 1994, contains more than 1,000 drawings dating back some 36,000 . The drawings - including equine syle-etchings - hark back to what is believed to be the first human culture in Europe. A French lawmaker for the Ardeche, Pascal Terrasse, described the cave as 'a first cultural act'. 'This artist has now been recognised,' Terrasse said. 'May he forgive us for waiting 36,000 years.' French Culture Minister Aurelie Filippetti called the cave 'a major site for humanity' that provides an exceptional opportunity for study. It is 'a jewel whose emotional power is as strong today as when it was conceived,' she said in a statement. UNESCO said the Grotte Chauvet 'contains the earliest and best-preserved expressions of artistic creation of the Aurignacian people, which are also the earliest known figurative drawings in the world'.

'Its state of preservation and authenticity is exceptional as a result of its concealment over 23 millennia,' UNESCO said. Researchers believe the cave was never permanently inhabited by humans 'but was instead of a sacred character' and 'used for shamanist ritual practice' The painted images include representations of human hands and of dozens of animals, including mammoth, wild cats, rhinos, bison, bears and aurochs . Access has since been severely restricted and fewer than 200 researchers a year are allowed to visit the cave, which stretches into several branches along about 800 metres and at its highest reaches 18 metres. The painted images include representations of human hands and of dozens of animals, including mammoth, wild cats, rhinos, bison, bears and aurochs. The paintings are more than twice as old as those in the famed Lascaux caves also in southern France and more discoveries are expected to be found in remote parts of the cave as yet unexplored. The cave also includes remnants and prints of ancient animals, including those of large cave bears that are believed to have hibernated at the site. Researchers believe the cave was never permanently inhabited by humans 'but was instead of a sacred character' and 'used for shamanist ritual practice'. Gilles Tosello, a graphic artist and researcher, works on full-scale reproduction of frescos of the cave of Pont-D'Arc (also known as the Chauvet cave) His work will then be used in a replica of the original cave, which will open to the public at the end of 2014 . The Chauvet Cave, located in the Ardeche region of southern France, has the oldest-known cave paintings, with handprints and depictions of horses and other animals dated to around 30,000-32,000 years ago . Over 1,000 images have so far been inventoried on its walls, combining a variety of anthropomorphic and animal motifs . The cave was closed off by a rock fall approximately 20,000 years BP and remained sealed until its discovery in 1994, which helped keep it in pristine condition . With the cave itself closed to the public, authorities are building a full-scale replica of the site nearby, which is expected to open in the spring of 2015. The Paris-based United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization oversees the system of granting coveted World Heritage Site status to important cultural and natural sites. Obtaining the status for sites is a point of pride for many nations and can boost tourism, but it comes with strict conservation rules. UNESCO delegates are meeting for 10 days in Doha to consider the inscription of 40 sites on the World Heritage List and issue warnings over already-listed locations that may be in danger. Other sites given the status this year include a vast Inca road system spanning six countries and ancient terraces in the West Bank that are under threat from the Israeli separation barrier.","Grotte Chauvet in Ardeche region survived in pristine condition sealed off for millennia before its discovery in 1994 .

"By . Associated Press . and Daily Mail Reporter . Pennsylvania 11-year-old Sarah Murnaghan got a second chance at life last year when she received a new set of lungs from an adult organ donor, becoming the exception to a nationwide rule. Before Murnaghan, children under 12 were only allowed to receive donations from other children but on Monday the Organ Procurement and Transplantation network voted and changed the policy. Now all sick children may apply to receive adult organs, giving them a better shot at recovery. Pioneer: Lung-transplant recipient Sarah Murnaghan speaks during a news conference on Monday, June 23, 2014, at her home in Newtown Square, Pennsylvania. Murnaghan and her parents offered comments after a national transplant board voted to permanently allow children the opportunity to apply for adult organ donations . Guardians: Murnaghan's parents sparked a national debate last year when they protested to get their daughter onto an adult donor list, after she was given just weeks to live. Murnaghan is pictured above flanked by father Francis (left) and mother Janet (right) The little girl spoke about the crucial piece of legislation at a press conference outside of her family's Newtown Square home on Monday. She called the rule change 'great' before wading into the more kid-friendly topic of summer. 'We do school work with mom and dad and we go to the pool and we go to some parks,' she said. Just a kid: Murnaghan also talked about her summer, saying she was enjoying going to the pool and playing in the park . Murnaghan's case sparked national debate last year when doctors gave the cystic fibrosis patient  just weeks to live. At the time, the 11-year-old was only eligible to receive an organ from another child and child organ donations are rare. In a last ditch effort, her desperate parents launched a public campaign to get her on the adult list and a federal judge agreed - handing down a court order to halt the Under 12 rule. The ruling was a success since Sarah has just breathing on her own for the first time in three years. Murnaghan returned to the hospital on the first anniversary of the controversial transplant to have a tube in her neck, which had been used to connect a ventilator, taken out. New lease of life: A year after receiving the life-saving transplant, Murnaghan had a tube removed from her neck and she is able to breath on her own . In a statement, her family called the lawsuit 'the absolute last resort' after other appeals failed. 'We believed making lungs from donors 12 and older available to children under 12 who are good candidates to receive them was the right thing to do. We very much appreciate that the medical community (now) agrees with that,' the family, including parents Janet and Francis Murnaghan, said. The lung transplant issue only affects about 20 children a year, making it difficult to study outcomes, the network said. A dozen children have asked to be added to the adult list under a waiver this past year, but most are still matched with donor lungs from children, the transplant network said. Sarah with her mother and father who launched a campaign get her access to the adult donor waiting list. Eventually they secured a court order to ensure she was placed in line for adult lungs . Plight: Sarah had been a top candidate for organs from a child donor but such donations are rare . 'Any allocation policy must weigh the unique needs and circumstances of transplant candidates with the benefit a transplant can provide them,' said Dr. Stuart Sweet, secretary of the network, a private nonprofit group that manages U.S. organ allocation. 'This is a difficult balance for very young lung transplant candidates in particular,' Sweet said. 'The progression of their lung disease may be considerably different from other patients, even those just a few years older.' Lung transplants are not a cure for cystic fibrosis but can buy time. The typical life expectancy for cystic fibrosis patients is 37 years and continues to rise as new medical advances are developed. The case raised questions among some health specialists and medical ethicists about how organ donation rules are developed and under what circumstances they might be disregarded.","The 11-year-old started a nationwide debate last year when she was allowed on an adult organ donor list .

Remarkably, Mrs Cox was helped out of the wreckage and was quickly taken in an ambulance to hospital, where she gave birth to a healthy 6lb 1oz baby girl, Islia. The birth was already set to be complicated because the baby was breech - meaning she came out feet first - when contractions started in the early hours of the morning. However, nothing could have prepared the parents for their ordeal on the way to the maternity unit in Epsom, Surrey. Mr Cox said: 'As the car was rolling I honestly thought I had killed us. It was horrible. 'My wife was very calm and collected. She knew to brace herself and she was telling me to keep calm and not worry about it. 'When we came to a standstill I honestly thought it was a dream, because I have had that dream. So I was expecting to wake up. The car slipped on black ice as the couple rushed to the hospital in the early hours of the morning. They were forced to climb out of the windows with the help of a passer-by . Islia had to be delivered by C-section as she was in the breech position, meaning she was born feet first . 'But thankfully we came out unscathed, apart from a few scratches and aches and pains.' Astonishingly, Mrs Cox, an NHS rota administrator, was completely unfazed by the crash. She simply stood on the rear view mirror to climb out of the upturned Honda Jazz, conscious of trying to stay away from the shards of glass all around her. Mr Cox managed to flag down a Good Samaritan who stopped his car and called 999, before helping to get Mrs Cox out of the crashed car. He said: 'The ambulance arrived within about five minutes, took us to the hospital and my wife had our daughter about an hour and a half later.' Mr and Mrs Cox and were lucky to escape the car with just a few aches and pains . Speaking from the couple’s home in Betchworth, Surrey, Mr Cox, who works for a pension provider, said his daughter was 'absolutely perfect'. 'She’s currently sleeping and is a very happy, healthy baby,' he added. The couple, who already have one child - a two-year-old boy called Kegan - were excitedly awaiting the arrival of their first daughter when the drama unfolded on January 12. They already had their hospital bags packed and all the documents ready before Mrs Cox went into labour. Their carefully-made birth plan was put into action and the call was made to Mr Cox’s sister, Emma, so she could come over to their house and babysit Kegan. Mr Cox said: 'Everything was going like clockwork until the weather played its part. My wife went into labour at about 3am. Due to our baby being breech we knew she had to get to hospital for a C-section. 'We were due to have the C-section on the Tuesday but she went into labour two days early. 'We left home about 4.30am. I was driving and as we approached a corner in the road I just lost control of the car. 'It was just through Ashtead, on the Dorking Road, only about a mile from the hospital. The hospital was just on the other side of the hill we were about to climb. 'It wasn’t a sharp bend. Not at all. When I realised I wasn’t steering the car any longer I just tried to counteract the slide. 'There were a few expletives. I was only going between 20 and 30 miles per hour. I tried to correct myself but it wasn’t happening. 'Then I hit the kerb. We did one complete roll and ended up resting on the side.' Mr Cox said: 'As the car was rolling I honestly thought I had killed us. It was horrible. My wife was very calm and collected. She knew to brace herself and she was telling me to keep calm and not worry about it' After checking his wife was OK, Mr Cox managed to haul himself out of the battered car window before clambering back up to the road, while also trying to call for an ambulance and the police. 'I tried to flag down passers-by,' he said. 'A couple ignored me, which I can understand, stopping for someone at that time of the morning. 'Someone did stop. He kindly helped me phone the emergency services.' The couple have since been relating the remarkable tale to their shocked relatives. Mr Cox said: 'I told my mother about the birth and then I asked her not to panic and said: ""On the way to hospital we had a crash"". She got a bit hysterical.'","Tamarin and Aaron Cox were travelling to hospital in the early hours of the morning when their car slipped on black ice and Mr Cox lost control .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The wife of a seriously-wounded Army Ranger who shocked onlookers by saluting during his Purple Heart ceremony in hospital has revealed her baby bump. Josh Hargis, 24, and his wife Taylor, from Cincinnati, Ohio, have announced they are expecting their first baby in May - bringing joy for the couple after months of adversity. Hargis suffered leg injuries after a female suicide bomber detonated her explosives in Afghanistan in October, killing four of Hargis' comrades, and costing the soldier both of his legs. Hargis, who had been on his fourth tour . of Afghanistan, battled a neck brace, breathing apparatus and tubes to . complete the mark of respect when a senior officer presented him the . medal. Together: Josh Hargis, pictured, lost his legs in a blast in Afghanistan last year and famously saluted from his hospital bed as he was awarded the Purple Heart. His wife Taylor, pictured, is expecting their first child . Joy: Taylor Hargis poses by a sign counting down until the days the baby is born in May . The brave and magnanimous gesture brought tears to the eyes of the 50 grown men and soldiers who had gathered in the room to witness the ceremony. An image of the touching moment became an internet hit. It marked the start of the couple's uplifting journey - as Taylor stood beside her husband as he underwent grueling physical therapy and learned how to walk on prosthetic limbs. Taylor has caught each moment on camera, and most recently shared a photograph of her growing bump to her Facebook page, adding: 'He is a kicking fool!' And as the couple try to get back to normal, Taylor's brother is spear-heading a fundraising campaign to help them. 'Without question there is a lot . going on in their lives and this is only the beginning of a series of . adversities that they will have to overcome,' Patrick Griffith posted on a fundraising website. Emotional: Comrades did not even think Josh was conscious when he raised his arm to salute his senior officer during the ceremony in October. This image quickly spread through the media . He has organized the 'Warrior’s Walk', which is a 222-mile walk from Fort Stewart to Fort Benning, . Georgia that began on Monday. It aims to raise funds and support for the Hargis family. The group is completing 17 miles each day and Josh and Taylor Hargis will join . for the final four miles of the walk, relatives said. Family and friends now hope to raise funds for the couple and their imminent arrival, knowing they still have tough times ahead. 'Though we can't change what has happened, we can change their future,' Griffith wrote. Relatives added to ABCNews.com that Hargis has already received a hand-cycle and an all-terrain . wheelchair from generous donors. Hargis was stationed in Afghanistan as part of the 3rd Army . Ranger Battalion on October  when a suicide bomber detonated her vest. Support: Josh is pictured left before the explosion and right as he learns to use prosthetic limbs . Together: Relatives are now raising funds to help the couple with future medical costs and their child . When soldiers surrounded his hospital bed to . pin the Purple Heart to his blanket, they assumed he was unconscious, but Hargis made every effort to salute. The simple gesture left a lasting poignant memory for the senior officer, who wanted to share the story of Josh's honor and bravery with the world. A letter from his commander to Taylor explained the gravitas of the occasion. 'I cannot impart on you the level of emotion that poured through the intensive care unit that day,' he wrote in the letter, which she shared on Facebook. 'Grown men began to weep and we were speechless at a gesture that speak volumes about Josh's courage and character.' The commander added that he 'will remember it as the single greatest event I have witnessed in my ten years in the Army'.","Touching image of Josh Hargis, 24, as he battled bandages and breathing tubes to salute his senior officer last October went viral .

"By . Kerry Mcdermott . North Korea has warned the South that it faces ‘final destruction’ – during a UN conference on disarmament. The open threat came amid growing tensions on the peninsula following the North’s recent nuclear testing. Since last week’s test, which was carried out in defiance of UN resolutions, its southern neighbour warned it could strike if it felt an attack was imminent. 'No fear': North Korean officials watched soldiers at a rally organised to celebrate the state's successful nuclear test last week . In response, North Korean diplomat . Jon Yong Ryong told the UN meeting: ‘As the saying goes, a new-born . puppy knows no fear of a tiger. South Korea’s erratic behaviour would . only herald its final destruction.’ His comments drew quick  criticism . from other nations, including South Korea, France, Germany and Britain, . whose ambassador Joanne Adamson said such language was ‘completely . inappropriate’. ‘It cannot be allowed that we have expressions which refer to the possible destruction of UN member states,’ she said. Pyongyang has said the aim of the . nuclear test was to bolster its defences in the wake the hostility of . the US, which is pushing for sanctions on North Korea. But the North exercised ‘its maximum . self-restraint’, said Mr Jon, who added that hostility from the US would . leave his country ‘with no option but to take the second and third . stronger steps in succession’. He did not specify what that would . entail. North Korea has already told China it is prepared to stage one or two more tests this year to force the US into talks. Spanish ambassador Javier Gil Catalina said the comments had left him stupefied . and appeared to be a breach of international law. Warning: Soldiers in South Korea - which said in the wake of its northern neighbour's nuclear test that it could strike if it believed an attack was imminent - participate in a live fire drill . 'In . the 30 years of my career I've never heard anything like it and it . seems to me that we are not speaking about something that is even . admissible, we are speaking about a threat of the use of force that is . prohibited by Article 2.4 of the United Nations charter,' he said. Since . the North tested a nuclear bomb last week in defiance of U.N. resolutions, its southern neighbour has warned it could strike the . isolated state if it believed an attack was imminent. Pyongyang said the aim of the test was to bolster its defences given the hostility of the United States, which has led a push to impose sanctions on North Korea. 'South Korea's erratic behaviour would only herald its final destruction' North Korean diplomat Jon Yong Ryong . 'Our current nuclear test is the primary countermeasure taken by the DPRK (Democratic People's Republic of Korea) in which it exercised its maximum self-restraint,' said the North Korean diplomat Jon. 'If the U.S. takes a hostile approach toward the DPRK to the last, rendering the situation complicated, it (North Korea) will be left with no option but to take the second and third stronger steps in succession,' he said, without elaborating on what that might entail. North Korea has already told key ally China that it is prepared to stage one or two more tests this year to force the United States into diplomatic talks, a source with direct knowledge of the message said last week. U.S. Ambassador Laura Kennedy said she found North Korea's threat today profoundly disturbing and later tweeted that it was 'offensive'. Training: South Korean soldiers fire live rounds during a training exercise in Cheorwon, South Korea . Poland's representative suggested North Korea's participation in the U.N. forum should be limited. Impoverished and malnourished North Korea is one of the most heavily sanctioned states in the world. It is still technically at war with South Korea after a 1950-53 civil war ended in a mere truce. Washington and its allies are believed to be pushing to tighten the noose around North Korea's financial transactions in a bid to starve its leadership of funding. Jon said last week's test was an act of self-defence against nuclear blackmail by the United States, which wanted to block North Korea's economic development and its fundamental rights. Not happy: U.S. Ambassador Laura Kennedy said she found North Korea's threat today profoundly disturbing and later tweeted that it was 'offensive' 'It is the disposition and firm will of the army and people of the DPRK to counter high-handed policy with tough-fist policy and to react to pressure and sanctions with an all-out counter-action,' he said. Jon said the United States had conducted most of the nuclear tests and satellite launches in history, and he described its pursuit of U.N. Security Council resolutions against North Korea as 'a breach of international law and the height of double standards'. Neither Russia nor China, which are veto-wielding members of the U.N. Security Council, spoke at the meeting in Geneva today. Before its nuclear test, North Korea was already facing growing diplomatic pressure at the United Nations. The U.N. Human Rights Council is widely expected to order an inquiry next month into its leaders' responsibilities for crimes against humanity.","North Korean diplomat's inflammatory language stunned U.N member states .

"By . David Mccormack . and Associated  Press Reporter . America’s newest soccer hero is a German-born 21-year-old who wasn’t expected to take part in Monday's night but who claims he knew he was destined for glory after dreaming about it two nights before. John Brooks got the American soccer team’s World Cup off to a flying start after coming on as a second-half substitute and scoring an 86th minute winner from a corner. The goal means he is the first American sub to ever score in a World Cup match and afterwards he revealed that he’d had a premonition that his big moment was about to arrive. America's newest soccer hero, John Brooks, is a German-born 21-year-old who wasn't expected to take part in Monday's night but who claims he knew he was destined for glory after dreaming about it . Brooks was born in Berlin, his father was a American serviceman father from Chicago and his mom is German . ‘I told some teammates that I dreamed that I scored in the 80th minute and we won the game,’ he said afterwards. ‘And now it was the 86th minute and we won.’ One of the surprise picks by U.S. coach Jurgen Klinsmann, Brooks hadn't been in the starting lineup for the World Cup opener against Ghana. But after central defender Matt Besler felt tightness in his right hamstring during the final five minutes of the first half, Klinsmann sent the 21-year-old Brooks on for the start of the second half. Just four minutes after Andre Ayew's 82nd-minute goal wiped out a lead Clint Dempsey had given the U.S. just 29 seconds in, Brooks outjumped Ghana's John Boye to meet Graham Zusi's corner kick and bounced an 8-yard header past goalkeeper Adam Kwarasey. Brooks, who has both German and American citizenship, revealed after the match that he had had a dream about scoring a header from a corner late in the match . United States' John Brooks, second from left, scores his side's second goal during the group G World Cup soccer match between Ghana and the United States at the Arena das Dunas in Natal, Brazil, on Monday . It wasn't just a dream! United States' John Brooks is mobbed by his teammates after scoring their side's winning goal . Overcome with emotion, Brooks ran in disbelief, slumped to the ground arms first and felt teammates pile onto him. When they finally moved off, he put both hands to his lips and blew a kiss. Two nights earlier he had dreamed about scoring a header from a corner kick. 'It was unbelievable,' Brooks said. 'I couldn't believe it.' Brooks, was born in Berlin to a German mother and an American serviceman father from Chicago. The 6ft 4in central defender plays club soccer for his hometown club Hertha Berlin. Brooks has only visited the U.S. for training camps and vacation, but has a tattoos of Berlin and Illinois on his arms. Speaking one day in California last month, he said, ‘When I'm here, I'm a full American.

Joe Biden congratulates the American team after Monday night's victory over Ghana . He had nerves initially Monday, yet is thrilled with how things ended. ‘I think the first goal was perfect, a perfect start. Couldn't be better,’ Brooks said. Brooks' moment in the spotlight ensured that after the match his name was trending on Twitter and one over enthusiastic fan updated his Wikipedia entry to read: 'After scoring against Ghana... he is now among the ranks of John F. Kennedy, Chuck Norris and Abe Lincoln as American heroes.’ The comment has since been deleted. As the American Outlaws chanted their way out of the stadium, Brooks missed the chance to meet Vice President Joe Biden when he visited the locker room. Brooks and Jermaine Jones had been chosen for random drug tests. Among the five German-Americans on the 23-man roster, Brooks made his national team debut last August and had only four appearances entering the World Cup. Nearly two hours after the final whistle, Brooks was among the last U.S. players to leave the locker room.

"By . Ben Gladwell, Press Association . Think of Thomas Hassler and you are not that far away from the blueprint for Germany's latest creative talent. The pint-sized midfielder who inspired Germany to their last two major titles - the 1990 World Cup and Euro 96 - had proved a tough man for the German national side to replace following his retirement in 2000 - until, that is, Mario Gotze came exploding onto the scene. Most at home when operating in the space behind two strikers, Gotze has shot to prominence since coming through the Borussia Dortmund youth academy, emerging as an inspirational figure for the yellow and blacks and also for Germany's youth sides. Young gun: Germany have high hopes on midfielder Mario Gotze starring for them at this summer's World Cup . The next messiah? Thomas Hassler helped Germany win the 1990 World Cup and Euro 96 . Comparisons with the 101-times capped Hassler were always likely to happen as his star continued to rise - but some have gone further, with Gotze even being placed in the same bracket as the best player of his generation. 'He's the German Messi,' Germany's two-time World Cup winner Franz Beckenbauer once said. 'He has the same understanding and technique, and he's a footballer who acts purely on his instincts - just like Messi. 'It's impossible to stop Mario Gotze. You just cannot play any better than him. He just strolls through as if there are no opponents.' Dortmund were unable to stop Gotze either when Bayern Munich stumped up the full value of his release clause - 37 million euros, a then Bundesliga record - last summer. Gotze was lured back home to Bavaria where the prospect of working under Pep Guardiola was cited as one of his main motivations. Under the Catalan, he hoped to develop in a similar way Messi had at Barcelona, ensuring that not only Beckenbauer would be drawing those parallels in future. An injury picked up in the semi-final of last year's Champions League, which ruled him out of the final against Bayern, also saw him miss the start of the 2013/14 campaign. Prolific: Gotze scored 10 goals and created 10 assists in 20 Bundesliga starts for Bayern Munich this season . High praise: Franz Beckenbauer has compared Gotze to Barcelona and Argentina star Lionel Messi . Since returning in October, though, he quickly made up for lost time. In just 20 Bundesliga starts, Gotze netted 10 goals and laid on a further 10. He created almost a century of chances for his team-mates, becoming one of the exceptions to Guardiola's rotation policy. Bayern without Gotze is as unimaginable now as Germany without their most resourceful asset. His flexibility means he can also play as the 'false nine' frequently preferred by Joachim Low, a position similar to Messi's at Barcelona. The 2014 World Cup is a stage for him to draw yet more favourable comparisons with the four-time world player of the year, but in his head the motivation will not be to become the second Messi - but the first and only Gotze.","Mario Gotze is expected to play a key role in Germany's World Cup bid .

We have all wondered how we might spend an unexpected £1million - but few of us could match the panache of one new millionaire currently part-way through an exuberant round-the-world spending spree. Matt Myles, 27, from Hereford, was working gruelling night shifts in a factory when a Euromillions ticket bought on a whim netted him a surprise £1million windfall. And he wasted no time in putting his newfound wealth to good use - jetting off to Indonesia before the money had even hit his account. Living it up: Matt Myles, 27, won £1million earlier this year, and is currently enjoying a jaunt round the globe .

Since then Mr Myles has been living a life of non-stop hedonism, fuelled by raucous and expensive nights out, designer clothes and beautiful women. He has also taken the time to keep all his friends - and hundreds of online fans - updated over Twitter as he makes the most of his money. Mr Myles took off on his round-the-world tour in April, taking his brother Pete, 26, along for the ride and picking up his tab. So far his lavish lifestyle has taken him to Hong Kong, Bali and Thailand. He then set off for Brazil, where England's disappointing World Cup performance failed to dampen the experience.

Still on his hit list are visiting Machu Picchu in Peru, diving at Australia’s Great Barrier Reef, ­bungee jumping into the Grand Canyon in Arizona, driving across Route 66 in a Ford Mustang. He then hopes to canoe the Amazon, walking the Great Wall of China and seeing the pyramids in Egypt, enjoy a fortnight of partying with his friends in Ibiza and volunteer with Unicef in Africa for three months. Mr Myles, who used to serve in the Army, told the Sunday People: 'From travelling the world to meeting ­celebrities I couldn’t have made this up in my wildest dreams - They say money can’t buy happiness but I have never been happier.'

Party guy: Mr Myles has taken to his new life of wealth with gusto . Before the shock win, he said: 'I was working night shifts and was worried I’d have to move back home to save some money. While the next 12 months will be incredible, I won’t change. I’ll live as I always have – go big or go home!' However, despite the apparent gusto with which he is spending his winnings, Mr Myles says he has set himself a limit of £100,000. Upon winning, he invested half of the cash and is ploughing much of the remainder into establishing a property business with friends, and hopes to train as an airline pilot.
