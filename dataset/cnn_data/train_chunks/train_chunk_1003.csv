"Cooking is said to be as much an art as it is a science, with simple ingredients creating culinary beauty when mixed together. But these photographs reveal the impressive patterns that salt, sugar, coffee beans, tea and ice cream possess on their own when placed under the microscope. As well as being visually stunning, images such as these could one day help scientists create superfoods that taste better and last longer. Fat and peptide crystals pictured. Crystals form when fats are cooled from a high temperature to below melting point. Nestle has major plans when it comes to creating processed foods. The firm is already working on is developing a 'food replicator' that its bosses describe as 'the next microwave' Created by Nestle, the series explores the hidden face of the food we consume, and attempts to convey the science behind making better products. An image of the foam boosters, for instance, shows how packet-made cappuccinos are particles of carbohydrates and protein loaded with gas bubbles. When these particles meet hot water, they release gas, lifting the creamer to the surface to form an instant, milky layer of foam. These photographs reveal the impressive patterns in salt, sugar, coffee beans, tea and ice cream, as seen under the microscope. Pictured are particles of sucralose - a non-caloric sweetener - alongside particles of roast and ground coffee . Tortoiseshell? No, something a little more sweet: Scientists use ‘cryo-microscopy’ to understand the effect shifts in temperature can have on the quality and stability of frozen food. This is what rapidly frozen sugar solution looks like at -100°C . Cup of green: Pictured is a close up view of a green tea leaf. Tea is rich in anti-oxidants called polyphenols, which appear as the green areas here. The darker circles are stomata - the tiny openings, or pores, that help plants control exchange of gases . Putting bubbles in your coffee: Pictured are cappuccino ‘foam booster’ granules. These particles of carbohydrates and protein loaded with gas bubbles. When they meet hot water, they release the gas, lifting the creamer to the surface to form an instant, milky foam . Shown here is the cell structure of roast and ground coffee. As well as being visually stunning, images such as these could some day help scientists create ‘super foods’ that taste better and last longer . It took six weeks and several failed prototypes before chocolatier John Costello was able to craft the perfect teapot from chocolate. Revealed last week, the chocolate teapot had a large opening at the lid to let the initial waft of steam escape quickly, and a hand-hollowed spout. The manufacturing, by Nestle, took just over two and a half hours. And then it was time for tea. Filmed by a crew from BBC’s The One Show, presenter Marty Jopson poured freshly boiled water into the pot and added a couple of teabags. The good news: it didn’t immediately melt. As the tea brewed for the requisite two minutes. The final brew tasted like tea with a hint of chocolate. A frozen sugar solution seen close-up at -100°C shows a hypnotic pattern of particles, used to understand the effect shifts in temperature can have on the quality of foods. Another image of the inside of a green coffee bean reveals the importance of roasting. This process changes the internal structure of the bean and impacts its overall taste. Scientists often use images such as these to change something known as ‘extrusion’ or the processing technique that helps to give certain foods specific textures or shapes. By examining the structure of extruded food products, such as the breakfast cereal, they can find ways to improve their texture. And Nestle has major plans when it comes to creating processed foods. The firm is already working on is developing a 'food replicator' that its bosses describe as 'the next microwave'. It will deliver meals personalised for each user, with exactly the right balance of nutrients they need for a healthy diet. Codenamed 'Iron Man', the project will eventually lead to a kitchen machine that can create tailored supplements and food. 'Iron Man is an analysis of what’s missing in our diets, and a product, tailored to you, to help make up that difference,' NIHS director Ed Baetge told Bloomberg. 'In the past, food was just food. We’re going in a new direction.' Extrusion is a processing technique that helps to give certain foods specific textures or shapes. By examining the structure of extruded food products - like this breakfast cereal - we can find ways to improve their texture . Get your ice cream in the freezer! Crystals that form in ice cream (pictured) can create an unpleasant texture. Nestle uses microscopy to find out which ice cream recipes, processing techniques, and storage conditions make crystals more likely to form . Boulders? This image of freeze-dried coffee revealing its ‘micro gas’ cells and cavities. When the cavities come into contact with hot water, they create ‘crema’, a naturally formed foam of coffee and air . Miniature skyscrapers: Here salt crystals are seen growing on the surface of powder. The crystals appear when powders containing ‘dissociated’ salt - which has had its molecules broken down into smaller particles - are stored above a certain humidity .","Photographs reveal patterns in salt, sugar, coffee beans, tea and ice cream, as seen under the microscope .

"Twenty-three people have been injured during a haunted hayride after the trailer that was carrying them flipped over in a forest in Maine. The unnamed victims - three of whom suffered serious injures - were travelling on The Gauntlet Haunted Night Ride trailer at Pumpkin Land in Mechanic Falls when the vehicle overturned. Two people were airlifted to hospital, while the 21 others - including the driver - were taken by ambulance to Central Maine Medical Center and St Mary's Regional Medical Center. Crash: Twenty-three people have been injured during a haunted hayride after the trailer that was carrying them flipped over in a forest in Maine. Above, authorities are pictured at the scene in Mechanic  Falls last night . Attraction: During the  ride, which includes 'things that jump and scream in the night', the driver of a jeep pulling the trailer 'missed a right-hand turn'.

The accident occurred at around 8.30pm yesterday at the top of a hill at Harvest Hill Farms, situated on Route 26, around 30 miles north of Portland, according to the Portland Press Herald. During the ride, which includes 'things that jump and scream in the night', the driver of a jeep pulling the trailer missed a right-hand turn, said Androscoggin County Sheriff, Guy Desjardins. The vehicle then flipped over, injuring everyone on board and the driver. 'The trailer jackknifed and the jeep went off the road,' Mr Desjardins said, describing the woodland hill as 'very steep'. He added: 'I’ve never witnessed a single incident that resulted in so many injuries.'

"Yorkshire's prehistoric past - complete with swamps, a tropical rainforest and even sharks - has been revealed in enormous detail after scientists unearthed fossils in Doncaster. As well as the 310 million-year-old shark egg case, several horseshoe crabs and some previously unrecorded seed pods were discovered at the disused Yorkshire Main Colliery in Edlington. Some of the fossilised plants and creatures may even be entirely new to science, claim experts. The fossilised shark egg case (pictured left) was discovered on the site of the disused Yorkshire Main Colliery in Edlington, Doncaster. As well as the egg case, several previously unrecorded seed pods were unearthed, some of which may even be new to science, claim experts from the University of Manchester . The shark egg case is particularly rare and significant, because it is soft bodied and so an unusual object to find fossilised, explained researchers. Incredibly well-preserved baby shark fossils with strange, long snouts recently became the oldest evidence of an ancient shark nursery. The fossils, found at Mazon Creek, Illinois, at the site of an nuclear plant, were uncovered earlier this year, with egg cases from the same species dating to about 310 million years ago. The findings suggests that the prehistoric relative of modern day sharks lived in freshwater but migrated down rivers to give birth in salty seawater. All the finds were found preserved in rocks that formed within the coal and shale deposits of the abandoned mine. It is said to be one of only a small handful of similar fossil locations left in the UK. Palaeontologist Dean Lomax, a visiting scientist at the University of Manchester's School of Earth, Atmospheric and Environmental Sciences, said: 'The fossils unlock a window into a long distant past, buried deep beneath residents' feet. 'They are proof that parts of Yorkshire were once a tropical water-logged forest, teeming with life that may have looked something similar to today's Amazon delta - a mix of dense forest, lakes, swamps and lagoons. 'We hope that future organised collections may reveal further rare discoveries, such as dragonflies, beetles, spiders and further evidence of vertebrates. 'And who knows, maybe we will even find the actual shark.' A fossil of a horseshoe crab (pictured) was also discovered in Edlington. Experts said they hope future organised collections at the site may reveal further rare discoveries, such as dragonflies, beetles, spiders and further evidence of vertebrates . After visits to all the redundant pit tips in the region, by Mr Lomax, alongside Peter Robinson from Doncaster Heritage Services and local fossil collector Brian Williams, Edlington was identified as being the only tip in the borough where fossils could potentially still be collected. All other locations have been landscaped and turned into parks. Mr Robinson said: 'For all three of us this site, and the fossils we've discovered here, are very close to our hearts. The largest predator to walk - and swim - the Earth was a terrifying cross between Tyrannosaurus rex, a crocodile and a whale, researchers have revealed. The discovery was made from fossils dug up in the Moroccan Sahara, which show that the Spinosaurus was the first dinosaur to have adapted to an aquatic lifestyle. Weighing 20 tonnes and measuring almost 50ft (15m), the swimming dinosaur was 9ft (2.7m) longer than the largest T. rex specimen known. Spinosaurus' (artist's impression, pictured)  most distinctive feature was a row of spines down the middle of its back. Scientists think it was used for . display purposes rather than to trap heat or store fat . It had jaws filled with vicious slanted teeth and a snout like that of a massive crocodile, while its short muscular hind legs were equipped for paddling and resembled those seen in early limbed whales. The creature also had powerful forelimbs with curved, blade-like claws ideal for hooking into or slicing prey. While other dinosaurs, such as T. rex, hunted on land, Spinosaurus pursued sharks and other large fish in the deep river system it inhabited. Plesiosaurs, a family of giant marine reptiles, lived alongside Spinosaurus 97 million years ago, but were not dinosaurs. Lead researcher Dr Nizar Ibrahim, from the University of Chicago, said: 'Working on this animal was like studying an alien from outer space; it's unlike any other dinosaur I have ever seen.' After visits to redundant pit tips in the area, experts from the University of Manchester and Doncaster Heritage Services identified Edlington (pictured) as the only tip in the borough where fossils could potentially still be collected. All other locations have been landscaped and turned into parks . The fossils (including the plant fossils pictured) are being stored at Doncaster Museum where they have been integrated into the museum's fossil collection, with full findings of the research being published in the Geological Journal . 'We are all locally born and bred and take great pride in uncovering, interpreting and preserving a very important piece of the borough's geological past. 'We hope this important discovery will encourage ex-miners from the borough to bring forward and donate fossil specimens from the now defunct collieries, which were collected whilst extracting coal from the pit face. 'We have heard many stories of some of the wonderful fossils that have been found.' The fossils are being stored at Doncaster Museum where they have been integrated into the museum's fossil collection, with full findings of the research being published in the Geological Journal.","Fossils were uncovered on the site of the disused Yorkshire Main Colliery .

"British forces have been rehearsing surprise airborne assaults which could be used to rescue British hostages from their Islamic State captors. Troops were seen rappelling quickly from helicopters as others parachuted from planes five miles off the coast of RAF Valley in Anglesey, Wales. The training missions honed techniques which could be used by elite troops in a shock attack on Islamic State extremists. Scroll down for video . British troops were seen rappelling quickly from helicopters while others parachuted from planes . The practice manouevres took place five miles off the coast of RAF Valley in Anglesey, Wales . The training missions honed techniques which could be used by elite troops in a shock attack on ISIS . Manchester taxi-driver-turned-aid worker Alan Henning, 47, has been held by IS since last December and earlier this month, they threatened to kill him in the same video which showed the beheading of fellow Briton David Haines. Another British hostage, the journalist John Cantlie, has now been held by IS since November 2012, and last month appeared on a YouTube video. In the two-week long training exercise launched from RAF Valley – where Prince William served as a search and rescue pilot – various scenarios were rehearsed to prepare troops for whatever might lie ahead. In one, troops leapt out of RAF Lynx and Merlin helicopters, zipping down ropes in a mock offensive. They were also spotted in a daring manoeuvre launching fast boats from the back of a Chinook helicopter which was flown just inches above the water at breath-taking speed. Manchester taxi-driver-turned-aid worker Alan Henning, 47, has been held by ISIS since last December . British journalist John Cantlie has now been held by ISIS since November 2012 and last month appeared on a YouTube video released by the militants . Alan Henning appeared in a video showing the beheading of British aid worker David Haines by Jihadi John . Servicemen were also seen leaping from two RAF Hercules transport planes during the exercise, which saw various routines carried out late in the evening until around midnight. A hostage rescue mission in hostile territory would be one of the most hazardous missions imaginable. In 1979, a top-secret attempt by US special forces to free American hostages held in Tehran, Iran, ended in disaster with the death of eight soldiers when two of the aircraft involved – a helicopter and a Hercules – collided and were engulfed in flames. The British Government has ruled out deploying ground troops against IS militants as the RAF joined air strikes against the extremists in Iraq yesterday. But that hasn’t stopped military commanders ensuring UK troops are at maximum readiness to strike in a targeted assault. Security services have identified six plots involving jihadi fanatics who have returned from Syria to launch attacks in Europe. One involved a gun and bomb attack in London which was to be carried out on the orders of a terrorist mastermind in the Middle East. As reported in The Mail on Sunday earlier this year, counter-terrorism officers working with MI5 detained a man who had returned to London from Syria with substantial amounts of cash which he used to buy weapons and bomb-making equipment. The suspect joined up with another extremist, and security officials arrested them at gunpoint. David Cameron warned of the six thwarted plots during the parliamentary debate on whether to take military action in Iraq against ISIS . The other plots were uncovered in France, Italy and the Netherlands, but the men were not charged with terrorism offences, security sources said. David Cameron referred to the six plots during the parliamentary debate on whether to take military action in Iraq against Islamic State. He said: ‘This international operation is about protecting our people too, and protecting the streets of Britain should not be a task that we are prepared to entirely subcontract to other air forces of other countries. This is not a threat on the far side of the world.’ One plot was not disrupted. In May, Mehdi Nemmouche, 29, who had fought with IS in Syria, was arrested after three people were shot and killed in a Jewish museum in Brussels.","Troops seen quickly rappelling down ropes from helicopters at RAF base .

"Terrified onlookers described how they ducked behind walls and ran for cover as frenzied gunman Michael Zehaf-Bibeau seemed 'to hunt people down' at the Canadian National War Memorial . Construction worker Matthew Blais said he saw one man fall to the ground while others tried to escape the gunman, who  let off more shots than he could count. 'I seen a lot of people running and a I saw a guy go down I don't know how many he hit,' he told Maclean's news magazine. 'From what I seen he was trying to hunt people down and get them really quick.' Onlookers described chaos outside Parliament buildings as gunman Michael Zehaf-Bibeau started shooting . Police, bystanders and soldiers aid soldier Corporal Nathan Cirillo who was shot at the National War Memorial . Amid the chaos at the War Memorial in Ottawa yesterday, Muslim convert Zehaf-Bibeau shot and killed 24-year-old Corporal Nathan Cirillo as he stood guard. Raivo Nommik was near the monument when the gunman appeared with his face covered and he told the Ottawa Sun that he initially thought the gunfire was 'ceremonial shots'. He added: 'And then I saw the guy with the rifle and I saw the second soldier there running ... he ran over one of the walls here and I just ducked down behind the wall until the shots had stopped.' Witness described how the gunman then raced towards Parliament buildings, where he opened fire again, before being shot dead by the House of Commons Sergeant-at-Arms. Paramedics pull the injured soldier away after the gunman ran from the Memorial and made for Parliament . Onlookers described panic and confusion outside Parliament after a gunman started firing . 'He was over by the War Memorial and he fired off four shots and then he took off toward the Parliament Buildings, jumping over the hedge, jumping over the fence. I don't know where he went from there,' onlooker Chuck Bromley told the newspaper. 'We were scared like hell,' Jan Lugtenborg, a tourist from the Netherlands, added. Business journalist Peter Henderson told CNN that onlookers rushed to the fallen soldier, who had suffered 'catastrophic' injuries, and began to perform CPR. 'To the best of my knowledge, (he) looked like ... a young man,' Henderson said. 'It appeared as though he had been hit in the back several times.' The horrific events of yesterday when Michael Zehaf-Bibeau shot dead a soldier and opened fire in Parliament . Armed RCMP officers guard Parliament following the shooting of Corporal Nathan Cirillo at the War Memorial . Labor minister Ric McIver was outside Parliament when Zehaf-Bibeau approached. He told the Calgary Sun: 'Lo and behold, the brown Toyota Corolla with no licence plate, roared up the street and screeched to a halt, five, 10 meters from us. 'The gunman was coming right at me, right toward me. So I considered my options. Frankly, I was a little concerned about getting shot. 'I was close enough. I didn't know whether I had to attack to save myself or run. I didn't think I could get to him before he could pull the trigger. I made a decision not to confront him. I ran.' Police officers take cover near Parliament Hill as the gunman opens fire sending Parliament into lockdown . Gunshots rang out in Parliament just before 10am sending MPs and journalists scrambling for safety . Desperate to create a distance between himself and the gunman, Mr McIver dashed to a parking lot with vehicles that was about 30 or 40 metres away. He said: 'I was looking over my shoulder in case I had to hit the deck. I was thinking: If he cocks the gun toward me my best chance is to hit the deck. He never did cock the gun toward me. 'I found a car and ducked behind it. 'He didn't pay me any attention. I watched him and, with the rifle in his hand, he walked around the corner of the East Block toward the Parliament building.' A little before 10am, gunshots rang out in Parliament. Canadian Deputy House Leader Kevin Lamoureux described how he heard gunfire just after security instructed everyone to clear the building. MPs barricade themselves in a meeting room after hearing gunfire in Parliament Building yesterday . 'I heard rapid fire - gunshots going very loud - and I figure maybe 20-plus shots within 10 seconds,' he told CNN. MP Tony Clement Tweeted: 'Shots fired during caucus meeting. at least 30 shots. MPs piled out. I'm safe with 2 colleagues but we're still at risk...' An hour later he posted: 'Still patiently awaiting rescue here in Centre Block. I feared this day would come, and my prayers are with the fallen soldier.' Other Tweets reveal the fear and confusion experienced by MPs. Joyce Murray posted: 'What's happening on #Parliament Hill? Everyone told to go into offices and lock the door!' MPs and journalists Tweeted from inside the building expressing confusion, fear and sadness for the events of yesterday, as well as thanking the security guards who kept them safe after a gunman opened fire . She then wrote: 'More yelling, gunshot sounds in Centre Block #ParliamentHill. A lot!' Journalist Justin Ling described how he sat huddled behind a low wall in the Parliamentary cafeteria with two dozen other reporters staffers and cooks, after being told there was an 'active shooter' in the building. 'Frantic laughter occasionally broke the doldrums of terror,' he wrote in his first-person account in the Evening Standard. 'Suddenly, a series of bangs coming from the fire exit behind us spooked us into action. 'What sounded resoundingly like gunshots, but what we now assume was a battering ram, pushed us to scatter. We ducked behind the lunch counter as the two unarmed security guards, clad in blue shirts and heavy black bulletproof vests, grabbed kitchen knives.' A Royal Canadian Mounted Police intervention team responds to reports of gunfire in Parliament . Susan Truppe Tweeted: 'In lockdown from shooters. Safe right now from gunman. Very scary.' Globe and Mail reporter Josh Wingrove was in the parliament building when gunfire erupted in the hallways, sending journalists and politicians running for cover. In his first-hand account in the newspaper, the reporter wrote: 'Witnesses scrambled past me, fleeing toward the House of Commons side of the building as officers drew their weapons, looking down the Hall of Honour... It seemed no one knew where the suspect was.' The journalist was following police down the hallway towards the Library of Parliament when a second round of shooting broke out. Corporal Cirillo (left) is pictured guarding the National War Memorial just minutes before he was shot and killed . Corporal Nathan Cirillo was rushed to hospital after being shot but he died from his wounds shortly after . 'I ducked for cover to the left of the hallway,' he wrote. 'To be honest, it is a blur. I slid out to a pillar as the shooting continued – most or all of it from guards, aimed toward the library.' 'I heard maybe two dozen shots. Afterward, I turned off the video to tweet photos of what, to me, appeared to be a body. I presume, but don’t know, that was the shooter, whom I hadn’t seen until then.' With the building in lockdown, Mr Wingrove said the rest of the day was spent mainly waiting in a holding room. 'The people in this room are shaken, confused, exhausted,'  he wrote at the time. 'Mostly we are just bored and waiting.' It was later revealed that Prime Minister Stephen Harper was immediately evacuated from Parliament and taken to an undisclosed location. The lockdown in Parliament was stopped shortly after he addressed the country condemning the horrific act, which he labeled as a terrorist attack. Reflecting on the events yesterday, Mr Wingrove wrote in the Globe and Mail: 'It was chaotic, and heartbreaking. I can’t imagine Wednesdays here will ever be quite the same.'

If I had been moments later, I would have been in hit. 'It was a big shock. 'As I was walking across, I thought it was a jack rolling across the floor but, before I knew it, there was this massive bang. It was the last thing I expected. 'It did a bit of damage to the car but I was lucky I wasn't beside it.' Garage manager Mark Daniels, 45, was in the building at the time. He said: 'The gentleman was driving down the road in his Land Rover.

"McDonald's Corp reported a 30 . percent fall in quarterly profit, hurt by a food scandal in . China and intense competition in the United States. It also warned that global restaurant sales will fall again in October. Stock in the company, which attracted fewer customers during the third quarter, was off 0.6 percent at $91.05 in early trading. McDonald's Corp reported a 30 percent fall in quarterly profit, hurt by a food scandal in China and intense competition in the United States . McDonald's net income slid 30 percent to $1.07 billion, or $1.09 per share, for the quarter ended Sept. 30. Sales at restaurants open at least 13 months, a closely watched gauge of performance, fell a steeper-than-expected 3.3 percent in the United States, where resurgent fast-food rivals and more upscale brands like Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG.N) are taking a bite out of market share. Europe, which just edges out the United States as McDonald's top revenue market, is grappling with political and economic issues as McDonald's Asia works through the upheaval from a scandal involving a major supplier in China. Sales at restaurants open at least 13 months, a closely watched gauge of performance, fell a steeper-than-expected 3.3 percent in the United States, where resurgent fast-food rivals and more upscale brands like Chipotle Mexican Grill (pictured) are taking a bite out of market share . Chief Executive Officer Don Thompson said in a statement that the company is taking steps to revive McDonald's global business. For example, in the United States, where McDonald's relatively inexpensive burgers and fries are falling out of favor, the company is directly addressing rumors about its food quality. Results, thus far, seem mixed. Last week, McDonald's launched a social media campaign called ""Our food. Your questions."" The company invited consumers to ask anything about its food and got the conversation rolling with questions such as: ""Is 'pink slime' in a Chicken McNugget?"" ""Why doesn't your food rot?"" ""Are there worms in your beef?"" The campaign, coupled with McDonald's recent Monopoly promotion, appeared to give the company short-term lifts in quality perception and purchase consideration from the younger, sought-after Millennial demographic that favors the likes of Chipotle, according to survey data from YouGov BrandIndex. Last week, McDonald's launched a social media campaign called ""Our food. Your questions."" McDonald's says that 'pink slime' is not used to make Chicken McNuggets . Nevertheless, the company's key demographic of frequent fast-food eaters were largely unmoved by the campaigns, YouGov spokesman Drew Kerr told Reuters. The reaction from moms was more complicated, Kerr said. While the Monopoly campaign persuaded them to consider a visit to the Golden Arches, quality perception declined. Europe's sales at established restaurants fell 1.4 percent in the third quarter, hurt by economic weakness in Germany as well as political events in Ukraine and Russia, formerly a fast-growing market for McDonald's. Same-restaurant sales at McDonald's Asia-Pacific, Middle East and Africa business tumbled 9.9 percent, as the China supplier scandal pummeled sales around the region, including Japan.

"Inspirational Christian minister born with no limbs Nick Vujicic was pictured hitting the beach in Maui on Tuesday as he took a much needed vacation ahead of the release of his newest book, in which the Aussie native explains how to overcome bullying. Vujicic's life is a testament to how one can overcome adversity, but in Stand Strong: You Can Overcome Bullying, the 31-year-old reveals that even he's had to struggle against bullies. But like his astonishing ability to get around blissfully on a sunny Hawaii beach proves, he's learned what it takes to overcome most any obstacle. Scroll down to read an excerpt from Stand Strong: You Can Overcome Bullying... Inspiring: Christian evangelist Nick Vujicic was born limbless, but has turned his life into a source of inspiration for millions worldwide as he's spread his message of hope through public speaking and motivational books . Bullied: Vujicic manages to get around swimmingly now, as evidenced by these April 1 photos of him vacationing in Maui, but he says there was a time when self doubt left him feeling helpless in the face of bullies . Rose above: The 31-year-old says he turned to God and inward to his own strength in order to beat his bullies and he's written a book that's released April 15 in which he shares his bully-beating wisdom, . 'I felt alone in my fear of bullies,' he writes in the intro to his new book, available April 15. 'And neither are you.' The minister, who's shared his inspirational message in 44 countries, describes how to turn bullies into motivators. 'Bullies want to abuse you. Instead of allowing that, you can use them as your personal motivators,' he writes. 'Power up and let the bully eat your dust.' Happily married: Vujicic and his wife Kanae Miyahara met in 2008. In this photo Kanae shows off the ring that Nick placed on her finger with his mouth . Beautiful family: Vujicic and his wife pose with Kiyoshi after his birth in 2013 . Vujicic's personal story is enough to motivate most anyone into bettering themselves. The bestselling author who was married to his beautiful wife Kanae Miyahara two years ago was born to Serbian immigrants in Melbourne, Australia. For medical reasons that remain largely mysterious even to Vujicic, he had no limbs. He does have a small foot on his left hip which helps him balance and enables him to kick. As a teen he mastered life’s daily tasks and went on to show that he can do everything that able bodied people can do-including writing, typing, play drums, brush his teeth. Aged 17 he began giving talks at a church group and went on to found a non-profit to use his experience to help others. Nick's father was a computer programmer and accountant and he taught his little son how to type with his toe at just 6 years old. His mum invented a special plastic device that meant he could hold a pen and pencil. Despite the risk of bullying, his parents insisted Nick attended mainstream school. Nick, who was teased and bullied, had an electric wheelchair for mobility, and a team of carers to help him. 'I was deeply depressed when I was eight years old,' he said. 'I went to my mum crying and told her I wanted to kill myself.' At age ten Nick, tried to drown himself in the bath but luckily the attempt was unsuccessful. But with the help of his religion, friends and family, Nick managed to pull through to become an international symbol of triumph over adversity.

"The Nakagin Capsule Tower is one of Toykyo's most famous buildings. Designed by Kisho Kurokawa in 1972, it caught the world's attention with its minuscule living spaces for the country's single office workers. The striking tower, in Tokyo's Shimbashi district, even appeared as a Japanese love hotel in 2013 blockbuster 'The Wolverine' starring Hugh Jackman. The Nakagin Capsule Tower in Tokyo's Shimbashi district. Just 20 of the 140 units are now lived in full-time . But over the years much of the once-modern building has fallen into disrepair. Around half of the 140 units are used as offices, art studios and second homes, but just 20 are lived in full-time. Each of the 140 units in the tower contains a bed, a fold-out desk and a tiny bathroom, all squeezed just 10 square metres. Rent for a capsule is around 60,000 yen (£337) per month. The rooms feature a large round window and retro features such as clocks and sound systems, giving them  the appearance of being suspended in a 1970s vision of the future. Small but perfectly formed: Unit owner Masato Abe in his miniscule room in  the Nakagin Capsule Tower . Tight squeeze: Each unit contains a bed, a fold-out desk and a bathroom area all in just 10 square metres . The building's dilapidated state does not make for an easy life.The capsules' asbestos insulation is deteriorating, so winters are cold, and summers can get very hot. Corroding pipes, water damage and an uncertain future mean half the capsules have been left to rot by their owners, who would rather see the tower demolished and reap the profits of a brand new apartment building. The individual capsules were originally designed to be removed and replaced every 25 years, except that failed to happen. While some owners are keen to restore the building, others feel demolition is the best route. Eighty per cent of them need to agree on any changes, before a decision is made.

Meanwhile, a crowd-funding project hopes to safeguard the future of the 13-storey tower - that some see as a monument to Japanese architectural history. The campaign, known as the 'Save The Nakagin Capsule Tower Campaign' aims to collect donations from people all over the world who love this capsule tower and use that money to buy the capsules one by one. But Japan, like many countries in Asia, often prefers the new to the old. Christian Dimmer, Professor of Urbanism at Tokyo University, told AFP news agency: 'It is hard to raise public awareness about the preservation of historic buildings in Japan, where buildings are usually torn down and replaced after 30 years.'","Originally designed by Kisho Kurokawa in 1972 for single office workers .

"A Colombian teenager who choked three women unconscious before sexually assaulting them in the street has pleaded guilty. The 17-year-old targeted three strangers on separate occasions in Melbourne's CBD between November 2013 and January 2014. On Wednesday the skateboarder pleaded guilty to a number of charges including rape, attempted rape, robbery, assault with intent to rape and indecent assault, The Age reported. In each case the teen choked each victim unconscious before sexually assaulting them, sometimes multiple times, according to the prosecution. A teenager has pleaded guilty to three horrifically violent sexual attacks in Melbourne's CBD, on of which took place near Southern Cross Station . The teenager, just 17 at the time of the attacks, was arrested on January 25 more than 200 kilometres from where the assaults took place - at camping grounds in Johanna, near Apollo Bay. The prosecutor said the teen's family had bought him a one-way flight back to Bogota, Colombia, and had tried to assist him in altering his appearance. He had been due to leave the country the day after his arrest. In the Victorian County Court on Wednesday Prosecutor Dr Nanette Rogers, SC, described the terrifying nature of each of the attacks, all on young women in their early twenties. On November 9 around 12.30am the first one took place, when a 22-year-old was grabbed on Bourke Street in Melbourne's CBD and shoved in to a laneway where she was assaulted. The second victim, a Chinese international student, 24, was speaking on the phone outside a car dealership on Kings Way near Albert street when she was attacked from behind. The three assaults were launched on women in their twenties between November 2013 and January 2014 at three separate locations . She was sexually assaulted some time between 2.30 and 3am. In her victim impact statement the woman expressed her distress over the fact that such an horrific crime could happen in Australia. 'Sexual abuse is an unforgivable offence ... It should not have happened here [in Australia],' she said according to The Age. The Colombian teenager's third victim was another 22-year-old who according to Ms Rogers had a shard of glass held to her throat on Flinders Street around 6am on January 18. Her attacker then marched her more than a kilometre through the city before dragging her into a stairway near Southern Cross Station and raping her twice, the court heard. This victim told the court she could not escape the traumatising memories of the violent rape, and was terrified while waiting for the results to see if she had contracted HIV from her attacker. The Colombian teen, just 17 at the time of the brazen attacks, pleaded guilty to a number of charges in the Victorian Country Court on Wednesday . The 22-year-old also revealed the devastating impact the incident had on her emotional connection with others, and said she no longer wanted to go to the gym as she believed the less attractive she was the less likely it was she would be assaulted again. The case was moved from the Children's Court to the County Court because of its severity, and the fact the attacker could have faced a maximum of three years behind bars if he had been tried as a child. The court heard the teen had moved to Australia to be with his mother late last year. He apologised for the horrific attacks but said the second two were due to alcohol abuse. He will be sentenced at a later date, and will most likely be deported when he is released on parole.","A teenager attacked and sexually assaulted three women in Melbourne .

"With her glossy, chestnut ponytail swishing to and fro, I spotted her furtively racing down the sparkling new ALDI shopping aisles, her slim, manicured hands greedily fumbling towards the coffee pods and water crackers. Here was the undisputed yummy-mummy queen of my son's little local public school, trying to go unnoticed. With a look as determined and stealthy as the engine of her $70,000 Volvo XC90 parked outside, this was clearly a 'shop-but-for-god's-sake-don't-be-seen' mission. Scroll down for video . Lucie Morris-Marr put the new ALDI store in Melbourne to the test and it came up trumphs, saving more than $20 compared with the same shop at Coles .

COLES TOTAL: $96.77 . PRICE DIFFERENCE : $22.64 . (SAVINGS OVER A YEAR SHOPPING FOR A WHOLE YEAR AT ALDI INSTEAD OF COLES :$1,177.28) After only entering Australia 13 years ago, the chain now has more than 10.3 per cent of the grocery market on the eastern ­seaboard, with more than 350 stores and annual sales of $5.3 billion. Yes, you read it right - that's $5.3 billion for a supermarket so weird and wonderful that somehow you can easily emerge with a $6 hula-hoop for your pre-schooler when all you went in for was a sandwich loaf. But what was remarkable was how by 9.20am this morning each one of the 136 parking spaces were filled outside the new store on Bay Road, Cheltenham, near the uber-wealthy neighbouring suburbs of Sandringham, Hampton and Brighton. Putting ALDI'S latest shopping experience to the test, Daily Mail Australia sent me to do a shop here to see if this new store will get me hooked, knowing that I can be a snobby beast when it comes to food shopping. The new Aldi store in Cheltenham was reviewed by Lucie Morris Marr . Bananas were $1.81/kg cheaper at ALDI compared with Coles . But some basic items at ALDI were a little more expensive including long grain rice which was $2.99 for a 2kg bag while at Coles it was $2.29 . Because, I have to be honest, my previous experiences of ALDI stores haven't always been a delight. Far from it. For a start there are no free carrier bags, no brands that I've known and loved all my life (e.g Heinz and Fairy Liquid) and you are most definitely not allowed to pack your shopping at the check out. Don't even think about it! In the past, it's at this point I usually weep silently, wishing I'd just re-mortgaged the house and shopped at Thomas Dux where you float off feeling like a better person - not a mother slipping towards the edge of sanity. But the first thing that strikes me as I walk into the doors of this flagship new store, is the sense of space. Yes, ALDI have gone all trendy here with a hint of minimalist at last. Whisper it quietly, it's almost IKEA-like. These were the products at the ALDI store that were price matched. The ALDI total came in at more than $20 less compared with the same shop at Coles . After doing a shop of 26 daily basic daily items at ALDI totalling $74.13, Lucie then drove two kilometres up the road to the nearest Coles at Southland, Cheltenham, where the exact same items came to a whopping $96.77 in comparison . 'The store say they are able to offer cheap prices by cutting down on overheads, using reusable crates and not giving out free plastic bags,' said Lucie . You can see what their game is, in their bid to get fussy mums like me onside, with their organic ranges, exposed pale wood beams, jaunty metal tubes on the tall ceilings and most importantly space between the food and those famously bizarre 'Special Buys.' Well done ALDI, for once the proximity between your cheap camping gear and boogie boards, are far enough away for me to safely manoeuvre towards the bananas without running anyone down. Let this be your future. And of course for savvy middle-class shoppers, feeling the strain of the increasing costs of housing and basic utilities, it's all about the cheaper price points they boast about. But are their claims really true? It is, as it turns out. After doing a shop of 26 daily basic daily items at ALDI totalling $74.13, I then drove two kilometres up the road to the nearest Coles at Southland, Cheltenham, where the exact same items came to a whopping $96.77 in comparison - by only using either their own brands or the cheapest on offer. 'Well done ALDI, for once the proximity between your cheap camping gear and boogie boards, are far enough away for me to safely manoeuvre towards the bananas without running anyone down,' said Lucie . Most fresh fruit came in cheaper at ALDI when compared to Coles . While some items such as plain flour, bread, milk and tins of baked beans were in some cases exactly the same as ALDI, it was in the meat and cheese aisles where ALDI won handsomely. Infact, there was a total saving of $22.64 by getting my basic items from ALDI which is a saving of a huge $1.117.28 over a whole year. That's a decent mini-break in a luxury hotel in my book. Take that Mr Dux! It's not surprising ALDI plans to continue to try and take over the world, with their 9,600 stores in 18 countries. They are investing between $400 million and $450 million in Western Australia and between $200 million and $300 million in South Australia over the next few years with the first stores in the states to open in 2016. 'Everything we do is designed to enable Australian shoppers to live richer lives for less,' an ALDI Australia spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia. 'Yes, ALDI have gone all trendy here with a hint of minimalist at last,' said Lucie . Lucie Morris-Marr found that it was more than $20 cheaper to shop at ALDI compared to Coles for the same items . 'In their bid to get fussy mums like me onside, with their organic ranges, exposed pale wood beams, jaunty metal tubes on the tall ceilings and most importantly space between the food and those famously bizarre 'Special Buys,' said Lucie . 'Australians have come to love the business model of ALDI, now they have had a taste of what we can offer.' The store say they are able to offer cheap prices by cutting down on overheads, using reusable crates and not giving out free plastic bags. OK so yes, Coles and Woolworths stores are full of famous brands and they pack your bags for you. (Which is life-saving if your toddler is crying.) And you don't get tempted to buy a laptop with your washing up liquid. But as I spied the school yummy mummy speeding off in her Volvo from ALDI, I knew one thing for certain. She may try to deny it. But she'll be back for the cheap free range chicken at least. And so will I.","ALDI opens it's latest $6 million store in one of Melbourne's most exclusive beach suburbs, Cheltenham .

"A young woman has appeared in court today accused of helping her best friend to kill herself. Milly Caller, 22, is accused of assisting her best friend Emma Crossman to die, by providing her with the gas container she used to take her life earlier this year. The 21-year-old's body was found by police at the flat she shared with her boyfriend in Sleaford, Lincolnshire on January 15.

Friends: Milly Caller, 22, is accused of assisting her best friend Emma Crossman to die, by providing her with the gas container she used to take her life earlier this year . Emergency services had rushed to the property, but Miss Caller was pronounced dead at the scene. Today, Caller appeared at Lincoln Magistrates' Court to face one charge of assisting the suicide of another. Wearing a black jacket and black trousers, she spoke only to confirm her name and address during the short five minute hearing. Court date: Milly Caller, 22, pictured leaving Lincoln Magistrates Court today, faces one charge of assisting the suicide of another. She spoke only to confirm her name and address during the short hearing . Bailed: Caller, from Sleaford, entered no plea and was given unconditional bail. She was escorted from the building by a male friend before being whisked away from court by car. Caller, pictured right with Miss Crossman, is the second youngest person to be arrested and charged with the offence in Britain . She entered no plea and was given unconditional bail until her next appearance at Lincoln Crown Court on October 30. Caller, from Sleaford, was escorted from the building by a male friend before being whisked away from court in a red Audi A4. Speaking after the charges were made earlier this year, a spokesperson for Lincolnshire Police said: 'Following advice from the Crown Prosecution Service, Lincolnshire Police have charged 22 year old Milly Caller from Great Hale with assisting the suicide of another. Home: Miss Crossman's body was found by police at the flat she shared with her boyfriend in Sleaford on January 15 . 'The charge follows her arrest on January 15, 2014 in connection with the death of 21 year old Emma Louise Crossman.' Caller is the second youngest person to be arrested and charged with the offence in Britain. Last year Kevin Howe was found guilty of assisting the suicide of his friend, Stephen Walker, in October 2013. The 20-year-old was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment after helping the the 30-year-old set fire to himself. Following the tragedy neighbours and friends paid tribute to Miss Crossman - who was said to have no obvious health issues. Sue Price, 33, who lived on the same street, described her as a 'happy and bubbly' girl. She added: 'She just seemed so lovely, happy and bubbly all the time. 'Emma lived there with her boyfriend I believe and we used to see her going out with her dad. 'We never expected anything like this - it’s an absolute tragedy, she was so young.” Writing on Miss Crossman’s Facebook profile page, John Ridley said: 'I will never forget you as I look up into the sky.' Ob Ob Obrien added: 'Heaven’s most beautiful angle sleep tight emma x x x.' Assisting suicide is allowed in Switzerland, Luxembourg, Belgium and the Netherlands, and some US states permit doctor-assisted suicide. But it is illegal in Britain and carries a maximum jail sentence of 14 years. In 2009, a Crown Prosecution Service change in policy set out new guidelines which took into consideration public interest in prosecuting suspects arrested over assisting suicide. Caller is the second person to be charged with the offence since the change in guidelines.

"It is the moment a great white shark latches on to a buoy and refuses to let go. Passengers on a boat in South Africa managed to capture amazing footage of the terrifying shark grabbing hold of a flotation device. As the fisherman on board tries to pull the buoy in, the shark can be seen battling to maintain its vice-like grip - in much the same way a dog would with a toy. As the shark becomes more frustrated, fling the buoy from side to side in a bid to keep hold of it, the onlookers on the boat can be heard laughing. In fact, the shark is so busy swing its head from side to side, it almost headbutts a cage hanging off the side of the boat, which is used by scuba divers. The footage was filmed in Mossel Bay, an area known for its shark diving along South Africa’s attractive Garden Route. Jaws: The great white shark wraps his jaws around the buoy in South Africa . The frustrated great white shows immense force as it fling around the bait, before eventually giving up and sliding back into the water and out of view. Scientists discovered in 2008 that the bite force of a great white can reach 1.8 tons, which is 20 times greater than a human's bite. Cage diving with great whites is a popular pastime for holidaymakers on the South African coast, with one session costing around £100. Swinging: The buoy swings from side to side as it breaks free from the shark's mouth . Firm grip: When the shark bites down on the buoy it holds it in its mouth in a powerful grip .

"Violent offenders may have to wear electronic ankle tags following the horrific murder of an 11-year-old boy who was beaten to death by his abusive father earlier in the year. This is a $150 million proposal put forward by the Victorian government as part of their re-election campaign to order high-risk perpetrators to wear GPS trackers while victims would be given separate devices to trigger an alarm if offenders approached. It comes eight months after Luke Batty was killed by his deranged father Greg Anderson, who attacked his son at cricket training, despite an intervention order placed against him by the boy's mother. Scroll down for video . Luke Batty was beaten to death with a cricket bat by his deranged father Greg Anderson, 57, earlier this year . Luke Batty, 11, who was the son of British-born Rosie Batty and her Australian ex-partner Greg Anderson . Tyabb Cricket Ground, south of Melbourne, where Luke Batty was killed on the evening of February 12 . On the evening of February 12, Rosie Batty watched in horror as her ex-partner Greg Anderson stabbed and beat their son to death with a cricket bat after a training session at Tyabb Cricket Ground, south of Melbourne. While emergency services were too late to save the 11-year-old, who died at the scene, police attempted to subdue the father with capsicum spray . Witnesses included parents and children who were gathered at the grounds for evening cricket training and watched on as the 54-year-old father charged with a knife at one of the officers, who shot him dead. Ms Batty had previously taken out domestic violence warrants on her deranged ex-partner. Tyabb Cricket Ground, in Victoria, where the 11-year-old boy was murdered by his father during evening cricket training . Ten days after he was murdered by his father, the body of 11-year-old Luke Batty is carried from his school chapel in a bright yellow coffin . The boy's British mother Rosie was standing metres from Luke when he was murdered . The Victorian government's pledge for electronic ankle tags on violent offenders would follow a pilot program next year, as part of the $150 million package announced on Saturday.

"With the average price of a home in London now above £500,000, it may come as a surprise to learn a studio flat has just been put on the market for less than £100,000. What is perhaps less surprising is that it measures just 206 square feet - including entrance and separate bathroom - requires a ladder to get into bed, and has only a microwave in the 'kitchen'. Described as a 'bijou studio flat... with an open plan kitchen area' on the listing, the sellers admit that it could do with 'updating in parts'. 'Bijou': Estate agents described this studio flat in Steatham as 'open plan' but in need of 'updating in places' Bargain: The new owner will pay just £99,950 for the studio apartment, but will need a ladder to get into bed and will have to use a microwave for all their cooking . However, with other studio flats in the same area selling for up to £235,000, estate agents Jacksons are hoping potential buyers will see it as a bargain. Across the other side of London in Mayfair, a 334 sqft flat was recently put up for sale for £1million, making it the smallest million-pound property on the market. Meanwhile, in nearby Kensignton and Knightsbridge, off-street car parking spaces often sell for in excess of £100,000, with some currently on the market for £225,000. The most expensive flat sold in Britain is also in Knightsbridge. Penthouse D at the top of 1 Hyde Park sold earlier this year for a reported £140million, despite having no furnishings or internal walls. In Steatham itself, the average cost of a house is now £523,267, having shot up from a little over £400,000 in 2010. A flat in the same postcode is worth an average of more than £300,000. Shoebox: The whole property measures just 206 square feet, including a separate bathroom and entrance . Prime location: The studio is above a shop, and just a few minutes' walk away from Steatham railway station . Experts have cautioned in recent months that the property market has been slowing down, with a report out today showing that mortgage lending in August fell for the first time in six months. A report published earlier today by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors showed a majority of areas in London are seeing property price falls for the first time in nearly four years after a dramatic slide in the number of new house hunters in the capital. And on Wednesday, lender Halifax forecast the property market would cool saying it believed house price inflation had peaked, despite homes rising another £1,100 in September. Cheap: At 206 square feet, the flat is only slightly smaller than another one-bed property put on the market in Mayfair, although that one was listed for £1million .","Studio flat in Streatham measures just 206 square foot including bathroom .

"Drinking tea and orange juice could cut a woman’s risk of ovarian cancer by up to a third, claim researchers. A major 30-year study found that compounds in tea and citrus fruits could protect against the devastating disease. Ovarian cancer – known as the silent killer because women are often diagnosed too late for a cure – affects almost 7,000 women a year in the UK and kills more than 4,000. Scroll down for video . Drinking tea and orange juice could cut a woman’s risk of ovarian cancer by up to a third, researchers claim . The University of East Anglia scientists, who studied the diets of 171,940 women aged 25 to 55 for more than three decades, found that those who ate foods high in the antioxidant compounds flavonoids – including tea, red wine, apples and citrus fruits – had a much lower risk of developing ovarian tumours. The reduction was up to 31 per cent for tea drinkers and a fifth (21 per cent) for those drinking large amounts of citrus fruit juices, especially orange, the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition reported. Lead researcher Professor Aedin Cassidy, from Norwich Medical School, said: ‘The main sources of these compounds include tea and citrus fruits and juices, which are readily incorporated into the diet, suggesting that simple changes in food intake could have an impact on reducing ovarian cancer risk.’ Flavonoids are thought to provide protection in several ways, such as by improving blood vessel function and preventing inflammation. Benefits: The risk of developing ovarian cancer was up to 31 per cent lower for tea drinkers and a fifth (21 per cent) for those drinking large amounts of citrus fruit juices, especially orange . Dr Simon Newman, head of research at Target Ovarian Cancer, said: ‘Whilst the causes and risks of ovarian cancer are complex, a healthy lifestyle with a good diet and regular exercise can reduce your risk slightly.’ Louise Bayne, of the charity Ovacome, said: ‘It is always welcome to see reports of how women might go about avoiding ovarian cancer. But the key in beating this disease is in identifying its symptoms early on... ‘Women also need to talk to their family to find out if there is a history of breast and ovarian cancer.’","30-year study carried out by scientists at the University of East Anglia .

"Work begins Friday to recover the remains of the four people who died when a small plane crashed into a flight training facility at a Kansas airport, authorities said. Jet fuel from the plane burned so hot during the blaze after the crash Thursday morning at Wichita Mid-Continent Airport that portions of the building remained unsafe all day and emergency officials voiced concerns about the stability of the structure. Late Thursday night, smoke continued to rise from the wreckage. Heavy equipment will be brought in Friday to remove portions of the building so firefighters can reach the victims, Wichita Fire Chief Ronald Blackwell said. Crews are expected to be at the site for at least a couple of days. Devestation: Work begins Friday to recover the remains of the four people who died when a small plane crashed into a flight training facility at a Kansas airport . Team effort: Heavy equipment will be brought in to remove portions of the building so firefighters can reach the victims, Wichita Fire Chief Ronald Blackwell said . 'The real work begins at daylight,' Blackwell said Thursday. National Transportation Safety Board investigator Leah Yeager said the pilot reported a problem with the left engine of the twin-engine Beechcraft King Air soon after taking off from the airport. Horrific blaze: Fire-damaged vehicles remain parked outside the flight training facility at Wichita Mid-Continent Airport . Clean-up processL Emergency workers arrive - crews are expected to be at the site for at a couple of days . According to witness reports, the plane was 'flying low and slow before it entered a left turn,' Yeager said. 'It continued to turn left and then impacted the building,' she said. The plane, which was manufactured in 2000, struck the top of the building and ignited a horrific fire, Blackwell said. The aircraft remains in pieces, with parts scattered on the roof and on the ground of the training facility. NTSB investigators at the scene will try to determine what caused the engine failure. Peter Knudson, an NTSB spokesman, told The Associated Press early Friday that there are procedures for pilots to land with an engine out but that he had no information on why those procedures were not applied.

"Serial killers are portrayed as cold, calculating and often obsessive but it was unknown exactly what caused them to commit such heinous crimes. Now research from Glasgow has found that these similar traits among different murderers may be linked to specific psychological disorders and childhood trauma. Researchers from Glasgow have conducted the first ever analysis of journals, news reports and legal files involved in the cases of killers, including Anders Breivik and Dr Harold Shipman. They discovered a link between suffering a combination of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), a head injury and a psychosocial disorder, such as that caused by exposure to abuse in childhood or parental divorce. The study found 28% of killers were thought to have suffered from Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), and a fifth suffered a 'definite or suspected' head injury. This venn diagram shows the proportion and overlaps between head injury and/or ASD and psychosocial stressors . Breivik was convicted of mass murder in 2012 for causing a fatal explosion and terrorism in Norway in 2011. During his attack eight people died in the bombing and 69 more died in a mass shooting. In January 2000, a jury found Dr Harold Shipman guilty of killing 15 of his patients - although he is believed to have been involved in the death of up to 250. Other killers studied included 1996 Australian mass murderer Martin Bryant, and 2008 Exeter nail bomber Nick Reilly. The team . from Glasgow searched studies and books that were both . published and still in progress which referred to serial killers, . violent crime, psychopathy, narcissistic personality disorder, and . Autistic Spectrum Disorders. This . included Web of Knowledge and PsycINFO, and search terms included . ‘autism and serial killer’, ‘psychopathy and autism’, ‘murder and . autism’, ‘brain injury and serial killer’, among other relevant . searches. Among . the 239 eligible killers, 28 per cent had ‘definite, highly . probable or possible ASD’ of which 7 per cent also had a head injury. More than 21 per cent had suffered a definite or suspected head injury, of which 13 per cent also had evidence of ASD traits. Out of the 106 killers with ASD and/or head injury, more than half  (55 per cent) had experienced psychosocial stressors. According to the findings, 28 per cent of the high-profile killers were thought to have suffered from ASD. In contrast, around one in 100 of the general population is thought to suffer from the condition. There were additional reports that claimed a fifth had suffered a ‘definite or suspected’ head injury in the past. Of those killers with ASD and/or a head injury, more than half had previously experienced psychosocial stress such as sexual or physical abuse, but also parental divorce. The Glasgow research, therefore, concluded probably . more than 10 per cent of serial killers on the whole, across the worldwide population, show signs of ASD, and a similar . proportion have had a head injury. This combination could . potentially result in an individual being predisposed to develop into a . mass murderer. ‘The report, which is the first of its kind to look at all the available material around serial and mass killers, identified that a complex interplay between neurodevelopmental problems and psychosocial factors are most likely to lead to incidences of this kind,’ explained the study authors, led by Dr Clare Allely. But the researchers claim that a person suffering a neurodevelopmental disorder or a brain injury, by itself does not result in a serial killer or mass murderer. To test the hypothesis, the team from the University of Glasgow searched studies and books that were both published and still in progress that referred to serial killers, violent crime, psychopathy, narcissistic personality disorder, and Autistic Spectrum Disorders. Researchers from Glasgow analysed journals, news reports and legal files involved with cases of serial killers, including Anders Breivik (pictured). They discovered a link between Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and psychosocial disorders, such as exposure to abuse in childhood or parental divorce, among serial killers . Databases included Web of Knowledge and PsycINFO, and search terms included ‘autism and serial killer’, ‘psychopathy and autism’, ‘murder and autism’, ‘brain injury and serial killer’, among other relevant searches. The researchers also examined book chapters, whole books and electronic documents available locally, and through the UK’s inter-library loan system. Among all the 239 eligible killers, 28 per cent had ‘definite, highly probable or possible ASD’ of which seven per cent also had a head injury. More than 21 per cent had suffered a definite or suspected head injury, of which 13 per cent also had evidence of ASD traits. Mass murderer Dr Harold Shipman, pictured, was 'highly suspected to have had ASD' and had experienced stressors in the past, the study found . Out of the 106 killers with ASD and/or head injury, more than half  (55 per cent) had experienced psychosocial stressors. The paper added that despite the ‘exhaustive search’ reports on fewer than 400 serial and mass killers were found since 1985, suggesting they are rare. Dr Allely, from the Institute of Health and Wellbeing at the University of Glasgow, continued: ‘It is crucial to note that we are not trying to suggest individuals with ASD or previous head trauma are more likely to be serial killers or commit serious crime. ‘Rather we are suggesting that there may be a subgroup of individuals within these groups who may be more likely to commit serious crimes when exposed to certain psychosocial stressors. ‘Research on mass and serial killing is still very much in its infancy. New research is urgently required to understand the mechanisms underlying these extreme forms of violence so that preventative strategies can be developed. ‘We would recommend that in future, all serial or mass killers who are apprehended should be thoroughly assessed using standardised tools for investigating neurodevelopmental disorders including ASD and head injury.’ The findings are published in the in the Journal of Violent and Aggressive Behaviour and the full paper can be viewed at Science Direct. Carol Povey, Director of The National Autistic Society’s Centre for Autism, told MailOnline: 'This is a very serious issue and research like this is vital if we are to develop preventive strategies. 'But we would urge people not to jump to conclusions about people with autism and to make judgements about a whole section of society. 'This and previous research shows that the vast majority of individuals with autism are law abiding and respect the rules of society. Indeed, in many cases, individuals with autism are unusually concerned to keep the letter of the law, due to the nature of the disability. 'This research reaffirms the importance of ensuring that people with autism get the support they need as early as possible.' In a recent paper, published in Frontiers in Human Neuroscience journal, Dr Sergio Canavero claimed the brains of killers and other psychopaths should be treated using psychomodulation – a deep brain stimulation of regions linked to personality and mood. He said that imprisonment or the death penalty are costly and considered inhumane. In his research, Dr Canavero called for a ‘complete rewiring of the psychopath brain by associating brain cortical stimulation to environmental reconditioning.’ He believes that because brain stimulation is a non-invasive, or minimally invasive technique, it can be used to treat a number neurological and psychiatric conditions. This is because ‘it has the capacity to alter brain circuitry according to length of stimulation. Unlike deep brain stimulation, it carries no risk of death or disability.’","Researchers studied journals, new stories and legal files for murder cases .

"A five-year-old boy smuggled a kitchen knife into his primary school and told classmates it was for 'stabbing bad teachers'. Horrified staff at Patrington Church of England Primary School, in Hull, East Yorkshire, overheard the pupil telling friends he had a knife in his schoolbag - before confiscating the weapon. The boy was excluded from school for a week - but parents were outraged after the school hushed up the incident, and failed to tell them what had happened. A five-year-old boy smuggled a kitchen knife into Patrington Church of England Primary School in Hull, East Yorkshire . One parent, who did not wish to be named, said: 'You expect this type of thing to happen in American high schools, not an East Riding primary school. 'If there is an incident involving a knife at my child's school, I want to be told about it by the headteacher.' The boy is believed to have taken the knife from his bag on arrival at school and showed it to two classmates before staff confiscated the weapon. Although no direct threat was made to staff or other pupils and no one was injured, parents say they only learned about it after talking to one another at the school gates. The unnamed parent said: 'I believe the school handled this completely wrong. Parents should have received a letter. 'The boy pulled the knife out of his bag at the start of the school day, in the cloakroom area. 'He showed the knife to two other small children. He was not jabbing it or anything like that, but he apparently told two other children that it was to stab the bad teachers with. 'My partner says when she dropped our son off at school the next day she saw a child crying. That boy's mum told her that he was scared he might be attacked if he misbehaved. 'Apparently, the school wanted to deal with it all internally, but I believe a meeting should have been arranged to discuss what happened.' The boy is believed to have taken the knife from his bag on arrival at school and showed it to two classmates before staff confiscated the weapon (file picture) Staff at the school refused to answer enquiries but Eleanor Course, spokeswoman for the Diocese of York, said the incident happened on the morning of Monday, October 13. She said: 'A child was overheard by a teacher at the school door of Patrington CofE Primary Academy saying he had a knife. 'A teacher located and removed a kitchen knife in the academy's cloakroom and the child was excluded for a week. 'The academy has been working with the child, his parent, and all appropriate safeguarding and behavioural support from the local authorities, to ensure the child is receiving all possible help. 'At no point were any children or staff in danger from the child in question, so the academy decided not to inform all parents. 'Patrington CofE Primary Academy is sorry that this decision has caused concern among parents, and would like to apologise for the worry this decision has created. 'However, the academy cannot inform the parents of the full details of the case, as the privacy and wellbeing of the child concerned and his family need to be taken into account. 'The academy wants to reiterate that no children were, or are, in any danger, and all possible steps have been put in place to ensure this incident will not be repeated.' In April, mother-of-two Ann Maguire, 61, was stabbed to death as she taught a classroom of pupils at Corpus Christi Catholic College in Leeds. A memorial service was held last month to celebrate the teacher's life. In America there has been a tragic history of killings in schools including at Sandy Hook Elementary in Connecticut in 2012 when gunman Adam Lanza claimed 28 lives. Earlier this year, 21 people were injured in a stabbing spree at Franklin Regional High School in Murrysville, Pennsylvania.","Child smuggled blade into Patrington Church of England School in Hull .

"Ferguson officials have been accused of refusing to cooperate as it emerged police officers are still not wearing identification on patrol and city leaders are blocking the release of government documents. Authorities have vowed to tackle racial divisions in the city following the shooting of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown on August 9. But almost two months later, little progress has been made - and the Department of Justice is calling for action. Scroll down for video . Refusing to cooperate? Ferguson police have been slammed as many have allegedly been covering or not wearing their identification tags. Meanwhile, the media is being charged hundreds to see public documents . In a letter to the Ferguson Police Department (FPD) on Tuesday, the department said its own investigators have spotted officers without name tags and refusing to identify themselves to members of the public. The practise violates FPD rules, the department pointed out, and is illegal in many states. It added: 'The failure to wear name plates conveys a message to community members that, through anonymity, officers may seek to act with impunity'. Just days later the letter was followed by a second on Friday, as it emerged the first one had been ignored. 'It further was reported to us that some officers affirmatively displaying these bracelets had black tape over their name plates. Conflict: The Department of Justice has slammed officers for wearing 'I Am Darren Wilson' bracelets on duty . Unrest: The city had pledged to repair racial divisions in the city but two months later there is little progress . 'The practice of not wearing, or obscuring, name plates violates your own department's policies, which we advised you earlier this week when we requested that you end the practice imrnediately.' The second letter also addressed the news that officers were sporting 'I Am Darren Wilson' bracelets in an apparent show of solidarity to the man that shot Michael Brown. Now, leaders of the city council have also been accused of failing to cooperate as media requests for documents which could be free of charge have been met with bills for hundreds of dollars. The Associated Press was charged $135 an hour  to retrieve a handful of email accounts - on the grounds that it would take a council employee an entire day's work to do so. However, the hourly salary at the city clerk's office is $13.90. In August, the AP sought copies of several police officials' emails and text messages, including those belonging to Wilson and Chief Thomas Jackson. Protest: Here, people can be seen doing a 'hands up' chant as unarmed black teenager Michael Brown allegedly lifted his hands before he was shot on August 9. His parents have rejected an apology from FDP . The council claimed it would cost $2,000 to get an external company to retrieve the data from their own computer system. Since, the Washington Post has been charged $200 for Freedom Of Information requests, and a BuzzFeed reporter was allegedly issued a bill for 'thousands of dollars' to see memos about Ferguson's traffic-citation policies and changes to local elections. The city's attorney Stephanie Karr, who was dealing with the requests, has refused to respond to repeated interview requests from the AP since earlier this month. The documents could be issued free of charge on the grounds that they are in the public interest. However, the council rebuffed requests on these terms. Meanwhile, Michael Brown's family is refusing to accept an apology made by Ferguson police chief Tom Jackson. They say an apology will be when Darren Wilson is arrested.","Ferguson police have been covering ID with black tape or not wearing it .

"The discovery of three mammoth pythons at a home may be a nightmare for some but Julie Baker simply can't get enough of them. The professional snake catcher - dubbed the Snake Sheila - was called out to a home in Ashgrove, northwest of Brisbane, on Wednesday morning. A resident had found the carpet pythons, each about 2m long, on the rafters of her verandah. Ms Baker was in her element when she arrived at the home to find three snakes, saying in a video she posted online: 'That is cool, only snake catchers think that's cool.' Scroll down for video . A resident had found the carpet pythons, each about 2m long, on the rafters of her home in Ashgrove, north of Brisbane . The three snakes, believed to be two males and one female, were found on the rafters of a verandah . A resident called Julia Baker, who posted video footage of the snakes online, to help catch the reptiles on Wednesday morning . Ms Baker says it's common to find snakes hanging out in the area especially during mating season . Ms Baker says she caught the three snakes and took them to a nearby nature reserve park . Video footage of the three carpet pythons was uploaded on the Facebook page of 1300 Catch It - a snake removal business run by Ms Baker. She believes there were two males and one female out on the verandah due to mating season. But while Ms Baker relocated them to a nearby nature reserve park, the resident called back some time later to tell her that she found another male snake in the same area to look for the female. 'Females give off this strong scent for male snakes, although we can't smell it, during mating season,' she said. 'So the males are really driven by this scent and that's probably why another one turned up.' The 45-year-old, who's been catching snakes for more than four years, says she first fell in love with the legless reptiles 10 years ago.

'They're [snakes] are gorgeous. They're so gentle and gracious but really misunderstood.' While she's unfazed by the widely-feared creatures, she admits that she can't stand cockroaches. 'Well I can't handle cockroaches but I can handle snakes,' she said. 'They have too many legs.' Ms Baker, from the nearby suburb of Eaton Hills, quit her job as a pastry chef to become a snake handler. 'Since then it's been my mission to change the perception that a ""good snake is a dead snake"",' she said. 'I want to change the attitude about snakes and show that they're not aggressive.'

Beforehand, he gave a speech to his unit before turning to Lt. Col. Stephen Twitty and simply saying: 'Sir, we are prepared for battle.' His son Patrick Gallagher said he was being treated for a heart condition at the time of his death. He added that his father would talk about his combat experiences at home but noticed a 'distinct change' when he came back from Somalia. Col. Greg Gadson told the Army Times: 'You know, I don't say this lightly, but Bob is probably one of, probably the best soldier I ever served with. That man really cared about soldiers. 'I know a lot about this man's life, and he's been through a lot. I almost come to tears thinking about what he overcame.

'It was the worst day, because we lost 18 Soldiers and 84 others, including myself, were wounded. It was the best day of my life because it showed the incredible performance of our warriors in long-protracted battle under extraordinary circumstances in an urban environment. 'Throughout it all, the warriors that fought that day performed in a manner that was consistent with the values of our nation, and I was very proud of that.'

"An blind dog has been rescued after being found in hanging in a ‘cocoon’ from a palm tree in a mangrove forest in south Florida. Residents spotted a dog wrapped in a ‘cocoon-like structure’ made from duct tape that had been nailed to a tree in southwest Miami-Dade County. Witnesses believe the male chihuahua had been subjected to a voodoo-like ritual as the animal was surrounded by bones. 'Voodoo': Angel the blind chihuahua was spotted handing from a tree in a cocoon made from duct tape . The blind dog, which has now been named Angel, was rescued by Miami-Dade Animal Services in Black Point Marina, Miami on Tuesday. Officers found Angel running free and hiding in the mangroves, however, residents claim the dog had previously been hanging from a tree. ‘On the edge of the forest, we found duct tape hanging from a nail and the evidence sort of points to the fact that the dog was covered in duct tape in like a cocoon and nailed to the back of a palm tree,’ resident Bill Flett told NBC Miami. Animal cruelty: Although Angel was running free when rescued, residents first spotted the dog hanging in  this 'cocoon' from a palm tree in the forest near Black Point Marina, Miami . Residents believe Angel had been subjected to a Santeria ritual, and animal bones were found at the scene . In recovery: Angel is now in the care of Miami-Dade Animal Services and is recovering from his ordeal . ‘All over this place are bones and I was told by some experts that I spoke with that it’s probably Santeria because there’s a bunch of dead bones and the way the dog was hung in the sack of made of duct tape up on the tree’. Santeria is a syncretic Afro-Caribbean religion which has some similarities to Voodoo. Santeria, also known as La Regla Lucumi and the Rule of Osha, is based on Yoruba beliefs and traditions and traditions, with some Roman Catholic elements added. Animal sacrifice is central to Santeria, a religion which is thought to have grown out of the slave trade in Cuba. Miami-Dade Animal Services say Angel is recovering well and will be put up for adoption unless an owner comes forward.","Blind dog discovered hanging from tree in 'cocoon' made from duct tape .

"A retired holiday camp entertainer who is Britain's most married man having tied the knot a whopping eight times is set to celebrate his tenth wedding anniversary. Ron Sheppard, 66, from Martock, Somerset, first walked down the aisle 47 years ago and has since married eight times, had eight children and welcomed 13 grandchildren and four great-grandchildren. However, despite being keen in the past to re-marry, Mr Sheppard is now happier than ever and promises his latest wife, 35-year-old Filipino Weng Platino, will be his last. Ron Sheppard, 66, from Somerset, who first walked down the aisle 47 years ago, has been married to his eighth wife, 35-year-old Filipino Weng Platino (together left today and right on their wedding day), for ten years . The couple are celebrating ten years of marriage, which is the second longest partnership for Mr Sheppard . He said: 'We've made it to double figures. It's my second longest marriage, but the first one wasn't a real marriage - it wasn't like this. 'We love each other so much. As each year goes on we love each other more and more. 'We just do everything together, it's how love should be.' Mr Sheppard, who has written a book on his life and is set to have a film made about him, has married eight women since his first ceremony aged 19 in 1966. He tied the knot with first wife Margaret 47 years ago and the pair had two children together before divorcing two years later. He then met second wife Jeanette and they wed in 1973, but it only lasted one year and Mr Sheppard has since described the marriage as a 'business transaction' which enabled them to receive a bigger house from the council. Shortly after their divorce, Mr Sheppard met third wife Lesley and in 1976 they tied the knot. They went on to have two children together and he said he thought she 'was for keeps', but he left five years later following a string of arguments. Mr Sheppard first walked down the aisle in 1966, when he married his first wife Margaret, at the age of just 19 . Mr Sheppard married third wife Lesley in 1976 and they had two children together but he left her five years later . He went on to meet 18-year-old blonde Kathy at Pontins holiday camp in Somerset and the pair married in 1982. They had a daughter together and lasted four years, despite Mr Sheppard claiming it was a 'rebound relationship' following his split from Lesley. It wasn't long after that split that he met his fifth wife Sue at a bingo hall. Despite claiming he wasn't 'swept off his feet by her', he moved in to her two-bedroom home and they married in 1986. They had two sons together but she threw him out after he was offered a job in Bournemouth. He then went on to marry Usha in 1999, after the pair met while he was on a stop-off trip to Singapore. They lasted four years but split after Mr Sheppard cheated on her during a holiday alone to Thailand. 1: Margaret, married in 1966. They had three children but were divorced after two years. 2: Jeanette, married in 1973. The marriage lasted one year. 3: Lesley, married in 1976. They had two sons together but Mr Sheppard left in 1981. 4: Kathy, married in 1982. They had one daughter together and  lasted four years. 5: Sue, married in 1986. They had two sons, but she threw him out in 1997. 6: Usha, married in 1999. The marriage to his Singaporean bride ended after four years. 7: Wan, married in 2003. She left him to return home to Bangkok after just eight months. 8: Weng, married in 2004 and are due to celebrate their tenth anniversary next week. With divorce number six behind him, he met seventh wife Wan in Bangkok in 2003 during a trip to visit an old friend. However, after returning to the UK, the pair stayed together for just eight months before the bride announced she was returning to her native country in 2003. It was then that Mr Sheppard met his current wife, Ms Platino, after reaching out online and sparking up a friendship with her. And the retired entertainer, who once mentored actor and singer Shane Richie, said he has finally settled down after finding his 'true love' and 'soul mate'. Mr Sheppard married 18-year-old Kathy (together above) in 1982 because he was 'on the rebound' from Lesley . Mr Sheppard tied the knot with his fifth wife Sue in 1986, when she was already seven months pregnant. Their marriage last a total of 13 years - making it Mr Sheppard's longest partnership out of his eight  marriages . The couple will celebrate their tenth wedding anniversary on November 15. Mr Sheppard said: 'We were going to go to Spain to celebrate, but Weng only gets two days off. 'Instead I think we'll have a nice steak meal with a bottle of pop. 'We've made it to ten years and I hope there is at least another ten to come.' Mr Sheppard has spent 44 of the last 47 years married and his longest union lasted 13 years. The shortest lasted just 10 months. Mr Sheppard met Ms Platino after splitting from his seventh wife, Wan (together above), when she returned to her home in Bangkok after eight months . He met Ms Platino after he sent an email to a Christian relationship advisor in the Philippines shortly after splitting with his seventh wife Wan after just eight months in 2003. He poured his heart out in a lengthy message and kept in touch with his bride-to-be before flying out to Santa Rosa, Laguna, Philippines, to meet her the following May. The couple instantly 'clicked' and they married on the Isle of Wight a month later on November 15, 2004. Mr Sheppard added: 'It's been a decade of pure joy, love and everything that a marriage should be. Weng's changed my life in a way I couldn't have imagined. 'People say we were made for each other. We've never had an argument in ten years and were just compatible in a way I've never experienced.' Mr Sheppard, whose new memoir Lord Of The Wedding Rings details his lothario lifestyle, has previously admitted he failed to mention any of his previous marriages to Ms Platino before proposing. 'I was scared that if I told her the truth she would reject me and I knew I'd found the right woman this time,' he sad. 'I had always planned to tell her but couldn't pluck up the courage.' In fact, he only told her when she saw him planning his new book and saw his notes about his previous partnerships. He said: 'She saw me emailing a publisher and saw the words “Wife No 1, Wife No 2 and Wife No 3” and asked me what it all meant. I had to tell her.' However, the former student nurse didn't seem to mind and said she wasn't angry. She said: 'In my culture, you only get married once, not even twice, so to hear Ron had been married seven times was a big surprise. 'But I'd fallen in love with him. I knew Ron had lived a colourful life but he's such a gentle, caring man. I knew we'd have a lovely life together.' Mr Sheppard married Ms Platino in 2004 (together above) and said he hopes they last another decade together .","Ron Sheppard, 66, from Somerset, first walked down the aisle 47 years ago .

"A dispute over the fate of a missing pig has landed one Missouri man in jail and another in the hospital with 23 stab wounds. Joshua Finke, 22, of St. Charles, was charged Tuesday with felony assault for allegedly attacking a 38-year-old neighbor with a screwdriver. The Lincoln County Sheriff's Department says Finke was accused by three roommates Monday night of stealing a 200-pound pig, and what started as a verbal spat between the men quickly turned physical. Skirmish sparked by a swine: Joshua Finke, 22, of St. Charles, was charged Tuesday with felony assault for allegedly attacking his 38-year-old roommate during an argument over the victim's missing pig . Court documents obtained by Stltoday.com indicate that the victim and his two roommates had been fattening up the pig for seven months for slaughter in their backyard east of Highway 79 in Winfield. Two weeks ago, the animal vanished from its pen and the pig's owners have come to suspect Finke of being the thief. When the roommates confronted Finke about the missing animal at around 10.30pm Monday, the 22-year-old allegedly lunged at the 38-year-old man, plunging a sharp object believed to be a screwdriver into his back 22 times and stabbing him once in the head. Pignapped: Finke was accused by three men of stealing a 200-pound pig (not pictured) that had been raised by one of them for meat . The unnamed victim was rushed to a local hospital for treatment and was released Tuesday morning. Finke is being held on $100,000 cash bond.

"At just 14-years-old, Florida teen Jazz Jennings continues to do more for transgender advocacy than most. Born male but first identifying as female from the age of two, the precocious eighth-grader was recently named one of TIME magazines 25 most-influential teenagers, alongside Taliban victim and Nobel Peace Prize-winner Malala Yousafzai. Jazz has now released I Am Jazz, the first book that is aimed at helping children understand exactly what it means to be transgender, whether they are struggling with their identity or not. 'People see black and white, they don't see the rainbow in the world, and that's really closed-minded,' Jazz said in a new interview with Katie Couric for Yahoo!. Scroll down to see the video . Powerful: Florida girl Jazz Jennings, 14, was recently named one of TIME magazines 25 most-influential teenagers, has written a book to help people understand what it means to be transgender . Gender dysphoria: Jazz was born male (left) but started living as female from the age of five (right), after becoming one of the first children to ever be diagnosed with gender dysphoria . Educating: Jazz hopes the picture book, I Am Jazz, co-written with Jessica Herthel (right), will help both trans and non-trans people . Personal: The book features experiences that happened to Jazz as she grew up living as female but physically male . 'I get many emails from a lot of different kids. 'Some people even write that, without me, they would have killed themselves. 'One kid said that they were going to walk into a street full of cars, and they decided not to because they thought of Jazz. 'That shows me I'm doing the right thing by being here and I have to continue moving forward.' Jazz said as a toddler he knew she wanted to be a girl and would unsnap her onsies to make it look like a dress. If people called her a 'good boy' she would correct them, saying she was a good girl. Her parents first decided to seek advice from a pediatrician when she was two years old, after she asked: 'Mommy, when's the good fairy going to come with her magic wand and change, you know, my genitalia?' Three years later, after being diagnosed with Gender Identity Disorder, or Gender Dysphoria, Jazz made the figurative transition from male to female. It was her fifth birthday and her parents let her wear a rainbow-colored one-piece swimsuit. She then grew her hair out, pierced her ears, and wore dresses everywhere - even to kindergarten. Doctors prescribed blockers that prevented the growth of body hair and the development of other masculine characteristics as Jazz started to go through puberty. Then an estrogen therapy will allow her body to go through a form of female puberty. She will grow breasts and gain body fat around her hips. Support: The eighth grader has a strong group of friends and family around her . Gorgeous: Jazz said she knew from very wrong that her gender was not a choice, but how she was born . Flashback: Jazz (left) has lived as a female since the age of five, and is seen playing here with her brothers . The final step would be sex reassignment surgery, but most doctors will not perform this until the age of consent, 18. With four years to go, Jazz is now focusing on how she can help others go through what she did. I Am Jazz features the story of Jazz's journey to understanding her true, accompanied with illustrations. 'I have a girl brain but a boy body,' Jazz says in the book. 'This is called transgender. I was born this way!' The experiences continue, from that first doctors appointment, to the rainbow swimsuit, up to the problems she had a school over what bathroom to use. Her school had insisted she go to the one in the nurse's office. The project, along with all of Jazz's endeavors, has the full support of her family, especially mom Jeanette Jennings. 'Trans kids are like other kids,' Jeanette told The Houston Chronicle last month. Groundbreaking: I Am Jazz is believed to be the first book aimed at transgender children . 'But a lot of times Jazz sits at lunch in school and people move away from her. 'She's still a human being. 'I'm hoping kids will embrace that. 'Let's get to them before they hear the negativity, and it won't be a big deal. 'Nobody says it's wrong to be autistic. 'It isn't wrong to be transgender. 'Being unique is pretty cool.' All the proceeds from the book will go to the TransKids Purple Rainbow Foundation, which Jazz's mother and father, Greg, started in 2007 to support trans children and challenge discrimination against them. Informative: The narrative moves through the experiences that actually happened to Jazz, such as being diagnosed with Gender Identity Disorder . Natural: Jazz said she hopes to show people that being trans is not a choice but a natural progression .","Jazz Jennings, 14, was born male but has lived as a female since she was five-years-old .

"Former NBA star Dennis Rodman has held tryouts for a North Korean basketball team while on a visit to the communist state. Rodman watched as a few dozen players showed off their skills for a chance to be selected for a match against an American team to mark dictator Kim Jong Un's birthday on January 8. But while Rodman is close to picking 12 Korean players for the game - who will each receive two new pairs of shoes - he admits he's struggling to convince some of the Americans to come. Former Chicago Bulls star Dennis Rodman has held tryouts in North Korea for a basketball team to play a match against former NBA athletes to mark dictator Kim Jong Un's birthday . Rodman spent his first day in the secretive state watching a few dozen local players show off their skills . Speaking after the tryouts, Rodman said: 'You know, they're still afraid to come here, but I'm just telling them, you know, don't be afraid man, it's all love, it's all love here. 'I understand what's going on with the political stuff, and I say, I don't go into that venture, I'm just doing one thing for these kids here, and for this country, and for my country, and for the world pretty much.' Wearing a pink button-down shirt and puffing on a cigar, Rodman asked one player, Kim Un Chol, why he liked basketball. Chol said it was because he had seen it on TV and knew it was a favourite of Kim Jong Un and his father Kim Jong Il. When Rodman asked the other players if they felt the same, they all nodded with enthusiasm. While Rodman is close to picking his starting 12 for the match, he admits he's struggling to convince the Americans to come as they fear for their safety . Wearing a pink shirt and puffing on a cigar Rodman explained to the players that if they get picked they will each be given two new pairs of shoes . In the spirit of unity the January 8 match will be played with Americans verses Koreans for one half, but with mixed teams for the second half . 'I want you guys to do one thing for your leader,' Rodman then told them. 'It's his birthday. It's a very special, special day for the country.' It is less than a week since Kim's powerful uncle was dragged from office and executed, but Rodman has refused to comment on the issue, or on the detention of American Kenneth Bae for allegedly committing anti-state crimes. Instead his focus has been on sport and the basketball game which he hopes will be without political or nationalistic undertones. In aid of that goal, North Korea will play against America in the first half, but for the second half the teams will be mixed. Rodman has said he will not ask his 'good friend' Kim about the execution of his uncle just over a week ago . When Rodman asked the players why they liked the sport they all agreed it was because it was favoured by their leader and his father, Kim Jong Il . Rodman added: 'It's not about win or loss. It's about one thing - unite two countries.' If all goes well Rodman says he will be planning another game in July. Rodman, 52, a former Chicago Bulls player, has been fiercely criticised by both Americans and North Koreans for his relationship with Kim who has imprisoned and murdered thousands of his own impoverished citizens. The bizarre friendship between the two which began while Rodman was filming an HBO series about the Harlem Globetrotters in February. Dennis Keith Rodman was born on May 13, 1961, in Trenton, New Jersey. His father left home while he was young, and according to his website his mother disowned him after he was accused of stealing watches while working as a janitor at Dallas-Fort Worth Airport. However in his late teens Rodman found success as a basketball player and quickly established himself as one of the NBA's most unique talents. He famously spent a period of his life cross-dressing, appearing at various celebrity events dressed in women's clothing, and decided to hold several interviews from inside gay bars. He had high-profile relationships with Madonna and actress Carmen Electra, before deciding to settle down Rodman-style by marrying himself while wearing a white silk dress. He also became very well known for his numerous tattoos, facial piercings and multicolored hair. However following retirement Rodman had a series of high-profile court appearances with his ex-wife Michelle over refusal to pay several hundred thousand dollars of child support. He was also sentenced to 104 hours of community service in May 2012. Since then he has become an unlikely quasi-political figure, appearing at the Vatican after the retirement of Emeritus Pope Benedict to try and elect the world's first black Pope, before striking up a weird and much-criticised friendship with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. Rodamn met the communist leader in February this year while filming an HBO show about the Harlem Globetrotters and has since visited the secretive state several times. Despite his insistence that he will not involve himself in diplomacy, he referred to Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton as 'a**holes' after one visit in which he failed to convince his 'good friend' Kim to 'do me a solid' and release American prisoner Kenneth Bae.","Dennis Rodman has spent his first day in North Korea holding basketball tryouts .

Loading up: Crew members receiving medical supplies to deliver aboard the ship. Today the WHO said the spread of the disease in Europe was 'unavoidable' after the diagnosis of Spanish nurse Teresa Romero . Critical: Crew members aboard the 18,000-tonne ship received boxes labelled 'urgent medical supplies' Crew members received boxes labelled 'urgent medical supplies' today as the 18,000-tonne Royal Fleet Auxilliary ship prepared to deliver vital equipment as part of Operation Gritrock. The 574ft floating hospital, which carries 80 personnel, can be 'uniquely tailored to deliver cutting-edge treatment afloat' according to the Ministry of Defence. It has more than 40 medical and surgical specialities and is manned by crew members from the MOD's hospital units and Royal Marine Band Service. Its facilities include a full emergency department, resuscitation and surgical facilities, a radiology suite with a CT scanner, a critical care unit, a high dependency unit and a 70-bed general ward. Once the ship is off the coast of west Africa, personnel will help train doctors and nurses as well as running treatment centres, with 200 military staff set to run a WHO-led training centre. Once the ship is off the coast of west Africa, personnel will help train doctors and nurses at treatment centres . Base: The ship will also support three helicopters as they move people and supplies to hard-to-reach areas . Preparations: Crew members in Falmouth today. Liberia has been by far the worst-affected country in the disease's deadliest ever outbreak, with 2,316 deaths compared to 930 in Sierra Leone and 778 in Guinea . The government says the training is vital - as among the 4,000-plus people who have died of Ebola, more than 230 have been doctors and nurses struggling to treat people with the disease. The ship will also be a forward base for the three Merlin helicopters, whose aircrew and engineers from 820 Naval Air Squadron will ensure 'the rapid movement of key personnel to areas where they are required', a Navy spokesman said. Troops, meanwhile, will help build a treatment centre in Sierra Leone's Kerry Town to help meet the British government's target of providing 700 new beds in the region. A spokesman said: 'This package will further support the country’s stretched public health services in containing the disease by helping up to nearly 8,800 patients over a 6-month period.' Liberia has been by far the worst-affected country in the outbreak, with 2,316 deaths compared to 930 in Sierra Leone and 778 in Guinea. The number of deaths dwarfs the previous most deadly outbreak, which killed 280 people in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 1976. Precaution: A funeral yesterday near Sierra Leone's capital Freetown. Many people contracted the disease by handling bodies of loved ones, and more than 230 of the 4,000-plus deaths have been of health workers . Unstoppable: Health authorities have warned it could be difficult to halt the disease if it is not contained soon . Today the WHO said the spread of the disease in Europe was 'unavoidable' after the diagnosis of Spanish nurse Teresa Romero. She became the first European to contract the disease outside west Africa after coming into contact with 75-year-old Spanish missionary Miguel Pajares, who was flown home for treatment and later died. 'Such imported cases and similar events as have happened in Spain will happen also in the future, most likely,' said WHO's European director Zsuzsanna Jakab. 'It is quite unavoidable... that such incidents will happen in the future because of the extensive travel both from Europe to the affected countries and the other way around.' Defence secretary Michael Fallon said it was vital that Britain helped the international fight against the disease. International aid: A U.S. soldier in training practices the decontamination process at Fort Campbell, Kentucky . The current outbreak, the deadliest since the virus (pictured) emerged in 1976, has killed about half its victims . 'The Ebola outbreak in west Africa is already a global threat to public health and it’s vital that the UK remains at the forefront of responding to the epidemic,' he said after a meeting of the Cobra emergency committee. 'We are stepping up significantly the UK's contribution and leadership in work to tackle the outbreak on land, in the air and at sea. 'At the heart of the package is the commitment to provide more than 750 personnel to help with the establishment of Ebola treatment centres and an Ebola training academy. 'We are deploying troops, helicopters and a ship – army medics and Merlin helicopters supported by RFA Argus – to provide direct support and reassurance.","Ship will sail fully-stocked to West Africa as part of Operation Gritrock .

"Hard task: Shares plunged again today after Tesco's Dave Lewis pledged to turn the supermarket around but kept the plan secret . Tesco's shares plunged again this morning after its new boss refused to reveal how he would tackle the biggest crisis in its 95-year history. The supermarket giant yesterday revealed half-year profits slumped by 91.9 per cent and its £263million accounting scandal was even worse than predicted. The news triggered another dramatic slump in Tesco shares, which closed down 12p at £1.71, and they have continued to dive-bomb today. This morning they were available for £1.65 but a year ago they were worth £3.70, meaning Tesco has had £4billion wiped off its stock market value in just 12 months. Millions of customers have switched to budget rivals like Aldi and Lidl or high-end Waitrose and Marks and Spencer because Tesco has failed to deliver on price, service or quality, . But CEO Dave Lewis yesterday refused to be drawn on what he would do to win back shoppers. He said: 'Everybody's been saying to me, 'Dave, when are you going to reveal your strategy – when is there going to be an announcement about what you're going to do?' And I won't be doing that because strategies are constantly evolving. 'So, there won't be an announcement of Tesco's new strategy. That will be for me and the management teams only.' He did say though he would 'begin the long journey of rebuilding trust and transparency in the business and the brand.” He added: 'As of today, we draw a line under the accounting issue. We dealt with it completely and then we start again in terms of looking at the business going forward.' Trouble: Tesco profits have fallen by 91 per cent yesterday after the supermarket announced falling sales and a £250million accounting scandal . Bloodbath: This graph shows how Tesco's shares have plummeted in the past two days, dropping to a rock bottom price of £1.65 . Tesco chairman Sir Richard Broadbent also ran for cover yesterday to try to dodge questions about the crisis. He raced out of a briefing with journalists amid high emotions and crashing furniture when challenged to defend the 92 per cent slump in profits. Extraordinary: Tesco's share price was at just under £4 18 months ago but now it is around £1.65 . Sir Richard - who quit the company yesterday - denied any wrongdoing or failures before escaping through a door that was then barred by a company minder. He stormed out of the press briefing when Channel 4 News economics correspondent, Paul Mason, asked: ‘Why should anyone put up with this level of incompetence running a major company?’ Mr Lewis then told reporters: ‘I don’t think the business is in a big hole. I am really very hopeful that we can get Tesco back to be the force that it has been.’ Chief executive Philip Clarke quit in the summer, with Dave Lewis parachuted in last month as the new CEO. Chief finance officer Laurie McIlwee left in April and has only just been replaced. Tesco is already reeling from the suspension of eight senior executives amid allegations that profits for the first half of the year were artificially inflated by £250million. Yesterday it emerged that the true scale of the black hole was £263million, with the problem dating back to 2012. Tesco also revealed that pre-tax profits for the six months to August 23 plummeted from £1.39billion last year to just £112million, with like-for-like sales down 4.6 per cent as families switch to budget rivals such as Aldi and Lidl. Running for cover: Departing Tesco chairman Sir Richard Broadbent raced out of a press briefing yesterday . Stark: Tesco was considered untouchable but its profit fall in the past year has been unprecedented . Sir Richard, 61, who will leave his £625,000-a-year post next year, refused to accept that he or the board had failed, insisting: 'I think the company has been well governed'. But he added: 'The issues that have come to light over recent weeks are a matter of profound regret.' He stormed out of the press briefing when Channel 4 News economics correspondent, Paul Mason, asked: 'Why should anyone put up with this level of incompetence running a major company?' Mr Lewis then told reporters: 'I don't think the business is in a big hole. I am really very hopeful that we can get Tesco back to be the force that it has been.' Tesco also announced that it is suspending multi-million-pound 'golden goodbye' bonuses for Mr Clarke and Mr McIlwee. Mr Clarke was due to receive 18 months' pay – £1.7 million – plus deferred share awards worth up to £5million. Mr McIlwee was due £971,000 pay and deferred share awards of up to £3million. Battle of the supermarkets: Tesco is by far the largest supermarket in Britain, but it is losing market share to its rivals, especially cheaper supermarkets like Aldi and Lidl .","Tesco is in crisis as millions of customers have left for its UK rivals .

"A simple chemical found in strawberries and apples could reduce the damage to the heart in the aftermath of an attack . Survival rates after a heart attack or stroke could be significantly boosted after a breakthrough by British scientists. A simple chemical found in strawberries and apples could reduce the damage to the heart in the aftermath of an attack. A team led by doctors and biologists at Cambridge University think that if the substance is injected following an attack, it could reduce long-term injury to vital organs. The breakthrough, published in the journal Nature tonight, came about after the team established the mechanism by which damage is done to organs after a heart attack or stroke. While much of the harm is suffered during the attack itself, injury is also done when blood floods back into the organs afterwards. When surgeons clear the clot that caused the attack - a process vital for survival - blood and oxygen rushes back into the heart or brain, in a process called reperfusion. Doctors have long been frustrated by the fact that by saving the patient’s life, they do further damage to the body. But until now that process had been a mystery. The new study, carried out on computer models and confirmed in mice, revealed that the damage is done by a chemical called succinate which occurs naturally in the body. The researchers, from Cambridge, Kings College London, University College London and Glasgow University, found that succinate builds up to abnormally high levels in tissue starved of oxygen during an attack. When the blood flow returns, the succinate interacts with oxygen, combing to release destructive new molecules which kill off cells in the heart or other organs. The injury means that in months and years after a heart attack, there is an increased risk of heart failure or other problems. Crucially, the researchers discovered they could reduce organ damage in mice by injecting simple chemicals called malonate esters. Injected during the treatment of a stroke or heart attack, the chemical could stop the build-up of succinate and the resulting release of destructive molecules. Malonate esters are cheap, readily available and are found naturally in fruits such as strawberries, apples and grapes, although not in high enough volumes to be beneficial by eating alone. Dr Michael Murphy of Cambridge University said: ‘This research explains how organ damage occurs during the first few minutes of restoring blood supply after a heart attack or stroke and, importantly, how to stop this damage. A team led by doctors and biologists at Cambridge University think that if the substance is injected following an attack, it could reduce long-term injury to vital organs . ‘We have used simple chemicals found in everyday fruits like apples and grapes that had never been suspected as being therapeutically useful before. Amazingly, these chemicals worked very well.’ Professor Peter Weissberg, medical director at the British Heart Foundation, which funded the study, said: ‘We have no way of knowing how much damage is caused during a heart attack and how much during reperfusion. 'But it is a reasonable assumption to say that if we could reduce reperfusion damage we could reduce the risk of later heart failure. ‘There are reasons to be optimistic that we could see this move quickly towards a treatment now that the basic findings have been made. ‘Drugs companies are certainly very interested and we could see clinical trials within a few years.’ ENDS .","Chemical found in strawberries and apples could reduce damage to the heart in the aftermath of an attack .

"It is a timely reminder that nature still often has the edge over technology. A drone owner in Cambridge was flying from his quadcopter when a hungry hawk passed nearby. Unintimidated, the hawk attacks - and downs the drone in one fell swoop. Scroll down for video . Look out! The moment a hawk attacks a drone over a Cambridge park, bringing it to the ground - although both parties eventually escaped unscathed. The incredible video was filmed over Magazine Beach Park in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Software developer Christopher Schmidt has been taking his Phantom FC40 quadcopter drone out into public areas to fly it around the skies, and often uploads footage to his YouTube channel. To capture 1080p video during his weekly flights, Schmidt uses a GoPro Hero 3+ Black attached to his quadcopter drone. However, last weeks flight took an unusual turn. 'I was flying my quadcopter at Magazine Beach Park in Cambridge, when a hawk decided he wasn't too happy with my invasion of his airspace,' Schmidt said. As the bird gets closers, its talons get ready to 'hit' the drone . After the attack, the drone falls to the ground, and the hawk flies off . The GoPro camera captured the hawk swooping in from above and slamming into the drone. In the video, the drone is filmed falling to the ground where it lands upside down on a grassy area of the park. 'As far as I could tell, the hawk came out unscathed, and having defeated his prey, was happy to retreat,' Schmidt said. 'As soon as he flew at me, I throttled down the props to try to minimize any harm to the bird. 'The quadcopter came out unscathed as well.'","Drone was attacked mid flight by hawk as its owner was recording video .

"A child was pulled out of a middle-school history class in Massachusetts by his father because his class was going to discuss Islam. Anthony Giannino reacted after seeing a section in a Revere Public Schools worksheet describing the Islamic call to prayer, part of which  states, 'I bear witness that there is no God but Allah'. He said he pulled his son out of class because his family didn't believe in Allah and he didn't think his child needed to learn about him at school. A child was pulled out of a middle-school history class in Massachusetts by his father because his class was going to discuss Islam; the parent had seen a section in a Revere Public Schools worksheet describing the Islamic call to prayer, part of which states, 'I bear witness that there is no God but Allah' In an interview with WHDH-TV Mr Giannino said: 'No religion should be taught at school. In their paper it says Allah is their only God. That's insulting to me as a Christian who believes in just Jesus only.' Revere Public School has said that Mr Giannino's son had been out of the class since he complained earlier this month, and as a result would likely receive an incomplete in his history course. Revere Public Schools Superintendent Paul Dakin told the Huffington Post that the school was teaching history, not religion, and that Massachusetts requires middle schools to cover such topics. Following Mr Giannino's complaint Mr Dakin sent a letter to parents in which he described 'misinformation circulating about the teaching of religion in our middle school social studies classrooms'. The letter details what subjects are taught during what years - World History is taught in grade 8 - and said all of the classwork was based on Massachusetts Curriculum Frameworks. It said: 'These documents identify the specific learning standards and concepts and skills for each grade level and each content area.' And goes on to say that 'no religion is taught with the purpose of converting students to that religion, insulting their own religious beliefs, or promoting the beliefs of one religion as superior to the beliefs of another'. Mr Dakin told the Huffington Post that it would be impossible to teach history accurately without explaining the importance of religious faith. If schools had to 'purge all the religion out of all the history we teach,' he said, 'we wouldn't be able to talk about the Pilgrims or Plymouth, ... about why they were coming [to America] because of religious beliefs.'","Anthony Giannino took exception to his son learning about Allah .

"The family of a woman who died in a New Orleans jail after being tied to a bed for four hours have settled their lawsuit for $600,000. Cayne Miceli, 43, was booked into Orleans Parish Prison on January 4, 2009, for allegedly biting a security guard during at the Tulane Medical Center earlier that day. With a history of chronic asthma, panic attacks and depression, Miceli was put in five-point restraints on a bed. The prison knew she had been hospital for breathing difficulties, however left Miceli restrained, the lawsuit claimed. Four hours later she was found to be not breathing, according to The New Orleans Times-Picayune. Death in custody: Cayne Miceli, 43, died after being placed in five-point restraints in Orleans Parish Prison in January 2009. She stopped breathing and never regained consciousness . Controversial: The five-point restraint system, pictured here, has been removed from many prisons, but was still in practice at Orleans Parish Prison when Miceli was booked in . Paying up: Sheriff Marlin Gusman agreed to the sum to end the wrongful death lawsuit brought by the family of Cayne Miceli. However Gusman has not admitted any wrongdoing in the case . Scene: Some 44 inmates - not including Miceli - have died at the Orleans Parish Prison in the last nine years . By the time an ambulance arrived Miceli had been without a pulse for 25 minutes. She never regained consciousness and was put on life support. Miceli then died in hospital on January 6, 2009. The wrongful death lawsuit brought by her family in 2010 said Miceli voluntarily admitted herself to hospital after suffering a severe asthma attack. However when doctors tried to discharge her several hours later, Miceli, who insisted she needed more treatment, panicked and fought with hospital personnel, the lawsuit said, according to The Times-Picayune. Miceli was accused of biting the ankles of a hospital security guard. She was then booked on municipal charges of disturbing the peace, resisting arrest and battery on an officer and taken to the jail. The federal lawsuit claimed that jail staff didn't provide adequate medical care to Miceli and caused her death with the restraints. However the  DA's office determined there was no criminal wrongdoing by staff at the Orleans Parish Prison. Cayne Miceli, 43, of New Orleans, died in hospital on January 6, 2009. She is seen here as a young woman . The prison's sheriff, Marlin Gusman, has now agreed to settle for $600,000 in three separate payments, the last of which is due on September 15, 2016. The agreement was signed on October 1. However Gusman's office has not admitted to any wrongdoing as part of the settlement. Miceli is one of 44 inmates to die in the last nine years at the Orleans Parish Prison. However, her death is not officially counted in the tally because she died in hospital. The Miceli family lawsuit was one of at least six filed against the office by relatives of dead inmates, The Times-Picayune reported.","Cayne Miceli, 43, died after being placed in five-point restraints in Orleans Parish Prison in January 2009 .

"It's the little things that really make a difference to Britons' happiness, according to a new survey. And results show it's small perks, like the extra hour in bed we'll all got today, that make 93 per cent of us happy. Topping the list  is receiving a compliment, with more than two thirds (68 per cent) of Britons saying a kind word is the best pick-me-up to their week. More than two thirds of Britons (66 per cent) are planning a guiltless lie-in on . This is closely followed by receiving an unexpected gift (65 per cent) and sunny days (59 per cent). More than a third (36 per cent) of Britons count having a lie in as one of the little things that make them happy, with more ladies (40 per cent) than men (31 per cent) looking forward to some extra shut-eye. In fact, more than two thirds of Britons (66 per cent) enjoyed a guiltless lie-in today. Almost a quarter (23 per cent) agreed that it's the ability of the unexpected little gesture or treat to brighten their day that makes them special - giving us a break from the humdrum of daily life. And us Britons are kinder than we realise - one in five claim to get one little pick-me-up a day (21 per cent), while for a quarter (25 per cent), the last time they received a small gesture was just a week ago. Furthermore, women are much more responsive to the little things, as opposed to grand gestures. Climbing into fresh sheets is a real treat for 65 per cent of women . Climbing into fresh sheets is a real treat for 65 per cent of women, compared to 42 per cent men. Not surprisingly, the one small thing men get more excited about than women is having an alcoholic beverage with almost half of males (40 per cent) admitting this cheers them up versus just 29 per cent of women. The research also revealed the happiest region is Edinburgh and incidentally its residents are also the ones most looking forward to a lie-in when the clocks go back this weekend (74 per cent). The least happy city in the UK is Newcastle, where only 14 per cent benefit from a little gesture from a friend of loved one every day. Almost half the nation (48 per cent) wish they had more time in the day, despite one in three admitting they'll be doing nothing at all with the extra hour over the weekend (37 per cent). However, when asked what they could do with an extra hour in the day, a quarter would exercise (25 per cent) and worryingly, more people would choose to spend more time with friends (21 per cent) than family (18 per cent), with only 6 per cent admitting they'd play with their kids. A spokesperson for multi-channel store QVC, which commissioned the research, said: 'It's interesting to see that it's is the small things which really count and that an unexpected gift is one of the things most likely to make someone happy.

"The Canadian man who killed and . dismembered a Chinese student in 2012 was raised by a domineering mother who would get drunk on vodka and was obsessed with germs, the man's father testified on Friday, while . describing himself as an alcoholic schizophrenic. Luka Magnotta, 32, has admitted killing and dismembering . engineering student Jun Lin, 33, and to videotaping the acts and . mailing parts of the body to several addresses. He is pleading . not guilty due to mental illness. The 50-year-old father is a tall, heavyset man from Ontario who cannot be named because of a court-ordered publication ban. Triggers: Luka Magnotta, 32, the Canadian man who killed and dismembered a Chinese student in 2012 had a troubled childhood, his father testified on Friday . He told the jury in a Montreal courtroom that Magnotta and . Magnotta's younger brother and sister were taught at home by his . ex-wife, Anna Yourkin. He said the children had no friends and . never played with children their own age. 'She was very clingy,' he said of his ex-wife. 'She wanted . to have total control over them.' Murdered: Jun Lin was a Chinese exchange student in Montreal, who once dated Magnotta. A video shows him being horribly mutilated and partially eaten . Trail: Pieces of Jun Lin were discovered more than 2,800 miles apart after Magnotta dropped his lover's dismembered limbs in the post . Yourkin was a heavy drinker who had such a phobia of germs . that she would not let the children use public washrooms, . instead making them wait until they got home, the father said. 'They were very mixed-up kids and they still are,' he told . the court. The prosecutor in the case says Magnotta had planned to kill a person for at least six months before the crime was committed,and that he had emailed a British journalist in 2011 saying he planned to kill and videotape the act. The court has seen a video of the killing and dismemberment which added a suggestion of cannibalism to what is considered one of Canada's grisliest murder trials. Gory: Police  discovered  blood stains inside Magnotta's Montreal apartment fridge . Evidence: Other bloodied items were discovered at his home including this T-shirt . Graphic: This heavily blood-stained mattress was discovered at the crime scene . After the killing, Magnotta sent body parts from Montreal to . two elementary schools in Vancouver and to two political parties . in Ottawa, wrapping the hands and feet in pink tissue paper and . including poems and notes. Magnotta was the subject of an international . manhunt. He was arrested in a Berlin Internet cafe, where he . was reading about himself. Magnotta's father said he and Yourkin got married at age 17 and 16, respectively, when Yourkin got pregnant with Magnotta. They named the baby Eric Clinton Kirk Newman after actors Clint Eastwood and Kirk Douglas. Weapon: Another photo of a knife was entered into evidence during the high profile Canadian murder trial . Wrapped: Jurors were shown pieces of pink tissue paper which Magnotta used to wrap up Lin's body parts . Chaos: Police found a number of knives and protective Nitrile gloves while searching the crime scene . Magnotta, who later changed his name, grew up moving from . town to town in Ontario and spent much of his childhood with an . abusive maternal grandmother, the father said. He said Magnotta started school in Grade 6 - when children . are typically aged 11 or 12 - after the family was forced to . move because they could no longer pay their mortgage. The father, who said he lost two jobs because of his own . drinking problems, added he was opposed to Magnotta being . educated at home, but worked long hours and deferred to his . wife. He said he later managed to quit drinking and realized he . had a psychiatric problem. 'I heard voices, I felt like . (committing) suicide,' he said.

"Comments released by North Korean state media describe South Korean president Park Geun-hye as 'a repulsive wench' A North Korean citizen has attacked the president of South Korea, Park Geun-hye, branding her a 'repulsive wench' who has failed to marry or bear children. The brutal denunciation, which goes far beyond previous criticism, was published by North Korea deepening the animosity amid growing tensions on the world's most militarised border. The KCNA news agency carried what it said were comments by a private citizen criticising Park's offer last week to help the impoverished North's women and children as 'foul-smelling vituperation uttered by human scum'. 'Park Geun-hye is but an unseemly wench who has never had a chance to marry or bear a child,' the citizen, Kim Un Kyong, was quoted as saying by KCNA. He said, Park had no right to talk about the children of North Korea. 'A repulsive wench such as Park Geun-hye is an incoherent existence who has long given up trying to be a woman of Korea and who makes a mockery of sacred motherhood, mad with the pursuit of national confrontation,' he added. North Korea tightly controls the content of its media, frequently dominated by articles lionising past and present leaders. Dispatches often quote people said to be private citizens or obscure foreign groups to attack the South and the United States. North Korea has steadily raised the level of insult against Park in recent weeks, after accusing the South of breaking an agreement to work to improve ties by stopping statements slandering of each others' leaders. Late last month, a North Korean agency that handles ties with the South criticised Park's comments at a summit with U.S. President Barack Obama and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe calling on Pyongyang to abandon its nuclear programme. North Korea accused the South of 'gangster-like' behaviour after the South returned a fishing boat that had strayed into its waters last week near a tense disputed naval border. It then fired more than 500 artillery rounds off its shore on Monday, landing more than 100 in South Korea's waters. The South responded by firing back 300 rounds into the North's waters. The KCNA news agency carried what it said were comments by a private citizen criticising Park's offer last week to help the impoverished North's women and children as 'foul-smelling vituperation uttered by human scum' Kim Jong-Un's North Korea tightly controls the content of its media, which is frequently dominated by articles lionising past and present leaders .","Brutal denunciation goes far beyond previous criticism of Park Geun-hye .

"The level of hate towards Wayne Rooney in this country rocketed to record highs this weekend, with bizarre calls for him to be stripped of the Manchester United captaincy following his red card against West Ham. These people making such suggestions must be small children or they have short memories. I can’t remember them demanding Roy Keane to be burned at the stake when he saw red as United captain. Keane described himself as a 'psycho' with 'veins bulging' as he berated a referee. Yet Rooney, according to the critics, is not a United captain because he shouts at team-mates who make mistakes. Can you imagine how Keane would have torn into that United defence at Leicester? Sends a shudder down the spine. Wayne Rooney walks off the pitch after being sent off during the match against West Ham on Saturday . Referee Lee Mason shows Rooney a red card after his foul on Stewart Downing at Old Trafford . Here’s the truth: Rooney is a working class kid who’s made something of himself, he’s an achiever, he’s a success story. Some can’t handle that. It could be a class-hate thing, it could be jealousy. Maybe it’s because he plays for Manchester United. Whatever the reason, it is clear that Wayne Rooney can break whatever record he wants for his club, he can win all sorts of medals, but the haters are still going to hate him. I suspect Rooney couldn’t care less what these people think. When he becomes United’s record goalscorer he can laugh in everyone’s face. Roy Keane is sent off by referee David Elleray during United's match against Blackburn in August 1995 . But Rooney does care about England; given the level of criticism he has received during his international career he could almost be forgiven for walking away form some of the nonsense that’s been said and written about him. But he still craves international football. And if he cares what the haters think of him, then there is only one way he can turn them around. And that’s to become the first England captain to lift a meaningful trophy. In France in 2016, it will be 50 years since England won the World Cup. We are all such strangers to success for England it seems unthinkable. Rooney celebrates scoring for England during the friendly against Norway at Wembley earlier this month . Rooney attends a press conference to announce a new club partnership with Abengoa on Monday . But for Wayne Rooney to lead England to European Championship glory would surely shut his critics up. He’s started his England captaincy in perfect fashion. Two games, two wins, no goals conceded. As a dedicated England fan I want the captain of our great country to know I’m on his side. Like our Manchester United Facebook page.","Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney was sent off during the club's 2-1 Premier League victory over West Ham on Saturday .

"The pressure is getting to Arsene Wenger. So much so he’s become a poor man’s Alan Pardew. It’s funny how Pardew was castigated for headbutting someone on the touchline, yet if Wenger charges towards an opposition manger and pushes him in the chest with both hands during a game, he gets away with it. Does the Frenchman get away with it because he’s been in the job for a long time? Because he’s untouchable? Because of the ridiculous amount of respect afforded to him by seemingly everyone in the game? Arsene Wenger (left) shoves Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho during his side's 2--0 defeat on Sunday . Newcastle manager Alan Pardew headbutts Hull midfielder David Meyler back in March . A two-handed shove may not be as aggressive, or as likely to cause injury as a headbutt. But it is still an unprovoked act of aggression which brings the great name of Arsenal into disrepute, and sets a terrible example. Yet the board have so far failed to offer any kind of statement condemning the incident, or sanctioning their manager. Three red cards in four Champions League games this season should be enough for Arsene Wenger to take a look in the mirror. If he ever bothered to do that, he’d realise that starting a ruck with Jose Mourinho on the touchline at Stamford Bridge will in no way help Arsenal achieve better results. It seems the Arsenal manager is more bothered about his own personal duels these days than boring stuff like tactics and team selection. Arsenal's players look dejected on their way to defeat at Stamford Bridge on Sunday . What kind of message does Wenger’s aggression send to the players? Are they laughing at this manager trying to start a fight he can never win because he’s up against a far sharper operator? Or are they thinking that they need to start getting physical with the opposition, roughing them up, pushing them without provocation? Arsenal used to be a club that prided itself on its discipline: to some Herbert Chapman is still the greatest manager in the club’s history – he’s the only Gunners’ manager with a statue outside the Emirates stadium so far. Chapman believed in a “code of conduct,” and even sacked a player, Tommy Black, on the bus home after conceding a penalty in a cup tie at Walsall in 1933. Chapman even refused to allow Black back into Highbury to collect his boots. Legendary Arsenal manager Herbert Chapman was known for setting high standards of his players . Heaven knows what Chapman would make of the current Arsenal manager shoving his opposite number in the chest during a game. It’s a new low for a once great manager. Wenger is becoming a specialist in spoiling his legacy.","Arsene Wenger shoved Jose Mourinho on the touchline on Sunday .

"Here’s something you will never hear: West Ham manager Sam Allardyce saying anything which might be misconstrued as negative about his captain Kevin Nolan. These two are inseparable, - they’ve served each other very well in their careers. But on Saturday they ganged up together like the school bullies. I don’t think these two realise the damage they’ve potentially done. Kevin Nolan (right) reacts after his goal is disallowed for offside at Manchester United on Saturday . West Ham manager Sam Allardyce (right) shouts instructions to his players during the 2-1 defeat . I was at Old Trafford on Saturday and I could see how frustrated Nolan was when his late goal was ruled out for offside. This is a Liverpool fan scoring an equaliser at Manchester United remember – that flag must have sliced right through Nolan’s heart. But that doesn’t give him or Sam the right to then behave like social media trolls, encouraging at best ridicule and at worst venom from the West Ham fans towards officials. Allardyce said the official 'dropped a massive bo**ock'. For a start, that is no way for the manager of a great club like West Ham to be speaking in a post-match press conference. Secondly, the linesman’s decision was correct, so if a bo**ock was dropped, it was Sam who dropped it. Nolan puts the ball into the net at Old Trafford but the goal is disallowed for offside . Assistant referee Andrew Garratt raises his  flag and rules out Nolan's second-half goal for offside . Nolan said the linesman 'gambled'. That’s a hell of an accusation – and I would dare to suggest Nolan will be a lucky man if the official decides not to seek an apology for such a slur on his professionalism. Nolan then dropped his own 'bo**ock' by saying that the official 'can’t have seen it, because if he had seen it he wouldn’t have given offside'. It’s a worry that a Premier League manager and a Premier League captain do not know the laws of the game of football. And it’s a disgrace when the pair of them team up like a pair of sneaky ill-informed grasses to ridicule an official, and accuse him of guessing at decisions. Allardyce (right) shakes hands with Manchester United manager Louis van Gall before the match . Allardyce scoffed at the decision, saying if Nolan’s head was offside then the linesman must be 'superhuman' with 'x-ray vision'. No Sam, it was just someone doing his job brilliantly.

"The astrologer who guided Ronald Reagan through every major decision of his presidency has died at the age of 87. Joan Quigley was consulted on everything from the Soviet Union to Air Force One's flight schedules. Before any crucial decision, the president was known to mutter: 'What does Joan say?' She was, White House sources claim, the administration's 'best kept secret'. Influence: Joan Quigley, who has died at the age of 87, advised President Reagan on key decisions . 'What does Joan say?' The president was known to utter those words during all crucial discussions . Quigley took up the extraordinary role in 1981 after Nancy Reagan contacted her following John Hinckley's assassination attempt on her husband. They had met in 1970 on the Merv Griffin Show where Quigley, a socialite from Kansas City, was a regular guest, alongside writing magazine columns under the pseudonym Angel Star. Evidently impressed, the First Lady put her on a $3,000-a-month retainer and installed her own private lines at the White House and Camp David. 'Sometimes I would talk with Nancy for three hours a day,' Quigley said in 1995. It was a position Quigley - an avid Republican - had fantasized about for years after reading President Reagan's stars. 'He had the most brilliant horoscope I'd ever seen in this country in this century,' she told The Washington Post in 1988. Starstruck: Quigley had fantasized about the role after seeing Reagan had the best horoscope she'd ever read . Called to duty: She was put on a $3,000-a-month retainer in the wake of the 1981 assassination attempt . Soon she was quietly influencing pivotal decisions, with direct lines installed at the White House and Camp David. She told Reagan to stop seeing the Soviet Union as 'evil' - supposedly a gem of advice that inspired the president to soften his stance on the region. 'At the time, they were thinking of the Russians as gangsters,' Quigley said. 'I told Nancy that Gorbachev was a different kind of leader, and that he would share a vision with Reagan.' Quigley's secret position lasted until she was outed in 1988 by former chief of staff Donald Reagan. As the world reeled in shock, Quigley insisted that she was a 'serious, scientific astrologer.' Dazzling career: She was a regular on the Merv Griffin Show and wrote horoscope columns for magazines . Fateful meeting: She was introduced to the First Lady by Merv Griffin and evidently impressed her . 'I am really not one of these clowns, and I really don't like this circus atmosphere,' she told the Associated Press in 1988. In the years that followed, the former First Couple downplayed Quigley's role. Nancy Reagan wrote in her memoir that she was in touch with Quigley but the president was more reticent. The president became aware of the consultations, she said, and warned his wife to be careful because it might look odd if it came out. 'If it makes you feel better, go ahead and do it,' she quoted the president as saying. Close: Quigley said she and Nancy Reagan (left) would speak on the phone up to three times a day. She was outed in 1988 (pictured right) by a former chief of staff and became a worldwide sensation . Quigley died on October 21 at her San Francisco home after an unspecified illness, the San Francisco Chronicle said on Friday. 'Joan was many many things,' her sister Ruth Quigley told SF Gate on Thursday. 'She was a truly interesting, complex, and remarkable person. And she was a beautiful woman as well. 'Astrology was a very important part of her life, but she also wrote books. She was an art history major in college, and remained extremely knowledgeable about art. She led a remarkable life.'","Joan Quigley advised Ronald and Nancy Reagan between 1981 and 1988 .

"Bid: HMRC chief executive Lin Homer (pictured) has had the power to seize cash wages since 1944 . The taxman has been accused of trying to become ‘all-powerful’ after vastly increasing the amount that can be taken from salaries. HM Revenue & Customs will be able to take up to £17,000 from pay packets – compared to the current limit of £3,000. From April tax codes will be altered for those believed to have underpaid income tax, capital gains tax or National Insurance contributions. The latest power grab follows outrage over proposals by the Treasury to raid bank accounts for unpaid taxes without gaining permission from the courts. Such measures have been called ‘draconian and regressive’ by industry bodies, while others have accused HMRC of acting as ‘judge, jury and executioner’. Yesterday Chas Roy-Chowdhury, head of taxation at the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants, said: ‘This is another creeping of HMRC’s powers, which are skewed in favour of themselves and away from the taxpayers. HMRC is becoming a more confrontational and all-powerful organisation.’ HMRC, headed by Lin Homer, has had the power to seize cash wages since 1944 and the taxman insists any money taken would be spread out over 12 monthly instalments. But accountancy firm Kingston Smith said raising the cap could be seen as ‘a new high in the intrusion of the state into private affairs’. Tax partner Tim Stovold said: ‘These so far overlooked new rules are a continuation of powers being given to HMRC to collect amounts owing to them and will come as a nasty surprise to many.’ George Osborne has announced a raft of measures to reclaim tax in recent months, which will generate billions of pounds for the taxman. The Government recently consulted on the controversial ‘direct recovery of debts’, which would enable unpaid tax to be recovered from bank and building society accounts without going through the courts. Officials want to be able to take funds directly from current accounts, joint accounts or ISAs. They will focus on debtors who owe at least £1,000 and who have been contacted at least four times by HMRC. HM Revenue & Customs will be able to take up to £17,000 from wages,  compared to the current limit of £3,000 . In addition, from next month the Government’s ‘accelerated payment’ rules will be implemented – forcing businesses and individuals to pay disputed tax up front before their cases are heard in court. The Government is consulting on whether these rules should include those thought to be using schemes to avoid inheritance tax. HMRC said the Government held a full consultation on the changes in 2013 and the higher cap would come into effect in April. The limit would be earnings-related and gradually increase from £3,000, depending on salary. This will remain at £3,000 for those earning less than £30,000, but rise to £17,000 for those on more than £90,000. An HMRC spokesman said: ‘Taxpayers welcome the option to have tax debt collected by instalments. This is a long-standing feature of the payroll system and the increase in the threshold will allow more tax debts to be paid in this way.’","HM Revenue & Customs will be able to take up to £17,000 from pay packets .

"North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un is healthy - and ‘there is no doubt about it’, one of the country’s most senior officials has insisted. The Communist regime’s ambassador to the United Kingdom became one of the first to offer a direct answer to increasing questions over the regime’s leader, who has not been seen since September 3. The lack of public appearances by the usually widely-photographed Kim Jong-Un, 32, has led to speculation that he is either ill or even that he has been deposed. A picture released  on 4 September 2014 shows  Kim Jong-un  and his wife Ri Sol-ju watching a performance by the Moranbong Band in Pyongyang. This was the last time the North Korean leader was seen in public . Speculation has been rife that Kim's younger sister Kim Yo-jong (left) is currently running the country . However speaking to the BBC, Ambassador Hyon Hak Bong, said: 'Our respected leader Comrade Kim Jong-Un is healthy, no doubt about it.' But it is unlikely that the assurances  will bring an end to the flurry of rumors surrounding the whereabouts of the North Korean dictator. In the five weeks since Mr Kim was last seen in the state media at a September 3 concert, he has missed several high-profile events that he normally attends. An official documentary released late last month then made a single reference to Mr Kim's 'discomfort' and showed video footage from August of him overweight and limping. Speaking to the BBC, the North Korean ambassador devoted more time to questions about human rights abuses than to the whereabouts of the country's leader. In the five weeks since Mr Kim was last seen in the state media at a September 3 concert, he has missed several high-profile events that he normally attends . He said such allegations of abuses were false and driven by the United States as the country wants to bring down the regime in Pyongyang. The ambassador took particular exception to the idea that there are labor camps in North Korea. He said there are no labor camps and there are no political prisoners. He added that there are institutions which rectify people's behavior through labor but they do not amount to 'labor camps'. Many analysts believe that while Mr Kim may have some health issues, he is probably not in serious trouble . North Koran defectors prepare to release balloons carrying leaflets condemning North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un and his government's policies. One theory is that the dictator has been toppled from power in a political coup and is currently languishing under house arrest - although there is little evidence to show this . He also said US missionary Kenneth Bae was being held in a 'reform institution', which was not the same as a labor camp. Mr Bae was sentenced to 15 years' hard labor in 2013 after he was convicted by North Korea on charges of planning to overthrow the North Korean government. The ambassador said in an email to the BBC: 'We have reform institutions where offenders sentenced to penalty of reform through labour by the relevant laws are held and educated through labour. His sister is in charge: Speculation has been rife that Kim's younger sister Kim Yo-jong is currently running the country . He is under house arrest: A more dramatic possibility is that the dictator has been toppled from power in a political coup and is languishing under house arrest . He 'hurt his leg': Thee have been rumors that Kim is out of action after injuring himself on a military visit or taking part in a military manoeuvre. There is no evidence to back this up, however. He has gout:  Kim's poor health has been the focus of many theories. He is clearly unfit and was last seen limping and overweight. Official North Korean media have cited unspecified personal 'discomfort' as grounds for his absence from public view . He broke his ankle playing basketball: One of the more bizarre theories - spawned from an episode of Saturday Night Live - is that the cause of his mysterious absence is that he broke his ankle 'dunking over Michael Jordan' He is ill due to diabetes, heavy smoking, endocrine problems, 'eating too much cheese': Various other health explanations have been put forward including a number of ailments . He's simply laying low: There is nothing particularly unusual about North Korean leaders stepping out the public eye for extended periods . 'Some Western media interpret them as 'labour camps', but they are reform institutions. 'If I take an example, the place where American citizen Bae Jun Ho (Kenneth Bae) is being held is a reform institution.' But in February the United Nations found  that there were widespread and serious abuses of human rights to be taking place in North Korea. In a recent online post titled 'North Korea Misinformation Bingo', Adam Cathcart, a University of Leeds history lecturer, suggested that the absence of Kim Jong-Un could be North Korea's attempt to change the subject from its human rights abuse . But he later added that there are lots of rumors floating around, and 'most of them are probably wrong'. Many analysts believe that while Kim may have some health issues, he is probably not in serious trouble. But his possible ill-health has led to speculation. Other commentators have noted that there is nothing particularly unusual about North Korean leaders laying low for extended periods. Kim's late father, Kim Jong Il, who was no fan of the limelight in his later years, would disappear at times. Kim Jong-Un, who seems to genuinely like being at the center of things, took off without a word for three weeks in 2012. Other reports have suggested from a range of ailments including  diabetes, a brain hemorrhage, a heart ailment, a leg injury that required surgery from a French doctor and even a cheese addiction that made his unwell. 'Within North Korea, the people feel Kim's presence even when he is absent,' Scott Snyder, a Korea expert with the Council on Foreign Relations, wrote in a recent blog post. 'Externally, North Korean propaganda has made Kim's presence so critical that international media regard his absence as disquieting, even ... without supporting indicators of instability or upset in Pyongyang.' Kim's disappearance from the public eye 'does not appear likely to shake the regime, but it reveals the vulnerabilities the regime faces', Snyder said. Last week, Saturday Night Live addressed the North Korean dictator's mysterious disappearance, with a bizarre skit in which the cast mocked his claims that he is still in power but just 'hurt his leg'. Bobby Moynihan, playing Kim, screams at a room full of soldiers: 'I broke my ankle dunking Michael Jordan! The movie Space Jam is about me, we all know that!' North Korea's ambassador to the UK told the BBC that the country's 32-year-old leader is well, despite having been absent from public view for more than 38 days .

"Never-before-seen nude photos from 1995 of Dancing with the Stars host Brooke Burke, 43, have surfaced in a New York City art show. The Route 66-themed Andre Plessel photos appeared Thursday in the Lilac Gallery in Manhattan and show the swimsuit model topless in the Western sun. Originally snapped for a German auto parts catalog, the pictures initially caused a stir with Burke's legal team, according to Page Six. Buxom: Brooke Burke posed in Route 66-themed Andre Plessel photos back in 1995. They resurfaced Thursday in the Lilac Gallery in Manhattan . Just sittin' on a tire: The photos were originally taken for a German auto parts catalog but were never used for that purpose . Their source says Burke's people called up the gallery just before opening night in an attempt to hunt down the photographer. 'They wanted to see the original releases Brooke signed to do this shoot,' claimed the Page Six source. The source would clarify that it was just a matter of updating files, since the buxom emcee's star power has rocketed since the shoot and her legal team wasn't with her back in 1995. Different life: The 43-year-old mom is now more likely to be seen toting her kids around than posing in artful photo shoots .

"This must surely be the ultimate tea break accessory for those with a sweet tooth - a 'dipper' mug designed to perfectly accommodate and dunk a biscuit. Craig Kaplan, a 3D printing enthusiast, designed the Little Dipper to solve the problem of biscuits being too big to be fully submerged. Originally marketed in America for kids who want to dunk biscuits in a small amount of milk before bed, they could also become a hit with tea lovers in Britain. The Little Dipper mug has been designed to perfectly accommodate and dunk a bisuit .

'A . cup large enough for whole-biscuit dipping must be filled with a huge . amount of milk, whereas a cup that holds the right amount of milk is . usually too narrow for proper dipping. 'The . sides of the cup are flared to allow thumb and forefinger to achieve . dipping perfection, and the drink can be drunk afterwards from one of . the narrow ends.'

Last month, MailOnline reported how new research suggested the humble Rich Tea biscuit was the most robust biscuit for dunking. Of the five common biscuits studied, Rich Tea came out on top, with the Hobnob exposed as the least resilient dunker, becoming unstable after as few as three short dunks (approximately four seconds). This is because it is an oat-based, rather than wheat-based biscuit and the larger oat particles in the Hobnob provide less structural strength.","Craig Kaplan designs mug to solve problem of biscuits being too big to dip .

"A carer has been jailed after she helped a prolific burglar steal from the homes of her vulnerable patients. Janet Kaye, 55, claimed she was pressured into helping Craig Armitage take valuable property from homes in Brighouse and Huddersfield, West Yorkshire. With her help, he stole hundreds of pounds in cash and antiques, including candlesticks worth £500 from a 94-year-old woman who was in hospital after a fall. Kaye, from Meltham in West Yorkshire, was jailed for three years. She admitted involvement in one burglary and was found guilty of involvement in a second following a trial. Janet Kaye, left, helped prolific burglar Craig Armitage, right, steal from the homes of her vulnerable patients. Kaye was jailed for three years for her involvement and Armitage received three years and five months . Armitage, 41, from Huddersfield, was jailed for three years and five months after admitting to two charges of burglary and one charge of burglary with intent. Bradford Crown Court heard Kaye was seen acting suspiciously near the flat of a 94-year-old woman who had been taken into hospital in Brighouse last October. A neighbour reported her concerns and when the flat was checked, it was found that valuable candlesticks, paintings and ornaments had been stolen. Kaye had been employed as a carer for the victim and was suspected of involvement in the crime as there was no sign of a forced entry. Prosecutor Ben Crosland said during the police inquiry officers seized a mobile phone belonging to Armitage and found the number of an antiques shop. When police officers visited the premises the owner said he had bought items from the couple, who were then living in Longwood, Huddersfield. Although some of the stolen items were recovered, Mr Crosland said the candlesticks had not been found. Bradford Crown Court, pictured, heard Kaye was seen acting suspiciously around the home of a 94-year-old woman who had been taken to hospital after a fall. Armitage later stole from the property . A few days later, Armitage used information from Kaye to burgle the home of two more vulnerable clients who lived in Huddersfield. About £300 in cash was stolen while the two women were asleep in their beds. The court head that Armitage's fingerprint was later found on one of the cash boxes. Around two weeks later, Armitage tried to break into another house in Bradford, during the day, but eventually left empty-handed. Barrister Joanne Shepherd, for Kaye, said she had long-standing health problems and was the primary carer for her own mother. Miss Shepherd said Kaye felt under pressure at the time of the offences due to Armitage's drug addiction. She submitted that Kaye had learned her lesson and urged Judge John Potter to impose a suspended prison term. But the judge said the offences against Kaye's clients were 'particularly mean' and involved the targeting of vulnerable victims for the defendants' own selfish and greedy needs. The court also heard that Armitage's previous convictions, dating back to 1989, included offences of house burglary and robbery. Judge Potter said his career of offending had 'spread misery in our community'.","Janet Kaye, 55, helped Craig Armitage steal from homes of patients in Brighouse and Huddersfield, West Yorkshire .

"The Queen could be hit with a £1million bill if Labour's 'mansion tax' comes into force . The Queen could be slapped with a £1million tax bill every year if Labour's proposed 'mansion tax' comes into force. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, Princess Anne and the Duchess of Cornwall could also be hit by hefty bills by the tax, which would target everyone with a home worth more than £2million. The likes of Buckingham Palace would not be taxed - as it is technically owned by the state - but Balmoral castle and Sandringham House would still leave the Queen with huge amounts to pay. Tatler reported that Balmoral had been estimated to be worth up to £50million earlier this year, and if Sandringham were to fetch a similar fee, the Queen could be made to pay nearly £1million for the two homes - if they were both taxed at a rate of one per cent of their value over £2million, the Daily Express reports. Labour has not yet released full details of the tax on the wealthy, which they say could raise an extra £1.3billion for the NHS. The idea has already been criticised by a number of its own MPs - as many of those based in London say it unfairly targets the capital. Of all of Britain's homes worth £2million or more, 96 per cent of them are in London or the South East. London mayor Boris Johnson has warned that  whose homes have gone up in value but do not earn huge salaries could end up being 'clobbered'. Scroll down for video . Balmoral castle in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, one property which could present the Queen with a large bill . Sandringham House in Norfolk, which has 20 acres of gardens and could also be taxed in new Labour plans . And the Royal Family would take a significant hit along with them. The 500,000-acre Balmoral in Royal Deeside and 20,000-acre Sandringham in Norfolk could start to cause the Queen serious problems. Meanwhile, Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge could have to pay around £10,000 each year for their Grade II listed Norfolk mansion Anmer Hall - which is 200 years old and has a swimming pool and a tennis court. Princess Anne could face a tax bill of around £60,000 for £8million estimated Gatcombe Park, which the Queen bought for her and her then-husband Mark Phillips after they wed in 1973. The nine-bedroom house's estimate has been calculated based on sales of other properties in the Gloucestershire area. And Duchess of Cornwall, Camilla Parker-Bowles, could face a £5,000 bill for Ray Mill House in Wiltshire, which she bought for £850,000 in 1996 and could now be worth around £2million. It is not certain whether Prince Charles' Highgrove House in Gloucestershire would be taxed, as it is owned by the Dutch of Cornwall, and similar goes for the Duke of York's Royal Lodge Windsor home, as it is a leasehold.

"A pilot of a private plane was arrested over concerns about the amount of alcohol in his blood yesterday - just two days after another similar incident. Ian Jennings, 47, from Gosport, Hampshire, was arrested at Norwich Airport yesterday afternoon after landing a commercial chartered plane. He has been charged with performing an aviation function when the alcohol in his breath was over the prescribed limited, Norfolk Police said. Allegation: Canadair pilot Ian Jennings, 47, from Gosport, Hampshire, was arrested at Norwich Airport yesterday afternoon after landing a commercial chartered plane (file photo) Jennings was released on bail to appear at Norwich Magistrates' Court on November 13 where he will face the allegation under the Railways and Transport Safety Act 2003. The pilot was privately hired by the owner of the plane - a Canadair CL601-3A Challenger. It is not currently known who owns the plane or where it had flown from at the time of the incident. Phil Gadd, a director at Norwich Airport, said: 'We're aware of the incident that took place yesterday and understand it's now being dealt with by the police through criminal proceedings. 'Unlike with scheduled airlines, small chartered flights such as this one are not handled by the airport directly so we don't know much than what's already been said.' The incident comes just two days after a Flybe pilot was arrested for being 'drunk' before take on Tuesday. The 48-year-old pilot had been due to fly from Newquay Airport in Cornwall to London Gatwick when he was held. Over the limit: Norfolk Police said he has been charged with performing an aviation function at Norfolk when the alcohol in his breath was over the prescribed limit . A concerned crew member alerted the police, who removed the pilot from the plane, a Bombardier Dash 8 turboprop, and breath-tested him. The flight was cancelled and passengers were delayed for up to four hours, with one person missing a connecting flight to Mexico. The pilot was named locally as Julian Lowden, who describes himself in an online profile as a pilot and former consultant stress engineer. In the UK drink drive limit is 80 miligrammes per 100 mililitres. For pilots the blood/alcohol limit is 20 milligrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood. Source: Civil Aviation Authority . A spokesman said: 'Flybe can confirm that one of its pilots volunteered to help the police with their inquiries at Newquay Airport yesterday. 'The airline is not able to comment further while the police investigation is taking place.' For pilots, air crew and air traffic controllers the alcohol limit is 20mg per 100ml of blood. The drink-drive limit for motorists is 80mg. Retired commercial pilot Andy Wilkins said he'd never heard of a pilot being arrested before a flight. 'It's very rare,' he said. 'I've never heard of my colleagues being tested - I wasn't. But the rules are very strict. Pilots are allowed a quarter of the limit for drivers. 'We always followed the adage, ""eight hours from bottle to throttle"" - stop drinking at least eight hours before flying. But pilots are human and everyone is different.' Last year, a Pakistani International Airlines pilot was jailed for nine months in Britain for being drunk before he was due to fly a plane with 156 people on board. Irfan Faiz, 55, was found to have three times the legal amount of alcohol in his blood, prosecutors told Leeds Crown Court. In the US, 48 year-old American Eagle pilot, Kolbjorn Jarle Kristiansen, was removed from the cockpit after airline employees detected alcohol on his breath on him at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport.

"Paedophiles have differences in their brain that make them sexually attracted to children, according to new research. An analysis of MRI scans found they are wired abnormally compared to heterosexuals, adding to a growing body of evidence that claims paedophilia is an illness. The same regions of a healthy adult brain that register a sexual response are triggered by a paedophile seeing a child’s face, according to a new study. An analysis of MRI scans found that the brains of paedophiles are wired abnormally compared to heterosexuals. The reserach could be sued to diagnose paedophilia using children's faces - even to anticipate attacks. Jimmy Saville is pictured . The research could mean that paedophilia could be diagnosed using children’s faces, overcoming ethical concerns about showing them naked pictures of youngsters under the age of consent. An experiment conducted by the Christian-Albrechts University of Kiel, Germany revealed that in a healthy control group, adult faces activated brain parts known to be involved in sexual processing. And the same regions were triggered then the paedophiles looked at children’s faces. These included the occipital area responsible for receiving visual information from the eyes, the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex which is unique to humans, the putamen that controls sexual arousal and the caudate nucleus where emotional feelings assemble. A total of 56 people - 24 of whom were paedophiles – observed faces of adults and children while undergoing magnetic resonance imaging, after which they were asked to rate the people’s attractiveness. A previous study by the University of Toronto, Canada, discovered 'huge differences' in the white matter of paedophiles' brains when compared to those of typical men. A cross section of a typical human brain, is pictured where the grey matter is stained blue . Among all the participants, the same network was activated by a sexually preferred face. But the ‘main difference in paedophiles is that network is abnormally tuned to sexual immaturity,’ the researchers said in the study published in the Royal Society journal Biology Letters . ‘In paedophilia, sexual attraction is directed to sexually immature children,’ Dr Jorge Ponseti, of the university said. ‘Therefore, we hypothesised brain networks that normally are tuned to mature faces of the preferred gender show an abnormal tuning to sexual immature faces in paedophilia. ‘In individuals attracted to adults, adult faces activated several brain regions significantly more than child faces. ‘These brain regions comprised areas known to be implicated in face processing and sexual processing, including occipital areas, the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, and the putamen and caudate nucleus.’ ‘The same regions were activated in paedophiles, but with a reversed preferential response pattern.’ Previous research has shown people who are sexually drawn to children are more likely to be left handed, less intelligent and shorter than average men. Huge differences have also been found in the white matter of paedophiles’ brains, compared to typical men’s. Paedophiles tend to be between 10 and 15 IQ points lower than average. In another study, clinical psychologist James Cantor, (pictured) studied MRI scans to look at the brains of paedophiles and believes that there is a literal 'cross wiring' of paedophiles' sexual response system and parental, nurturing system, in their brains . Clinical psychologist James Cantor has previously suggested that paedophilia is an illness and is linked to abnormalities in the brain’s white matter. He studied MRI scans to look at the brains of paedophiles and believes that there is a literal ‘cross-wiring’ of  the sexual response system and parental, nurturing system, in paedophiles' brains. He also noticed that people who are sexually drawn to children are more likely to be left-handed, less intelligent and shorter than average men. Dr Cantor, of the University of Toronto, Canada, was surprised to find ‘huge differences’ in the white matter of paedophiles’ brains when compared to those of typical men. He believes his research adds to evidence that no man is in control of what he is sexually interested in and does not suggest that the cross-wiring could be fixed by an operation. Dr Cantor said that paedophiles tend to be between 10 and 15 IQ points lower than average and are typically 2.5cm shorter than an average male. He also discovered that 30 to 35 per cent of paedophiles are left-handed - much higher than average.","Analysis of MRI scans found that the brains of paedophiles are wired abnormally compared to heterosexuals .

"More than 200 acres of the wild and 'magical' heathland that inspired author Thomas Hardy have been bought for the nation by the National Trust. The £650,000 acquisition of Slepe Heath, Dorset, will connect existing protected heathland areas as part of efforts to conserve the landscapes of Hardy's novels. Slepe Heath, whose windswept landscape was immortalised as fictional Egdon Heath in Hardy's Return Of The Native, is an important site for wildlife, including rare birds such as Dartford warblers, nightjars and woodlarks, the National Trust said. Visitors to the 240-acre site, which rises 100ft above its low-lying surroundings, are given panoramic views of the area including Corfe Castle (above), Poole Harbour and the Purbeck Hills . Visitors to the 240-acre site, which rises 100ft above its low-lying surroundings, are given panoramic views of the area including Corfe Castle, Poole Harbour and the Purbeck Hills. The acquisition of the former forestry plantation will connect the protected lowland heath of Hartland Moor, which is already looked after by the National Trust and Natural England, and the Arne reserve owned by the RSPB. Slepe Heath, whose windswept landscape was immortalised as fictional Egdon Heath in Hardy's Return Of The Native, is an important site for wildlife . Laurie Clark, National Trust Purbeck general manager, said: 'Slepe Heath is somewhere you can get that little bit closer to a true wildness. Thomas Hardy immortalised much of the area in Dorset as Wessex  in his books . 'It's a magical and wonderfully atmospheric place where visitors can experience Hardy's fictional Egdon Heath, the setting for the Return of the Native. 'Dorset's heathland is among its crown jewels in terms of both wildlife and landscape. 'By looking after Slepe Heath we can ensure that this heathland remains open and protected for everyone to continue to enjoy.' The National Trust said Hartland Moor and the Arne reserve were grazed by cattle in a way that conserved the landscape for wildlife, and the purchase of Slepe Heath would unite the sites into a single grazing area. The move forms part of efforts to improve habitat for wildlife on a 'landscape scale' under the Wild Purbeck Nature Improvement Area scheme, one of 12 such large-scale areas designated across the country by the Government. The acquisition was made possible by a legacy left to the National Trust, and is the largest area of lowland heath the Trust has acquired for more than a decade.","Slepe Heath immortalised as Egdon Heath in Hardy's Return Of The Native .

"Pictured is Professor Phil Jones, the academic at the centre of the ‘Climategate’ affair, whose raw data is crucial to the theory of climate change . High-profile rows over climate science have had no lasting impact on people’s views on global warming. This is according to an analysis of search terms on Google from 2004 to 2013 around two events: 'Climategate' and the discovery of an error about the melting of Himalyan glaciers in a major UN climate report. In both these incidents, media coverage highlighted apparent issues with the science. During 'climategate' emails were hacked from the University of East Anglia’s Climatic Research Unit in November 2009 (CRU) and used to accuse scientists of misconduct. Sceptics seized on phrases from the emails such as 'trick...to hide the decline' in data on temperatures to claim scientists manipulated or deleted data to support the evidence of global warming, though they were cleared of doing so following several independent inquiries. Shortly afterwards, in January 2010, news broke of an error about the rate of ice melt in the Himalayas in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s fourth assessment report, a major review of climate science. Although there were spikes in the search term 'global warming hoax', indicating scepticism, as news of the incidents emerged, levels of the search quickly fell back to previous lows, the study published in the journal Environmental Research Letters found. The search term 'climategate' halved six days after a peak in public interest, the research found. The study’s co-author Dr Greg Goldsmith, from the University of Oxford, said: 'The study uses the search term ‘global warming hoax’ as an indicator of global warming scepticism amongst the public. in January 2010, news broke of an error about the rate of ice melt in the Himalayas in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s fourth assessment report. Pictured is Rajendra Pachauri, the head of UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, who admitted that the figure needs reviewing . 'Although we found an increase in the volume of searches for the term immediately after the news of the hacking of the emails from the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia, the search volume quickly returns to the same level as before the incident. 'This suggests no long-term change in the level of climate change scepticism.' The research also found that 'global warming' was more commonly searched for than 'climate change', although the gap between the two had narrowed. But the analysis suggested an overall fall in interest in the subject since a peak in 2007 after Al Gore’s climate documentary 'An Inconvenient Truth' was released and the IPCC’s fourth assessment report was published. The analysis suggested an overall fall in interest in the subject since a peak in 2007 after Al Gore’s climate documentary 'An Inconvenient Truth' was released and the IPCC’s fourth assessment report was published . Dr William Anderegg, from Princeton University, said: 'Our results showed that the volume of these search terms peaked in 2007 around a unique sequence of major events - the releases of Al Gore’s An Inconvenient Truth in August 2006 and the IPCC fourth assessment report in April 2007 - and the level of interest has declined since then. 'There is no single reason why the public have become less interested in climate change. However research certainly suggests that economic issues, such as the recent recession, tend to take precedence over environmental issues like climate change.' Although there were spikes in the search term 'global warming hoax' after both events, indicating scepticism, levels of the search quickly fell back to previous lows . A scientific study which suggests global warming has been exaggerated was rejected by a respected journal because it might fuel climate scepticism, it was claimed last week. The alarming intervention, which raises fears of ‘McCarthyist’ pressure for environmental scientists to conform, came after a reviewer said the research was ‘less than helpful’ to the climate cause. Professor Lennart Bengtsson, a research fellow at the University of Reading and one of five authors of the study, said he suspected that intolerance of dissenting views on climate science was preventing his paper from being published. ‘The problem we now have in the climate community is that some scientists are mixing up their scientific role with that of a climate activist,’ he told the Times. Prof Bengtsson’s paper suggests that the Earth’s environment might be much less sensitive to greenhouse gases than previously thought. If he and his four co-authors are correct, it would mean that carbon dioxide and other pollutants are having a far less severe impact on climate than green activists would have us believe. The research, if made public, would be a huge challenge to the finding of the UN’s Intergovernmental panel on Climate Change (IPCC), that the global average temperature would rise by up to 4.5C if greenhouse gases in the atmosphere were allowed to double. The paper suggested that the climate might be less sensitive to greenhouse gases than had been claimed by the IPCC in its report last September, and recommended that more work be carried out ‘to reduce the underlying uncertainty’.","During 'climategate', emails were hacked from the University of East Anglia .

"A mysterious man known only as Jonnie has apologised to a woman and told her he loves her – by hiring a plane to soar through the sky with a banner saying: 'I'm sorry, I love you'.

Airads offers plane banners and skywriting, but usually takes orders from those looking to propose in style or celebrate a special occasion. Simon Moores, director of Airads, said the apology was only the second he had flown in 10 years. He said: 'Normally, I don't like doing apologies because they often cancel at the last minute. 'This is only one of two in the last 10 years that actually went through with it. 'He was more mature than most, rather than the normal schoolkids or teenagers who look us up. 'He was more determined than others which convinced me and he had his credit card ready on the spot.'

"For Gary Lineker, the greatest player in the history of the game is Diego Maradona. ‘By a million miles the best I played with or against,’ is the emphatic verdict. Argentina’s run to the final has jogged memories of Maradona’s magical influence on the 1986 and 1990 World Cups. He controlled the tournaments. It is here then, in the grand setting of Rio de Janeiro, where Lionel Messi must come to life if Argentina are to win the World Cup for a third time. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Gary Linekar joke with Diego Maradona about hand of god goal . Little magician: Gary Lineker says that Diego Maradona (pictured) is the best player of all time 'by a million miles' Expert: Match of the Day presenter Lineker expects to see more from Messi as he is a fantastic player . Looking tired: Lineker says he expects more for Lionel Messi and thinks he is 'jaded' ‘I can see the comparisons with Maradona,’ admitted Lineker. ‘He is a god in Argentina, understandably. He is a tough act to follow and has always been a huge personality. ‘His left foot could manipulate the ball as though it was a hand. He was astonishing.’ Despite Messi’s standing within the game, he has looked subdued and isolated at times. In a workmanlike, industrious team, he is expected to turn games. He has scored four goals - including a special strike against Iran - but they have largely been forgotten in the final week of the tournament. Lineker, who scored against Argentina in the 1986 World Cup, added: ‘I love Messi. He is the most wonderfully gifted player I have seen since Maradona, but he looks jaded. Let’s see if he can do it in the final. ‘I’ve watched him at Barcelona and there was less and less movement as the season progressed. I don’t think he is in brilliant shape and he looks exhausted. To be honest I have been marginally disappointed with him - something is not right.’ Scorer: Lineker netted against Argentina for England in the 1986 World Cup quarter-final . Incredible: Maradona inspired Argentina to World Cup glory in 1986 and to the final in 1990 . Lineker was unimpressed with Messi’s work-rate during Argentina’s semi-final against Holland. He added: ‘I know in all the games teams have put players on him but he has done so little to create space for himself. Every now and then he will light the place up, get the ball and beat three men but you have to wait a long time for that. ‘I have watched him for years and he scores a lot of poacher’s goals, but on the occasions Argentina did counter attack down the flanks, with Lavezzi or Zabaleta or whoever it was, he didn’t even try to get anywhere near the box. ‘I don’t think in 120 minutes he touched the ball in the box. I saw a quote from his father saying he’s exhausted and his legs weigh 100kgs. It looks a bit like that.’ Messi’s goals got Argentina out the group, but he has yet to control the tournament in the same way as Maradona. Quadruple: Messi has scored four goals for Argentina at this World Cup but all were during the group stages . More: Former England international Lineker wants and expects to see Messi control Sunday's final . Phenomenal: Maradona (right) dominated the 1986 and 1990 World Cups for Argentina . Lineker added: ‘They might have struggled to get through the group without some Messi magic. He got them through, in all ways. ‘Then there was the brilliant bit of play for Di Maria to get the winner in the last 16 against Switzerland. ‘He’s been massively influential. They wouldn’t be where they are without him, or without Mascherano either.’ To prevent Germany winning their fourth World Cup, Argentina must restrain the midfield three of Bastian Schweinsteiger, Toni Kroos and Sami Khedira. The former England man said: ‘The Germany-Brazil game was the most amazing, remarkable match I have ever seen. The thing about them is that they are a team and they are very strong. Trio: Germany's midfield three, which includes Bastian Schweinsteiger, destroyed Brazil during the semi-final . Stellar: Sami Khedira was also brilliant as Germany destroyed hosts Brazil 7-1 to reach the final . Brilliant: Toni Kroos excelled during Germany's semi-final demolition of Brazil, scoring twice . Position: Germany's decision to shift Philipp Lahm back to full-back has benefited the side . Unusual: Germany forward Thomas Muller has a unique style but is extremely effective . Messi must reach new heights if Argentina are to beat Germany in Sunday's World Cup final . ‘Schweinsteiger is important, Kroos has had a lot of stick in Germany but he has come through. ‘I also like Muller. He is a funny looking footballer, slightly ungainly, he falls over a bit and yet he sees things and he is a wonderful finisher. ‘The best thing that happened to them was shifting Lahm to full back. I don’t think he is a defensive midfielder - he is a bit ill-disciplined. They got away with it against the (United) States and Ghana. Whereas Khedira is not as a good a footballer as Lahm, he is very good in the position. ‘Their high line is the only risk, but Argentina don’t have runners in there. Mascherano is as good a holding player as you will ever see. His performance in the semi final was epic.’ Gary Lineker presents the World Cup final on BBC One at 7pm on Sunday.

Tortured: Weighing just 17 pounds, the canine was brought to the Humane Society of Westmoreland County and was so badly malnourished you could see its ribs . The tortured animal is now being cared for and is said to be doing well. Jon Dillion of the Humane Society told CBS Pittsburgh: 'The garbage company called us. They were dumping garbage and they noticed one of the bags moved.' The dog was extremely malnourished – weighing just 17 pounds. It is supposed to weigh around 50 pounds. 'With some good care, she'll be going home with a vet tech; things will look good for her,' The dog had a microchip, so the owner has been identified. However, she allegedly moved to Texas. The chip identifies the primary owner as Nicole Baker. She lived in the trailer were the dog was discovered in the garbage can. The secondary owner is identified as Brittney Booker. She lives next door. No charges have been filed, but the charity is hoping to talk to the pair. Doing well: After being treated, the dog is said to be recovering.

"Britain’s smallest million-pound house has gone on the market - a studio flat that is more than five times the country’s average property price. The refurbished £950,000 home in Mayfair, central London, is made up of a joint living and sleeping area with a small kitchenette and shower room. Agents have described it as a fine example of a purpose-built Mayfair ‘dower flat’ - a property once used by genteel widows in the Victorian and Edwardian era and used by the landed gentry of the real Downton Abbey. Tiny: The refurbished £950,000 home in Mayfair, central London, is made up of a joint living and sleeping area with a small kitchenette and shower room . Bathroom and kitchen: The property - billed by estate agents as 'Mayfair’s biggest bargain' - is spread across just 328 sq ft, making it a third of the size of a UK new build . Costly venture: The owner will also have to pay a further £38,000 in stamp duty and then stump up a £2,200-a-year service charge . Mayfair dower flats were deliberately compact to keep maintenance and cost to a minimum. The Dowager Countess of Carnarvon (the real Downton Abbey), the Dowager Countess of Portsmouth, Dowager Lady Deere and the Dowager Countess of Stafford all had Mayfair flats. It is thought that during the late 1920s, Lady Virginia Champneys, widow of Sir Francis Champneys, lived in a flat at the address where this property is located. However, it is more likely this studio flat will be lived in by a super-rich foreign student or used as a pied-a-terre. From the outside: The flat is more than £750,000 above the average UK house price of £188,374, and is sold with a 100-year-lease . History: The flat is also a good example of a purpose-built Mayfair 'dower flat' - a property once used by genteel widows in the Victorian and Edwardian era . Expected occupants: It is  likely this studio flat will be lived in by a super-rich foreign student or used as a pied-a-terre . The total floor space is no bigger than a bathroom suite in some upmarket hotels .

The owner will also have to pay a further £38,000 in stamp duty and then stump up a £2,200-a-year service charge. And the flat, which is more than £750,000 above the average UK house price of £188,374, is sold with a 100-year-lease. The total price paid will therefore work out at around £1,020 per month, compared to a rent of £2,500 per month for a typical studio flat in Mayfair. The flat has a living and entertaining area with wooden floors, ceiling spotlighting and room for a double bed. There is also a walk-in shower and a fully fitted kitchen. The total floor space is no bigger than a bathroom suite in some upmarket hotels. Peter Wetherell, chief executive of Wetherell, said: ‘Compact yet chic, this purpose built Mayfair studio would historically have served as a dower flat for an aristocratic lady from the “Downton Abbey” era. ‘Now fully modernised it would provide the perfect Mayfair pad for an overseas student studying in London from a wealthy family or a socialite who wants a Mayfair address but at a lower cost.’","Refurbished £950,000 home in central London has living/sleeping area with small kitchenette and shower room .

"A police officer working for a school district in suburban Houston was charged with official suppression after he allegedly asked a woman to smell her feet during a traffic stop. The woman filed a report claiming that on the morning of August 11, she was pulled over on Jones Road by Cy-Fair Independent School District Officer Patrick Quinn, 26, on her way home from visiting a friend. Quinn stopped the motorist for driving with an expired insurance, but later told her that he could smell marijuana in her car. Kinky: Officer Patrick Quinn, 26, pictured left in a booking photo and right with his daughter, has been charged with official suppression for allegedly trying to pressure a woman to let him sniff her feet . The driver agreed to let Quinn search her vehicle, which allegedly yielded a marijuana grinder, Houston Chronicle reported. According to the complaint filed with the Harris County District Attorney's Office, the cop then asked the woman what she would do in his place, to which the driver replied that she would let him off. In response, Officer Quinn confided in the motorist that he had a foot fetish and would let her go if she let him sniff her feet, according to the district attorney’s office. As the woman was removing her boots and socks, Quinn made it clear that if he were to take a whiff of her tootsies, he would likely lick them as well. As an alternative, Quinn told the driver she could give him her underwear instead. The woman removed her intimates and made an attempt to hand the item to Quinn, but the officer apparently had a change of heart and let her go without getting anything in return. Disgusting: Quinn, seen here with his wife of seven years, allegedly told the driver that he would lick her feet as well . Trade-off: According to a complaint, Quinn, pictured here with his beautiful family, offered the let the driver go if she gave him her underwear . Police identified Quinn as the officer behind the bizarre traffic stop from a fingerprint left on the driver's insurance card and charged him October 25. Prosecutors with the district attorney's office believe that Quinn may have preyed on other women to satisfy his foot fetish and are asking drivers to come forward. The Cy-Fair school district released a statement to Click2Houston Monday saying that Officer Quinn has been placed on an administrative leave. ‘We are appalled by the nature of the allegations brought forth against one of our officers,’ the statement read in part. According to Quinn's Facebook page, the St Louis native has been married for seven years and has two young daughters.","Cy-Fair Independent School District Officer Patrick Quinn, 26, charged with official suppression .

"Britain is bracing itself for a lashing from the elements when the driest month on record is set to be blown away by 70mph winds and heavy rain this weekend. But it has been a case of the calm before the storm today with much of the country basking in the warm conditions and clear skies - and some stunning sunsets across parts of the South. The spectacular summery weather is set to come to a dramatic end, however, with forecasters predicting that dismal conditions will settle in over the next few days. Scroll down for video . Calm before the storm: Two men enjoy what could be the last of the glorious Indian Summer weather as they take a row on the River Cam in Cambridge this morning . Forecasters have predicted dismal conditions over the next few days, but much of Britain has been enjoying the glorious weather that typified much of September . This stunning scene was captured across Aylesbury Vale in Buckinghamshire last night, but the sun is also setting on the glorious weather with up to 60mm of rain falling in a matter of hours in some parts . Sunlight bursts through the mist over Corfe Castle in Dorset. Despite the settled weather in the last few dayts, the The Met Office has said that downpours over the next few days could lead to surface water flooding . Up to 60mm of rain could fall in a matter of hours while severe gales of up to 70mph are set to batter parts of the north with temperatures plunging by 10C. The grim forecast comes days after early figures indicated last month is set to be the driest September across the UK since records began in 1910. It is also likely to finish in the top five warmest Septembers. The Met Office warned severe gales with gusts of up to 70mph were possible in north-west Scotland in a yellow 'be aware' alert. The sun sets over Aylesbury Vale in Buckinghamshire in a picture taken from Dunstable Downs. Severe weather warnings of rain are in place for parts of the north and west of Britain today and tomorrow . Picturesque: This autumnal scene was captured at Sycamore Gap along Hadrian's Wall last night. The grim forecast comes days after early figures indicated last month is set to be the driest September across the UK since records began in 1910 . With the sun shinging and beneath clear blue skies,  a man enjoys the fine weather as he walks his dog along the beach in Hastings, East Sussex . Despite the dire weather forecast, these four girls found it warm enough today to paddle in the sea at the beach in Hastings, East Sussex . Fine day for a walk: The surface of the water sparkles in the October sun today as a man walks his dog along the shore at Hastings . The Chief Forecaster's assessment said: 'Although such wind speeds are not unusual across these areas of Scotland, the contrast with the recent quiet weather means that a few minor impacts may occur.' A yellow warning for rain was also issued with 'heavy and persistent' downpours predicted in parts of southern Scotland, Northern Ireland, northern England and Wales from Friday afternoon until Saturday morning. Forecasters said between 20mm (0.8in) and 40mm (1.6in) could fall 'quite widely' across the warning area, while some places could see more than 60mm (2.4in) with much of the rain falling within a few hours. Making a splash: A 'super-pod' of more than a thousand dolphins was  spotted off the coast of pembrokeshire - as they swim further inland to feed and raise their young . Experts at The Sea Trust counted the mass off the Pembrokeshire coast in the Bristol Channel. They say the pod is at least a thousand strong but admit it could be an under-estimate as they are impossible to keep track of . Sailing volunteers on the boat 'Cartlett Lady' were surrounded for nearly three hours by 'wall to wall' dolphins as they surveyed a 35 mile stretch . The Met Office said the downpours could lead to surface water flooding, saying: 'The public should be aware of the potential for some localised impacts to travel due to surface water flooding.' It said the high pressure which settled over Britain and protected it from Atlantic depressions in September is in the process of moving - and making room for conditions more in keeping with October. Drivers are being warned of the risk of flash flooding. A man heads out early to the banks o the River Cam in Cambridgeshire for some fishing.

The sun shines through the trees along the banks of the River Cam as two women enjoy a morning row. Wet weather is set to sweep in from tonight . Darron Burness, head of the AA's flood rescue team, said: 'It's a case of ""change of month, change of weather"". 'After precious little rain in September, autumn will fall sharply into focus tomorrow as it turns wet and windy across many areas. 'While river catchments may well be able to take this volume of water after the very dry September, a lot may fall within 12 to 24 hours, so flash flooding is likely to be the main issue for drivers in the affected areas. Dark clouds gather from the coast off Fraserburgh, Aberdeenshire this afternoon with Scotland's Indian summer looking over for the time being after severe winds and rain battered much of the north last night and into this morning . Scotland and northern England is expected to see winds gusting up to 70mph as the fine spell of weather finally comes to an end . 'Be wary of places where water may accumulate; for instance, dips in the road and under bridges. 'In dark, wet conditions, it can be extremely difficult to distinguish between a road that's flooded and one that is simply very wet until it's too late. 'Tomorrow evening's rush hour could be particularly affected, so allow a bit more time if you're heading away for the weekend, and check your car's lights and wiper blades.'","Britain bracing itself for a lashing from the elements with heavy rain and strong wind set to sweep in .

"A senior employee at a leading British bank could face up to ten years in prison after admitting conspiracy to defraud in connection with rigging interest rates. The individual, whose identity is protected by a court order, yesterday became the first banker in the UK to plead guilty in court following the ‘Libor’ inter-bank lending scandal. He is also the first senior worker at a British bank to be convicted of criminal wrongdoing since the financial crash of 2008. Details of the guilty plea can be reported for the first time following court proceedings yesterday. A senior employee at a leading British bank could face up to ten years in prison after admitting conspiracy to defraud in connection with rigging interest rates. But the gagging order regarding the individual’s name, served by Judge Leonard QC at Southwark Crown Court, also prevented the ‘leading bank’ he worked for being identified. The banker is one of 12 people charged by the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) for allegedly manipulating Libor interest rates, which are used to set the price of mortgages and are linked to trillions of pounds worth of financial contracts. Eleven of the accused are currently awaiting trial. Many have yet to enter formal pleas. Yesterday’s guilty plea was the first criminal conviction arising from the SFO’s Libor investigation, which began in July 2012. The Treasury said those found guilty of playing a part in the scandal should feel the ‘full force of the law’. Bank of England governor Mark Carney has also led calls for bankers to be held to account. In July, he said staff at another bank involved in a scam to defraud taxpayers during the financial crisis could be guilty of ‘criminal conduct’. Scroll down for video . Hearing: The banker's guilty plea to a charge of conspiracy to defraud was entered at Southwark Crown Court (pictured) in central London on Friday and can be reported today following a court ruling . Andrea Leadsom, economic secretary to the Treasury, said: ‘The integrity of the City matters to the economy of Britain. ‘Ensuring that the key rates that underpin financial markets are robust, and that anyone who seeks to manipulate them is subject to the full force of the law is vital.’ The public has a legitimate interest in knowing which bankers were allegedly involved in Libor rate-rigging, a judge ruled in a previous case. The High Court judge said last year that keeping the names of bank bosses secret would be ‘an affront to the principle of open justice’. He was asked to impose an order giving anonymity to more than 100 bank staff whose emails were handed to the City watchdog during its probe into Libor manipulation. The ruling on a civil claim was separate to yesterday’s criminal case. In the civil case, the judge denied anonymity to staff whose emails were handed over, even though most of them were not accused of any impropriety. The innocent would not be prejudiced by being named, he ruled, and the public had the right to know who was alleged to have been involved. He said: ‘The public has a legitimate interest in learning who in the banking community is alleged to have been implicated in the manipulation of Libor. 'For the court to permit individuals who were involved in such manipulation the protection of an anonymity order is not only not necessary for the proper administration of justice, but would be an affront to the principle of open justice and would potentially damage public confidence in the administration of justice.’ The case was brought by a care home that said it was mis-sold a so-called interest rate swap linked to the Libor rate. Conspiracy to defraud carries a jail term of up to ten years, but the date for the sentencing of the unnamed banker has not yet been set. In total, seven banks and brokerage firms have settled allegations of interest rate rigging in the UK and US. These include Barclays, which was fined £290million in June 2012, Royal Bank of Scotland, which paid out £390million, and Lloyds, which was hit with a £148million penalty. Damning emails showed how traders bragged about moving Libor interest rates up and down to fix their bets on the stock market, promising each other kickbacks and bottles of champagne. Last night, MPs welcomed the conviction. Chris Leslie, shadow Treasury minister, said: ‘This is not down to a single rogue individual. ‘This is just the beginning of a long process of weeding out a crooked culture in banks which has deep roots.’ Labour MP John Mann, who sits on the Treasury select committee, added: ‘Whoever this banker is, his or her bosses who created the culture that allowed this to happen must be held to account.’ The Government has made manipulating Libor – which stands for the London Interbank Offered Rate – a criminal offence carrying a jail term of up to seven years. The rate is based on daily submissions lodged by a panel of international banks, and is supposed to reflect the cost at which they borrow from one another. But some traders manipulated Libor rates to favour their own short-term investments. They did this by conspiring with colleagues called ‘submitters’, who were responsible for entering the bank’s estimated rate each day. Some bankers also colluded with rivals and brokers, urging them to either increase or decrease their estimates to push the overall Libor rate up or down. Libor stands for the London Interbank Offer Rate and is a measure of the interest rate banks charge to borrow between each other. The rate is set every morning by a panel of banks and overseen by trade body the British Bankers' Association. Each bank sets the rates at which it believes it can borrow, from overnight to 12 months. There are 150 Libor rates, spanning ten currencies and 15 time periods. It heavily influences how banks price variable rate mortages, such as new tracker and discount deals and standard variable rates. Some borrowers also have mortgages linked directly to Libor, which are typically reset every three months. Traders could make money from tiny movements in the rate due to the millions being gambled on them, however, by the time these shifts of fractions of one per cent reach mortgage pricing their effect would be minimal. Even those whose mortgages were directly linked to Libor would find changes in their interest rate would have little overall effect.

"Throughout their long married life together, Arthur Tear and his beloved wife Mary were inseparable. When Mrs Tear began to suffer from the worsening effects of dementia, her devoted husband, a retired GP, continued to care for her at home into their late 80s. But on Monday, just days short of their 66th wedding anniversary, the bodies of the elderly couple were discovered at their house in Millport, on the island of Great Cumbrae in the Firth of Clyde. Loving couple: Dr Arthur Tear and his wife Mary's bodies were discovered at their home, just days before their 66th wedding anniversary. The couple were described as 'inseparable' by their children . Inquiries into the incident are ongoing but it is understood that police are not looking for anyone else in connection with the deaths. Last night, the couple’s children paid tribute to their parents’ enduring love for each other. In a statement, they said: ‘We are very sad at the loss of our mother and father. They were a devoted couple, inseparable since they married over 60 years ago. We will miss them terribly. ‘We would like to thank everyone for their words of comfort. It is reassuring to know how well thought of our parents were – however, we would be grateful if we were left to grieve as a family.’ As detectives and police forensic scientists remained at the large stone property in the town’s West Bay area for most of the day, residents expressed their shock and sadness at the tragedy. Neighbour Janice Campbell, 51, said Dr Tear, 89, always stopped to say hello and used to make her pots of jam. Home: The bodies of the elderly couple were discovered at their house in Millport, on the island of Great Cumbrae in the Firth of Clyde, Scotland . She said: ‘The last time I saw Arthur was last week – he was outside doing the pointing on his wall in the front garden. He made me a pot of jam about a month ago because my husband had cut his grass. ‘I saw an ambulance arriving outside their house about 11.30 on Monday morning. At first I thought Mary had maybe taken a turn. ‘Almost every day you would see Arthur out with her, taking her a walk along the sea front. He kept it a regular thing, as a routine, which is obviously important for someone with an illness like hers. ‘I never heard them argue or losing their temper with each other. It must have been really hard for him. Their daughter would take Mary out to the shops in Largs.’ Dr Tear, born in Denbeath, Fife, married his wife in 1948 in Rutherglen, Lanarkshire, near her home town of Cambuslang. They went on to have four children – Mhairi, Marjorie and twin boys Alastair and Hamish. Investigation: Inquiries into the incident are ongoing but it is understood that police are not looking for anyone else in connection with the deaths . It is understood Dr Tear first came to work as a locum for the Cumbrae Medical Practice before later settling on the island for good. He and his wife moved to Millport in the 1980s and stayed in the same house after Dr Tear retired around 1986. A few years ago, they had to deal with the heartbreak of losing their eldest daughter Mhairi and, in October 2012, Dr Tear arranged for a commemorative window plaque to be installed in her memory at Millport’s historic Garrison House. None of the couple’s family lives on the island. Their son Alastair – a company director with a Glasgow-based shipping firm – lives in Newton Mearns, near Glasgow, and his twin brother, Hamish, works as a professional photographer in Wyoming in the US. The couple’s surviving daughter, Marjorie, now lives in Jersey with her family. Residents in Millport said she often visited and would take her mother out for trips. It is believed Mrs Tear, 88, was suffering from a form of dementia that had worsened rapidly over the space of 18 months. She would go to Marina’s Hairdressers every six weeks, often brought in by her daughter. The owner noticed a deterioration in Mrs Tear’s health. She said: ‘I came into the shop just over a week ago and Mrs Tear was getting her hair cut. She didn’t want to engage in any conversation. And in her appointments before that she’d get quite mixed up. ‘Dr Tear always made sure she was wrapped up when they went out for a walk. I remember Dr Tear when he worked as a doctor when I was a wee girl. He worked as a GP on the island for at least 40 years.’","Bodies of Arthur Tear and wife Mary discovered at their home on Monday .

'There were many times on the air in recent years where I nearly said that I'm transgender,' she said. 'I knew from around the same time that I knew I wanted to be on the radio that something wasn't right. 'I didn't feel complete, I didn't feel like it locked. I felt like a square peg in a round hole but I didn't know why and I couldn't work it out.' Stephanie has received messages of support from loyal listeners keen to have the personality back on-air . Hirst, who also hosted the Hit40UK national commercial radio Top 40 chart between 2003 and 2006, took the decision to leave the popular breakfast show because 'I got to the point in my life where I had to stop doing what I was doing to have some time out to focus on me, because I have devoted my entire life to radio'. She said the torment of carrying the secret around was like 'someone poking you in the arm constantly, just tapping you. It's like that every single day'. 'From the minute I woke up to the minute I went to sleep it was always there. 'The thought was there in my head constantly.' Hirst said: 'I'd drive home in the car - I'd be driving home on the M1 and, honestly, I could have just turned the wheel to the central reservation. I didn't of course. Or I would scream. 'I remember sitting in my kitchen rocking backwards and forwards going ""just make this stop, go away, leave me alone"" and I felt like she was eating me up inside.' Asked how listeners would react, she said: 'I'm just me, I'm the same person. 'I'm not going to flounce around in flowery dresses all day. I'm just me, I'm just a human being, I still love people, still care for people the same way - nothing changes. 'And for anyone who is going through this or anyone who's thinking of going through this we don't change, we don't change. Yes, the exterior changes but we're still the same people.'

"A millionaire former Tory donor defected to UKIP today and announced he was handing the party £1million to fight the next election - because he was angry at being called a 'nobody' by William Hague. Arron Banks, who has previously given tens of thousands of pounds to the Conservatives, said he was only going to give Nigel Farage's party £100,000 - but decided to increase it by £900,000 after Mr Hague's jibe. The announcement, timed to disrupt David Cameron's set-piece party conference speech this morning, comes after the Tories were left stunned by the double defection of rebel backbenchers Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless. But David Cameron today warned voters who back UKIP at the next election that they risk 'going to bed with Nigel Farage and waking up with Ed Miliband'. Scroll down for video . David Cameron was stung this morning after Tory donor Arron Banks (right) announced he was defecting to UKIP . Mr Farage said the Tories were paying for insulting UKIP supporters like multi-millionaire Mr Banks (right) Mr Banks was accompanied by Mr Farage and party chairman Steve Crowther when he made the announcement at a press conference at a country hotel near Bristol . Potshot: Commons leader William Hague dismissed Mr Banks (pictured) as someone he'd 'never heard of' Speaking this morning, Mr Hague - the Commons leader - dismissed the importance of Mr Banks' defection. He said: 'I’ve never heard of him so we are not going to get too upset about that. It’s certainly not going to overshadow the prime minister’s speech today that someone we haven’t heard of has gone to Ukip.' The remarks infuriated Mr Banks, causing him to increase his planned donation to UKIP. Speaking to reporters this evening he said: 'In light of that and in view of the fact that I am a strong advocate of leaving the EU, I've decided to donate £1million to the party and not the £100,000 originally agreed.' He added: 'Mr Hague will now know who I am.' Mr Farage said the donation had capped a 'remarkable week' for UKIP following Mr Reckless's defection on Saturday. He also lashed out at the personal attacks directed against UKIP during the Tory party conference in Birmingham. The UKIP leader attacked Boris Johnson's claim that UKIP defectors were the type of people of had sex with vacuum cleaners. Mr Farage said it was an 'incredibly crude' jibe. The UKIP leader has already announced two Tory MP defections, but has claimed he is discussions with many more . Mr Farage said the donation had capped a 'remarkable week' for UKIP following Mr Reckless's defection on Saturday . Recent Tory defections to UKIP have sparked an angry torrent of abuse against Mr Farage's party at the Conservative conference in Birmingham this week. Boris Johnson accused defectors of being the kind of people who had sex with vacuum cleaners - while former Chancellor Ken Clarke said the party's supporters were 'grumpy old men' who had led 'disappointing lives'. In his conference speech today, Mr Cameron warned backing UKIP would only help Labour to victory. He said: 'If you vote UKIP – that's really a vote for Labour. Here's a thought - on 7th May you could go to bed with Nigel Farage, and wake up with Ed Miliband.' The Prime Minister quipped: 'I don't know about you but not one bit of that works for me.' Mr Banks – an insurance supremo – will hand over a cheque to Mr Farage for £100,000 today in a major boost to UKIP. Mr Banks told Sky News he did not believe the Prime Minister would succeed in his efforts to reform the European Union or leave it. He said: ‘I’ve supported the Conservatives for a number of years but have come to the realisation that only Ukip supports my views. ‘Being a member of the EU is like having a first class ticket on the Titanic. Economically, remaining in the EU is unsustainable.’ David Cameron arrived back in Downing Street this evening after his conference speech in Birmingham . On his way back to London the PM stopped with is wife Samantha at the Five Guys Burger Bar at Touchwood in Solihul, West Midlands . The latest defection is timed to hit Mr Cameron on the day he made his set-piece address to the Conservative Party conference . The Prime Minister today warned voters that a vote for UKIP was a vote for Labour and would help Ed Miliband into Downing Street . The move is the latest in a series of announcements designed to disrupt the Tories’ final party conference before the general election. Over the weekend Mr Reckless became the second Tory MP to jump ship and trigger and a Commons by-election rather than sit as a UKIP MP. Former deputy mayor of London Richard Barnes has also declared he is switching allegiance. Mr Banks said: ‘We are being dragged down to the lowest common denominator of financial growth when we should be looking to trade worldwide and should be basing our future prosperity on a long-term global outlook. ‘The Conservative Party try to sell us the myth that EU reform is achievable when frankly all Cameron can offer is tinkering around the edges. He is not even able to bring himself to say that he would support UK exit if his supposed reforms do not work.’ Nigel Farage has left the Tories reeling after convincing two Tory MPs to switch to UKIP, including Mark Reckless (right) Rebel backbench MP Douglas Carswell became the first Tory MP to quit to join UKIP, after making the shock announcement at a press conference last month . Labour frontbencher Michael Dugher said: ‘David Cameron is haemorrhaging support and his authority is ebbing away. He can’t control his party, who clearly have no confidence in his leadership. ‘And once again we see that Ukip are reliant on Tory money as well as Tory policy and Tory politicians, putting paid to the idea that they stand up for working people.’","Millionaire  donor Arron Banks said he was switching to UKIP this morning .

"Leverett Johnson (pictured) has been charged with robbery and aggravated assault . A would-be robbery suspect was beaten up when he found out the hard way that a convenience store clerk on the University of Pittsburgh campus is also a former Golden Gloves boxing champ. The boxer, Eric Sydnor, told KDKA-TV he just did what he had to do when 45-year-old Leverett Johnson walked into the convenience store with a gun on Saturday night. 'He got slammed,' Sydnor told the station. Johnson was still in the hospital on Tuesday, recovering from the beating Sydnor administered, police said. Johnson, of Pittsburgh, has been charged with robbery, aggravated assault and criminal mischief. Online court records today showed he faces a preliminary hearing Oct. 15, but did not yet have a defense attorney. Sydnor was the Western Pennsylvania Golden Gloves champion two years ago and still boxes out of a gym in nearby Sharpsburg, said Jose Caraballo, a pro boxer who trains Sydnor. Caraballo said that Sydnor injured a tendon in his hand during the incident, and that Johnson bit Sydnor. He's hoping the injury doesn't delay Sydnor's training. Sydnor said while his boxing skills came in handy, his decision to stop the robbery was about something more important. 'The fact that I'm a boxer had nothing to do with anything,' Sydnor told KDKA. 'It's just what's right and what's wrong.'","Eric Sydnor was the Western Pennsylvania Golden Gloves champion two years ago .

"Brussels Airport has announced that it will begin screening passengers arriving from Ebola-stricken countries Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Incoming passengers arriving from these three countries will have their temperatures taken starting today, the airport operator revealed. Those showing a fever will be questioned by a nurse or doctor at the airport, and immediately sent to hospital if they are suspected of having the deadly virus. A member of the US Coast Guard takes the temperature of an arriving passenger at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago, Illinois. Major airports in the United States as well  other international gateways have started ramping up health checks for signs of the virus in passengers who may be arriving from Ebola hotspots . Erika Vlieghe, who was appointed Belgium's national Ebola co-ordinator on Friday, said the measures add 'value' to the screenings already being done in West Africa before departure, EU Observer reported. But Ms Vlieghe admitted that the chances that temperature screenings catch an Ebola case are small. She noted that the measures were 'primarily to remove the increasing worries' of airport workers, adding that some will receive additional training on how to safely clean aircraft and how to react when someone has symptoms. Four flights a week from the area concerned arrive weekly at Brussels Airport, including twice weekly flights from the Liberian capital of Monrovia. Airport physician Dr Bargain demonstrates the use of a thermometer on an actor during a visit for members of the media to highlight measures to screen passengers for the Ebola virus, at the Charles de Gaulle airport . Airport physician Dr Bargain (left) speaks with French Health Minister Marisol Touraine (second right) about measures taken to inform travelers on the Ebola virus, during a press visit at the Charles de Gaulle airport . Trade unions in Brussels had previously urged urged Brussels Airlines - the only European airline still flying to West Africa - to upgrade security procedures to better protect airline staff and passengers from the threat of Ebola. Last week, Belgium was criticized for reportedly being the only European country still accepting flights from the epicentre of the Ebola crisis. Passengers arriving on recent flights from Monrovia reported being screened before leaving Liberia but little or no extra health checks for Ebola when they landed in Brussels. A Nigerian health official uses a thermometer on a worker at the arrivals hall of Murtala Muhammed International Airport in Lagos. Nigeria has been declared Ebola-free after a 42-day period with no new cases . Men look at an information screen displays that Air France flight AF755 from Conakry has arrived at Charles de Gaulle International Airport. Ebola-screening measures were begun at the airport on Saturday . Many passengers were joining connecting flights to the United States, NBC reported. Airport officials in Brussels  defended the decision not to screen people arriving from West Africa, saying there there were emergency procedures in place in the event signs of Ebola show up on a flight. Brussels Airport has announced that it will begin screening passengers arriving from Ebola-stricken countries Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone . But they say they have not yet needed to activate those procedures. Thomas Eric Duncan, the Liberian man who died from Ebola last week in a hospital in Texas, traveled through Brussels on his way from Africa to the United States. The total death toll of the Ebola outbreak, first detected in March deep in the forests of southern Guinea, has risen to more than 4,500, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Although Senegal and Nigeria have been declared Ebola-free, the epidemic remains out of control in Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia. WHO warns that by December there could be as many as 10,000 new infections per week. The deadly virus has also reached Spain and the United States but outbreaks have been contained so far. Major airports in the United States as well as London's Heathrow and other international gateways have started ramping up health checks for signs of the virus in passengers who may be arriving from Ebola hotspots. Similar screening measures were begun Saturday at Paris' Charles de Gaulle airport, where one daily flight arrives from Conakry, Guinea. There are no other direct flights to Paris from the other West African countries most affected by the virus. On Friday, Brussels Airport also revealed  it had hired a specialized firm to check baggage coming from Ebola-hit regions, after a union told its members to no longer handle such items. The company will screen luggage from Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia and destroy any it suspects may be contaminated. Belgium's socialist union on Wednesday had called on its members at Brussels Airport to no longer handle baggage from infected areas. The airport said in a statement it was 'taking such concerns seriously'. The total death toll of the Ebola outbreak has risen to more than 4,500, according to  WHO.

She told Daily Mail Australia: 'It was very windy, I was surprised when I read on Facebook about the incident. 'I hope the kids get better and wish them all the best. It was my middle child's birthday yesterday and he asked if we could have a jumping castle out and I said no because of the winds. Bannockburn is a small rural town near Geelong, in Melbourne, Victoria . 'People book the jumping castles ahead and we have to look at the how the weather is at the time and make a decision on the day, I would not have let one be hired out for the outside yesterday. 'You always read about this kind of thing happening but never think it is going to happen that near you.' A spokeswoman for Aaron's Amusements in Melbourne said they cancelled two bookings because of the weather forecasts. She said: 'There are strict rules in Australia about this kind of thing and we did cancel parties because of the forecasts. 'Customers do get upset but safety has to come first.

"Madame Tussauds in New York will today unveil the newest members of their royal waxwork collection: Prince Harry and Her Majesty the Queen. The pair will join the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge as part of a 'royal set' which set to go on tour at the Madame Tussauds attractions across the world. The figures will be in New York through the end of the year. Prince Harry’s wax figure is dressed in a Dege & Skinner suit from Savile Row -- created by the actual tailor he uses for his uniforms, and he is adorned with medals: a set of three Court-Mounted full-size medals, three pairs of gilt and enamel Garter Stars, and one pair of Flying Wings.

A spokesman for Madame Tussauds New York told Mail Online Travel: 'This will be a very special experience and, for many, the only opportunity to get up close and personal with the royal family. 'We hope the new royal set will be a hit with US visitors especially on the heels of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's exciting baby news. 'William and Kate have always been a favorite in the attraction and we're excited to expand our royal family, and have the new figures of Queen Elizabeth and Prince Harry alongside them. Madame Tussauds studio artists were invited to the Palace to obtain exact measurements, photos and detailed notes of the dress - which is embellished with approximately 10,000 Swarovski crystals and took over 60 hours to complete. Madame Tussauds hopes to capitalise on royal fever in the US and the popularity of the British monarchs . New York's newest figures will join the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge as part of a 'royal set' Her jewelry is all handmade and includes the George IV State Diadem, the Garter Star, the Garter Badge, the insignia of the Royal Order of George V and George VI, and Colette necklace and earrings.

"It was a heart-melting discovery of a lost love letter written 68 years ago. Addressed to 'dearest darling Hilda' from gunner Eric Winspear, each page was affectionately marked with kisses instead of numbers and detailed the excitement of the couple's impending marriage.

We will have a good time being together all the time and going to dances,' he continued.

'I'm very pleased she got the letter back because it was something that mum treasured,' she said. Owner of Adra Op Shop, Jacqui Dodd, said she had 'goosebumps' when she found the love letter . The note was found inside a pocket of a donated handbag about three weeks ago . It was a tearful moment for Hilda Winspear, now 87 and at a nursing home, when she saw the recovered letter. 'I couldn't have got a better man, no matter where I'd gone,' Mrs Winspear told Today. Evidently it was a precious piece of memory for Mrs Winspear who did marry the love of her life, exactly a year after the letter was written. 'They first met at a dance before the war and their romance blossomed from there,' Ms Shaw told Daily Mail Australia. 'They were a very loving couple who did everything together including a tour around Australia for 15 years in a caravan in the mid-90s.' Together the couple went on to raise four children and moved from Britain to Australia in 1970. 'Dad was a very affectionate man and he loved writing letters so he was the one that kept in touch with everyone back home when we moved to Australia,' Ms Shaw said. The couple were married for 66 years until Mr Winspear died on January 29 at the age of 90.","A seven-page love letter written in 1946 was discovered in a donated handbag .

"A reporter covering a story about a missing boy has found the youngster in a neighbor's yard. Cameron Polom, who works for WFTS in Tampa, Florida, discovered 10-year-old Paul Ezekiel Fagan on Friday after going to his neighborhood to cover a press conference about his disappearance. Paul, who has a mild learning disability, was last seen playing in the front yard of his grandmother's home at 4pm Thursday. He later told cops he ran away because he needed space from his brother. His disappearance sparked a massive search by helicopter and sheriff's dogs. Scroll down for video . Safe: Ten-year-old Paul Ezekiel Fagan, left, was found covered in dirt in his neighbor's yard by WFTS reporter Cameron Polom, right, in Tampa, Florida the day after he went missing last week . Polom, 29, was walking through the neighborhood with his cameraman after the press conference when he saw a mud-covered child matching Paul's description behind a neighbor's fence. 'I thought to myself, ""oh this couldn't be the boy, no way"",' Polom told ABC News. 'I walked over and said, ""Hey bud what's your name?"" He mumbled ""Paul"" and then I asked if I could pick him up over the fence and he gave me a huge hug before we walked over to the officers parked in front of his house.' Polom said Paul, who looked worried that he might be in trouble, told him he had spent the night in the neighbor's backyard and had eluded police because of overgrown vegetation. Found: His news crew captured the moment Polom took the boy to sheriff's deputies on Friday . Heading home: An officer then took him to his grandmother (in white), who has custody of the boy . Loved: WFTS also caught the moment he was reunited with his father after he was found safe on Friday . 'He told me he simply needed space from his little brother,' Polom said. The news team captured the moment that Polom took Paul to an officer and then reunited him with his grandmother, Hazel Epps, who has custody of the boy. 'Oh, baby. Oh, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus!' she cried as he ran towards her. Hours later, the news crew also captured the moment he was reunited with his father. He ran towards his dad and jumped into his arms for a massive hug. 'It's like a wonderful joy - like your son first being born,' his father said. 'I love him.' Debbie Carter, a public information officer for the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office, said the boy was 'just fine' and back in his grandmother's care. Concerns: Paul, pictured left and right when he was greeted by his father, told Polom that he needed space from his younger brother and ran away from his grandmother's house as they played in the yard . Speaking to Today, Polom said Paul might have approached him because he does not have a threatening appearance. Paul had referred to Polom as 'the skinny guy in a suit' to his relatives. 'I'm not a guy who's walking around with a gun on my hip. I don't have a badge on my chest,' Polom said. 'Maybe he just wasn't afraid to come up to me.' Polom said he was just happy he could help and shouldn't take the credit for the happy outcome. 'I was just in the right place at the right time,' he said. 'I wasn't out there all night looking for him like the deputies were. Those guys did all the work. I just happened to be there at the right time.'

"Thomas Menino, the former mayor of Boston who shepherded his city through its darkest hour after a terrorist attack at the Boston Marathon, has died of cancer at age 71. Menino was the longest-serving mayor in the city's history. He led City Hall for consecutive terms in city hall and reshaped the Back Bay into a modern, gleaming metropolis during his tenure. His tenure began 1993 and ended in January. He was diagnosed with cancer shortly after leaving office and handing over the reigns to Marty Walsh. Last week, he announced that he was suspending his book tour and halting cancer treatments so that he could spend more time with his family. Former Boston Mayor Thomas Menino has died of cancer. He was diagnosed shortly after leaving office in January - but it didn't stop him from attending the first Boston Marathon after the 2013 terrorist attacks . Leader: Menino was in the hospital recovering from surgery when the Boston Marathon bombs went off. He checked himself out against his doctor's orders so that he could be at the first press conference . He died peacefully in the company of his family from advanced cancer. On April 15, 2013, less than three weeks after he announced that he would not seek a sixth term as mayor, two homemade bombs exploded near the finish line of the Boston Marathon - the city's marquee event. Three people were killed and more than 260 injured. Many lost limbs and were horribly maimed by the crude explosives packed with ball bearings. Menino was in a hospital recovering from surgery from a broken leg when the bombings struck. He checked himself out against doctor's orders so that he could attend the first press conference. During the ensuing manhunt for the terrorists and havoc that briefly led to the entire city going into lockdown and public transit shutting down, Menino was a calming presence. He hoisted himself out of his wheelchair during one public event after the bombings so that he could stand behind the podium and declare: 'We are one Boston. No adversity, no challenge, nothing can tear down the resilience in the heart of this city and its people.' Menino dramatically hoisted himself out of his wheelchair three days after the bombing so that he could stand at Cathedral Holy Cross and declare: 'We are one Boston. No adversity, no challenge, nothing can tear down the resilience in the heart of this city and its people' Menino was City Council President and was appointed Acting Mayor when President Bill Clinton named his predecessor to an ambassadorship . Visionary: Menino told developers who brought him the initial design of 111 Huntington Avenue: 'Guys, flat roofs don’t make it.' He personally approved the crown that ultimately topped the building . President Barack Obama: 'Bold, big-hearted, and Boston strong, Tom was the embodiment of the city he loved and led for more than two decades. As Boston’s longest-serving mayor, Tom helped make his hometown the vibrant, welcoming, world-class place it is today. His legacy lives on in every neighborhood he helped revitalize, every school he helped turn around, and every community he helped make a safer, better place to live.' Secretary of State John Kerry: 'Others talked, Tommy worked. Crime fell, population rose, the skyline became world-class, schools got better, the financial, academic, and medical sectors thrived, and neighborhoods became more diverse. It was in those neighborhoods that Mayor Menino made his mark.His example for 20 years as Mayor taught us all a lot about people and politics, and his example the last year taught us even more about grace and grit.' Boston Mayor Marty Walks: 'To any who had come to know him, it is no surprise that more than half of Boston had a direct interaction with Tom Menino. No man possessed a greater love for our City, and his dedicated life in service to Boston and her people and changed the face of the City.' Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg: 'Tom Menino was a terrific mayor and a close partner for me. I got to know Tom well as we worked together to keep cities safe from gun violence. In 2006, we formed Mayors Against Illegal Guns -- and what began as a meeting of 15 mayors ultimately became a coalition of more than 1,000 mayors from around the country.' US Senator Elizabeth Warren: 'The City of Boston lost a great fighter today. Mayor Tom Menino used his big heart, his strong voice, and his fierce determination to shape every corner of the city. Bruce and I send our prayers to Mayor Menino’s wife Angela, to his family, and to all Bostonians. Our mayor is gone, but he lives on in every neighborhood in Boston.' A liberal Democrat in a liberal Democratic city, Menino helped found Mayors Against Illegal Guns, which has stepped up its gun control campaign in the wake of the school massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut. However, he also worked to appeal to conservative voters in East Boston and won each re-election by landslide margins of at least 15 points. He was City Counsel President in 1993 when President Bill Clinton named Boston Mayor Raymond Flynn as US Ambassador the Vatican. Menino was named acting mayor by default. The Boston Globe reports that a community newspaper at the time declared him 'Action Mayor Tom Menino' and Mineno liked the the misspelling so much that he vowed to live up to it. He won the 1993 election by a landslide, becoming the city's first Italian-American to run City Hall. In his tenure as mayor, he oversaw a remarkable transformation in Boston. He used the city's wealth of elite universities to help recruit high-tech and financial firms that brought high-paying jobs. He oversaw the construction of gleaming skyscrapers that transformed the skyline of Boston's Back Bay. When the developers proposed a 36-story tower next to the Prudential Tower, he vetoed the initial design and told them: 'Guys, flat roofs don’t make it.' He then personally approved the illuminated crown design that makes 111 Huntington one of the most recognizable towers in the city. Menino was known for his folksy down-to-earth style. He often got tongue-tied while making speeches and was known as 'Mumbles Menino' for his gaffs. But even as he worked to redevelop and redefine Boston, he prided himself on being a man of the people. The Globe reports that fully half of Bostonians said in a recent poll that they had personally met Menino - a remarkable feat in a city of nearly 650,000 people. He was known for showing up and strolling through some of the city's toughest and far-flung neighborhoods. He attended hundreds, perhaps thousands, of ribbon cutting ceremonies - from burrito shops to community centers to mulltimillion-dollar skyscrapers.","Menino was Boston's longest-serving mayor - in office from 1993 until January 2014 .

"Vulnerable  teenagers are being  sexually assaulted by gangs of men in towns and cities across the country, the child protection expert who exposed the scale of abuse in Rotherham told MPs today. Professor Alexis Jay was in the Commons following her bombshell report in August which revealed around 1,400 children had been raped and abused by gangs of Asian men in the South Yorkshire town. She said the level of abuse went unreported for 16 years because staff feared they would be seen as racist. But speaking today Professor Jay said the problem was not confined to Rotherham. Asked by MPs whether the abuse was happening in towns and cities elsewhere in the country, she said: ‘Yes I do believe that. I certainly don’t think Rotherham is unique.’ Professor Jay's report into the Rotherham abuse scandal revealed child protection staff did not speak out about Asian gangs raping young girls for fear of being labelled 'racist' Children as young as 11 were trafficked, beaten, and raped by large numbers of men between 1997 and 2013 in Rotherham. More than a third of the cases were already know to agencies. But Professor Jay said: 'Several staff described their nervousness about identifying the ethnic origins of perpetrators for fear of being thought racist'. She condemned the 'blatant' collective failures by the council's leadership, concluding: 'It is hard to describe the appalling nature of the abuse that child victims suffered.' The landmark report exposed widespread failures of the council, police and social services. It revealed victims were doused in petrol and threatened with being set alight, terrorised with guns, made to witness brutally-violent rapes and told they would be the next if they spoke out. The victims were raped by multiple abusers, trafficked to other towns and cities in the north of England, abducted, beaten and intimidated. Despite the abuse, police 'regarded many child victims with contempt' and some fathers who tried to rescue their children from abuse were arrested themselves. South Yorkshire Police and Crime Commissioner Shaun Wright resigned in the wake of Professor Jay's damning report . Prof Jay said the majority of the abusers were described as 'Asian men', and many were said to be of Pakistani origin. One young person told the inquiry that 'gang rape' was a usual part of growing up in the area of Rotherham where she lived. In two cases, fathers had tracked down their daughters and tried to remove them from houses where they were being abused - only to be arrested themselves when police were called to the scene. And one child declined her initial offer to give a statement after allegedly receiving a text from a perpetrator threatening to harm her younger sister. The failures happened despite three reports between 2002 and 2006 'which could not have been clearer in the description of the situation in Rotherham'. Prof Jay said the first of these reports was 'effectively suppressed' because senior officers did not believe the data. The other two were ignored, the professor said. Teachers reported seeing children as young as 11, 12 and 13 being picked up outside schools by cars and taxis, given presents and mobile phones and taken to meet large numbers of unknown men in Rotherham or other local towns and cities. The majority of victims believed the perpetrators to be their boyfriend who gave them gifts, alcohol and drugs. Some of the victims still maintain they were not groomed or abused. Analysing the case studies, Prof Jay said many of the children came from dysfunctional families, had parents with addictions, and had suffered domestic or sexual abuse as a child. Some had serious mental health problems. The spotlight first fell on Rotherham in 2010 when five men, described by a judge as 'sexual predators', were jailed for grooming teenage girls for sex. Mohsin Khan (left) and Umar Razaq (right) were two of five Asian men convicted of grooming of teenage girls in Rotherham in 2010 . The five men - Umar Razaq, Adil Hussain, Razwan Razaq, Zafran Ramzan, and Mohsin Khan - preyed on their victims over several months and threatened them with violence if they refused their advances. One of the men branded his victim a ‘white bitch’ when she resisted, while a second smirked: ‘I’ve used you and abused you.' The men, all British-born Pakistanis, attacked the four girls in play areas, parks and in the back of their cars, Sheffield Crown Court heard.","Professor Jay revealed 1,400 children abused by Asian men in Rotherham .

"Edinburgh city has ruled out a proposed 'bed tax' on tourists for the second time after a cool response from the Scottish Government and local hotels. Local authorities contacted Scottish ministers to discuss a voluntary 'transient visitor levy' which would impose an additional fee for every night's stay in Edinburgh. But concern over the reliability of income and whether enough hotels, B&Bs and guest houses would sign up saw the plan stall. Edinburgh city chiefs scrapped plans to tax tourists visiting the city extra per night for the second time . A proposal of a compulsory tax - which would have added between £1 and £2 per night to a room bill - were backed by the council in 2011 and they say up to £10 million could have been raised for festivals, venues and conference centres. The tax, however, would have needed new legislation to pass through the Scottish Parliament and ministers weren't responsive to a potential backlash against the move. City officials are now considering whether to create a Tourism Business Improvement District (TBID), which would see hotels pay levies to fund urban improvements. Tristan Nesbitt, chairman at the Edinburgh Hotels Association (EHA), said: 'The compulsory tourist levy was dropped as it was not deemed a fair, suitable and efficient way to raise additional funding. Funds raised from the 'bed tax' would have raised money for local festivals and venues . 'Those same reasons still apply to the business environment today and it is difficult to see how a voluntary scheme would be feasible or desirable by members of EHA. 'We would also worry that this additional cost could make Edinburgh even less price competitive as a destination to travellers on top of some of the highest VAT taxes and Air Passenger Duties in Europe.' But festival promoters said it was unlikely large numbers of high-paying overseas tourists would be put off by a bed tax, particularly during the Fringe. Scottish Highlands Council is considering a similar fee but VisitScotland has urged against it . Tommy Sheppard, director of The Stand comedy club said: 'I think it might have a deleterious effect on the weekend break market, particularly in the off-peak months. 'But in terms of peak demand, I don't think it would present a great barrier compared to the considerable charges already being levied, and it creates a pot of money that's ring-fenced for visitor improvements.' Council finance leader Alasdair Rankin, said: 'The idea of a voluntary Transient Visitor Levy has now been ruled out, however Marketing Edinburgh continues to explore options around a TBID for the city.'","Edinburgh 'bed tax' has been shelved after talks with Scottish government .

"A boy who posed with a cockatoo for his senior yearbook picture has expressed his surprise that the school got in a flap about it – and banned the photograph. Officials at Glens Falls High School in New York told 17-year-old Ben Brodeur that allowing animal-themed photographs could open the floodgates for incendiary poses, such as students making rude gestures or gang signs. Brodeur, however, thought that the school was over-reacting. Officials at Glens Falls High School in New York told 17-year-old Ben Brodeur that allowing animal-themed photographs in the yearbook could escalate into something incendiary . The superintendent of the school (pictured), Paul Jenkins, said that if parents want to publish a less formal photograph of their child in the yearbook they can pay for it to appear in the back . He told the Glens Falls Post-Star: 'I think that's kind of a far stretch.' Brodeur's family fosters and cares for around 22 rescued exotic birds, including parakeets and macaws, which they offer up for adoption after rehabilitating them. 'Parrots are a big part of my life and I wanted to be remembered that way,' Brodeur said. The cockatoo he posed with is special, he said, because it was his first umbrella cockatoo. 'He is just a big sweetheart. He'll cuddle,' he added. He has now started a petition to have the school's decision reversed. The school's superintendent Paul Jenkins said that if parents want to publish a less formal photograph of their child in the yearbook they can pay for it to appear in the back, as an advertisement.

"Extraordinary coincidence: Convicted paedophile Andrew Sadler (pictured in 2012) taught at schools attended by David Cameron, Prince Edward and 'psycho' banker Rurik Jutting . A convicted paedophile who was caught in bed with two child prostitutes in Romania taught at schools attended by David Cameron, Prince Edward - and 'psycho' banker Rurik Jutting. In an astonishing coincidence, MailOnline can reveal that Andrew Sadler, who was jailed after abusing two 15-year-old boys, was a teacher at prestigious boarding schools where the prime minister, princes Andrew and Edward, and the trader accused of murdering two sex workers in Hong Kong were all pupils. Sadler was also a member of the notorious Paedophile Information Exchange (PIE) - a vile web of perverts that at one stage was linked to three of Labour's most senior figures, including deputy leader Harriet Harman. He taught French at £6,600-a-term Abberley Hall in Worcestershire when Jutting was a pupil in the early 1990s. Sadler had previously taught at the prestigious Heatherdown Preparatory School near Ascot, Berks, now closed, and is even pictured in a school photograph with a young David Cameron and Prince Edward in 1977. In one image from his time at Heatherdown, Sadler stands just a row in front of a ten-year-old David Cameron in 1976-77. Sadler taught French and Spanish and was also one of the staff members charged with keeping an eye on boys during dormitory duty. There is no suggestion any abuse happened at Heatherdown, which closed down in 1982 while Sadler was standing in as headteacher. Prince Edward attended Heatherdown for five years until 1977, when he was 13, while David Cameron spent five years at the school before leaving in 1979 for Eton. It is not known if Sadler taught Mr Cameron or Prince Edward directly - although he was at the school at the same time. Exclusive: Before he was a teacher at Jutting's school, Sadler (far right) taught French and Spanish at Heatherdown prep schoolwhen David Cameron (back left) and Prince Edward (middle row) were puils . In this picture from his time at Heatherdown, Sadler stands just a row in front of a ten-year-old David Cameron . Sadler (seen, left in 1994) went on to teach Rurik Jutting (pictured, right, being driven to court accused of murder in Hong Kong) at Abberley Hall, where he was reported to police and took 'early retirement' in 1995 . Rhidian Llewellyn, an education consultant and former teacher at Heatherdown, told MailOnline: 'I can confirm the Andrew Sadler who taught at Heatherdown was later convicted [of child abuse]. 'I was absolutely shocked. I can't confirm if he directly taught them [David Cameron and Prince Edward], but it was a small school, about 80 or 90 boys. 'There was no suggestion anything went on at the school though.' Former pupil Alexander Bathurst said: 'I remember him [Sadler] very well, he taught me for at least a couple of years. I was an awful student and he was an extremely competent teacher.' Mr Bathurst, now a life skills and leadership consultant from Cirencester, Gloucestershire, said Sadler stood in as head shortly after he had left and before the school closed in 1982. 'Mr Sadler would have certainly taught David Cameron and Prince Edward. 'Cameron was in the year below me and Prince Andrew in the year above,' he said. 'The majority of the teachers in those days were generalists and Mr Sadler taught just about every subject in the curriculum.' Sadler taught French at £6,600-a-term Abberley Hall (above) when Jutting was a pupil there in the early 1990s . He says Sadler taught English, Latin and Geography and history. 'He also took us in sports: rugby, cricket, football, I remember he loved cricket and he umpired the games.'  He said he was 'extremely surprised' at the later conviction. It also emerged today that Sadler went on to teach Rurik Jutting at Abberley Hall boarding school in Worcestershire, where he was reported to police and took 'early retirement' in 1995. Jutting is accused of slaughtering two prostitutes in Hong Kong last week in an unexplained act of savagery. While Sadler was never charged with abusing any children at Abberley - and there has been no suggestion that Jutting was among his victims - he was convicted in 2000 in Romania. He was found guilty of having sex with a 14-year-old boy and engaging in an obscene act in the presence of a juvenile in Romania after being caught in bed with two under-age male prostitutes. Lifestyle: Former public schoolboy and Cambridge graduate Rurik Jutting dated a string of beautiful Asian girls. He is accused of slaughtering two prostitutes in Hong Kong last week in an unexplained act of savagery . These photos show Rurik Jutting while he was a pupil at the £34,000-a-year boarding school, Winchester College. One photo was published in the 2000-2001 yearbook while the other featured in the 2002-2003 edition . They were found in a squalid property which had been covered with newspapers to stop anyone looking inside. It was then that his sickening double-life was finally exposed. British police who helped the Romanians convict him described Sadler as a key member of a network of public school paedophiles. He was described as the 'quartermaster' of PIE – it was his 'job' to help co-ordinate other abusers in their ceaseless search for the world's most vulnerable children. Police believe Sadler – who confessed to a colleague of having 'sex with hundreds and hundreds' of boys – was an associate of PIE leaders including its treasurer Charles Napier and founder-member Morris Fraser. PIE, which in the 1970s lobbied for sex between adults and children to be decriminalised, helped paedophiles to secretly pass around their young victims. Sadler, who now lives 100 yards from another prep school, told the Mail: 'Yes, I was a teacher at Abberley, but I don't know [Jutting]. I didn't teach him and I don't recognise him from the photograph.' Asked about his paedophile activities, he said: 'It has all been a terrible misunderstanding. I have been fighting to clear my name for 14 years. 'I am the subject of a SOPO [Sexual Offences Prevention Order] which prevents me from associating with boys under 18 and I have to notify the police if I leave the country.' From angelic schoolboy to bloated 'zombie' banker: Rurik Jutting pictured aged six at Wallop Preparatory School in Weybridge, Surrey in 1990 (left) and (right) while working as an investment trader in Hong Kong . 'Not he most popular kid in the school': A former classmate at Wallop Preparatory School in Weybridge, Surrey said Jutting (second right, middle row) was 'a bit of a strange chap' in his days at the school . He said he had previously visited other countries including Hong Kong, adding: 'I have been to all over that part of the world as a teacher. 'There is a lot of poverty, which is why a lot of these girls go into prostitution - I have to say with their parents' knowledge.' He spent 16 months of a four-year sentence in jail in Romania before being deported back to Britain on medical grounds. In 2007, he then breached an interim court order not to have children under 18 at his home after he allowed a 15-year-old to smoke cannabis, drink beer and stay overnight. Worcester Crown Court heard Sadler had employed an 18-year-old gardener who brought the youth along to his house. In a failed attempt to appeal the ban, Sadler maintained he was only 'helping' a vulnerable boy who was having problems with his parents, it was reported by Worcester News at the time. Sadler had claimed the order was 'unjust' telling the court: 'I have never gone near a child in my life. 'I'm not a paedophile and think the whole subject is abhorrent. I was helping the boy purely out of compassion.' 'Can still feel her presence': Seneng  in a photograph from the family album. Her parents said she 'a lovely girl' who always helped around the house when she was still at school and later on the family's coconut plantation . Quashing his appeal, Judge Andrew Geddes said: 'It is highly probable the boy was at his home to be groomed for sexual ventures. It is a very similar situation to the one in Romania.' Sadler was subsequently given a full SOPO that also banned him from working with children under 16. Details of Sadler's links to Jutting emerged after the British trader was accused of slaughtering two prostitutes in Hong Kong last week in an unexplained act of savagery. Speaking to the Mail yesterday, Michael Haggard, former headmaster of Abberley Hall, said: 'There was never any suggestion that Sadler had done anything wrong while at the school. 'I have no reason to think that anything happened.' He described Jutting as 'a highly intelligent and respected chap', adding: 'He excelled in academics but he also did a lot of other things. Seneng, also known as Jesse Lorena (pictured posing with cash) was found by police with her throat slashed at Jutting's apartment . 'He played musical instruments and was in lots of sport teams. He got on well with his peers and teachers. 'He was very intelligent and got a scholarship to Winchester College, which is not a terribly easy thing to do.' Police in Hong Kong are expected to carry out a video reconstruction of the alleged murders at Cambridge-educated Jutting's high-rise apartment in the near future. The former Merrill Lynch banker has been asked to take part in the exercise, ahead of his next court appearance on Monday. A spokesman for the princes said: 'It's in the public domain that and Prince Andrew and Prince Edward were both educated at Heatherdown Preparatory School. 'I don't have any further information.' MailOnline has also contacted David Cameron for comment.","Andrew Sadler taught at Heatherdown school with Prince Edward and PM .

"Everyone has their reasons for travelling - be it to get the ultimate tan, taste exotic dishes or dive into history - but most of us have the same goal in mind. TripAdvisor's new TripBarometer: Psychology of Travel report, examined motivations behind holiday choices and found that 'enhancing perspective' drives 71 per cent of global travellers to go on holiday. But precise motivations vary from continent to continent. North Americans, for example, hope to strengthen relationships with loved ones, while Europeans really just want to brag about their experiences. Travellers are also nine times more likely to crave unique rather than pampered experiences, while 38 per cent of global holidaymakers expand their diets to include the new foods they tried during their travels. Five per cent of travellers say a trip motivated them to get engaged or married. And it's no surprise that holidaymakers are finding plenty of rewards from seeing the world. Forty-five per cent say they are inspired to be more tolerant of others when they return home, and 37 per cent are eager to learn a new language or skill that they encountered abroad.

Beytullah Gunduz, 28, recruited one of the assassins for the hit on 34-year-old Zafer Eren, a leading member of the 'Tottenham Turks', on his doorstep in Southgate, north London. Mr Eren was allegedly gunned down in revenge for the killing of Ali Armagan, a leading member of the rival 'Hackney Turks'. The trial in the suspects in the Armagan murder, which revealed that a member of the Eren family was responsible, ended at the Old Bailey in March 2013. Today, the Old Bailey heard how two days after the end of the trial, Gunduz contacted one of the hired hands involved in the hit on Zafer Eren. Prosecutor Ed Brown QC told the jury: 'The Crown say that this defendant was part of the planning for that killing, knowing what was afoot. 'He may not have known the precise time and date the killing would take place but he knowingly took part in the planning of the murder, the recruitment and at least one of the murders.' The court heard how the murder of Mr Eren was the latest chapter in a 'violent feud' between the two rival north London gangs, headed by the Eren and Armagan families. Mr Brown explained that the feud began in March 2009 when Ali Armagan's brother Kemal Armagan was beaten up at the Manor Club in Manor House. He said: 'He vowed to exact revenge and over the next few years there were a series of attacks, escalating to the use of guns and ultimately to murder and attempted murder.' In March 2009 innocent shopkeeper Ahmet Paytak, 50, was shot dead at Euro Food and Wines in Hornsey Road, Holloway, by a hitman hired by the Hackney Turks. On October 2, 2009, Tottenham Turk member Oktay Erbasli, was shot and killed while driving in Tottenham. Three days later the Tottenham Turks took revenge with the shooting of 21 year-old Cem Duzgun at a social club frequented by Hackney Turk members in Upper Clapton Road. Ali Armagan, left, whose murder sparked the revenge killing of Zafer Eren. Ahmet Paytak, right, was an innocent shopkeeper, who was shot dead after being shot by a hired hitman . The feud continued with the murder of 32 year-old Ali Armagan, 32, near Turnpike Lane tube station on February 1, 2012. Gunduz was allegedly present during one incident when a Hackney Turk was shot through the hand at a shop. Then on the evening of December 30, 2012, Zafer's cousin, 34 year-old Inan Eren, was shot in the arm, stomach and buttock on his own doorstep but survived. The trial of suspects charged with the murder of Ali Armagan began in February 2013, the court heard. Mr Brown added: 'It was during the trial that it became clear it was Kemal Eren who had been directly responsible. 'Two days after that trial had finished, on March 7, this defendant, who was associated with the Hackney Turks, contacted Samuel Zerei, who ultimately was to take a direct part in the killing of Zafer Eren.' Gunduz was also involved in sourcing a car for the hired killers although it was never used, the court heard. The Old Bailey heard how two days after the end of the trial into the murder of Ali Armagan, Gunduz contacted one of the hired hands involved in the hit on Zafer Eren . Jurors heard the hitman, Jamie Marsh-Smith, 22, and the getaway driver Samuel Zerei, 21, have both been found guilty of the murder of Zafer Eren. At 7.20pm on April 18, 2013, Zafar Eren was shot as he walked through the security gates to his home at Fontaine Court off Southgate High Street in North London. Marsh-Smith fired seven shots from the pavement, three of which struck Mr Eren in the back, before escaping in the back of a burgundy Peugeot 308 driven by Zerei. Mr Brown said: 'The killing of Zafer Eren would not have occurred had it not been for that feud between these two warring parties. It was not a random killing, it was ordered and organised. 'It is clear that hired hands were brought in to carry out the killing itself, willing to do the rival gang's dirty work for them.' Marsh-Smith, of Manor House, north London, and Zerei, of Newington Green, north London, were both convicted of murder. Gunduz, of Finsbury Park, denies conspiracy to murder. The trial continues.

"His friends admit that Abdullah Elmir, 17, who this week gained notoriety through his ISIS backed video rant against western society, was 'expected' to run away to the Middle East. 'Some expected it, like he used to talk about it a bit,' a friend told Daily Mail Australia. Distraught classmates from Condell Park High School, in Sydney's south-west, painted a picture of a complex young man on Thursday, describing him as both 'very quiet' and someone who 'enjoyed politicking'. Scroll down for video . Abu Khaled from Australia, thought to be Abdullah Elmir, speaks flanked by other ISIS fighters in the latest ISIS propaganda video . Distraught classmates from Condell Park High School, in Sydney's south-west, painted a picture of a complex young man on Thursday, describing him as both 'very quiet' while also someone who 'enjoyed politicking' In the YouTube video, Elmir, who now goes by the moniker Abu Khaled, declares that ISIS will not stop their murderous campaign 'until the black flag is flying high in every single land'. Australian security agencies are analysing the vision to determine whether a bearded man to Elmir's right is Mohamed Elomar, (one of the country's most wanted) the ISIS recruit believed responsible for radicalising and luring dozens of Australians to take up arms in the Middle East. While most of his best mates either closed ranks behind him or were too upset to speak, one of his childhood friends admitted to being in a state of shock. 'Yeah man, he's my friend and I don't want to talk about him,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'He was my mate but I don't talk about him'. But the teenage terrorist was described by another classmate as being 'very quiet, he was a good kid, we used to pray together at our mosque'. While most of his closest mates either closed ranks behind him or were too upset to speak, one of his childhood friends admitted to being in a state of shock . 'He did a little bit of debating here, he liked knowing politics and did some politicking but he was mostly very quiet and never, ever got into trouble,' he said. 'Abdullah was in theatre groups at school and he liked playing basketball a lot.' When asked if he was one of those who thought Abdullah was capable of running away, he added 'no, no I didn't expect that but I know a few of his other friends say they heard him mention it'. Professor Greg Barton, from Monash University's Global Terrorism Research Centre, said Elmir was recruited by another wanted terrorist, Mohammad Ali Baryalei, an Australian based in Syria. He said terror recruiters lured targets by making friends through social media, like many sexual predators. He said the boy appeared as a 'pawn in the machine' in the chilling video. 'He thinks he's the star ... but the reality is, his new friends have got him a one-way ticket,' Professor Barton said. 'He's not in charge of his own destiny at all, he's being used.' Professor Barton added that young people were the easiest to radicalise. Bearded ISIS fighters, holding rifles, flank the Australian jihadi as he preaches hate . 'Teenagers, 20-somethings, particularly young men more than young women, are vulnerable to making rash judgments,' he said. 'They tend to be more rebellious toward [older] generations and sceptical of establishment figures.' It is believed former Kings Cross bouncer Baryalei, 33, recruited Elmir through western Sydney street preaching group Parramatta Street Dawah. 'He's said to have recruited 30 plus young people - mostly in western Sydney through Street Dawah,' Prof Barton said. Before Elmir joined ISIS, the ginger jihad was employed as a butcher in a shop in Bankstown, The Daily Telegraph. 'He made his own bed now he has to lie in it,' his former boss said. 'He was a good kid. The best kid.' Elmir's boss was furious when the 17-year-old called in sick, the same day Elmir reportedly told his mother that he was 'going fishing' and disappeared from his Bankstown home in Sydney's south-west, in June. Elmir and his friend Feiz are believed to have made their way to Syria and Iraq after crossing the border from Turkey, where they were last known to have contacted family members. They travelled via Perth, with stops in Malaysia and Thailand. Titled 'Message Of The Mujahid 4', the 1.43 minutes long video is full of threats against the west . As Elmir finishes his diatribe the men all cheer and chant in Arabic . Elmir begins the video by saying 'this message I deliver to you the people of America, this message I deliver to you the people of Britain and this message I deliver especially to you the people of Australia'. Titled 'Message Of The Mujahid 4', the video which is 1.43 minutes long is full of heavily worded threats and taunts the US-led coalition that recently began air strikes on ISIS targets in Syria and Iraq. 'I say this about your coalition: you threaten us with your countries, bring every nation that you wish to us, bring every nation that you want to come and fight us. Whether it's 50 nations or 50 thousand nations it means nothing to us,' Elmir says. Reading from a script, a black and white scarf wrapped around his head and a huge rifle in his hand, he warns: 'Bring your planes bring everything you want to use because it will not harm us because we have Allah which is something you do not have.' Australian terrorist Khaled Sharrouf is wanted by the Federal Police for his activities in Syria . Former Sydney boxer Mohamed Elomar posted photos of himself holding up decapitated heads on Twitter . A spokesman for Prime Minister Tony Abbott said: 'This video again highlights the threat posed by ISIL.' 'As the Prime Minister has said on many occasions, ISIL is a threat that reaches out to Australia and our allies and partners.' Elmir's family told the Sydney Morning Herald in June they were devastated their son had been 'brainwashed'. His family's lawyer Zali Burrows told the Australian Associated Press: 'The family went to the media today as a plea to the government to bring their boy back. 'We know they have the intelligence to pinpoint him. 'The concern is that he's being used as a tracking device to gather further intelligence, to see where he's actually going to go.' Ms Burrows questioned how Elmir was not stopped by Federal Police, who were thought to be monitoring him. On Sunday, Foreign Minister Julie Bishop announced Australia will send its special forces into Iraq to fight against Islamic State. Elmir's video was published one day after the announcement.","Schoolmates at Condell Park High School close ranks around their mate Abdullah Elmir .

"The Obama administration should ban all air travel to the United States from the three African countries hardest hit by the Ebola epidemic, say at least 41 members of Congress including three Democratic House members. Republican Senator Ted Cruz, whose home state is ground zero for Ebola in North America, wrote Wednesday in a Texas Tribune op-ed that 'we all very much hope the virus will not spread any further in Texas. But hope is not a strategy.' 'Given the gravity of the threat, common sense dictates that it’s time to ban flights from the countries afflicted by Ebola.' 'There's no reason to allow ongoing commercial air traffic out of those countries,' he told the Dallas Morning News. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . House Speaker John Boehner called for an Ebola travel ban to be reopened for debate, while House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (left) and other top Democrats have shied away from the idea . Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz spoke at an Oct. 9 political rally for Kansas Sen. Pat Roberts. Both men have called for a commercial air traffic ban between the U.S. and the three African nations where Ebola rages out of control. 'I have no confidence in how the Obama Administration is managing the Ebola crisis, and neither do the people of Kansas,' Roberts said Oct. 14 . Only a drill: Hazmat suits like these could become commonplace at US airports if Ebola spreads without end . Rep. Lou Barletta, a Pennsylvania Republican, said in a statement that the U.S. is 'faced with the growing threat of a disease for which there is no known reliable cure, and we know where it’s coming from. Why would we not act in every way possible to stop it from reaching us?' That sentiment is 180 degrees opposition from the White House's point of view, producing a clash that has D.C.beltway insiders scratching their heads. A group of 26 House members, including Democrats Alan Grayson, Dave Loebsack and Kyrsten Sinema, wrote to Obama on Oct. 8 that 'the United States needs to institute travel restrictions, enhanced airport screening and possible quarantine of individuals who have traveled to, or from' Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. House Speaker John Boehner joined that group on Wednesday after the chief White House spokesman said a travel ban is not under consideration. 'A temporary ban on travel to the United States from countries afflicted with the virus is something that the president should absolutely consider,' he said, 'along with any other appropriate actions as doubts about the security of our air travel systems grow.' The White House is nowhere near considering restrictions on commercial airline flights from the Ebola hot zone to major American airports. Instead, it has ramped up disease surveillance at the five airports that handle about 94 per cent of the passenger load from the hardest hit African nations. The extra screening – carried out by Customs and Border Control officers, not health care professionals – have begun at New York's John F. Kennedy, Newark Liberty,Washington Dulles, Chicago O'Hare and Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta airports. Obama did not address the possibility of a travel ban during his remarks after a two-hour emergency cabinet meeting Wednesday afternoon. Not going to happen: White House Press Secretary, Josh Earnest . Urgency: Obama skipped his planned political fundraising in order to chair a cabinet meeting about his administration's Ebola response . The president canceled planned political campaign appearances in New Jersey and Connecticut to call the meeting. The White House said late Wednesday that presidential campaign trips to New York and Rhode Island had been called off for Thursday as well. But hours before the president spoke, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest reiterated that banning America-bound flights from Ebola-ravaged countries 'is not on the table.' House of Representatives . Democrats . Republicans . Senate . Republicans . 'It's important for people to understand exactly why that's the case,' Earnest said. 'Shutting down travel to that area of the world would prevent the expeditious flow of personnel and equipment into the region.' 'And the only way for us to stop this outbreak, and to eliminate any risk from Ebola to the American public, is to stop this outbreak at the source.' Earnest and Centers for Disease Control chief Thomas Frieden have emphasized that isolating entire countries would make it harder, not easier, to contain the spread of Ebola. At the same time, the CDC has tried to isolate individual Americans who have come into contact with Ebola-infected people. Earnest added that the administration is already 'mobilizing significant resources to make sure that supplies and personnel can get to the affected region.' MailOnline asked the White House why military aircraft couldn't be used for the same purpose without putting civilians' health at risk, but no response has come. A survey of online airfare booking websites including Kayak and Expedia found that domestic U.S. airlines are no longer flying between U.S. airports and the Liberian capital of Monrovia – the epicenter of the Ebola outbreak. But several foreign-owned airlines fly those routes every day, including Brussels Airlines, Lufthansa and Moroccan carrier Royal Air Maroc. That, says Alabama Republican Rep. Mo Brooks, should stop. 'Allowing people to come from outbreak areas into the United States threatens the lives and health of American citizens,' he told the News Courier in Athens, Alabama, on Oct. 12. 'It’s crazy and irresponsible.' Two-thirds of Americans agree, according to a Washington Post/ABC News poll released Tuesday. Fully 67 per cent told pollsters they would agree with 'restricting entry to the United States by people who've been in affected countries.' Just 29 percent lined up against the idea. Texas Rep. Joe Barta said last week during a congressional field hearing in Dallas that the Obama administration is 'almost guaranteeing mathematically we're going to miss some people' with airport screening alone. 'If we were really treating this as a public health issue why would we not immediately stop these flights?' he asked. Others in Congress are asking the State Department to suspend  the 13,000 travel visas issued to foreign nationals from the three countries that have been hardest hit. That's a position shared by House Foreign Affairs Committee chairman Ed Royce, Homeland Security chairman Michael McCaul and at least five other House members. Most Democrats in Congress share the White House's view, however, including Wisconsin Rep Gwen Moore. She downplayed the health risks from Ebola in the United States, complaining in a statement Wednesday that 'many of my congressional colleagues have let their anxiety about this crisis dictate a panicked and perilous tone during a time when we need a cautious yet vigilant discussion.'","House speaker wants US airports closed to traffic from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea .

"David Cameron last night pledged to scrap ‘once and for all’ Labour’s controversial Human Rights Act – and replace it with a British Bill of Rights. The Prime Minister launched a scathing attack on European human rights judges and defended the right of Parliament to make its own laws. He said the country that wrote Magna Carta did not need to take human rights lessons from judges in Strasbourg. The policy is a repeat of the commitment made in the 2010 manifesto – which was then scrapped during coalition negotiations with the Liberal Democrats. Promise: David Cameron last night pledged to scrap ‘once and for all’ Labour’s controversial Human Rights Act and replace it with a British Bill of Rights . More details of human rights reforms are expected to follow in the coming days – including giving more sway to the British Supreme Court. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling is also considering a so-called ‘Parliamentary override’ which would allow MPs to veto contentious Strasbourg rulings, such as those on giving prisoners the vote. Mr Cameron also insisted he would secure greater powers over immigration from within the European Union. The Government had succeeded in capping non-EU migrant numbers, he said, but admitted the ‘bigger issue today’ is EU migrants and their ‘immediate access to our welfare system’. Scathing: The Prime Minister launched a scathing attack on European human rights judges and defended the right of Parliament to make its own laws . More power: Mr Cameron told his audience he would get 'what Britain needs' and would 'not take no for an answer', pointing to success in cutting the European Budget and pulling out of EU bailout schemes . He said: ‘Britain, I know you want this sorted so I will go to Brussels, I will not take no for an answer and, when it comes to free movement, I will get what Britain needs. ‘Anyone who thinks I can’t or won’t deliver this – judge me by my record,’ he said, pointing to success in cutting the European Budget and pulling out of EU bailout schemes. There was a murmur of agreement from Tory supporters in the Birmingham Symphony Hall when Mr Cameron said it was ‘not just the EU that needs sorting out – it’s the European Court of Human Rights.’ Plans: Justice Secretary Chris Grayling is also considering a so-called 'Parliamentary override' which would allow MPs to veto contentious Strasbourg rulings, such as those on giving prisoners the vote . Praise: Mr Cameron praised Home Secretary Theresa May for capping migrant numbers from outside the EU and shutting down 700 bogus colleges 'that were basically visa factories' He condemned human rights rulings that blocked the deportation of terror suspects and applied even on battlefields. He said: ‘This is the country that wrote Magna Carta, the country that time and again has stood up for human rights, whether liberating Europe from fascism or leading the charge today against sexual violence in war. ‘We do not require instruction on this from judges in Strasbourg. So with a Conservative Government after the election, this country will have a new British Bill of Rights, passed in our Parliament, rooted in our values. And as for Labour’s Human Rights Act? We will scrap it, once and for all.’ Mr Cameron praised Home Secretary Theresa May for capping migrant numbers from outside the EU and shutting down 700 bogus colleges ‘that were basically visa factories’. ÷ In the biggest group action to date, more than 1,000 UK prisoners – including 74 serving life – are to go to the ECHR to demand compensation for being barred from voting.","Prime minister pledges to scrap Labour's controversial Human Rights Act .

"Buying a sports car, fretting over thinning hair and flirting embarrassingly with people 20 years your junior are usually dismissed as classic signs of a midlife crisis. But it seems that this catch-all term will no longer work as an excuse for bad behaviour, as new research reveals the idea of suffering angst in your forties in a myth. A growing number of studies suggest emotional turmoil is just as likely to happen when a person is in their twenties or sixties. Research by the University of Massachusetts Amherst suggests the idea of a midlife crisis is a  myth, despite being portrayed in films  like American Beauty by the main character, Lester Burnham, played by Kevin Spacey . Research by the University of Massachusetts Amherst, which looked at hundreds of people who graduated from college between 1965 and 2006, concluded that hitting 40 does not increase the chance of a life crisis. Psychology professor Susan Krauss Whitbourne, who led the research, said: 'Given the ubiquitous nature of the midlife crisis notion, it might surprise you to learn that, as far as psychology is concerned, it's a myth. 'Scientific research shows that most of us go through our middle years without so much as a blip on our psychological radar screens. 'Even those in their forties, considered the prime age for the midlife crisis, showed no signs of suffering from the kind of existential angst we associate with this period of life.' Bill Murray portrays ageing actor Bob Harris in the film, Lost in Translation, and gets involved with a much younger woman, which is a classic sign of a midlife crisis . The term mid-life crisis was first coined in 1965 where early analysis suggested that it could happen anywhere between the ages of 40 and 60 . She interviewed 200 adults who graduated from college in the late 1950s, but found only one particular subgroup seemed to experience upheaval at that age. These were the people she considered to be on the 'downward slope' route of development, who had made a series of poor decisions throughout their adult lives. She said: 'Even these unhappy 50-somethings wouldn't have been considered candidates for the midlife crisis. Their unhappiness characterised them throughout their adult lives, not just in the decade of their forties.' Other research conducted in Britain has identified the twenties as a troubled decade where many go through a 'quarter-life crisis'. A study by the University of Essex last year found 86 per cent of people in their twenties felt anxious that they were not doing enough. Damian Barr, author of the book Get it Together: A Guide to Surviving Your Quarterlife Crisis, said a growing number of 25-year-olds are experiencing pressures and demands previously felt by those in their forties. He said: 'Being twentysomething now is scary – fighting millions of other graduates for your first job, struggling to raise a mortgage deposit and finding time to juggle all your relationships. 'We have the misfortune to be catapulted into a perilous property market. We're earning more and spending more than ever. We're getting into debt to finance our degrees, careers and accommodation.' One in six people are also believed to suffer some sort of crisis in their sixties, according to research by the University of Greenwich. Dr Oliver Robinson, who led the study, said: 'It is not a delayed midlife crisis. Nor is it just about retirement and people freaking out because their work routine has gone. 'The research shows it is linked to loss.' The term mid-life crisis was first coined in 1965 where early analysis suggested that it could happen anywhere between the ages of 40 and 60, . But Professor Whitbourne believes the phrase should now be removed from our vocabularies. She said: 'Nearly 40 years later, the midlife crisis is ready for its own midlife crisis. In fact, it's about time for it to bite the dust. 'To do that, we need simply to expunge the word from all of our vocabularies. The problem is that people like it too much. 'You can sweep a lot of bad behaviour under the midlife crisis carpet and never get blamed for any of it. 'Like Lester Burnham, the main character in American Beauty, played by Kevin Spacey, you can fall in love with the cheerleader next door, sell your beige minivan for a red (what else) sports car and in general act like a 16- (or maybe 12-) year-old boy.' 1.

"The date on which Rosetta's Philae lander will attempt to land on comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko has been revealed as 12 November. If all goes to plan, Rosetta will release the Philae lander at 0935 BST that day at a distance of 14 miles (22.5km) from the centre of the comet. The landing will occur about seven hours later, although confirmation will not arrive back on Earth until 1700 BST. Scroll down for videos and animation . The relatively smooth landing region, identified for the moment simply by the letter 'J', is located on the smaller of the duck-shaped comet's two lobes. An inset showing a close up of the landing site is also shown . A backup called Site C is available if the primary Site J is not used. This would see a separation occur later at 1404 BST at just 7.8 miles (12.5 km) from the centre of the comet. This landing would take just four hours, with confirmation reaching Earth at 1830 BST. The Rosetta probe will launch its Philae robot from a distance of about 6.2 miles (10km) to Comet 67P. The 220lb (100kg) lander will reach the surface on 12 November. It will take around seven hours to descend. During the descent, images will be taken and other observations of the comet's environment will be made. Philae . will make a gentle landing on the comet at walking pace, using screws . and harpoons to lower and secure itself on the surface. Once . the lander touches down, it will make a 360° panoramic image of the . landing site to help determine where and in what orientation it has . landed. The . initial science phase will then begin, with other instruments analysing . the plasma and magnetic environment, and the surface and subsurface . temperature. The lander will also drill and collect samples from beneath the surface, delivering them to the onboard laboratory for analysis. The interior structure of the comet will be explored by sending radio waves through the surface towards Rosetta. Esa will make a final confirmation on the landing site to be used on 14 October after a formal Lander Operations Readiness Review. The agency has been quick to select a landing site and prepare for the touch down since Rosetta arrived in orbit around the comet on 6 August 2014. This is because they want to attempt the landing before the comet gets closer to the sun and becomes more active. When this happens it is thought it will release more water vapour, which may be hazardous to the lander’s health. The landing itself even without this hazardous water vapour will be incredibly tense, as such an endeavour has never been successfully completed before. The closest comparison is the attempting landing on an asteroid of a probe called Minerva attached to Japan’s Hayabusa spacecraft on 12 November 2005. However, in that instance the lander was released at too great a height - and it floated off into space instead of drifting towards the asteroid. Mission operators for the Rosetta mission will be hoping such a fate does not befall the Philae lander. Nonetheless, Rosetta will still be continuing to study the comet into the future regardless of the outcome of the landing attempt. It will use its 11 scientific instruments to study the comet as it orbits the sun. Close-up of Philae’s primary landing site J, which is located on the ‘head’ of Comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko. Site J offers the minimum risk to the lander in comparison to the other candidate sites, and is also scientifically interesting, with signs of activity nearby . At Site J, the majority of slopes are less than 30º relative to the local vertical, reducing the chances of Philae toppling over during touchdown. Site J also appears to have relatively few boulders, and receives sufficient daily sunlight to recharge Philae and continue science operations when its battery runs out . The high-risk manoeuvre, if successful, will be the first time in history that a probe has been landed on a comet. Scientists . at mission control in Germany hope the spider-like probe will send back . data that could answer questions on the origin of Earth's water and . perhaps even life. But . they've warned that the landing should be seen as an 'exciting extra' on the Rosetta mission as the mission carries a 'high risk'. Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko is currently travelling through space some 273 million miles (440 million km) from Earth. The . relatively smooth landing region, identified for the moment simply by . the letter 'J', is located on the smaller of the duck-shaped comet's two . lobes. A further back up site has been chosen on the larger of 67P's lobes, and is currently being marked by Esa with the letter 'C'. 'As we have seen from recent close-up images, the comet is a beautiful but dramatic world - it is scientifically exciting, but its shape makes it operationally challenging,' Stephan Ulamec, Philae Lander Manager, said earlier this month. 'None of the candidate landing sites met all of the operational criteria at the 100 per cent level, but Site J is clearly the best solution.' At Site J, the majority of slopes have an angle less than 30º, reducing the chances of Philae toppling over during touchdown. Site J also appears to have relatively few boulders, and receives sufficient daily sunlight to recharge Philae and continue science operations on the surface beyond the initial battery-powered phase. Site C was chosen as a backup because of more sunlight hours and fewer boulders. But even the flat surface chosen contains potentially dangerous boulders and cracks. This . reconstructed-colour image, taken earlier this month, indicates how dark . the comet appears. On average the comet's surface reflects about . four per cent of impinging visible light, making it as dark as coal . This 3D image of Philae’s primary landing site on the ‘head’ of Comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko can be viewed using stereoscopic glasses with red–green/blue filters . Site C was chosen as the backup site for Rosetta’s lander Philae during the Landing Site Selection meeting held on 13 to 14 September 2014. This image was taken by Rosetta at a distance of about 43 miles (70km) If all goes to plan, Philae will then make a gentle landing on the comet at walking pace, using screws and harpoons to lower and secure itself on the surface. According to Esa, this is a 'one-shot opportunity' and real-time radio control will be impossible due to the incredible distance of the comet from Earth. The entire landing process is expected to take seven hours, and if successful, will represent a historic moment in space exploration. 'We will make the first ever in situ analysis of a comet at this site, giving us an unparalleled insight into the composition, structure and evolution of a comet,' says Jean-Pierre Bibring, a lead lander scientist. 'Site J in particular offers us the chance to analyse pristine material, characterise the properties of the nucleus, and study the processes that drive its activity.' Several different surface regions are shown in this map, which is oriented with the comet's 'body' in the foreground and the 'head' in the background. The map was used to help researchers pick a suitable place to drop a lander in November . The original five candidate landing sites for Rosetta’s lander Philae, and with the backup, Site C, indicated . The race to find the landing site could only begin once Rosetta arrived at the comet on 6 August, when the comet was seen close-up for the first time. Since then, the spacecraft has moved to within 18 miles (30km) of the comet, allowing more detailed scientific measurements of the candidate sites. 'There's no time to lose, but now that we're closer to the comet, continued science and mapping operations will help us improve the analysis of the primary and backup landing sites,' says ESA Rosetta flight director Andrea Accomazzo. 'Of course, we cannot predict the activity of the comet between now and landing, and on landing day itself. 'A sudden increase in activity could affect the position of Rosetta in its orbit at the moment of deployment and in turn the exact location where Philae will land, and that's what makes this a risky operation.' During the descent, images will be taken and other observations of the comet's environment will be made. Zoom in on the image below to find out where Rosetta is at the moment . The Rosetta probe will launch its Philae robot from a distance of about 6.2 miles (10km) to 67P. If all goes to plan, Philae will then make a gentle landing on the comet at walking pace . Rosetta took an incredible selfie of its 131ft (40 metre) solar wings gleaming against the darkness of space last week. In the background is the duck-shaped comet, Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, with its distinct 'head' and 'body' clearly visible . Once the lander touches down, it will make a 360° panoramic image of the landing site to help determine where and in what orientation it has landed. The initial science phase will then begin, with other instruments analysing the plasma and magnetic environment, and the surface and subsurface temperature. The lander will also drill and collect samples from beneath the surface, delivering them to the onboard laboratory for analysis. The interior structure of the comet will be explored by sending radio waves through the surface towards Rosetta. 'No one has ever attempted to land on a comet before, so it is a real challenge,' says Fred Jansen, Esa Rosetta mission manager. 'The complicated 'double' structure of the comet has had a considerable impact on the overall risks related to landing, but they are risks worth taking to have the chance of making the first ever soft landing on a comet.' Comets are time capsules containing primitive material left over from the epoch when the sun and its planets formed. By studying the gas, dust and structure of the nucleus and organic materials associated with the comet, via both remote and in situ observations, the Rosetta mission should become the key to unlocking the history and evolution of our solar system.

"Police in California have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of 30-year-old Perla Avina, a mother of four who was killed in a road-rage attack four days ago. Carl Duboe, 20, was caught Wednesday in the Sacramento suburb of Elk Grove, about 90 miles from where the shooting happened in East Oakland. Police there sent in a SWAT team and arrested Dubose after a short standoff, the San Francisco Chronicle reported. Scroll down for video . Happier times: Perla Avina (right), 30, was traveling home with her husband, Mando Lopez (left), in East Oakland, California when they got into 'some type of confrontation' with another driver . Perla Avina, 30, was traveling in a black 1998 Toyota Camry with husband Mando Lopez when they got into a confrontation with Dubose in East Oakland, police says. Dubose allegedly fired at the vehicle, piercing the windshield on the passenger side and striking Avina in the face. As Dubose sped off, Lopez pulled over at the 400 block of Rossmoor Avenue in Brookfield Village neighborhood, before putting pressure on his wife's face and crying: 'Wake up!' Meanwhile, resident Dwayne Jackson, who heard the commotion, rushed outside and dialed 911. He first tried to perform first aid on Avina, but she remained unconscious. 'I didn't see any signs of life,' Jackson told NBC. 'There was no waking [her] up.' Paramedics arrived at the scene within minutes but could not save Avina. She was pronounced dead in the Camry. The suspect allegedly fired at Avina's vehicle through the windshield and hit her in the face before fleeing . Avina, a medical receptionist from Los Angeles, has four children with Lopez. The youngest child is just 18-months-old . Police later said the motivation for the shooting was likely road rage. '[Road rage] is extremely dangerous,' a police spokesman said. 'In this case, it turned deadly.' Avina, a medical receptionist from Los Angeles, leaves behind four children, the youngest of whom is just 18-months-old, authorities said. None of the children were in the car at the time of the shooting, KTVU.com reported. Jackson described Avina as the 'heart' of the family, saying: 'She made the family work, with the kids, and school and working.' Above, people surround the victim's damaged car at the 400 block of Rossmoor Avenue in Brookfield Village neighborhood following the attack . Scene: Paramedics arrived at the scene within minutes of the shooting, but couldn't revive Avina . The victim's grief-stricken parents, Jose and Herlinda Avina, said the day of the shooting that finding their daughter's killer was the only thing that could slightly ease their 'inconsolable pain.' 'If [anyone] knows the person who did this, please turn him in,' Herlinda Avina begged before Dubose was arrested. 'Turn him into the police, please, please, help us.' Darlene Cederborg, Avina's manager at the Emeryville medical clinic where she worked, said she was a 'shining spirit' who 'always had a smile on her face'. 'This was a beautiful young woman with four young children and there was no reason for it. This never should have happened,' she said.

"School-leavers are damaging their career chances by spending too long fiddling with their smartphones and making social calls at work, a survey of firms has revealed. They are leaving bosses unimpressed because they often display poor attitudes to work including using their phones while on the job. Employers are also concerned that new recruits are taking long lunch and coffee breaks and failing to turn up for work on time. In a survey, 43 per cent of employers were worried about young recruits using their mobile phone while at work or taking too long on their breaks )File photo) The poll is the latest in a spate of studies to question the skills and suitability of school-leavers to start work. The CBI warned earlier this year that economic prosperity is being put at risk because large numbers of teenagers are leaving school and college ‘underequipped for life’. The latest survey – covering 500 small and medium-sized businesses - showed that many employers believe youngsters have little idea how to behave appropriately at work. More than four in 10 – 43 per cent – were worried about young recruits using their mobile phone while at work or taking too long on their breaks. A similar proportion – 41 per cent – believed young people lacked time management and punctuality skills. It also emerged that 55 per cent of employers felt school-leavers lacked relationship skills, leaving unable to handle clients, customers and suppliers. The survey – by the LifeSkills programme aimed at boosting youth employability - concluded that ‘young people at entry level lack a range of basic skills when they start work’. Following the research, LifeSkills today demanded a greater focus in schools on preparing children for the world of work. It made a series of proposals to ministers including long-term tracking of school-leavers to monitor their success in the workplace. It said programmes such as LifeSkills, which offers web resources and lesson plans and facilitates work experience to smooth pupils’ transition to work, helped youngsters with skills such as handling new people and situations confidently and conveying their strengths to others. Kirstie Mackey, head of LifeSkills at Barclays, which supports the programme, said: ‘Small and medium sized businesses are an incredibly important source of employment, yet this research shows they perceive a disconnect between the skills they need and those of young people at entry level.’ Standards in schools and universities are a recurring concern among business leaders, several of whom have publicly aired their views. Sir Terry Leahy (above), then chief executive of Tesco, lamented that standards were ‘still woefully low in too many schools’ and that companies were ‘often left to pick up the pieces’ Sir Terry Leahy, then chief executive of Tesco, lamented that standards were ‘still woefully low in too many schools’ and that companies were ‘often left to pick up the pieces’. Meanwhile Sir Stuart Rose, the former Marks and Spencer boss, said too many school-leavers struggled with reading, writing and arithmetic. The CBI report earlier this year found that standards of basic skills among young staff are so poor that more than a quarter of companies now run their own remedial training courses in the three-Rs. The study, carried out jointly with the publisher Pearson, said that ‘too many young people leave school underequipped for life’ outside the classroom. Almost three-quarters of businesses criticised school leavers’ ‘business and customer awareness’, while 61 per cent said they had poor ‘self-management and resilience’. More than half cited concerns over communication skills, 50 per cent criticised a lack of problem-solving skills, 38 per cent said students struggled with basic numeracy and 36 per cent claimed ‘basic literacy and use of English’ was a problem.","CBI warned that large numbers of teenagers are ‘underequipped for life’

"A 15-year-old girl was branded a hero after her quick thinking saved an 18-month-old boy who had been kidnapped by her schizophrenic mother. Camryn Wood was in a car with her father in Olympia, Washington, when she received an Amber Alert on her phone saying a youngster had been abducted. The text included the make, model and licence plate number of the suspect's car and is sent to all smart phones in the area. Less than a minute later, she noticed the vehicle in question was right in front of them and drug addict Cassandra Wilhelm was behind the wheel with her son Mason in her lap, according to KIRO 7. Rescued: 18-month-old Mason Wilhelm was kidnapped by her schizophrenic, drug addict mother, but was saved by police thanks to the quick thinking of a teenage girl in Olympia, Washington . Hero: Camryn Wood was in a car with her father in Olympia, Washington, when she received an Amber Alert on her phone saying a youngster had been abducted. She told her father to follow the vehicle and called 911 . The 34-year-old, who police say was addicted to pills and heroin, had taken the boy earlier in the day after assaulting her estranged husband. Camryn told her father, who was driving at the time, to follow the car before she dialed 911. Wilhem noticed she was being tailed and started driving in a number of different directions. But the Woods managed to corner her in a hotel parking lot. There Wilhem was arrested while her son was rescued and taken back to his father. 'We just followed them,' Wood told the station. 'They jumped on the freeway, they were making all sorts of turns. We were trying to not make it obvious that we were behind them.' 'Actually seeing you can make a difference and help somebody get their kid, that means the world to me.' Wilhem is now facing kidnapping and assault charges after she attacked her estranged husband earlier in the day. Detectives say it was the quickest reaction to an Amber Alert they have ever seen and officers reportedly cheered in the emergency response center when the baby had been saved. After police were alerted less than a minute after Mason was abducted, the Woods cornered his mother Cassandra Wilhem allowing police to arrest her. She had also assaulted her estranged husband that day . The suspect had the child in her lap in this dark blue Dodge and had tried to flee on the freeway .

"San Francisco's already tight housing market just got another squeeze after a tiny former earthquake shelter sold for $765,000 in October. According to SF Gate, the 330-square-foot shack that sits on a quiet street in Telegraph Hill is one of the surviving properties built for earthquake victims in 1906. The US Army Corps of Engineers built the shacks in public spaces to house some of the 250,000 people displaced by the fires and quakes that struck the city. Shocking: A 330-square foot 'shack' in San Francisco sold for $765,000, which was $100,000 over the asking price . Floorplan: The design utilizes the space to create the illusion of separate dining and living rooms to give the home an open feel . Once those camps started to close, the Army allowed families to take the homes with them, on the condition they hauled them away themselves, which most did with the help of a mule or two. That doesn't mean that the new buyer is going to be living in a dilapidated shack, as this hardy home has been kept in great shape over the century it's stood in the city. Its previous owner, an artist based in the city, recently renovated the interior, managing to economize the space without making it feel small. Roomy: The emergency shelters were built after the Great Earthquake in 1906 and designed as simple shelters . Renovation: Many still survive, and have been given a modern update in order to keep their avant garde homeowners happy . Space: A recent renovation by the artist that owns the home tries to be economical with space without squeezing too tight . Up the staircase is where the new owner has their semi-enclosed bedroom, and a walk-in closet provides some storage space. When the inside starts to feel like too much of a squeeze, there's an adjoining patio and a porch that's as pint-sized as the home. San Francisco's housing market has experienced some overheating during the last few years, as Silicon Valley's employees have snapped up the limited amount of real estate. Living room: The space might not be enough to throw a rager, but an open floor plan gives it a great atmosphere for an intimate gathering . Cozy up: The semi-enclosed bedroom up a flight of stairs may not be to everyone's taste, but for some it will truly feel like home . Storage: A rolling door gives the walk-in closet a little more breathing room in spite of the low ceilings space at the top . Stretch out: When living in the small shack gets to be too tight, homeowners have a patio and a small elevated porch . According to the real estate site Zillow, the median price of a home sold in the city is $979,000, having hovered around $1million since it broke that record back in 2013. If you still have your heart set on one of the city's emergency shelters-cum-luxury properties, SF Curbed reports that a $1.15million shack in Bernal Heights went on the market earlier in the year. This one has a bit more space, with a garage, two full floors and ample room on the patio, as well as a solarium.","The renovated shack originally for survivors of the 1906 earthquake sold in October at $100,000 over its asking price .

"Couples about to walk  down the aisle have been left devastated after a Bali wedding company went bust, owing $180,000. So far nine couples from Western Australia have so far registered complaints against Australian-owned company Bali D'Luxe with Consumer Protection and it is believed many more will come forward. Bali D'Luxe advertises itself online as having more than 20 years experience in organising weddings in Bali and say the 'offer our clients a range of services from our hand picked luxury villa and accommodation collection, tailored tour experiences, weddings and events, private parties and much more'. Scroll down for video . Amy-Mae Perry and partner Jake Smith are due to get married on November 8 in Bali . The couple have been left 'heartbroken' because they now have to find another $4000 for their wedding . The website is still up and running but the company's Facebook and Twitter accounts have been closed down. Some of the couples had also arrived in Bali to find out services had not been paid for. Mother of one Amy-Mae Perry, 25, from Ballajura, WA, was due to marry her partner Jake Smith on November 8 on the holiday island after spending 12 months planning the ceremony. Miss Perry explained they deposited $6300 into a bank account and not by credit card where they might have been able to get the money back . A liquidator was appointed after sole director Catherine Williams voluntarily wound the business up . Amy-Mae and Jake have been planning their nuptials for 12 months and say the excitement of getting married has been taken away from them . The couple, who have been together for four years, don't know if their dream ceremony will go ahead because they now have to find another $4000 at last minute to pay for the ceremony, reception, cake, videographer and flowers. Ms Perry told Daily Mail Australia: 'We are heartbroken, I got an email on Tuesday lunchtime from the insolvency company confirming our worst fears. 'We had seen on the internet the night before lots of people talking about it but it didn't sink in until we got that email.' Ms Perry said she researched getting married abroad because she had family from the UK coming over for the wedding, many of whom who have booked flights and accommodation. The couple say they paid director Catherine Williams $6300 and they deposited it into a bank account, not by credit card where they might have been able to get the money back. She said: 'We chose this company because her site looked nice and there was lots of positive feedback and lots of information. The professional looking website for Bali D'Luxe which was run by sole director Catherine Williams . The site, which is still live, says the company has more than 20 years experience and will cater to all the needs of the bride and groom . 'There were no alarm bells until after we went over to Bali in August to visit Catherine. After that she started taking longer to reply to emails and that is when we started to become concerned. 'I think she must have gone into hiding because we have not heard from her for a long time. 'My fiancée is very annoyed. We have been planning it for a long time and this experience has taken the fun out of getting married, it's not exciting any more. 'We don't know if our wedding is going to go ahead but I would say to anyone looking to use a company like this do your research and pay on a credit card.' Acting commissioner for Consumer Protection David Hillyard said a liquidator was appointed after the sole director Catherine Williams voluntarily wound the business up. 'Bali D'Luxe customers are now classed as unsecured creditors and should register their details with the liquidator RSM Bird Cameron Partners via Mr Louis Bailey,' Mr Hillyard said. 'The insolvency process can take time and you may not get all, or any, money back. 'If you made a Bali D'Luxe booking using a credit card or selecting 'credit' on a debit card, you should seek a chargeback (transaction reversal) from your card provider because you did not receive any goods or services in return for the amount paid.' Daily Mail Australia tried to get in contact with Bali D'Luxe and has not received a response.","Couples in Western Australia left stranded at the altar after Bali wedding company goes bust .

"Ministers have been banned from taking iPads into Cabinet meetings to stop them being spied on. Intelligence agencies have demanded that tablet computers be removed from the room before David Cameron and his top team conduct ultra-sensitive talks. It is feared the devices could be hacked by a foreign power and used as covert listening devices. Secrets: Ministers have been banned from taking iPads into the weekly Cabinet meetings . Senior government figures claim countries including China, Russia, Iran and Pakistan could have developed viruses that would allow iPads and mobile phones to be used as bugs, even when they are switched off. China in particular spends billions on its military budget, and has been accused of trying to hack into governments around the world. At last week’s Cabinet meeting, ministers were briefed on how better use of technology could save the taxpayer billions. Cabinet Office minister and Government Digital Service chief Mike Bracken used iPads to give a presentation on how the GDS would save the economy close to £2 billion a year within the next four years. Security: It is feared iPads could be targetted by foreign spies to use them as covert listening devices . It went down so well, the presentation was greeted with applause from ministers desperate to find efficiency savings. But as soon as the talk was over, security advisers insisted all the iPads be removed from the room. It follows revelations that ministers in the most sensitive departments have been given lead-lined, sound-proofed boxes in which to put mobile phones when having high-security conversations. Last week it emerged that delegates at the G20 summit in Russia were given ‘poisoned’ computer memory sticks. As world leaders gathered in St Petersburg in September, those attending were given USB drives which contained viruses which could be used to access sensitive information held on any computer it was placed in. Herman Van Rompuy, the President of the European Council, ordered tests to be carried out on the memory sticks. ‘The USB pen drives and the recharging cables were able to covertly capture computer and mobile phone data,’ a secret memo said. Foreign Secretary William Hague also revealed his own mobile phone has been modified by spy agencies to prevent him being targeted by China, . He said: ‘I think my phone has been modified by GCHQ enough that it'd be difficult, but I'm sure the Chinese have had a good go.’ Paperless: Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude has urged other ministers to embrace technology to cut costs . Mr Maude has been a leading advocate of technology in government. Last month it emerged he grew so fed up with Whitehall’s ‘clunky and rubbish’ IT systems he had his own personal wi-fi network installed. He became frustrated at the time it took to log on to government systems and wanted to use his iPad instead for non-sensitive material. But the Cabinet Office minister was astonished to find that a multi-million pound contract signed by the Labour government did not include providing a easy wireless web access usually found in coffee shops. Mr Maude was forced to take matters into his own hands when he could not get his phone or iPad to work in his Whitehall office. He refused to use a high security computer issued by contractors under the Labour deal because it involved entering numerous passwords and could not use it to surf the internet properly.","Devices removed after presentation on how technology could cut costs .

"Guest editor: Musician PJ Harvey's Today treated listeners to segments from radical journalist John Pilger and Wikileaks founder Julian Assange . The BBC was under fire last night over claims that a celebrity edition of its flagship radio news programme had been dominated by ‘left-wing claptrap’. The Today programme on Radio 4 faced criticism from across the political spectrum after it gave editorial control to cult musician P J Harvey, who filled the show with polemics from left-wing activists and bizarre musical interludes. Radical journalist John Pilger was given air-time to attack David Cameron and Barack Obama, and WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who is wanted for sex offences in Sweden, was hailed for his ‘great courage’ and given a Thought for the Day slot, in which he attacked State control. Listeners were also subjected to a poem from an inmate of Guantanamo Bay and a rant against the Olympics. Critics of the tone and content of the show included a former aide to Gordon Brown, the BBC’s political editor and a Tory Cabinet minister. Tory MPs suggested the programme – one of a series produced under the guidance of ‘guest editors’ – may have breached the BBC’s duty of political impartiality. Labour MP Ian Austin, a former minister who served as a close aide to Gordon Brown, said yesterday’s show was the worst he had heard in 30 years of listening. On Twitter, he said: ‘Quick, the BBC need a guest editor to continue Today’s balanced reporting of global affairs. Are Putin, Ahmedinejad or Assad available tomorrow?’ Welsh Secretary David Jones added: ‘Today’s BBC Radio Today programme is apparently the work of a “guest editor”. Have to wonder who extended the invitation.’ Dover MP Charlie Elphicke said: ‘The BBC has a duty to provide balanced factual report and analysis of the day’s news – instead their flagship news and current affairs programme consisted of three hours of left-wing claptrap complete with conspiracy theories, monologues and folk music.’ Public reaction to the show was divided, with some Twitter users branding it ‘left-wing tosh’, but others describing it as ‘powerful and thought-provoking’. One Tweet said, ‘What has BBC Radio 4 got for us tomorrow? Some sixth form Debating Society leftie reject? Pitiful drivel today.’ A comment left on the Guardian’s website – where many posters were supportive – read: ‘P J Harvey – what an utter embarrassment to the BBC and the UK. It was like giving editorship to an angry sixth-former, desperate to impart their ignorant and facile vituperations upon us all.’ Appearances: Radical journalist John Pilger was given air-time to attack David Cameron and Barack Obama, and WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange was hailed for his ‘great courage’ and given a Thought for the Day slot . BBC political editor Nick Robinson weighed in, criticising Mr Pilger’s suggestion that the corporation should not have broadcast tributes to Nelson Mandela from Mr Obama because he had failed to close Guantanamo Bay, or from Mr Cameron because he had visited South Africa during the Apartheid era. In a seven-minute diatribe against the ‘criminal power of our government’, Mr Pilger also suggested the centuries-old conflict between Sunni and Shia Muslims had been caused by the British and American invasion of Iraq in 2003. On Twitter, Mr Robinson said: ‘Pilger always thought-provoking but was he really suggesting that BBC ignore Obama’s Mandela grief as he is a hypocrite? Or Sunni Shia massacres in Syria as Blair & Bush’s fault? Surely, John, those are what we call opinions not facts?’ The decision to give free rein to Assange provoked particular anger. Tory MP Julian Lewis said it was extraordinary that the WikiLeaks founder, who is hiding from justice in the Ecuadorian embassy in  London, was given an unchallenged platform for his views. 'Opinions not facts': BBC political editor Nick Robinson criticised Mr Pilger's segment on Twitter, but admitted he was 'thought provoking' In a special Thought for the Day slot, Assange said: ‘To keep a person ignorant is to place them in a cage. And so it follows that the powerful – if they want to keep their power – will try to know as much about us as they can, and they will try to make sure that we know as little about them as is possible.’ Mr Lewis said: ‘There was no attempt to put an opposing point of view – it was a breach of the BBC’s duty to impartiality. It is not good enough for the BBC to say it is balanced because they have someone putting a right-wing point of view on another issue on another day.’ But Labour backbencher Diane Abbott said Miss Harvey should guest-edit the show ‘every day’. Yesterday’s show also featured a series of poetry readings by actor Ralph Fiennes, including one by Shaker Aamer, the last British resident held in Guantanamo Bay. A weather forecast was replaced by Tom Waits’s song Strange Weather and there were several other musical interludes. Miss Harvey said she agreed to edit the programme only after extracting a promise from the BBC that contributors would be ‘heard in a manner of their choosing, whether that be a monologue, a poem, or interviewing others’. A BBC spokesman last night said the corporation had no plans to review its use of guest editors over the festive period, adding: ‘The well-established role of the guest editors is to bring their own unique ideas and expertise to the Today programme, working closely with the regular programme team to ensure the material meets the BBC’s editorial guidelines.’","Tory MPs accused programme of breaching BBC's duty of impartiality .

"A controversial plan to segregate all people wearing face coverings inside Parliament House has been dumped. The security overhaul, which one MP labelled 'religious apartheid', was abandoned after mounting criticism. However, the Department of Parliamentary Services (DPS) which sets security protocols says all visitors to Parliament House will now be required to temporarily remove any coverings that prevent the recognition of facial features. Scroll down for video . A controversial plan to segregate people wearing face coverings in Parliament House has been dumped in favour of new security measures . Anyone wearing a facial covering is now required to remove it at Parliament House check points for identificatoin purposes before being allowed to view Question Time proceedings from the public gallery . Bronwyn Bishop is the Speaker of the House of Representatives. The decision taken by the Speaker and Senate President Stephen Parry to restrict anyone wearing facial coverings to a glassed-in area of Parliament has now been rescinded and replaced with new rules . Senate president Stephen Parry was asked to reconsider the 'burqa ban' by Prime Minister Abbott. That security measure has now been rescinded in favour of new rules . The DPS says this will enable security staff to identify anyone who may have been previously banned from entering the building or who may be known to be a security risk. 'Once this process has taken place visitors are free to move about the public spaces of the building, including all chamber galleries, with facial coverings in place.' The new security arrangements reverse a decision announced on October 2 to seat people wearing coverings such as a burqa in glassed-off areas, normally reserved for noisy school children. That decision - made by Speaker Bronwyn Bishop and Senate President Stephen Parry - came after more than week of heated debate about the potential security risk posed by burqas. Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who labelled the burqa as 'confronting', intervened in the matter, requesting a review of the decision after it prompted widespread outrage. But Deputy Opposition Leader Tanya Plibersek ridiculed Mr Abbott's comments regarding the burqa being confronting. 'I'd prefer if Tony Abbott didn't get about in his Speedos either, but it's a free country,' she said. Prime Minister Tony Abbott calls the burqa 'confronting' but asked the Speaker of the House, Bronwyn Bishop and the Senate President, to reconsider the ban inside parts of Parliament House . The DPS says the security measures for Parliament House have now been 'enhanced'. Procedures are in place to ensure that security manage the arrangements in a 'sensitive and appropriate manner'. The official circular from the DPS states that the new rules are effective immediately: . 'Further to the circular of 2 October 2014 providing for interim access arrangements to the private areas and public galleries at Parliament House, the Presiding Officers met yesterday and enhanced those arrangements. This circular replaces the circular of 2 October with effect from 8.30am Monday 20 October 2014. 'The new interim arrangements are as follows: . (a) The renewal and issue of sponsored passes remains suspended. (b) Photographic identification is required for the issue of escorted passes for all adult visitors. (c) All visitors entering Parliament House will be required to temporarily remove any coverings that prevent the recognition of facial features. This will enable DPS security staff to identify any person who may have been banned from entering Parliament House or who may be known, or discovered, to be a security risk. Once this process has taken place, visitors are free to move about the public spaces of the building, including all chamber galleries, with facial coverings in place. New procedures have come into force on Monday at Parliament House in Canberra requiring anyone wearing a facial covering like a burqa to remove it temporarily for identification before being allowed in . 'Procedures are still in place to ensure that DPS security manage these procedures in a sensitive and appropriate manner. 'These measures are designed to enhance and strengthen the existing access, identification and security arrangements at Parliament House. Further amendments and enhancements to pass policy and broader security practice will be implemented in due course.' Deputy Opposition Leader Tanya Plibersek and Palmer United Party Senate Jacqui Lambie hold distinctly opposite views when it comes to the wearing of the burqa . The government was accused of inflaming tensions with the Muslim community when it was revealed the proposed restrictions, which would have forced women wearing head . coverings to view chambers of parliament from the glassed-in . gallery, following a series of high-profile security-related raids across Sydney and Brisbane. 'I asked the Speaker to re-think that decision and my . understanding is that it was an interim decision,' Mr Abbott said at the time. Mr Abbott said the burqa was something he . wished people chose not to wear, but said it was not the role of . government to tell people what to wear outside of secure . buildings. The restrictions were criticised by Muslim groups and . opposition members of parliament, including independent MP . Andrew Wilkie, who called them a form of 'religious apartheid'. Among those who had thrown their weight behind a proposed ban was controversial Palmer United Party Senator Jacqui Lambie who labelled it a 'national security issue'. 'It is like a motorbike helmet. It is like a balaclava,' she said during the debate . 'I will not allow you to wear that into my office because it is a security risk.'","Burqa ban dumped after outrage over 'religious apartheid'

"The number of eggs a woman has may not just indicate her fertility, but overall life expectancy . Women who go through an early menopause may be ageing faster generally, scientists have discovered. They say the number of eggs a woman has may not just indicate her fertility, but overall life expectancy. Specifically, it may predict the risk of a heart attack, New Scientist reports. A woman is born with all the eggs she will ever have and the number declines with age. Previous research has suggested the average woman is born with 300,000 potential egg cells. Going through the menopause anywhere between 45 and 55 is considered the norm, while experiencing it before the age of 40 is known as a premature menopause. A study from the University of Alabama found women who go through an early menopause run twice the risk of a heart attack or stroke in later life. A possible explanation is the reduction in a woman's natural supply of oestrogen at a much earlier stage of life than would normally occur at the menopause. The ovaries make the hormone oestrogen, the hormone that regulates a woman's periods. So when the ovaries stop functioning, the level of oestrogen drops. However oestrogen also has a protective effect on the heart - so after the menopause, the risk of heart disease increases. Post-menopausal women often experience weight gain, particularly around the abdomen, which can contribute to poor health. The new study, presented at the annual meeting of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine in Hawaii, takes this ageing concept a step further. The researchers investigated whether women who have early menopause are ageing faster generally. 'Perhaps women who go through menopause early are intrinsically ageing at a different rate,' lead researcher Professor Marcelle Cedars, of the University of California, San Francisco, told New Scientist. The ovaries make the hormone oestrogen, which has a protective effect on the heart. Levels of the hormone drop after the menopause, raising the risk of heart disease . She and her team analysed blood samples of more than 1,000 women aged 25 to 45 for their level of anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), which estimates the remaining egg supply. The number of eggs was then confirmed using an ultrasound and each woman's biological age was estimated by assessing her telomeres. These are tiny structures that protect DNA from damage and are an indicator of health. Scientists have discovered the reason why women find it difficult to conceive later in life - they have used up 90 per cent of their 'ovarian reserve' by the age of 30. This ovarian reserve - the potential number of eggs women are born with - declines faster than many people realise, the study by the University of St Andrews and Edinburgh University, found. By the age of 30 there is only 12 per cent left on average and by the age of 40 just three per cent, they warned. Found at the ends of chromosomes, they protect the DNA in them from damage, much like the caps on the ends of shoelaces prevent fraying. As we get older, our telomeres get shorter and shorter, leading to DNA becoming damaged and raising the odds of age-related illnesses such as Alzheimer's, diabetes and heart disease. Shorter than average telomeres are seen as a sign of ill health and premature death. Three to five years later, a quarter of the women returned to have their risk of heart disease calculated, based on factors such as weight, blood pressure and cholesterol levels. The researchers found women with lower egg counts were at a higher risk of heart disease. However they also had shorter telomeres - meaning they were at higher risk of conditions such as Alzheimer's and diabetes. Professor Cedars said: 'We think the ovary may be more sensitive to the processes of ageing,' says Cedars, making it like a canary in a coal mine for a general state of accelerated ageing.","Was known that hormone oestrogen has a protective effect on the heart .

"Darrell Simester, 44, was allegedly kept as a slave working 15-hour days on a farm in Wales after running away in 2000 . A mother has described the moment she saw her son for the first time in 13 years, saying he looked like an old man after allegedly being kept in captivity. Cardiff Crown Court heard that Darrell Simester, 44, was kept in a rat-infested shed on a farm in Newport, south Wales, for a decade while being forced to work 15-hour days. Daniel Doran, 67, and David Dan Doran, 42, father and son, are standing trial accused of forcing Mr Simester to carry out unpaid labour. Speaking to the court today, Mr Simester's mother, Jean, recalled the moment she was reunited with her son for the first time in 13 years after a newspaper appeal. The 63-year-oldsaid: 'He looked like a vulnerable old man. He did not look like my son at all. 'He was hunched over and and was more like a man of 90 than a man of 43. 'I just couldn’t believe it was my son. 'I asked him to show me where he’d been living. He took me to his caravan. It was disgusting. It was a disgrace. 'You wouldn’t have had an animal living there.' Jean told the court that Mr Simester was last seen in 2000 while he was living with the Loveridge family, near to her home in Kidderminster, Worcestershire. However he ran away while the group were on holiday in Porthcawl, south Wales, after he got into an argument with Jimmy, the father of the family, who hit him. He was later picked up by a family member of the two defendants while walking on a dual carriageway, and went to work on their farm called Cariad - the Welsh word for 'darling'. Mother-of-four Mrs Simester said: 'I had a phonecall a few weeks after I last saw Darrell saying he had been picked up by two men who offered him accommodation and a job. 'He said he had an argument with the (Jimmy) Loveridge, who had hit him over the head and he’d walked off.' Mrs Simester said she had been reassured her son was going to be 'cared for and looked after' somewhere in Wales. A jury heard Mrs Simester and her husband Tony kept in contact with their son by telephone and were initially given a phone number to call him on. Scroll down for video . Mr Simester was picked up walking along a dual carriageway and taken to Cariad farm (pictured) where he was later found by his family after a tip-off . Mr Simester's mother, Jean, said that her son (left) regularly called her on her mobile to say he was being looked after until 2008, when she contacted the police . However, Mrs Simester said the number began going 'to answerphone' and that her son started calling her from a withheld number. She said: 'How many phonecalls would we receive from him? They would just be at random. They were two or three times a year - you might be lucky to get a fourth. 'What was my opinion as to what Darrell was saying in these calls? It wasn’t the truth...it wasn’t what Darrell would say. 'During a phone call in February 2006, he told me he was married to Mary and got a daughter called Lisa and there was another baby on the way....and he was living in Ireland.' Mrs Simester said she asked her son for a number to call him on, but was told he was 'not allowed' to give one out. She said the last time she spoke to him was Christmas Eve in 2008 while her family were on holiday in Spain. After the phonecalls stopped, Mrs Simester said she 'tried everything' to find out what had happened to her son. 'I’d spend hours on the internet, I got in touch with (charity) Missing People...the Salvation Army and the police.' In 2012, a schoolfriend set up a Facebook page - which later lead to the family contacting a Welsh news site after learning their son may be in the Cardiff area. The court heard that after a story was published about the Simesters’ bid to track down Darrell, they were taken to the gates of Cariad Farm after an anonymous tip-off. The court was earlier told that Mr Simester's brother Duncan went into the farmyard and found a man shovelling manure, which he eventually recognised as his brother. Duncan said Mr Simester was found in poor health, with a large hernia on his groin and scrotum, missing teeth, cystic swelling in his back, and burns on his legs. Mrs Simester said she was 'grateful' for the newspapers’ help, and agreed for a photographer to take a picture of the family together again. Daniel Doran, 67 (left), and his son, David Dan Doran, 42, deny forcing Mr Simester to work without pay . She added: 'I wanted people to know what was going on in this world...that people are being held and being made to work for nothing.' However,  once the story broke Jean said the family became 'pestered by the press' - and they decided to get in touch with PR guru Clarence Mitchell. The court heard Mr Simester was paid £4,000 following an exclusive story for The Sun newspaper. Mrs Simester was asked by Doran senior’s barrister Kevin Malloy QC why the money for that story was not in her son’s bank account. She said: 'That money has been put aside for when Darrell needs it. If ever he needs a holiday or needs to buy him anything else it’s there for him. It’s not anybody else’s - it’s Darrell's.' She also denied suggestions her son had a major gambling problem. Earlier today, Mr Simester’s brother Duncan gave evidence saying his brother had been kicked out of a flat after falling behind with the rent. Duncan also admitted that his brother’s return home had 'caused turmoil or difficulty' for his parents. 'There have been certain moments when things have not been 100% hunky dory,' Duncan said. 'Has he re-engaged his interest in going to the bookies? Yes. 'Did things get to a stage where I hit him? Yes....because I told him to stop gambling and he didn’t. He went down to the betting shop the next day. I had had enough of it.' Duncan added he had an argument with relatives because he felt his brother should not be living with his parents. 'He’s 44 years old. He should not be living at home. He should be old enough to look after himself.' The trial continues.

'You slapped her, you threatened to hit her with a vodka bottle and chased her around the house, throwing her across the sofa. 'You punched her in the face. 'This part of the evening took approximately one hour and in my opinion if formed part of a sustained assault on her. Chanttelle Ward (pictured prior to the attack) was left with scarring and needed counselling after the attack . Culley (pictured outside Newcastle Crown Court at an earlier hearing) was jailed for eight years today . 'You asked her if you were still in a relationship. On her answer you were no longer in a relationship you threw her on the bed and pinned her down. 'You lent down and bit sideways onto her top lip. 'I consider you have caused a very significant disfigurement to this young lady.' The court heard that Miss Ward was left so traumatised after the attack that she needed counselling and has been left with permanent scars. Jurors heard Culley bit down on the her lip with the same force that would be needed to bite through a 1cm thick piece of rubber. As well as the gruesome and 'very deep' injury to her mouth, Miss Ward had bruising and scratches to her head and body after the attack. She told jurors during the trial that Culley had tried to kiss her and asked her if she still loved him before the bite. She said: 'He put his whole mouth around my lips and pulled, I thought that my whole lip had come off. 'There was blood everywhere.' Jurors heard Culley bit down on Miss Ward's lip with the force that would be needed to bite into a 1cm  rubber . The court heard the attack happened at Miss Ward's home after a night out on February 22. Prosecutor Emma Dowling said that after Culley had bitten his victim, he 'rubbed his face in hers, smearing the blood across her face and then he stuck his tongue into her mouth'. She added: 'When the police arrived they saw that they both had blood on them and over their faces.' Culley was arrested and Miss Ward was taken to hospital to have her injuries examined. She suffered not only the injuries to her mouth, but bruising to her arms and body, a scratch to her left breast and bruising of the face and ear. During his evidence, Culley said he did not mean to harm his 'beautiful' girlfriend, who he knew he was lucky to have. At the sentence hearing, the public gallery was packed with his friends, family and supporters and the judge was given more than 20 references from people who know him. The judge said she accepted Culley was ordinarily a 'reliable and helpful' young man who did not pose a risk to the general public before jailing him for eight years.","Rhys Culley, 23, sank his teeth into Chanttelle Ward's face during the attack .

"To date, the overwhelming majority of astronauts have been men, with Russia as an example only recently sending a woman to space after an absence of female cosmonauts for several decades. But the first manned mission to Mars should be all women, a science writer who took part in a simulated mission to the red planet has claimed. She says that females require a lower calorific intake than men and thus need fewer resources, making an all-women mission to Mars cheaper and more feasible. Scroll down for video . A San Francisco writer says the first mission to Mars should be only women. Kate Greene for Slate took part in a simulated mission to the red planet called Hi-Seas (shown). She found that women needed much less resources than men. Most women burned less than 2,000 calories per day, but men regularly exceeded 3,000 . The argument was made by San Francisco-based writer Kate Greene for Slate. Last year she took part in a Nasa project called Hi-Seas (Hawaii Space Exploration Analog and Simulation), which simulated a long-duration mission to Mars on Earth. Ms Greene and five other crewmembers - three men and three women in total - spent four months in a dome on Hawaii, only leaving the habitat in mock spacesuits. This was intended to simulate what an actual mission to Mars might be like, with the crew spending most of their time in a structure. On Mars any future mission will be subject to limited resources, meaning any attempt at such a mission will need to find ways to improve sustainability. And Ms Greene says sending only women to Mars could be the answer, based on her studies throughout the simulated mission. The £620,000 ($1 million) Hi-Seas (Hawaii Space Exploration Analog and Simulation) mission's crew spent four months 8,000 feet (2,440 metres) above sea level in a geodesic-dome habitat on the northern slope of the Mauna Loa volcano. The volcano is a barren landscape, an abandoned quarry with little vegetation that's as similar to Mars' landscape as planet Earth can get. The crew members live under Mars-like conditions. According to Hi-Seas 'communication latencies and blackouts, in close quarters, under strict water-use rules, etc' are part of the deal. The food study was designed to test food preparation strategies for long-term space exploration. Hi-Seas aims to address problems that may be encountered in future space missions by simulating exploration in areas of the world similar to space environments. The aim of the first mission in which Ms Greene took part, funded by Nasa's Human Research Program, the University of Hawaii and Cornell University, was to learn about living and cooking in Mars. The third and latest mission started on 17 October 2014, and will conclude on 15 July 2015. In December Nasa will fly the Orion spacecraft on an unmanned test for the first time. Orion will ultimately be used to take astronauts to and from Mars in the future, but Ms Greene argues that the first mission to the red planet should be composed of only women . 'Week in and week out, the three female crew members expended less than half the calories of the three male crew members. Less than half!' she says. 'We were all exercising roughly the same amount - at least 45 minutes a day for five consecutive days a week - but our metabolic furnaces were calibrated in radically different ways.' She says it was rare for a woman to burn more than 2,000 calories a day, whereas men regularly exceeded 3,000. Her conclusion is that sending women to Mars would be cheaper and more feasible than one with men. Most estimates for a mission to Mars tend to be around £60 billion ($100 billion), but she quotes former Nasa contractor Alan Drysdale as saying that smaller astronauts are a more attractive option than large men. 'Small women haven't been demonstrated to be appreciably dumber than big women or big men, so there's no reason to choose larger people for a flight crew when it's brain power you want,' said Drysdale. 'The logical thing to do is to fly small women.' Ms Greene adds that most astronauts prefer to work in diverse groups of men and women. 'Still, if the bottom line is what matters in getting to Mars, the more women the better,' she concludes. On Mars any future mission will be subject to limited resources, meaning any attempt at such a mission will need to find ways to improve sustainability. And Ms Greene says sending only women to Mars could be the answer, based on her studies throughout the simulated mission .","San Francisco writer says the first mission to Mars should be only women .

"The FN party, led by Marine Le Pen, entered the senate for the first time, securing two seats . France's far-right National front party was today celebrating a 'historic victory' as it won its first  seats in the upper house of parliament. The party (FN), led by Marine Le Pen, entered the senate for the first time, securing two seats. It was at the expense of Francois Hollande's struggling left-wing government, which is rapidly losing its grip on parliament. FN leader Le Pen, who is anti-immigration and anti-euro, said the election was a 'historic victory' for the party once synonymous with shaven-headed thugs and Third Reich nostalgia. She added: 'These results are beyond what we hoped for. Each day that passes, our ideas are increasingly being adopted by the French people. We have great potential.' Stephane Ravier, one of the two newly elected FN senators, said: 'There is only one door left for us to push and it is that of the Elysee [presidential palace].' Half of the Senate's 348 seats were up for grabs in the election, with only some 158,000 people, the vast majority local councillors, able to vote. The conservative UMP party of former President Nicolas Sarkozy and its centre-right ally, the UDI party, won 188 seats –13 seats more than needed for an absolute majority, according to the latest figures released early on Monday morning. President Hollande's Socialist party still controls the National Assembly, or lower house. It comes after a strong showing by the far right in European elections in May. One in four French voters, or 25 per cent of the electorate, voted for the FN. The Socialists also suffered huge setbacks in municipal polls that saw the right make significant gains. Many have accused Mr Hollande’s mismanagement of allowing extremists to flourish in a country where unemployment is now at 3.4 million . Recent opinion polls suggest President Hollande has become the most unpopular French president in modern times, with only 13 per cent of people saying they were satisfied with his performance. Many have accused Mr Hollande’s mismanagement of allowing extremists to flourish in a country where unemployment is now at 3.4 million. The FN are now even talking of victory in the 2017 presidential elections, when Le Pen will stand as head of state. He has been hit by a recent cabinet revolt over austerity measures and criticised in a book by former first lady Valerie Trierweiler, who claimed the Socialist leader despised the poor, labelling them 'the toothless ones'. The president has vehemently denied the allegation. Marine Le Pen, right, was described as the 'ideal physical specimen for this part of France' by her father . As the daughter of a greatly reviled politician, Holocaust denier Jean-Marie Le Pen, Marine Le Pen grew up in an atmosphere of fear and intimidation. In 1976, aged eight, a bomb tore through the front of the family’s apartment building in Paris while she, her parents and two older sisters were asleep. They escaped unhurt. More trauma was to come when she was 16 and her mother, Pierrette, ran off with a reporter from Le Figaro newspaper who was writing a biography on her father. Her parent’s bitter divorce was played out in the papers, and the French edition of Playboy. It meant Jean-Marie was left to bring up his daughters alone and so Marine became closer to her father. At 18, she joined the Front National (indeed, all the Le Pen girls became active in the party). After attending one of France’s top law schools, Marine Le Pen pursued a short career as a lawyer until 1998, when she ceased practising and became the head of the FN’s legal department. Her devotion to the party has been blamed for her own inability to enjoy stable long-term relationships. Both her ex-husbands were in the Front National. She has three children and has been through two divorces. In her political career, she has attracted criticism for calling for the banning of the Jewish skullcap in public, saying that schools should be prevented from offering non-pork alternatives to Muslim and Jewish pupils and comparing Muslims praying in the streets outside overflowing mosques to the Nazi occupation of France in World War Two.","FN party, led by Marine Le Pen, won two seats in the upper parliament .

"Warned: Prime Minister David Cameron has been told sending arms to Syrian rebels could see them end up in the hands of Islamist terrorists who target the West . David Cameron has been warned against sending arms to Syrian rebels amid fears they would end up in the hands of Islamist terrorists who target the West. Up to 3,000 surface-to-air missiles have gone missing in Libya since the conflict -  and spy chiefs say the state has become the 'Tesco' of the world's illegal arms trade. More than one million tonnes of weapons belonging to Colonel Gaddafi were looted from arms dumps after the dictator was toppled in October 2011. MI6 agents fear large numbers of . weapons - which included 22,000 shoulder-launched missiles capable of . bringing down an aircraft - have been smuggled out of Libya to groups . linked to Al Qaeda. Security . sources are said to fear that, if the rebels fighting tyrant Bashar . al-Assad's regime in Syria are armed by the West, a similar situation . could arise there - with the weapons falling into the hands of Islamic . extremists in the country. It . is understood MI6 estimates there are now more weapons in Libya than . the entire arsenal of the British Army — and much of it is unsecured. The Libyan government remains in a precarious position, with large parts of the army dominated by local militias. There . were thought to be 22,000 shoulder-launched anti-aircraft missiles, . known as manpads, at the time of Gaddafi's death in October 2011. And although the majority are believed to have been destroyed MI6 estimates about 3,000 are still unaccounted for. Just one such missile could bring down a civilian airliner if it fell into the wrong hands. As well as the security services, several military figures have deep reservations about any plans to arm the rebels in Syria. General Sir Richard Dannatt, the former head of the army, yesterday said he was 'very much in the camp of those who would not wish to be involved and intervene in any shape or form.' Major General Julian Thompson, who commanded British forces in the Falklands War in 1982, said it was 'absolutely ridiculous' to contemplate another intervention at a time when troop numbers were being cut. Ministers will confirm tomorrow another 5,000 Army personnel will lose their jobs. 'People will think it is absolutely ridiculous,' said Maj Gen Thompson. 'The thought of getting involved with something else before we finish what we are trying to do in Afghanistan would certainly not be good for morale.' More than one million tonnes of weapons belonging to Colonel Gaddafi were looted from arms dumps after the dictator was toppled in October 2011 . Mr Cameron is in a precarious position because he is keen to support US President Barack Obama. America plans to channel small arms to the rebels but has no immediate intention of seeking international agreement to impose a no-fly zone. But the dangers of this became starker yesterday SUN when an internet video showed a stockpile of surface-to-air missiles had fallen into the hands of jihadists fighting in Syria. The film shows a stash of at least 30 Soviet-era SA-16 heat-seeking missiles - the most advanced anti-aircraft weapons yet seen with in the clutches of the Islamists. Known as the 'Needle', SA-16 missiles can hit aircraft flying at 11,000ft. They would be particularly dangerous if used for attacks from airport perimeters. Military experts are concerned that arms supplied to Syrian rebels would find their way to fanatics who would then use them to target Britain. Charles Lister, an analyst at IHS Jane's Terrorism and Insurgency Centre, said: 'If the West ever did provide weapons to the moderate insurgency, there is still a high chance weapons will cross between different groups and almost invariably end up in the hands of groups like this.' Meanwhile, Mr Cameron has been warned that Britain would suffer 'unacceptable' casualties in a war with Syria. Sources said the RAF risked losing up to 50 per cent of fighter jets deployed to enforce a no-fly zone because of Syria's extensive air defence system, which is based around infra-red guided missiles. One well-placed insider said: 'It has been stressed to the Prime Minister that attacking Syria would not be the same as attacking Libya.'","Up to 3,000 surface-to-air missiles went missing in Libya .

"Skeletal remains found in two rusting cars at the bottom of an Oklahoma lake belong to six people who vanished in two separate incidents more than 40 years ago, DNA tests have confirmed. The discovery - made accidentally as police tested out sonar in Foss Lake in September 2013 - brings an end to two cold cases, stretching back to 1969 and 1970. This week, more than a year after the discovery, the state Medical Examiner's Office confirmed the identities of the bodies, and said they all died from drowning in accidental deaths, CNN reported. In one car, a 1969 blue Camaro with a white top, investigators found the bodies of 16-year-old Jimmy Williams, who was driving, and his friends Thomas Rios and Leah Johnson, both 18. Scroll down for video . Solved: From left, Jimmy Williams, 16, Leah Gail Johnson, 18, and Thomas Michael Rios, 18, disappeared in 1970. Their remains were discovered in a lake last year and DNA tests have just confirmed their identities . Discovery: A photograph from September 18, 2013 shows law enforcement officials examining two cars pulled from Foss Lake in Oklahoma. They were discovered as police tested out sonar equipment in the lake . On November 20, 1970, Williams was driving the two older teens in his new car - which he had bought just three days before - as they made their way to a football match, but they never arrived. The second car, a green 1952 Chevrolet, was carrying 69-year-old John Alva Porter, Cleburn Hammack, 42, and Nora Marie Duncan, 58, who vanished on April 8, 1969. The friends were last seen 'when their 1953 green Chevrolet car was given a push to help it get started,' according to a July 1969 newspaper article published in Oklahoma. Authorities discovered the cars accidentally when dive teams conducting training with sonar at Foss Lake came upon the vehicles. Even though the cars were linked to cases years apart, they were found submerged side-by-side, 12ft under the surface of the murky water. When authorities pulled the cars out, they were stunned to find bones inside, Betsy Randolph, spokesman for the Oklahoma Highway Patrol, said last year. Found: Teams found a 1969 Camaro and a 1952 Chevrolet  and were shocked to see skeletons inside . Evidence: An investigator takes a picture of a shoe at the crime scene where six bodies and two cars were pulled from the lake last year. The discoveries finally solve two decades-old cold cases . Bizarre: Even though the cars were from two separate cases, they were found side-by-side in the lake . Proud owner: Jimmy Williams is pictured by his new Camaro just days before he vanished . Jimmy Allen Williams, 16, and his friends Thomas Michael Rios, 18, and Leah Gail Johnson, 18, disappeared on On November 20, 1970 - baffling their community. Jimmy, who had a part time job at a grocery store, had bought himself a brand new Camaro muscle car just three days before he vanished. He told his parents he was going to a football game, but according to reports at the time, he backed up his car to the back door of the home and loaded shotguns into the trunk with the help of one of his younger brothers. According to one of his friends called Wayne, the three friends were actually going on a shooting trip. Wayne said he was had planned to join them but changed his mind at the last minute because there was not enough room for him in the car. The three teenagers never returned home. When the cars were pulled from the lake, their bodies were found among the rifles and beer bottles. The medical examiner determined that they had died from drowning. 'When they pulled the cars out of the water, the first one that came out they found bones in the car,' she said. 'When they pulled the second car out, another set of bones was discovered. 'The divers then went back in the water and searched around and found a skull. 'We thought it was just going to be stolen vehicles and that's not what it turned out to be, obviously.' Although the cars were found close to a boat ramp, authorities said the water was so cloudy that it was understandable that they had remained undetected for decades. The unexpected discovery of the remains brought closure to a community who had long questioned how six people could vanish without trace. Last year, the family of Thomas Rios said his mother never gave up hope that her son would be found, after he made an off-the-cuff comment once about how easy it would be to disappear. Pearl Guzman had insisted on staying in the town where Thomas grew up so that he could find them again, and regularly called the police for updates until she died, heartbroken, in 2010. 'Mom didn't ever want to leave Sayre because she told us if Thomas came back, he'd be looking for us,' Lucia VanZandt, his sister, told the Associated Press. 'Since we didn't have a body to lay to rest, it was just like he vanished.' VanZandt, who was 16 when her brother vanished, recounted how her mother appeared to shrink after her brother's disappearance. 'She was beside herself. She couldn't cope,' she said, adding that her mother pulled through thanks to her strong Christian faith. In a tragic twist, the missing teenager's brother died just hours before Thomas's remains were finally discovered. Leah Johnson was Native American and related to legendary Indian chief Sitting Bull, Dayva Spitzer, publisher of The Sayre Record & Beckham County Democrat newspaper, told CNN. Scene: The cars were 12ft below the surface of the murky water in Foss Lake in Foss, Oklahoma, pictured . Bottles of beer were also found in the car believed to belong to the teenagers and rifles were found inside the car, suggesting they might have gone hunting instead of heading to the game. Spitzer said. The mystery surrounding the teenagers' disappearance led to theories that they had stumbled across a crime and had been murdered - but the medical examiner's conclusion suggests they accidentally drove into the lake and drowned there. Kim Carmichael, a friend Jimmy Williams, told Oklahoma's News9: 'I just remember how devastated everybody was. We lived in a little town ... Nothing like that ever happened in Sayre.' At the time of the disappearance, her father was the undersheriff in nearby Beckham County where the teenagers were last seen. He died in 2003 never knowing what happened. 'He said there was nothing,' she recounted. 'There were no leads, no nothing. He said it was just like they vanished into thin air.'","Two cars, a 1969 Camaro and a 1952 Chevrolet, were accidentally found at the bottom of Foss Lake last year as police tested sonar equipment .

"There aren't many people who like to be taken for a ride. But that's exactly what one Lowestoft resident wanted... and the more tumultuous the ride, the better. Adrenaline junkie David Ellis dedicated his life to roller coasters after a childhood trip to Great Yarmouth Pleasure Beach sparked his interest - and has just clocked his 1,000th ride. Mr Ellis travelled more than 1,500 miles on the rides and visited 22 countries in his bid to become one of just 40 people to have conquered the thousand coaster challenge. An unusual achievement: Adrenaline addict David Ellis celebrated his 1,000th roller coaster ride . Strapped in: Mr Ellis  riding the Mindbender - the world's largest indoor triple looping coaster - in Edmonton, Canada . The 48-year-old accountant  likes nothing more than the rush of a loop-the-loop, normally associated with thrill-seeking teenagers. His passion started  on a family holiday when he was aged just ten. He said: 'The roller coaster at Great Yarmouth Pleasure Beach was my first ever coaster and it still holds a special place in my heart. 'My dad took me for the first time and although I was a bit nervous I immediately got a taste for coasters and I became determined to ride as many as I could.' Since then he's worked his way round theme parks all over the UK taking in classics such as the Big One at Blackpool Pleasure Beach and Stealth at Thorpe Park. He once drove four hours to Alton Towers  to ride Nemesis 64 times and drive straight back again.

The first time was in Wales in 1999 and he did it for a dare. Since then he's been combining his passion for roller coasters with record-breaking nudity. He has twice set and beaten the world record for the most people without any clothes on a roller coaster. He said: 'In 1999 the park manager of a theme park in Wales dared members of the European Coaster Club – which I'm a member of - to go on naked and said he wouldn't run the ride past midnight unless we all stripped. 'It was a good laugh and we all really enjoyed it. 'Then in May 2004 I was approached by Thorpe Park to break a world record attempt for the largest number of naked people on a roller coaster.

'We do have a nudist beach close to where I live which I've been known to visit. I'm not at all shy.' In the last 20 years his quest to find new roller coasters has taken him outside the UK and his dutiful wife Susan has followed him round the globe. The couple even rode a roller coaster on the morning of their wedding in 2002 in Vegas. David said: 'Susan is not quite as mad as me because I'm a bit of an adrenaline junkie.

"Patients face either paying for some treatments or going without if the NHS fails to close a £30billion black hole in its budget, its experts have warned. They have refused to rule out charges if the health service cannot be run cheaper – or receives extra money from the Government. It came after a report by the head of the NHS Simon Stevens warned that the health service would have an annual deficit of £30billion by 2020/21. Patients may have to start paying for non-urgent procedures and even to make GP appointments if costs are not cut, experts have warned . But estimates show that even if it makes unprecedented cost-savings, it will still need an extra £8billion from the Government. David Bennett, chief executive of Monitor, the NHS financial watchdog, refused to rule out charging patients if this money is not forthcoming. And the NHS’s most senior doctor Professor Bruce Keogh said that it was crucial that the NHS closes the funding gap for services to remain free of charge. He said: ‘The money will be a big issue. 'But in my mind the real issue is the immeasurable value of living in a society where you, your family, your neighbours can get high quality, modern care without having to worry about money when you’re already anxious and in pain.’ Previously, other health experts have warned that in future patients may be forced to pay up to £10 for a GP appointment, or £75 for a night in a hospital bed. Professor Bruce Keogh said funding would be an issue if changes were not made . They include Rob Webster, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, who earlier this month said bosses would have to ‘think the unthinkable’. Doctors have also suggested patients will have to pay for some non-urgent procedures such as hip and knee replacement and cataract surgery or go without. The NHS’s annual budget is currently £110billion a year and this amount has been ring-fenced from the public spending cuts which have hit other departments in the past five years. But it needs much more money to cater for ever increasing costs of treating the ageing and more obese population. Mr Stevens’ report contained a series of key recommendations to save the NHS money in the long-term by preventing patients becoming ill and providing care more cheaply. These include recruiting an army of volunteers to carry out tasks such as feeding patients in hospital or looking after them at home in return for getting £200 off their council tax bill. Other measures will see GPs and doctors carrying out consultations by email or webcam particularly for frail patients with long-term conditions. Mr Stevens also urged employers to offer cash prizes or vouchers to help staff lose weight to tackle obesity. But even if these plans are implemented, it is estimated the NHS will still need an extra £8billion of funding from the Government. This is to meet the ever-growing costs of caring for the ageing and more obese population succumbing to long-term illnesses such as heart disease and dementia. Mr Stevens said the NHS was ‘at a crossroads’, adding: ‘We have no choice but to do this. If we do it, a better NHS is possible; if we don’t the consequences for patients will be severe.’ Yesterday Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the Government, if re-elected next year, could provide the needed funding but the NHS would also have to make efficiency savings. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said he could provide the extra funding if the Conservatives were elected in May but that the Service needed to make efficiency savings . Speaking on BBC News, he added the Conservatives were committed to ‘protecting and increasing’ funding in real terms. He said: ‘A strong NHS needs a strong economy – then it is possible to increase spending this report calls for. ‘We will need to find greater efficiency savings. It will be tough to do so, and don’t underestimate the challenge.’ Labour has pledged to increase the NHS’s budget by £2.5billion a year on top of inflation – but that money will not arrive until 2017. Health chief's ten-point prescription for reform . The report by chief executive of NHS England Simon Stevens said more money in itself would not be enough to prevent service cuts – major structural reforms are essential. Here the Mail’s Whitehall Correspondent Daniel Martin details the main proposals: . Simon Stevens said changes must be made if the NHS is to continue running in the same way as it has for generations .","NHS will have annual deficit if costs are not lowered, experts warned .
Government 'must pay extra £8billion or patients could be charged'
Aging and gradually more obese population is adding costs to hospitals .
Family doctors should provide more services traditionally provided in hospital. GPs should carry out more scans and tests, to prevent patients having to make so many trips to hospital, and start to employ consultants and psychiatrists.
GP surgeries should be set up in hospitals to deal with less acute cases and reduce numbers of the elderly needlessly admitted to wards. With a night in a hospital bed costing hundreds of pounds, this has the potential to save huge sums.
Major structural change for urgent care services, to ensure they work ‘seven days a week’. A&E departments should collaborate with failing out-of-hours services, potentially even being merged.
It should be easier for women to give birth outside hospital – a plan which would deliver significant savings. This could involve midwives setting up their own community-based midwifery services.
Reform of care homes, to ensure they provide more health services and rehabilitation help after falls.
More consultations with doctors should take place on email and via webcam. This would save people the trouble of trailing to hospital and also because it is a more efficient use of money.
Specialist services – such as heart operations – should be centralised to ensure the quality of care is maintained. At present, there are too many centres, which is costly for the NHS.
People who volunteer in hospitals, or to care for the elderly in their homes, should receive council tax discounts of up to £200.
NHS cash should go to companies so they can reward staff who lose weight with shopping vouchers and prizes. Councils should play their part on health, such as curbs on junk food outlets, so people do not end up in hospital in the first place.
And underpinning all this is the hope that the public will start to take more responsibility for their own health. Mr Stevens warns only by losing weight, giving up smoking and doing more exercise will the numbers ending up in hospital go down."

"A new campaign has been launched to make Halloween safer for children with food allergies. The Teal Pumpkin Project, organized by FARE (Food Allergy Research and Education), encourages people to offer trick-or-treaters small toys rather than candy, which may contain milk, nuts and other potentially harmful ingredients. Participants are asked to paint a pumpkin teal and place it in front of their house to indicate that they're providing non-edible treats. Paint it blue: A new campaign to make Halloween safer for kids with food allergies asks participants to place a teal pumpkin in front of their house to indicate that they're offering non-edible treats . 'Food allergies are potentially life-threatening,' FARE spokeswoman Veronica LaFemina told Today.com, adding that one in 13 children in the Unites States has one. 'When we are looking at a Halloween celebration, it is really nice to provide something that is safe,' she said. The organization's website suggests giving out bouncy balls, stickers, coins, playing cards, crayons, noisemakers, glow sticks or pencils. Good cause: Lucky Ladd Farms (pictured) in Eagleville, Tennessee, is supporting the Teal Pumpkin Project . The guidelines also advise Halloween hosts to check ingredients, as allergens can be found in some non-food items - for example Play-Doh, which contains wheat. The Food Allergy Community of East Tennessee came up with the idea last year, before FARE took it nationwide. Teal was used because it's the color of food allergy awareness, according to the organization's website. Fun for everyone: 'That moment when you see a child get to have a treat that they don’t have to trade out or give away is really something special,' FARE spokeswoman Veronica LaFemina said . Ms LaFemina told ABC News that she expects the campaign to have a big impact for young allergy sufferers.

The missing tourist has been confirmed as coming from Shanghai, and the Chinese consulate have issued an emergency telephone number for concerned families. A receptionist at the hotel declined to comment, as did police in the district. A Philippines intelligence official said the attackers were believed to be from the Abu Sayaff group, a militant Muslim group that claims allegiance to al-Qaida and has been implicated in other kidnappings for ransom in the region before.

Last November, suspected Abu Sayyaf militants shot and killed a Taiwanese tourist and kidnapped his wife from a resort in the Semporna area. The women was released a month later in the southern Philippines. Authorities have not disclosed whether a ransom was paid. The Abu Sayyaf had tenuous historical links to international militant networks, including al-Qaida, but a U.S.-assisted Philippine military crackdown on the group's heartland in Sulu province in the southern Philippines has weakened it considerably in recent years. The group has around 300 fighters and is more focused on ransom kidnappings than the global jihadi cause. In 2000, Abu Sayyaf gunmen crossed the porous maritime border with Malaysia in speedboats and snatched 21 European tourists and Malaysian and Filipino workers from Malaysia's Sipadan diving resort and brought them to the southern Philippines, where the captives were later released in exchange for ransom.

"The US-led coalition hit Islamic State group targets in Syria's central province of Homs for the first time Saturday as it pressed what Washington says are 'near continuous' strikes, a monitoring group said. The coalition also targeted IS, also known as Isis, in the town of Minbej, east of second city Aleppo, for the first time, as well as multiple targets in the jihadist heartland province of Raqa, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. Observatory director Rami Abdel Rahman said the targets hit in Homs province were far away from the front line with forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad, who control Homs city, Syria's third largest. The US-led coalition hit Islamic State group targets in Syria's central province of Homs for the first time Saturday as it pressed what Washington says are 'near continuous' strikes, a monitoring group said. Pictured are a pair of U.S Air Force F-15E Strike Eagles returning from a bombing mission in Syria . An F/A-18F Super Hornet lands aboard the aircraft carrier USS George H.W. Bush, which is supporting U.S.-led coalition airstrikes on Islamic State group . 'The US-Arab coalition has for the first time struck IS bases in the eastern desert of Homs province,' Abdel Rahman said, adding that the positions were in the area of Al-Hammad, east of ancient city Palmyra. Washington has been keen not to let Assad's forces exploit the air campaign against IS to take the upper hand in the more than three-year-old civil war. In eastern Aleppo province - the western limit of IS control - the coalition hit several jihadist targets in Minbej, said the Observatory, which relies on a broad network of activists and doctors for its reports. Further east, the coalition pounded the city of Raqa, which the jihadists have made their headquarters, the Britain-based group said. The guided-missile cruiser USS Philippine Sea (CG 58) launches a Tomahawk cruise missile to conduct strikes against ISIL targets as seen from the aircraft carrier USS George H.W. Bush . British Tomahawk missiles are set to soon join American ones in the fight against the Islamic State terrorists . A Royal Navy hunter-killer nuclear submarine carrying Tomahawks is already in place in the region awaiting targets for attack . Airstrikes in northern Syria killed the 'world's most wanted terrorist' before his band of Islamist militants were able to carry out deadly 'toothpaste tube bomb attacks' on the U.S. and Europe, American officials believe. Muhsin al-Fadhl, 33, was identified as the leader of the Al Qaeda-affiliated Khorasan Group - a radical terror collective specializing in intercepting Western jihadists on their arrival in Syria, and training them to carry out deadly bomb attacks on targets in their home nations. As well as an American and Arab coalition hitting targets relating to ISIS militants in Syria yesterday, the U.S. air force also independently struck Khorasan as intelligence suggested the group were nearing 'the execution phase' of a terror atrocity against a Western target that could have rivalled 9/11. Details of the alleged death of al-Fadhl emerged this afternoon from a U.S. military official speaking on condition of anonymity. Despite his relatively young age, the Kuwait-born militant was an Al Qaeda veteran; joining the terror group as a teenager and becoming so close to its leadership that he was among a select few with prior knowledge of the 9/11 attacks in America, despite having only just turned 20 at the time. 'At least 31 explosions were heard in Raqa city and its surroundings.' The strikes also hit IS targets around the town of Tabqa, which houses an air base whose capture by the jihadists last month sealed their occupation of the whole of Raqa province, as well as two training camps, the Observatory added. The United States and its Arab allies launched air strikes against IS and other jihadist positions in northern and eastern Syria on Tuesday. A US defence official told AFP on Friday that the mission is now similar to US-led air raids against IS in Iraq, with 'near continuous' combat flight operations over Syria. It comes as Britain, Belgium and Denmark added their firepower to the operation against Isis. The European politicians flatly described the moves as critical to security on home soil, arguing that facing down terrorists has become a matter of urgency. Prime Minister David Cameron made a passionate plea on Friday for action in drastic terms - noting that the militants had beheaded their victims, gouged out eyes and carried out crucifixions to promote goals 'from the Dark Ages.' 'This is about psychopathic terrorists that are trying to kill us and we do have to realize that, whether we like it or not, they have already declared war on us,' he said. 'There isn't a ""walk on by"" option. There isn't an option of just hoping this will go away.' Cameron told a tense House of Commons during more than six hours of debate that the hallmarks of the campaign would be 'patience and persistence, not shock and awe' - a reference to the phrase associated with the invasion of Iraq. That unpopular intervention has cast a shadow over the discussions because critics fear that Europe will be drawn into a wider conflict, specifically taking on the Islamic group's fighters in Syria. British MPs voted 524-43 for action after being urgently recalled from a recess. Belgian lawmakers also overwhelmingly approved, voting 114-2 to take part, despite widespread concerns that more terrorism may follow in their homeland as a result. The White House said in a statement that it welcomed the countries to the coalition. 'These decisions - along with those by Saudi Arabia, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Qatar to participate in airstrikes against ISIL in Syria - demonstrate the clear commitment of the international community to take action together against these terrorists,' the statement reads.

A formation of US Navy F-18E Super Hornets leaving after receiving fuel from a KC-135 Stratotanker over northern Iraq on Tuesday. These aircraft were part of a large coalition strike package that was the first to strike ISIL targets in Syria . Air strikes by the UK will increase the risk of terror attacks in Britain by jihadists returning from fighting in Syria and Iraq, the EU’s anti-terrorism chief warned yesterday. The number of Europeans fighting for IS was rising all the time, posing a major threat to EU countries, said Gilles de Kerchove. If his figure of 3,000 is correct, it means that almost a tenth of Islamic State fighters may be European, with some 500 of those coming from Britain. Mr de Kerchove said it was significant that France, the only European nation so far to have carried out air strikes, has already been singled out by IS for terrorist attacks targeting the Paris metro. Speaking to the BBC, Mr de Kerchove also warned that groups competing with IS, such as Al Qaeda, may try to launch attacks in Europe to maintain their profile.","The coalition also targeted IS in the town of Minbej for the first time .

"This is the devastating moment a heavily pregnant zebra was killed by hyenas in Africa. It was a scene that photographer Marc Mol found incredibly difficult to watch – other onlookers couldn’t bear it and left, he said . The harrowing scene unfolded in Kenya’s Maasai Mara National Reserve in Narok County, with the mare set upon by 20 hyenas. Heart-breaking: The heavily pregnant zebra is simply unable to get away as the hyenas attack . Savage: The hyenas attacked in huge numbers - but the zebra looked defiant at times . Brutal: The hyenas gather around the zebra's rear, with some soaked in blood . Surrounded: The zebra doesn't stand a chance against so many of the predators but she still tries to stand up . The zebra looked on in a stoic and defiant manner as the animals attacked. Wildlife photographer Mr Mol revealed that the zebra’s misery lasted for 20 minutes. Mr Mol said: ‘It was one of the most remarkable events I've ever seen. Merciless: The hyenas attacked in a frenzy, with one pictured here almost completely covered in blood . Helpless: The zebra doesn't have the strength to escape . Instinct: The hyenas quickly sense that the zebra won't be able to get away . Vicious: More and more hyenas become covered in blood as the attack goes on . Numb: The zebra didn't make a sound as the attack took place, probably as it was in shock, according to photographer Marc Mol . ‘My wife and I observed this predation by a pack of hyenas on this poor and unfortunate Zebra mare who was heavily pregnant and simply couldn't keep up with the herd. ‘It was the first time my guide of 15 years and I had ever witnessed something like this. ‘Subsequently the unborn foal was savagely ripped out and carried off by one of the hyenas. The end is close: These pictures were taken shortly before the zebra died, with the hyenas tearing flesh off her . Final heartbreaking moment: A hyena carries the mare's unborn foal away . ‘It was absolutely heart-breaking to watch, simply too much for one person in another vehicle next to us and they left after this happened. ‘Throughout the attack, the mare didn't utter a sound as the savagery of the pack set in, no doubt in severe shock. ‘It was not an easy event to photograph and document as I witnessed two lives being taken, but this is after all the struggle for survival in the circle of life.’ Mr Mol also revealed that one hyena made off with the unborn foal and a black-backed jackal stole some of its kill. Feared predators: The attack showed just why hyenas are so dangerous, especially when hunting in packs . Intruder: A jackal stole some of the hyena's kill .","WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"Hugo Lloris has revealed how the France players used footballs as missiles in an attempt to knock the drone that flew over their training ground last week from the sky. Speaking after the French opened their World Cup campaign with an impressive 3-0 win over an over-physical Honduras, the France captain spoke of this extraordinary incident that brought one of their training sessions to a halt. ‘It’s a good invention,’ Lloris said with a smile. ‘It looked like a little helicopter. Very small and it flew well. It’s a good object for journalists, yes?VIDEO: Scroll down for France fans in Sao Paulo enjoy 3-0 World Cup win over Honduras . Clapper: Hugo Lloris acknowledges the fans after France's 3-0 victory over Honduras on Sunday . Missiles: The drone flew over their training ground during a session last week . ‘We heard it and then we saw it. We didn’t see anyone controlling. Maybe they were behind the stand or the hotel. But there was nothing we could do to stop it – maybe kick the ball at it. But it’s a big challenge to hit it.’ On Saturday Didier Deschamps said the matter – something the France coach described as an invasion of their privacy – was now being investigated by FIFA. Curiously, a FIFA spokesperson has said they have not received an official complaint from the French federation. In the same Deschamps press conference a Honduran journalist insisted his country was not responsible for the small, unmanned aircraft that was presumably armed with a camera. ‘No?’ said Deschamps with more than a hint of suspicion. If Honduras were responsible – and they continue to vehemently deny it – it did not do them much good here in Porto Alegre. Was Lloris concerned on privacy grounds? ‘Players can do nothing about that,’ he said with a shrug. ‘We can’t have control of the drone. Maybe the guy is from the hotel just behind the stand and you can’t see him. Maybe with a good job of the security we can find him!’ Brace yourself: Karim Benzema scored two as France beat Honduras in their opening game on Sunday . Harmonious: Didier Deschamps has created a seemingly more harmonious France camp than before . 2002: France 0-1 Senegal . 2006: France 0-0 Switzerland . 2010: France 0-0 Uruguay . If Karim Benzema was among those who launched a football at the drone, he proved more accurate against Honduras. This World Cup has so far seen the big-name forwards make an early impact and Benzema was no exception, the Real Madrid striker scoring twice on his World Cup debut. ‘He had a really good season with Real Madrid, winning the Champions League final,’ said Lloris. ‘That has given him good confidence. He played well during the preparation games and he was in excellent condition to play today. Fumble: Honduras' goalkeeper Noel Valladares spills the ball over the line to give France a 2-0 lead . Goal-line technology: The ball was ruled in after the decision was taken to video replay for the first time at a World Cup . 'He showed that, scoring two, maybe three depending on the FIFA goal-line decision, and it was important for him and for the team to start well because he is a decisive player for France. Maybe he is our key player and he showed it today. ‘When you play for Real Madrid you have to be a special player. He is still young but he is an excellent player. He has a big talent and for him this competition is the perfect platform to show who he is to everyone. 'This was his first game at the World Cup after being left out four years ago. For all players the World Cup only comes every four years and when you have the chance to play you have to take it. 'You have to enjoy the possibility to play at your best level and do everything for the team. That’s what every player did today.’ Seeing red: Wilson Palacios was sent off just before half time after a second bookable offence for flooring Paul Pogba in the area . Lucky: But the Juventus midfielder could perhaps consider himself fortunate for not being sent off himself for an incident with the same player earlier . Lloris said the France players should be more than happy with the manner of their performance against physically aggressive opponents who were reduced to 10 men before half-time thanks to the dismissal of Wilson Palacios. ‘It’s a good start,’ said Lloris. ‘We expected that kind of game and we had a good control. It was a tough game physically because Honduras play very hard, very strong. But we stayed very calm and played our own game. We created some chances and we scored. ‘We have to stay calm because it’s just the first game. We have two more strong games against Switzerland and Ecuador, so it was important to get the three points today to put us in a good position with good confidence. I think the next game will be decisive for us. ‘I don’t want to compare to four years ago. But for me and everyone it was really important to start well this time and come into the competition with a good performance and a good result.’","French players used footballs as missiles to try and knock down a drone that flew over their training ground .

"A former nuclear engineer on Tuesday was convicted of murder for poisoning his wife with a lethal dose of nicotine in Southern California in 1994. Jurors in Orange County Superior Court found Paul Curry, 57, guilty of first-degree murder in the death of his then-50-year-old wife, Linda, a district attorney's statement said. Curry killed his wife to collect more than half a million dollars in life insurance and benefits after she died, prosecutors said. He sedated his wife with the sleep drug Ambien before injecting her with nicotine, Ebrahim Baytieh, deputy district attorney for Orange County, said during the trial.

Almost got away with murder: It was 20 years before Paul Curry, 57, was found guilty for murdering his wife . Murdered: Linda was murdered by her husband in 1994 who sedated her with ambien and then injected her with a lethal dose of nicotine so he could gain $500,000 in life insurance and benefits . Curry's wife suffered from a series of health issues including anxiety, depression and stomach pain, Curry's lawyer, Lisa Kopelman, has said. A message seeking comment was left for Kopelman on Tuesday. But she insisted on Curry's innocence during trial. 'This case is all about conjecture, innuendo and suspicions, and that is not what guilt beyond a reasonable doubt is,' she said, according to City News Service. Curry and his wife met in 1989 when they worked at the San Onofre nuclear power plant in northern San Diego County. Curry had previously been married, but he left his former wife after she was rejected for life insurance, Baytieh said. Curry was arrested in 2010 in Salina, Kansas, where he had rebuilt his life and worked as a building official. ""For 16 years, he thought he had gotten away with it,"" Baytieh told the Orange County Register, ""and now he's going to prison for the rest of his life.""

"Actress best known for her role as D.J. Tanner on the hit Nineties series Full House . In her new book, she talks about the reality of being a Hollywood mom with no nanny or personal assistant . Candace Cameron Bure has announced that she would welcome a Full House reunion. 'Everyone talks about it and we’ve all talked about it. But who knows? … . It’d be really fun,' the actress,who is best known for her role as D.J. Tanner on the hit Nineties sitcom, told ABC News. 'I’ve always said I’d be up for it if . it happens.' Scroll Down for Video . Candace Cameron Bure, who stars in the new Christmas film Let It Snow alongside Alan Thick, admits that juggling family life and Hollywood is not as glamorous as people are sometimes led to believe . Fans have been frantically speculating about a reunion since the actress posted photos of herself with some of her former co-stars at the Starlight Awards in L.A. in September. Most recently, she starred in the Christmas film Let It Snow alongside Alan Thicke. In her new book Balancing It All: My Story of Juggling Priorities and Purpose, Mrs Cameron Bure discusses how she has balanced her acting career with her three children - and never had a nanny or personal assistant. 'People think I’m this great mom and . doing it all so perfectly,' the 37-year-old told MailOnline. 'And while I'm appreciative, they’re not . 100per cent truthful. I don’t want people to think I’m this perfect women who . has it all together, because I don’t.' She admits that juggling family life and Hollywood is not as glamorous as people are sometimes led to believe, adding that it is 'important that we're all honest with each other.' All in the family: Mrs Cameron Bure is pictured here with several of her Full House co-stars . Mrs Cameron Bure, 37, is a mother to Natasha age 14, Lev age 12 and Maksim age ten . 'No one does it perfect . 100per cent of the time,' she said. Mrs Cameron Bure, who has been married for 15 years to hockey pro Val Bure and took a self-imposed hiatus from television and film to devote time to her family when her first child was born, admits that her husband's help is imperative to being able to 'balance it all'. In her first book, Mrs Bure wrote candidly about battling bulimia when she was in her early 20s. 'I chose to be a stay at . home mom when the kids were little,' she said. 'I stopped working so I could be at home . with them; and I was fortunate that I . didn't have to go to work. 'Honestly our lives are even busier as our kids are now . now pre-teens and teens, but we still manage, between my husband and I, because no matter what our priority is family.' The actress is best known for her role as D.J. Tanner on the hit Nineties sitcom Full House which she starred in from ages ten (left) to 18 . She added that Mr Bure, who retired from hockey in 2005, is 'incredibly hands on' with their children Natasha age 14, Lev age 12 and Maksim age ten. 'I could not do it myself and balance . without my husband's help,' she confessed. 'He does so much with the kids. When I'm out of . town he does everything and vice versa. 'Realistically, if I didn’t have him, I probably would . have hired a nanny by now!' she said. While . Balancing It All is a compilation of Mrs Cameron Bure's best tips and . tricks for juggling her career, family, and herself, she says there is . no set formula for 'balancing your life well'. The actress and author is set to release her second book in January titled Balancing It All: My Story of Juggling Priorities and Purpose . 'I've realized that every person's life is . unique and everyone's circumstances are different. I think that we, as women, need to stop . comparing ourselves to each other and realize that what may work for . me, might not work for someone else. 'I hope that when we do our own things well in . our own life, we’ll have a sigh of relief that we don’t have to look the . same as some woman on TV -- their balancing will look different from someone else's,' she said, adding that she finds comparison 'dangerous'. 'It leads to disappointment, so I hope people look . at their own life and do what what they can do the best.' The multitasking Make It or Break It star, who was folding laundry and packing for a trip to New York during her interview with MailOnline, said that she simply wanted to share her own story, decisions, and things that helped her along the way. 'We live in a culture where we are so busy, and that pertains to everyone whether you're a working mom, a single mom, or a stay-at-home mom. 'Everyone's plates are just full. So I wanted to be honest with women. And share the things that have worked, and haven't worked in my own balancing act.'","Actress best known for her role as D.J.

"Regina perfectly captures the attitude of many towards Halloween in her famous Mean Girls line . 'Halloween is the one night of the year a girl can dress like a slut and no one can say anything about it!' This line, uttered in the cult film Mean Girls by Regina George, perfectly encapsulates the attitude of many towards Halloween. Originally a pagan festival influenced by Christianity, Halloween's adoption by America saw the mass commercialisation of the day, with things like trick-or-treating and pumpkin carving being invented. But over the last few decades it has become increasingly sexualised - particularly women's costumes. Research has found that 51 per cent of Britons think that Halloween costumes on sale aimed at women are over-sexualised, and, more worryingly, the majority of people (69 per cent) think that children’s Halloween costumes on sale are not age appropriate. Even avoiding specifically 'adult' themed Halloween costumes, a brief look across nearly all retailers shows that most women's costumes involve a short skirt or plunging neckline and are often pushing the boundaries of modesty. However, and perhaps unsurprisingly, 58 per cent of men did not think women’s Halloween costumes were over-sexualised, but two thirds of women felt the opposite. Scroll down for video . Kelly Brook was far from shy in showing off her famous derriere last Halloween . Paris Hilton wore a replica of Miley Cyrus's infamous bear costume that she donned for the Playboy Mansion bash in 2013 (left) and reality star Stephanie Pratt (right) wore a very revealing genie costume the same year . There was a clear age divide of opinions of the current state of Halloween attire, with the majority (76 per cent) of those aged over 55 feeling that the costumes on sale for children were not age appropriate but thirty four percent of 18 to 24 years olds had no problem with the clothing on sale for children. In general, parents are not impressed with children’s Halloween costumes on sale, with 83 per cent finding them to be inappropriate for the age at which they are marketed. A brief look across nearly all retailers shows that most women's costumes involve a short skirt or plunging neckline, similar to the outfits worn by Nicole Sherzinger (left) and Jessica Lowndes (right) last year . Mark Pearson, founder of My Voucher Codes, who commissioned the study, commented on the findings: 'Halloween is meant to be a time where you dress up in scary costumes, not sexy. Our results show that many women feel that the choice available to them is not equal to men’s choices with the main focus of the outfit being sexy rather than scary.' He added: 'We can see that some outfits on sale for children are also inappropriate for the age ranges the clothes fit. Whether they are a scary film character a child should not know about or a rather revealing outfit for a young girl. Obviously many parents feel the same, which is why it is important to push for more family friendly costumes this Halloween.' Parenting blogger Clare from www.emmysmummy.com has been in search of Halloween outfits but tells FEMAIL she has struggled to find an outfit which is scary rather than sexy: . Searching the supermarkets was my first thought however my local one only has children's outfits which forced me online. Now I made the mistake of doing this with Emmy.....I'm not sure if you've searched for 'Women's Halloween dressing up outfits' yet... It's eye opening that's sure. Now try that search and pull up the images instead as I did. Apart from a few exceptions I could see (as could my 4 year old daughter) anything and everything seems to go as a Halloween outfit, and it seems the tighter, shorter and low cut the better. Now I'm no proud and have been to an adults only dressing up party before so have worn these types of outfits in the past; but what about family dressing up parties? Searching through eBay seems to bring up the worst culprits - nearly all of those are boob tubes and only just cover your knickers - not something I would wear in front of children or with children around. They wouldn't be out of place in an Ann Summers catalogue!! Heading to a fancy dress costume website I thought I may find more choice but actually they weren't that much better - if you look in the women's section they too are tight fitting and really short or even the long ones have high splits up the legs and low cut busts to them. One of the better costumes Clare managed to find . This is one of the better costumes I managed to find. Now there isn't actually anything wrong with it at all however I'm not really sure I want my daughter to see me in it either. At the age of 4 she is very impressionable as are all young girls. So why do we need to have only sexy style costumes available to us women? Thankfully when looking for costumes for my daughter I have found them to be very appropriate and I am actually spoilt for choice in her outfits. I think it's actually very cute to see the children all dressed up in their witches outfits with their broomsticks and hats. I just really wish that I was able to join my daughter, however to date I've not found a witches outfit which isn't either short enough to just about cover my knickers and would require me to wear thermal tights (It's October and freezing after all) or leggings to cover my pride, or which requires the tops of my legs to be shaven - I've said before, It's October and freezing!! Why do witches all have to be sexy? I'm sure in the story books they aren't or in the horror movies!","Majority  (69%) think children's Halloween outfits are not age appropriate .

"David Cameron must calm down about the European Union's demand for an extra £1.7billion, his new man in Brussels has warned. Lord Hill, Britain's new European Commissioner, urged the Prime Minister to 'look at the facts' to cool the 'political temperature'. Mr Cameron has warned the EU's  'appalling' behaviour has pushed Britain closer to leaving the EU, accusing bureaucrats of 'thumping' Britain with a bill which must be paid by December 1. Brussels is to offer for Britain to pay the bill in instalments, something rejected by Number 10 today. Lord Hill, Britain's new European Commissioner, urged the Prime Minister to 'look at the facts' to cool the 'political temperature' over the row about the shock £1.7billion bill . Britain is locked in intense negotiations with the European Commission about the demand for an extra £1,7billion, which caught Mr Cameron off guard at a summit last month. The European Commission used rules dating back to 1995 and found Britain's economy has grown faster than expected, so must pay a greater share to Brussels. To add insult to injury, France will receive a £790million rebate because its economy is struggling. Bizarrely, Germany is also in line for a rebate while countries like Greece and Italy must pay more. Mr Cameron angrily insisted he will not bow to the demands, declaring: 'I am not paying that bill on December 1. If people think I am, they have got another thing coming. It is not going to happen.' But today Lord Hill, who was appointed by Mr Cameron in the summer, issued a plea for calm and insisted it was time to look for a 'practical' solution. He added that the question over Britain's membership of the EU is at a 'lively stage' and is a 'boil that needs to be lanced. Lord Hill, the EU commissioner for financial services, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'It seems to me that this is one of those classic examples you get from time to time where something that a group of people think are technical matters suddenly, and in this case for perfectly understandable reasons, become highly political. 'The sensible thing now is to try to calm the situation down, and to look at the facts, and to look at a practical solution to the challenges that various member states face.' He added: 'These things happen... the political temperature goes up and then it goes down again.' Lord Hill said his job means he is required to act in the interests of all 28 member states, not just Britain. Britain faces by far the biggest surcharge and has been seeking allies among other EU states for a rethink of the contributions. Chancellor George Osborne will use a meeting in Brussels tomorrow to call for a rethink, but is likely to face stiff resistance from states which gain, including France, which is in line for a billion euro (£788.7 million) rebate, and Germany, which stands to receive 779 million euro (£614 million). One idea which has emerged is that officials in Brussels will allow Britain to pay the money in installments, without running up interest. But Mr Cameron's offical spokesman said: 'The right thing is to keep doing what we have been doing, which is to make very clearly our views around the unacceptability of the scale of the bill and to get on with the work we are doing with the European Commission and other EU finance ministers.' Britain has been told to pay £1.7billion by December 1, on top of the £8billion-a-year it already pays. France, Germany and Denmark are among those told they will get money back from Brussels . Lord Hill said Brussels needs to do a 'smaller number of bigger things better' instead of 'intruding' into areas of national life. He told the programme: 'My view is that on the back of a reform process Britain would want to choose to stay in the EU. 'Obviously that's a choice for the people of Britain, there's democratic process to go through if we have that referendum. But I think it is good to address that question, I think there is a boil that needs to be lanced.' He added: 'We have a tendency in Britain to think of all these issues as though they only affect Britain, British exceptionalism, if I can call it that. 'The fact is, when I sit here and look across the EU and what's happening in other countries, many other countries have very similar debates.' Prime Minister David Cameron has refused to pay the £1.7billion bill by December 1, accusing the EU of 'appalling' behaviour . Jean-Claude Juncker, the new Commission President, this week hit out the Prime Minister’s behaviour. Mr Juncker criticised the leaders of Britain and Italy for making critical comments about the EU after both countries were landed with huge cash demands. Matteo Renzi, the Italian premier, was also highly critical of EU civil servants after the meeting. Speaking in the European Parliament yesterday, Mr Juncker said: 'I didn't like the way several prime ministers were behaving after the European Council. 'For a long period of time I've taken notes and I was always comparing what is said in the room and what is said outside the room. And from time to time it happens that the notes are not coinciding.' Mr Cameron tried to block Mr Juncker, a former Luxembourg PM and arch-federalist, from taking the senior EU post. Mr Juncker described the way Mr Cameron was presenting the EU cash demand issue as 'not correct'. 'They are presented in a totally different way in parts of British public opinion,' Mr Juncker said, pointing out that the rules of the EU should be better respected. Mr Renzi had complained that the EU was overtly bureaucratic. At one point he warned that he would make public the cost of EU 'palaces' in a row over Italy's budget projections. Mr Juncker responded: 'I have to tell my good friend Matteo Renzi that I am not the chairman of a gang of bureaucrats... I am the president of the European Commission which is a political body.' David Cameron last night rejected an EU ‘pay-as-you-go’ compromise over Britain’s bill for £1.7billion. At a dinner in Helsinki, he warned his northern European counterparts that the budget demand was pushing Britain towards the exit door. It emerged last night that senior officials in Brussels are suggesting Britain could be allowed to pay its bill – calculated after the UK’s economy was uprated – in chunks over the next year, rather than in full on December 1. Interest payments of more than £40million a month would also be waived. Last night, the Prime Minister argued the row was a ‘prime example of where the EU needs to respond to voters’ concerns’. Mr Cameron said the £1.7billion demand had triggered a 10 per cent poll swing to leaving the EU ahead of his proposed referendum on membership should he win next year’s election.","Britain's new European Commissioner tries to cool 'political temperature'

"The emotional anguish felt by a female former Wallabies staffer after she was accidentally sent a crude text message about her by star player Kurtley Beale can be revealed. Di Patston quit her role as the Australian rugby team's business manager on Friday after weeks of controversy following a mid-air row with Beale last month. Now, the full text message exchange which sparked that bust-up and her leaving her post - and Beale being stood down indefinitely - has come out. In the messages, reported in The Daily Telegraph, Ms Patston tells of the hurt she feels at being the subject of the texts and asked Beale why she has been targeted. 'What did I do to you? I have barely known you a day. I can't stop crying I am so humiliated by this,' Ms Patston texted to Beale, according to The Daily Telegraph. 'Don't you think my job is hard enough with this?' Scroll down for video . Di Patson, left, was copied into a message sent by Kurtley Beale in June and has become subject of an ARU investigation . Wallabies coach Ewan McKenzie has defended his relationship with Ms Patston, with whom he  worked at the Queensland Reds . Beale replied four minutes later, apologising for the message, telling Ms Patston she has done nothing wrong and that he does 'stupid things for no reason'. Ms Patston fires back that she wants the player to leave him alone. The emotional string of texts were exchanged in June while the team were in a Brisbane hotel before the first Test against France. The contents of Beale's offensive text messages about Ms Patston were revealed earlier this week, when a letter from the Australian Rugby Union to Beale was leaked. The letter, reportedly sent on Wednesday, referenced two messages containing photographs of 'extremely obese women', one with the message 'Di - who wants a go f***ing this?' The Sunday Telegraph reports. Kurtley Beale (left) allegedly sent the offensive text messages  in June. A susbsequent row between Beale and Ms Patston led to McKenzie (right) driving the then team business manager to the airport so she could leave the tour early . Ms Patston contacted Beale after she received the images, telling him, 'I can't stop crying.' 'I have earned this job and I am proud of being a female at this level,' she wrote. 'If I complain then I make it hard for women in rugby and it puts the reputation of the entire squad at stake. 'Do you realise the situation I am in? Just leave me alone please.' After a further apology from Beale, Ms Patston asked whether he was sorry for sending the message - or for being caught. Around two hours after their  exchange began, Ms Patston and Beale met to discuss the matter in a hotel room with three Wallabies players present. Ms Patston forgave Beale, promising to keep the offending texts secret - but swore she would only keep her silence if no other incidents occurred. After they met, she messaged him to assure him the ARU would not find out about the texts. 'I wanted you to look me in the eyes and realise I am a person - a mum, wife and daughter... and how they would feel seeing what you sent me,' Ms Patston wrote to Beale after their meeting. 'I'll never know who you sent them to or why, but everybody deserves a chance.' 'You were clearly upset and showed remorse which I am for (sic).' PATSTON (1:08pm) 'I am sitting here in the team room doing my job and I can't stop crying. What did I do to you? You have barely known me a day. I can't stop crying I am so humiliated by this. Don't you think my job is hard enough without this? This is how the only female staff member is treated? I am so embarrassed by this I am leaving for my room I can't stop crying thanks a lot.' BEALE (1.12pm) 'We all see how hard you work for us. I just do stupid things for no reason... I hate that I have done this to you & I am so sorry di.' PATSTON (1.15pm) 'Just leave me alone this is not ok. Do you realise the situation you've put me in? I have earned this job and I am proud of being a female and this level. If I complain then I make it hard for women in Rugby and it puts the reputation of the entire squad at stake.' After Kurtley Beale and Di Patston met in a Brisbane hotel room . PATSTON (3.44pm) 'Glad we got the chance to catch up and talk it through. I wanted you to look me in the eyes and realise I am a person - a mum, wife and daughter (all those things we discussed) and how they would feel seeing what you sent me. I'll never know who you sent them to or why; but everyone deserves a chance. You were clearly upset and showed remorse which I am for (sic).' BEALE (3.48pm) 'I can't believe you're not going to tell Ewen or the ARU this means so much to me & I have learned my lesson I promise you. You have been evry kind to me di and I'll never do anything like this again. Seeing you so upset hurt me I couldn't deal with it. You have my respect & deserve better you do so much & work so hard. Wish I could take it back. Thankyou di.' Edited transcripts of text messages . The rugby star promised the then-business manager he would 'never do anything like this again.' 'I can't believe you're not going to Ewen or the ARU this means so much to me,' he replied. 'I have learned my lesson I promise you.' 'Seeing you so upset hurt me I couldn't deal with it. You have my respect & deserve so much more.' However, Beale broke that promise when he verbally abused Patston on a flight from South Africa to South America last month, leading to Ms Patston's resignation due to stress. The team was flying to Mendoza after their 28-10 loss to the Springboks in Cape Town. Beale is believed to have made a sarcastic comment to Ms Patston when she asked him to change into an item of Wallabies team gear, which sparked a heated exchange. The Integrity Unit announced an investigation into the matter and Beale was not selected to play against Argentina the following Saturday, which resulted in a 21-17 loss. After Beale's second offence, Ms Patston is understood to have notified Ewen McKenzie and ARU officials about the offending texts Beale had sent four months earlier. Beale's playing future is in doubt, as he prepares to face two separate code of conduct hearings. The first hearing will take place early this week, to exclusively address the text messages. It's expected the matter will result in the termination of Beale's Wallaby contract, which is due to expire at the end of the year. Wallabies captain Michael Hooper came out in Beale's defence on Sunday, saying the 25-year-old does not deserve to be sacked. 'I hope KB stays in rugby union and Australian Rugby Union,' said Hooper. 'We are backing Kurtley.I enjoy having him around the team and he is quality on the field.' Beale, 25, was also reportedly involved in a verbal altercation with Ms Patston while travelling with the team before the side's loss to Argentina .","Text message exchange can be revealed between the former Wallabies business manager and Kurtley Beale in June .

"Smoking should be outlawed in public parks, the chief medical officer said last night. Sally Davies claimed a ban was needed to stop children being set a bad example. Campaigners immediately denounced the idea as an attack on personal liberties. They said it could be the start of a slippery slope leading to a total ban – even in homes. Scroll down for video . Slippery slope? Chief medical officer Sally Davies (pictured) has suggested smoking should be banned in parks . The plans are in a report commissioned by Boris Johnson and written by Lord Darzi, a surgeon and former Labour minister. The peer calls for Mr Johnson to use his powers as mayor to ensure 20,000 acres of parks in London go smoke-free. The ban would even extend to Trafalgar Square and possibly nationwide because Lord Darzi said it would be a blueprint for the whole of England. Dame Sally said it was dangerous for children to see adults smoking in parks because they might decide to copy them. ‘We all know smoking is bad for health,’ she said. ‘So I welcome any measures to reduce both active smoking and its role-modelling in front of children.’ But Stephanie Lis, of the Institute for Economic Affairs, said: ‘This is an outrageous attack on personal freedom – a slippery slope on the path to banning smoking altogether. Park: People lighting up in public encourages children, the report said (picture posed by model) ‘Politicians must avoid this heavy-handed interference in the lives of ordinary people.’ And Simon Clark, of the smokers’ group Forest, said: ‘A ban on smoking in open air parks would be outrageous. 'There’s no health risk to anyone other than the smoker. If you don’t like the smell, walk away. ‘The next thing will be a ban on smoking in our own gardens in case a whiff of smoke travels over the fence. ‘The anti-smoking bandwagon is becoming farcical. It’s sad to see the Mayor of London encouraging such nonsense.’ Mr Johnson said the proposal should spark public debate. ‘One of the glories of London is that we are generally pretty laissez-faire about how people live their lives – provided they do not break the law and provided they do no harm to others,’ he said. ‘If we were to consider a ban on smoking in parks, we would need pretty clear evidence that this would have direct health benefits – in other words, that it would actually save lives. It is time for London to have that debate.’ The Government’s public health quango backed the idea of smoke-free parks. Rosanna O’Connor, who heads the alcohol, drugs and tobacco division of Public Health England, said: ‘Parks and outdoor spaces should be healthy environments for people of all ages. Smoke-free outdoor spaces will help de-normalise smoking in our society by reducing the number of smoking role models for children.’ Professor Robert West, director of tobacco studies at University College London, said: ‘I would expect it to save lives by reducing reminders of smoking in those who are trying to quit and providing more incentive to stop. ‘I hope most smokers would see this as a positive step.’ Optimistic: The report for Boris Johnson aims to turn London into a healthier capital (picture posed by models) 2002 - Ban on all tobacco advertising and sponsorship . 2007 - Smoking ban in public places such as bars and restaurants in England . 2008 - Introduction of graphic images on cigarette packets . 2011 - Ban on tobacco vending machines . 2013 - Ban on display of cigarettes in shops starts to be rolled out . 2014 - Parliament votes to ban the smoking of cigarettes in cars when children are present . The future - Government is considering mandatory plain cigarette packages . Lord Darzi’s report, called Better Health for London, calls for a range of measures to improve the health of people in the capital – leading to a ‘healthier, slimmer, fitter city’. It called for mandatory traffic-light labelling on restaurant menus, public transport discounts for those who walk for a substantial part of their journey to work and restrictions on junk food outlets near schools. Councils with a particular alcohol problem should also use their licensing powers to introduce a minimum unit price of 50p. This final recommendation would be seen as a challenge from the London Mayor to David Cameron. The Government has so far declined to introduce minimum pricing. Lord Darzi said Mr Johnson should use his powers over Trafalgar Square and Parliament Square to ensure they go smoke free. He should also use his influence over the Royal Parks, the board of which he appoints. This would take in Hyde Park, Richmond Park, St James’s Park, Green Park, Regent’s Park, Kensington Gardens and Greenwich Park. Town halls would be encouraged to do the same in the parks they control. It is hoped cities and towns up and down the country would follow suit. ‘The ideas and proposals in this report have been developed for London,’ said Lord Darzi. ‘Yet they could just as easily apply to other big cities in the UK. 'Hundreds of children take up smoking every week – two classrooms-full a day in London. Once they start they continue, since cigarettes are more powerfully addictive than narcotics. 'We know smoking is bad for health,' said Dame Sally, 'So I welcome any measures to reduce role modelling' ‘It’s little surprise that in places where more adults smoke, more children begin smoking too. London should lead the way for Britain, and the Mayor should lead the way for London by acting to make our public spaces smoke free.’ Asked how smoke-free parks would be policed, Lord Darzi said 98 per cent of people abided by the ban on smoking in pubs and restaurants which was introduced in July 2007. ‘I don’t see the necessity of having wardens walking around the parks,’ he said. ‘The evidence will suggest that our nation does abide with the laws. We just need very clear signs.’ The plan was welcomed by Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City, where smoking is already banned in all parks. He said: ‘London’s plan will help prevent children from picking up the habit, discourage adults from smoking, and improve the health of children and families. ‘I look forward to visiting London’s smoke-free parks and squares, and I’m certain that millions of others will as well.’ Deborah Arnott, of the anti-smoking charity ASH, said: ‘London needs to do more to tackle smoking, which is the major cause of preventable premature death in the capital.’ A source close to Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said he was not considering extending smoking bans to public parks, though London and local authorities could act independently to implement their own measures. Lord Darzi is a cancer surgeon at St Mary’s Hospital in Paddington.","Chief medical officer Dame Sally Davies suggests ban in new report .

"Mail ordering a bride is an ever growing business where desperate divorcees shell out thousands to fulfill their dreams of having an 'ideal' wife. For the women in countries like Ukraine who sign up to meet a western man, it's an opportunity to escape from poverty in their homeland. But the trade off is a marrying a man likely to be much older than they are - and in some cases, who wants a live-in maid more than a wife. Scroll down for video . Big business: Jodie Marsh investigates mail order brides in her latest documentary for TLC . Regrets: The former glamour model admits her own marriage for a TV show was a big mistake . It's this 'quite sad and desperate' situation that Jodie Marsh investigates for her latest documentary for TLC. The former glamour model is no stranger to unconventional marriage. She once tied the knot with a stranger for a TV show, something she now bitterly regrets. She said: 'My big day was a big disaster. My experience of marriage is horrendous and a joke. I got married as part of a TV show, it is my most embarrassing moment of my whole life.' So for the 35-year-old to be left feeling sad and baffled by the mail order bride business shows just how seedy it can be. Via the documentary, Jodie meets men from America and the UK so desperate to find love, they are willing to pay to travel to the other side of the world and take a chance on a woman they barely know. She joins a coach trip organised by one international dating agency who charge men almost £3,000 a time to travel to Ukraine. Once there, they spend a week on organised speed dating events where they hope to meet the woman of their dreams. Disillusioned with American women: Divorcees Randy, 60, left, and Jerry, 53, are both seeking wives abroad . Not seeking a bread winner: Andrew, 44, from Wales said he wants a wife who 'doesn't want to be a man' and believes he has more chance of this in Ukraine where the women have more traditional values . Many of the men are divorcees desperate for another chance at love and disillusioned with western women. They are seeking women like those in Ukraine who have more traditional values about a women's place in the home. They include financial adviser divorcee Randy, 60, from Florida, who tells Jodie: 'I think America is evolving for the worst. It's almost like a woman doesn't need a man anymore.' Jerry, 53, from Virginia, another divorcee, agrees. He explains: 'I've not had any issues meeting women but I've had a tough time meeting the right woman. The women in Ukraine are totally different to American women. They are more attentive and appreciative, they are not competitive with men.' Andrew, 44, a civil servant from Wales, tells Jodie he feels the same about women in the UK. He said: 'You don't want a woman who wants to be a man - who wants to be the big bread winner and drive a fast car.' Not a sightseeing coach trip: The men aboard have paid nearly £3,000 each to take the journey to Odessa organised by an international dating agency who introduces them to Ukrainian women . Not all the men Jodie meets on the coach trip are ageing Lotharios. One of the hopefuls is 26-year-old Eldon, a pharmacist from Kansas. He's a virgin who thinks American women aren't attractive. He said: 'The women in America don't dress up or do their hair, they just wear sweatpants. It's disappointing they are not tying to attract any male attention at all.' Those on the trip Jodie joins are wooed by the story of the dating agency's founders. They are American Mark Davis and his Ukrainian wife Anna who have been married for years after meeting through an international dating agency. They have a happy relationship despite a 25 year age gap and now help other people follow in their footsteps. Mark said: 'Everyone wants what we have. I tell men they have to have face to face introductions because you can't download a wife.' Anna said they organise their week-long trips with dating events so the men are not 'buying a wife' but 'trying to win a woman's heart'. Found love: Mark and Anna Davis met through an international dating agency and now help other couples do the same thing (for a price) Anna reveals to Jodie what life was like before she married Mark and moved to America - she used to have to shower outside in the snow and earned £62 a month . Another success story: Wayne Denton, 57, from the West Midlands, met his wife, Luliia, 32, in Ukraine . It's not difficult for them to find attractive, young women to sign up for their speed dating nights - which are conducted with the help of translators. Anna tells Jodie that for many young women in the Ukraine, the future is bleak and they are lucky if they can earn $100 (£62) a month. Her mother tells Jodie that she was delighted her daughter was given a new life in American thanks to meeting Mark through an international dating agency. She said: 'I was very happy when she left. There is nothing good for young people in Ukraine. There are no good guys, just drug addicts and alcoholics. I'm glad she met Mark. It's better than if she stayed here.' It's this dream of a new life that inspires many of the girls to marry a man decades their senior. It's estimated that 15,000 women a year are entering the U.S. thanks to international dating agencies. As with Mark and Anna, it worked out for Brit Wayne Denton, 57, from the West Midlands, who met his wife, Luliia, 32, in Ukraine. Despite spending £10-12,000 on dating agencies and travel in order to have a relationship with her, he says he doesn't feel like he bought her because they fell in love and have been happily married for four years. Hoped for a fairytale ending: Katarina from Russia thought she would live happily ever after in America after she became Frank's mail order bride . Nightmare: But Katarina, pictured today, told Jodie she became Frank's slave and punch bug . Jodie concludes that their relationship 'may have started as an online transaction but it has turned into something real and wonderful.' But not everyone she meets has lived happily ever after as a result of a being a mail order bride. Katarina moved to Atlanta from Russia after meeting her ex-husband Frank through an international dating agency. Once they were married, she said he became 'cold and distant' and treated her like a slave. She said: 'I stayed in the house and cooked and cleaned for him and that was it.' Things then got even worse when he became abusive. 'He hit me and I felt from that point it wasn't going to get better. I wanted to go back to Russia,' Katarina told Jodie. But when she told Frank she was leaving, he cut his own arm with a knife and then rang the police to accuse his wife of attacking him. The charges against her were eventually dropped and she got a restraining order preventing Frank from going near her. When he broke this and approached her armed with a gun, he was shot dead by the police. While traumatised by his violent killing, Katarina is also relieved, believing if he had lived, he would only have gone on to buy another wife and make her life hell.

"The cyclist whose collision with a CBS executive's wife ultimately led to her death is believed to have top ratings on a fitness app which allows users to race each other. Jason Marshall, 31, who hit 59-year-old Jill Tarlov while she was walking through Central Park last Thursday, is said to be an avid user of Strava, a service which allows riders to challenge one another and share their locations via GPS. It has a ranking system where cyclists can record their times over 2.5million different routes in a bid to become KOM - or King Of The Mountain - or complete various 'achievements'. Scroll down for video . Jason Marshal, 31, is alleged to have been an avid user of Strava, the mobile phone app that allows cyclists to race against each other by recording times over certain distances . Victim: Jill Tarlov, pictured, suffered severe head injuries during the crash last Friday and died in hospital on Monday. Marshall has said the collision was an 'unavoidable accident' A screenshot of the Strava profile reportedly belonging to Jason Marshall shows that he completed four 'achievements' on the app the day of the fatal collision . The app uses GPS so cyclists can keep track of their speed and record times over certain stretches of road . According to New York Magazine's Daily Intelligencer, Marshall had completed four  'achievements' - where he beat his own personal best - in New York city on the day he collided with Mrs Tarlov last week. She died in hospital on Monday. They included being the second-fastest over three stretches of road, and third fastest over another. He is also alleged to have hit speeds of 28.9mph on West Drive earlier that day - the area where the crash took place which has a speed limit of 25mph. Robert Wright, a Financial Times reporter who blogs about cycling at Invisible Man, said of the crash: 'To judge by accounts of Jason Marshall's keen pursuit of records on Strava … his overall, incautious determination to maintain his speed may have been far more culpable than anything specific about his reaction on encountering people crossing the road.' There have been two lawsuits associated with the app in the San Francisco Bay Area - where it was created. In 2010, William Flint reportedly flipped his bike while trying to take the top spot in the app. His family tried to sue the makers of Strava, claiming they had created a 'wild, wild West culture where [law-breaking] is encouraged and rewarded' - but the suit was overturned. In 2013, another rider was convicted of manslaughter for riding through a red light and mowing down a 71-year-old pedestrian because he 'was  way too committed to stop.' He'd been using the app during the ride, and there was speculation he was trying to set a personal record at the time. This case however was also not proven. A spokesman from Strava told Mail Online: 'Last week’s accident in Central Park is a tragedy and we offer our sincere condolences to all involved. 'We believe everyone is responsible for their own safety and the safety of those around them while riding and running. We encourage good behavior within our community through the guideposts described at Strava, and ask our members to use good judgement and understand the responsibility that they have to act within the limits of the law.' Hours after Mrs Tarlov's death, jazz-saxophonist Marshall said in a statement that he was 'utterly devastated' about the crash, calling the incident 'an unavoidable accident.' He then added: 'I am deeply, deeply saddened about the accidental collision that I had with Ms. Jill Tarlov last week and her subsequent passing.' Gathering evidence: NYPD investigators canvas the scene of the crash in Central Park . Legal rep: Thought not charged with any crime yet, Marshall (above) released his statement today through his lawyer . Some cyclists who have ridden alongside Marshall s told the Daily Intelligencer he is 'energetic' and 'enthusiastic' but is a relative newcomer. One, without revealing their name, added that at that time of day he should have been riding on a more deserted stretch of road. Miss Tarlov of Fairfield Connecticut, was in New York City on Thursday to buy her daughter a gift, when she was hit by  Marshall while walking through Central Park. The mother of two was rushed to New York Presbyterian hospital where she was put on life support. On Monday, her husband, CBS executive Mike Wittman, released a statement confirming that she had passed away. 'My wife was beautiful in every way imaginable,' Mr Wittman wrote. 'Jill was the most amazing mother to Matthew and Anna, who taught them above all that kindness, compassion, and a spirit for life were the right morals to live by. Everyone who had ever met her was somehow made better by her company. 'Even though she has been taken from us far too soon, her spirit will live on forever. On behalf of our family, I would like to thank everyone for their thoughts and prayers, and request privacy during the difficult times ahead,' Mr Wittman said. It's unclear whether her family took her off life support. Collision course: Witnesses described how the cyclist riding an expensive high-performance bike allegedly made no attempt to stop in the moments before the crash . Tarlov also used to work at CBS, and the company issued a statement following her death, saying they would work to help prevent similar tragedies in the future. 'We are heartsick over the passing of our dear friend and former 1010 WINS Radio colleague Jill Tarlov,' Anton Guitano, chief operating officer of CBS Local Media and Peter Dunn, presiden tof CBS television, said in a joint statement. 'As we mourn the loss of our friend and console Mike and his family, we are committed to doing what we can to bring greater public awareness of the perils of unsafe and distracted driving by motorists and cyclists that endangers pedestrians. Far too many people have been killed or seriously injured on our streets,' the statement read. Cyclist Marshall has so far, not been charged in the deadly collision. Police say the Harlem saxophonist was riding in the park's bike lane when he swerved to avoid other pedestrians and hit Tarlov. Phillip Fenton, 21, who allegedly witnessed the accident, told the New York Post: 'It didn't look like he tried to stop.' Another witness, Tom Longman, told the newspaper 'The right side of [Tarlov's] face looked really bad. There was blood all over her.' Marshall remained at the scene and suffered minor injuries. According to the New York Daily News, an online training log shows that Marshall had logged speeds above the 25 miles per hour limit. Cyclists are also supposed to slow down at crosswalks and yield to pedestrian, the Parks Department website says.","Jason Marshall crashed into Jill Tarlov while riding through Central Park .

"The customized Captain America chopper Peter Fonda rode in Easy Rider is up for auction this weekend in Calabasas, CA. Or is it? Gordon Granger of Texas says he bought the original Easy Rider motorcycle in 1996 from Dan Haggerty, an actor with a bit part in the 1960s counterculture classic. Both that red, white and blue bike and the one headed for auction Saturday have certificates of authenticity signed by Haggerty. But the actor acknowledged to the Los Angeles Times this week that he has authenticated and sold two Captain America bikes. Which one's a phony? Collector Michael Eisenberg (pictured September 4) insists that his customized Captain America chopper is the same one Peter Fonda rode in Easy Rider, but collector Gordon Granger insists that he owns the original motorbike . Actor Peter Fonda is reluctant to take sides as he says he doesn't have enough expertise to make a judgement between the bikes . Now Haggerty says just one of the bikes is legitimate, and it's Michael Eisenberg's — the one going up for sale Saturday with a $1 million minimum. For his part, Fonda says he has no idea which bike is the real one. 'There's a big rat stinking someplace in this,' said the 74-year-old actor, who co-wrote Easy Rider. He hopes the weekend sale by auction house Profiles in History is called off. Auctioneer Brian Chanes holds a photo of Peter Fonda on the iconic Harley, which Fonda helped design himself . Actor Dan Haggerty, atop the bike, with Michael Eisenberg, says he rebuilt the Harley after its crash in the final scenes of 'Easy Rider' Eisenberg, a Los Angeles real estate agent and collector of Hollywood memorabilia, bought his chopper earlier this year from John Parham, a Midwestern motorcycle parts magnate who had purchased the bike from Haggerty 12 years earlier. Eisenberg insists his bike is the real one, because Haggerty says it is. Fonda signed one Harley's gas tank before he knew that there was as controversy over authenticity . Haggerty did not deny that he signed Granger's authenticating documents but now says he signed something that simply was not true . 'Dan Haggerty is the only guy who knows,' Eisenberg said. Haggerty did not deny that he signed Granger's authenticating documents. He now says he signed something that simply was not true. 'That was my mistake,' Haggerty said. 'It's not the real bike.' 'There's a big rat stinking someplace in this': Even the 74-year-old Oscar nominee, who wrote and starred in the 1960s classic, hopes that Profiles in History cancels the auction . Granger, furious at the prospect of this weekend's auction, insists he owns the genuine article. 'They know damn well they don't have the real bike,' Granger said. 'I own the original remaining Captain America bike. The one to be auctioned is a replica.' The chopper features a forward-angled front wheel and handlebars, fishtail exhaust pipes and a teardrop-shaped gas tank where the movie's protagonists stashed their cash. It was designed with input from Fonda who insisted on it being decorated with the American flag. Easy Rider was a 1969 road film about two drug-using, long-haired bikers, Wyatt (Fonda) and Billy (Dennis Hopper), who go on a cross-country odyssey to New Orleans in search of personal freedom and easy money. Four motorcycles were created for the movie, but only one is known to have survived. It was used in the climactic crash scene in which Fonda is thrown off the bike. Fonda sketched the original design but doesn't want to take a side. 'I'm no expert, and I can't tell you which one is real,' he said. 'I know there are two bikes out there that are both authenticated by Haggerty. That's not right.' However he did authenticate the bike up for auction after a brief examination and even signed its gas tank. He says that until a few years ago when he learned to the other possible Captain America motorcycle he had no reason to doubt Haggerty's word. Now he regrets endorsing the bike. 'It's embarrassing, and infuriating,' he said. He hopes the weekend auction is cancelled.","Gordon Granger of Texas says he bought the original Easy Rider motorcycle in 1996 from Dan Haggerty, an actor with a bit part in the 1960s counterculture classic .

"A furious Labour frontbencher has dismissed David Cameron as a ‘low rent PR man’ after being personally singled out by the Prime Minister for abuse at the Tory conference last week. Shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt accused the Prime Minister of demeaning his office with the ‘boorish’ attack on his background. In his set-piece conference speech on Wednesday, the PM ridiculed Mr Hunt for going to an exclusive private school but wanting to ‘restrict’ other children from having the same advantages. The Labour shadow minster said it was a ‘highly personalised attack on me, my family and upbringing’ and claimed it was reminiscent of the ‘boorishness’ of Jeremy Clarkson. Privately-educated historian Tristram Hunt accused David Cameron of being a 'low rent PR man' Mr Hunt, elected in 2010 but already tipped as a future party leader, was educated at the private University College School in north London before studying history at Trinity College, Cambridge. In his conference address on Wednesday, Mr Cameron said: ‘Tristram Hunt, their shadow education secretary, like me, had one of the best educations money can buy. ‘But guess what? He won't allow it for your children. He went to an independent school that wasn't set up by a local authority … but no, he doesn't want charities and parents to set up schools for your children.' Mr Cameron added: ‘He had the benefit of world-class teachers who happened not to have a government certificate … but no, he wants to stop people like that from teaching your children. ‘I tell you – Tristram Hunt and I might both have been educated at some of the best schools in our country. But here's the difference: you, Tristram – like the rest of the Labour party – want to restrict those advantages. I want to spread them to every child in Britain.’ Mr Hunt said the Prime Minister’s ‘assault’ was triggered in a refusal among the Tories ‘to believe that anybody called Tristram could or should be a member of the Labour party’. He said: 'To be accused by David Cameron in his party conference speech of “hypocrisy” was rich indeed. 'But his highly personalised attack on me, my family and upbringing spoke volumes about the man himself – and his inability, following those revelations about the Queen “purring” down the phone to invest the office of prime minister with the dignity it deserves.' He added: 'Cameron has moved on little since his time as a low-rent PR man.' The Prime Minister said Mr Hunt had enjoyed 'one of the best educations money can buy' but did not want other children to enjoy such privilege . Mr Hunt saidBut Labour politicians regularly taunt Mr Cameron over his ‘out of touch’ background – with remarks about his education at Eton and membership of the Bullingdon Club at Oxford. Mr Cameron’s attack is reminiscent of the Tory leader Michael Howard's Commons put down of Tony Blair in 2004 when he said: ‘This grammar school boy is not going to take any lessons from that public schoolboy.’","Tristram Hunt accuses the Prime Minister of demeaning his office .

"An ice epidemic is sweeping through Australia and destroying regional towns as children as young as 11 become hooked on the deadly drug from their first hit. A Four Corners investigation has revealed there are now almost 350,000 Australians taking cheap, easily accessible and highly addictive crystal methamphetamine, nicknamed ice, which destroys the brain and creates psychotic behaviour such as users gauging away at their skin as they imagine feeling insects crawling beneath it. The ABC’s current affairs show has met with ice users, ice cooks, police and recovering addicts in Victoria and Tasmania, who painted a disturbing picture: international drug cartels are working with local bikie gangs to push ice out of the cities, and police are losing the battle to stop it. ‘These addicts have the battle scars, there was a man who has ripped out all of his teeth with pliers, people pick away at their teeth, gums and skin,’ reporter Caro Meldrum-Hanna told Daily Mail Australia. Scroll down for video . Aaron, 19, who started using ice at 15, told Four Corners he would smoke ice all weekend, steal to feed his addiction and stay awake for days. He became so paranoid he couldn't look in the mirror . The ravaged physical appearance of those consumed by the drug shocked Caro and so did the age of the people she encountered. She said ‘sitting down with a young crystal meth cook’ who tried ice at 13 and was cooking by 15 horrified her the most. ‘He was cooking without any protection, no suits – this isn’t Breaking Bad… at just 19-years-old his body was falling apart already, his joints pop out of place, he is riddled with early onset arthritis, he’s vomiting blood, paralysed by muscles aches. ‘His brain has suddenly changed, he is very sick and probably won’t live very long,’ Caro explained. She discovered that ‘young and desperate’ kids from broken homes, often lonely and with great responsibilities to provide for their families, were being targeted by outlaw motorcycle gangs to do their dirty work - dealing and cooking ice for other bored teenagers in country towns. One woman's ice addiction led her to start rummaging through bins every day . In 2006, The Ice Age program showed Lenore 'scattering' after using ice. She was obsessed with rubbish . Caro explained that the people who agreed to open up on camera - such as 17-year-old Ethan who left school after an older man injected him with ice and joined a crystal meth pack of fellow young addicts, stealing from people  to feed their addiction - did so because they want to show people the dangers. They want to show that it’s not just junkies who are involved, it's young people with promising futures who are ruining their lives with the drug. ‘Park that judgement and put that aside… we are spending time with young people who started using when they were 15 and 13, older men putting needles in their arms… their’s are tales of absolute self-destruction.’ Teenage user Ethan said of his desperation to get more ice: ‘Mum locked the door on me and I remember thinking... if I get in there I will hurt her for money. I will get money out of her one way or another.’ Children as young as 11 are using ice and being signed up as dealers by bikie gangs . This photo shows the huge amount of the drugs seized by NSW Police in just one ice bust this year . NSW Police found a huge factory producing ice and cops have stressed it's a 'very very big issue for Australia in 2014' When people take ice the dopamine levels in the brain shoot up from 100 units to over 1000, something that's about 12 times as much of a release of dopamine as you get from naturally pleasurable activities such as food and sex. ‘Over sustained use your brain stops producing naturally so you really became no longer a human being,’ Caro reasoned. Reporter Caro Meldrum-Hanna visited regional towns across Australia and was shocked by what she found . One disturbing example of an ice addict who lost his human side, was a man Caro met who almost beat an undercover police officer to death. ‘He lost all empathy… while he was beating him he thought it was funny and ironic because the police officer was squealing and he thought it was a pig,’ Caro said. In 2006, the ABC's The Ice Age program also showed the the psychosis some users suffer. They showed Lenore, an ice-addicted mother who had become obsessed with rubbish, rummaging through bins and Matty who had just come out of jail. This time, in the small regional towns that ice has infiltrated Four Corners was confronted by a desperate lack of treatment facilities for those trying to get clean and under resourced or non-existent police. ‘The country needs and deserves better,’ Caro said as she explained the solution to the epidemic is education about the drug and more treatment facilities. Highlighting the difficulties people currently face when trying to get clean, Caro said: ‘I met a woman named Kim in Tasmania. For her to get into rehab, which is a sixth month program to reboot the brain to start producing dopamine again, she would lose her housing commission house and become homeless.’ In one community of less than 4,000 people Four Corners found up to one in ten people are using ice. A clinical nurse in regional Australia explained: ‘The demographic for ice is changing all the time. We’re noticing the age actually dropping, there’s been reports of 10 year olds presenting at the Emergency Department here.’ Some of the young people Caro met told her that their friends had died before getting a spot in rehab. But the stigma around the drug has been diminished. ‘It’s thought of as common as having a joint and you are the weird kid if you are not on it… we spoke to kids in the very small country towns of a few thousand people who said they could get three difference ounces up the hill on their bikes,’ Caro said. On Monday, the show Ice Rush: Four Corners will illustrate how the drug is being made in homes in Australia . Lenore spoke about how she her teenage kids no longer lived with her. She went straight for about a year but suffered a relapse back into ice . Matty was just out of jail when he appeared on TV to speak about his ice addiction in 2006. He said he sees people and the trees speak to him during his hallucinations . Unlike other drugs, ice does not have to be imported - it's being cooked up in homes and even in the back of vans in Australia. In August, NSW Police Commission Andrew Scipione spoke about a syndicate police had smashed and the 'very very big issue for Australia in 2014'. 'It's tearing apart the fabric of our community, its destroying families, you've only got to look at those before and after photographs to release this changes its not like humpty dumpty you can't put them back together again, they are forever damaged.' In Victoria last month, where places like Mildura are gripped with ice addiction, the state government announced more than 980 regional sporting clubs will be given financial help to tackle ice through education programs. ‘The expansion of the good Spots program in regional and rural Victoria will enable football and netball clubs to lead the discussion about the dangers of methamphetamine use,’ Minister for Mental Health Mary Wooldridge said. The Australian Drug Foundation has been given $200,000 to run the program. Watch the program ICE RUSH: FOUR CORNERS on Monday 20 October, 8.30pm on ABC.

"Uber drivers around the globe unhappy with some of the company's practices are planning protests in cities including San Francisco and London - but in New York drivers plan to go on strike. The multi-city protest which has been organized by a newly formed nonprofit group called the California App-Based Drivers Association will take place outside of the company's offices. Last month, Uber drivers in New York protested over what they claimed are unfair working conditions and poor fares. Uber drivers aren't employed by the company, but instead work on a freelance basis and are summoned by users as needed. Drivers gathered outside Uber's offices in Queens, New York last month to protest what they say are low fairs and poor treatment by the company . 'We're hoping we can coordinate a mass demonstration, potentially around the globe on so that we can get the message across that these policies are not just affecting drivers in Los Angeles, but anywhere Uber operates,' Joseph De Wolf Sandoval, an Uber driver and the president of CADA, told Business Insider. In New York drivers are planning to shut off their phones - effectively disallowing potential Uber customers from hailing them. The drivers are unhappy with a number of issues that they hope to draw attention to by staging the strike, namely Uber's reduced fares, the company's tipping policy, the five-star rating system, and driver safety. 'It's not just a small group of disgruntled or unprofessional drivers, as Uber would like to cast us,' De Wolf Sandoval said. 'It's a nationwide feeling of general unhappiness and unease with policies and programs.' The trouble began in July when Uber reduced its UberX fares making Uber cheaper than getting around town in a taxi. It was supposed to be a promotion but in September Uber decided to keep the cheaper fares running indefinitely. Uber recently dropped the amount that drivers were being payed for each fare by 20percent in an effort to compete New York City yellow taxis . The company argued that drivers would end up making more because of increased demand as a result of the cheaper fares. Drivers say that the reality couldn't be more different and claim that they are now losing money as a result of the change. Some have suggested that a 20% cut in fares mean drivers need to work 20% harder to make the same amount of pay. There is also unrest among drivers at the company's tipping policy. Uber charges an all-inclusive price and drivers are told not to accept tips from customers. The Uber app does not even allow for customers to leave tips even if they wanted to. Last December, a federal judge ruled that Uber drivers could sue the company for deceptive marketing that told customers that Uber fares already included a tip, . Uber's fares are calculated based on distance and time along with any surcharges or tolls. Customers are also confused about the tipping system. Drivers says they would also like some openness when it comes to Uber's rating system which allows both riders and drivers to rate one another. Drivers  appreciate that customers can very easily write comments about their experience to give valuable feedback to drivers but the rating system is also dreaded by drivers because of how easy it is to fall below the 'acceptable' rating. If drivers  fall below 4.7 (out of 5) on the rating system it can affect the number of trips they pick up. Should they fall below a 4.4, they can be permanently deactivated. Ideas being put forward include a suggestion Uber create an cash incentive for drivers that provide excellent service handing out commission-based rewards if rides are of a certain standard. The grievances held by drivers is  something of a grey area as they are not truly independent contractors nor employees of the company, but by holding the strike in New York and protests in other cities drivers are hoping that at the very least Uber will sit up and take notice as the company continues to expand its global reach.","Drivers are unhappy that a '20percent reduced promotional fare' introduced in July is now running indefinitely .
Drivers say they want options that allow customers to tip and for the Uber rating system to be fairer ."
"She stripped naked at the end of September during the AFL Grand Final - now Heather McCartney is set to release some of her racy photographs for every month of the year. The 26-year-old caused a controversy when she took off her clothes and danced in front of thousands of supporters at the Melbourne Cricket Ground as Hawthorn were beating the Sydney Swans. But the Scottish model, who lives on the Gold Coast, has been keeping herself busy while working on a cancer charity calendar for 2015, which is set to be released in November. 'It's close to home and everyone knows someone that has had cancer,' she told Daily Mail Australia. The model who stripped naked at an AFL Grand Final is set to make an appearance every month of the year . McCartney, who is also an ambassador for Cancer Research, said all proceeds will split between two charities -  Cancer Research and the Leukaemia Foundation. The former Playboy model was arrested last month after receiving complaints when she danced naked in full view of strangers as police arrived to arrest her. But it was reported that she lashed out, kicking, punching and biting the officers as they tried to handcuff her and she was jailed overnight. McCartney, who has over 250,000 fans on Facebook, was a last-minute guest with a friend in the corporate box at the Grand Final.

The 26-year-old has been working on a cancer charity calendar, which is set to release in November . Shortly after the final siren, she took off her dress and performed a naked display of celebration, which she now admits was a big mistake after she woke up on the floor of a police cell. 'I just pretty much went up to the window, turned around, walked away and put it back on,' she said. 'People around me were in absolute shock.' McCartney told Daily Mail Australia that she wanted to 'clear the air' that she was never fined $300 or convicted for police assault after her raunchy antics at the Grand Final. The Scottish model has been doing promotional work at sporting events, including the V8s motorsports . The stripper turned model also added that the AFL incident has given her a few extra modelling opportunities in the industry. 'Had talks with my agency about doing promotional work, sports events, V8s, horse racing and promotions,' she said. 'Still modelling bikini's for 'Wild Orchard' - had a bit of work with them for a couple of years. 'Few more shoots as a model and I have a big shoot coming up for FHM.' McCartney, who blamed the free alcohol bar for her raunchy antics that shocked fans following Hawthorne's big win, says now things have started to finally calm down and get back to normal .

"Fans of the Hobbit trilogy blockbusters were left outraged this week after being told some of the films' most beloved characters would not be attending the world premiere. New Zealand actor John Callen, who plays the dwarf named Oin in the popular series, took to Facebook on Friday to inform fans that he and his fellow local actors would not be attending the London premiere of the third movie on December 1. 'Just had the word that Warner Brothers won't be taking the Kiwi dwarves of the Hobbit to the London premier because of 'budget' considerations,' Callen wrote. 'Sorry to all...' At least four online petitions have been launched by Hobbit trilogy fans, protesting against announcements that the New Zealand dwarf actors will not be attending the world premiere of the third installment . John Callen, who plays the dwarf named Oin, was the first to inform his fans over Facebook . The news was met with outrage by hundreds of fans who slammed Warner Bros. for the decision, that would mean seven of the thirteen dwarves - Jed Brophy (Nori), John Callen (Oin), Mark Hadlow (Dori), Peter Hambleton (Glóin), Stephen Hunter (Bombur), William Kircher (Bifur), and Dean O'Gorman (Fili) - would not attend the premiere. 'This is ridiculous. And disappointing. And simply not fair. You are such an important - no, THE MOST IMPORTANT part of these movies. You, the dwarves, the company. And this is the WORLD premiere of the LAST middle earth movie. The end of an era. This makes me so angry!!' Ulrike Pröschild wrote. 'Shame on WB! The Company of Thorin Oakenshield must follow him one last time. We want all the Dwarves for the World Premiere in London. The excuse is insulting and ridicolous. They will have to face a very angry fandom,' Cristina Salvini responded. The news was met with outrage by hundreds of fans who slammed Warner Bros. for the decision that would mean seven of the thirteen dwarves would not attend the premiere . It has since been anounced the NZ dwarves will be flown to Los Angeles' premiere while the European dwarves will attend London's premiere . At least four online petitions have since been launched by fans from across the world, one of which was set up in the form of a Facebook page and has received over 700 likes since Callen's original post two days ago. Further outrage ensued due to Warner Brothers funding a six-day trip around New Zealand for 150 global competition winners, alongside Air New Zealand and Tourism New Zealand . Matt Dravitski from Wingnut Films has since told the New Zealand Herald that the New Zealand dwarves would be flown to the film's premiere in Los Angeles while the actors who play the European dwarves would attend the London premiere. Further outrage ensued due to Warner Brothers funding a six-day trip around New Zealand for 150 global competition winners, alongside Air New Zealand and Tourism New Zealand . The announcement did little to quell fans' fury however, with many simply dubbing the Los Angeles premiere as 'an inadequate substitute' for the world premiere, with petitions only slightly changing their wording to specify the location of their demands. Directed by Sir Peter Jackson, The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies will be released on December 11. The first two movies in the trilogy, The Hobitt: An Unexpected Journey and The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug, earned over $1 billion and $958 million respectively.","New Zealand actor John Callen, who plays Oin, told fans that he and his fellow New Zealand actors would not be attending the London premiere .

"The British Navy has seen significant changes over the past 200 years, since Admiral Horatio Lord Nelson sailed HMS Victory to glory in the Battle of Trafalgar. And to celebrate 2014 being the 209th anniversary of Trafalgar Day - when Admiral Nelson hoisted the flag in conquest - BAE Systems has revealed just how far naval engineering has evolved. Using laser imaging techniques, experts have been able to get under the skin of HMS Victory - the oldest commissioned warship in the world - allowing them to draw direct comparisons between the vessel, and Type 45 Destroyer HMS Defender. Scroll down for video . The 249-year-old HMS Victory's £50 million conservation program has seen experts from BAE Systems using both advanced laser diagrams and traditional crafting techniques - that would have been the same hundreds of years ago when she was originally built - to identify damage to the vessel (pictured) Type 45 destroyers are the most recent and advanced class of ships built by the navy. They replaced the previous Type 42 models. Type 45s are also known as D, or Daring-class, are were primarily designed for anti-aircraft and anti-missile warfare. HMS Defender is one of the newest commissioned ships in the Royal Navy fleet, recently deployed to the Gulf as part of the international coalition against ISIL. Teams of shipbuilders and engineers have been able to examine and compare aspects of both vessels, to look at how things have evolved on the seas, and below decks. BAE Systems is working on both the completed construction and maintenance of Type 45 vessels, and also the ongoing conservation of HMS Victory. Using laser imaging techniques, naval engineers have been able to get under the skin of HMS Victory (pictured) - the oldest commissioned warship in the world - allowing them to draw direct comparisons between the vessel and Type 45 Destroyer HMS Defender . BAE Systems is working on both the completed construction and maintenance of Type 45 vessels, including HMS Defender (pictured) and also the ongoing conservation of HMS Victory. While at sea, HMS Victory would have displaced 3,500 tonnes, making it twice as light as HMS Defender that displaces 8,000 tonnes . The 249-year-old ship's £50 million conservation program has seen experts from BAE Systems using both advanced laser diagrams and traditional crafting techniques - that would have been the same hundreds of years ago when she was originally built - to identify damage to the vessel and help restore it for another decade. Whilst out at sea, Admiral Nelson's flagship would have displaced 3,500 tonnes in the water, making it twice as light as HMS Defender which displaces 8,000 tonnes of seawater by comparison. Despite this, HMS Defender would be the more agile of the two in battle, using its twin WR21 Gas Turbine engines - each capable of lighting the city of Leicester - to hit a top speed of 30 knots (55 km/h). This is compared to the eight to nine knots (15 km/h) top speed offered by the 37 sails on the wooden masts of HMS Victory. This graphic shows how the two vessels compare in terms of length, crew size, cost and armament . The researchers used a Leica HDS6000 scanner capable of measuring at a density of 1mm. They could then use these high-resolution scans to create detailed images for detailed surface modelling. Areas of the ship can be enhanced, rotated, labelled and annotated using specialist software . At 227ft (69 metres) in length, HMS Victory is half the size of the 500ft (152 metre) Type 45, and comprised of eight decks as opposed to HMS Defender's 13 levels. Despite this vast difference in size however, HMS Victory had a crew of 850 seamen, while HMS Defender's crew only numbers less than a quarter of that, with 190 crew members on board. James Davis, Naval Base Services Director at BAE Systems said: ‘Being able to use innovative technology to compare these two iconic warships has been fascinating. ‘The new research provides an unprecedented level of insight into the power of HMS Victory, and life on board. Part of the 3D fly-through revealed every nook and cranny of the historic ship. This scan was taken from on top bowsprit of the HMS Victory. The bowsprit extends 110ft from the ship's head . At 227ft (69 metres) in length, HMS Victory (left) is half the size of the 500ft (152 metre) Type 45, and is comprised of eight decks as opposed to HMS Defender's (right) 13 levels. Despite this vast difference in size, HMS Victory had a crew of 850 seamen, while HMS Defender's crew consists of 190 members . ‘By comparing the findings of the research with the Type 45 vessels, we can see that over the passage of more than two centuries, British naval engineering continues to go from strength to strength.’ Philip Nash, Commanding Officer of HMS Defender, added: ‘Type 45 is the world's most advanced warship, just as HMS Victory was in its time. ‘It is thanks to new research techniques that we are able to look back and marvel at the power of the British naval forces when HMS Victory was in service, and also see just how British naval engineering has evolved - promising a bright future for our Royal Navy.’ HMS Victory has 37 sails flown from three masts and would carry 23 spares during battle (illustrated) HMS Victory was launched in 1765 at a cost of £67,000 in modern-day figures - the equivalent to building an aircraft carrier. She was built from 6,000 trees, 90 per cent of which were oak - the equivalent of 100 acres of woodlands. The HMS Victory has 37 sails flown from three masts and it would carry 23 spare sails during battle. The total sail area is 6,510 square yards. The Bowsprit protrudes 110ft (33 metres) from the ship's head. The Fore mast is 182ft (55 metres) above the waterline, the Main mast extends 250ft (76 metres), the Mizzen mast is 152ft (46 metres) and the Main yard is 102ft tall (31 metres). A total of 26 miles of cords were used to rig the ship and this was used with 768 blocks, made from elm or ash, were used for the rigging. A further 628 blocks were used for the guns. Many other blocks were carried for the ground tackle, the ship's boats, storing and spares. Her top speed is eight to nine knots (15 km/h). HMS Victory first saw battle in 1778 under Admiral Augustus Keppel in the first Battle of Ushant and again two years later in the second Battle of Ushant. She was also called into action in the Battle of Cape St Vincent in 1797, but she will always be best known for her pivotal role in the 1805 Battle of Trafalgar under Admiral Lord Nelson. The battle was a decisive victory for the British but Nelson was fatally wounded. She continues to be flagship of the Second Sea Lord and is the oldest naval ship still in commission - this means if she was needed the Navy could sail her into battle. This 3D scan shows the Victory's famous stern. The lines seen on the gallery and along the port and starboard of the ship were based on the design of the HMS Royal George - launched the same year as the Victory, in 1765 .","2014 marks the 209th anniversary of Admiral Lord Nelson's Trafalgar Day .

"Imprisoned killer Joran Van der Sloot is now a father after his wife of three months gave birth to a baby girl. The child was born on Sunday in Lima, Peru - far from the remote prison where van der Sloot is serving a 28-year sentence for killing a Peruvian business student in 2010, his attorney Maximo Altez said. The child was named Dushy after Van der Sloot's grandmother. Van der Sloot also remains the chief suspect in the 2005 disappearance of U.S. teenager Natalee Holloway in Aruba. Scroll down for video . Killer Joran Van der Sloot is a father after his wife gave birth to a baby girl on Sunday. In 2010, he confessed to killing Stephany Flores, a 21-year-old business student. The murderer was the last person seen with U.S. student Natalee Holloway, who vanished while on a  trip to Aruba. No charges were filed against Van der Sloot and the case remains unsolved . Van der Sloot married 24-year-old Leidy Figueroa (pictured last week) in July. She gave birth to his daughter on Sunday, whom she named Dushy after Van der Sloot's grandmother . Van der Sloot married 25-year-old Peruvian trainee accountant Leidy Figueroa in July. A month later, authorities sent him to a prison high in the Andes, saying he had threatened to kill the warden of the lockup near Lima. Van der Sloot  was transferred to the feared Challapalca prison just over a month ago. In interviews exclusively with MailOnline last week, Figueroa spoke for the first time to insist that Van der Sloot is 'gentle, sensitive, kind' and 'no monster', despite being a convicted murderer and the main suspect in the disappearance of American student Miss Holloway in 2005. Ms Figueroa insisted her husband has changed since they started an unlikely prison romance four years ago. She declared: 'My Joran is no monster'. Stephany Flores Ramirez, 21, (left) who was found murdered at the Miraflores Hotel Tac in Lima, Peru, in April 2010. Joran Van der Sloot, the 23-year-old Dutch playboy twice arrested in the mysterious disappearance of American teenager Natalee Holloway in 2005 (right), confessed to the murder . She said the 6ft 5in killer is a 'different man' after finding God and says he 'seeks forgiveness' for the evil he has committed. And in a series of astonishing prison love letters seen by MailOnline, Van der Sloot's passionate feelings for his 5ft 3in wife were laid bare. Ms Figueroa also said that her husband is close to breaking point after becoming deeply depressed by his new living conditions which he describes as 'worse than Guantanamo Bay'. The prison's conditions are in stark contrast to those under which Van der Sloot fell in love with Leidy in an unlikely prison romance four years ago. The couple were even allowed to marry behind bars earlier this summer. Lax prison rules also meant he was able to play online poker, use a cellphone, take drugs and have other women come and go as he pleased. And he enjoyed teaching English to other inmates and doing arts and crafts, making ceramic sculptures for his wife. Van der Sloot was transferred to Challapalca after he threatened to kill the warden of the Piedras Gordas penitentiary in Lima. He was found with an illegal cellphone which was confiscated, officials of the Inpe prisons administration said. Van der Sloot even recorded a video in which he showed the conditions in his cell, later saying that it was warden Sergio Haro who provided him with the cellphone. 'The warden himself gave it to me. I don't know why, but I suspect that it was to set a trap for me,' said Van der Sloot in a portion of the video. According to Leidy, Warden Haro was furious and told her husband he had never liked him. Van der Sloot was immediately thrown in the 'Hole' – solitary confinement – for six days. Joran van der Sloot's wife wife Leidy Figueroa poses for a portrait with some of the ceramic sculptures Joran made for her inside prison - she gave birth to the couple's daughter, Dushy, on Sunday . Van der Sloot, pictured in 2010, as he is transferred from the police headquarters to the prosecutor's office in Lima. Sloot admitted he killed 21-year-old Stephany Flores, whose body was found in a Lima hotel room . Leidy said: 'When he came out of the Hole the warden told Joran that he won't see his baby daughter when she's born. Joran didn't believe him but the warden is true to his word.' However she is confident that one day she and Van der Sloot will be together properly. 'Somehow one day he’s going to leave prison and we can be a family,' she said. Van der Sloot is expected to remain in prison until 2038 and then be extradited to the United States to face charges of extortion and fraud for allegedly falsely promising to lead Natalee Holloway's mother to the girl's body in exchange for $25,000 payment. The murderer was the last person seen with Holloway, who vanished while on a high school graduation trip to Aruba. No charges were filed against Van der Sloot and the case remains unsolved. In 2010, he confessed to killing Stephany Flores, a 21-year-old business student, five years to the day after Holloway's disappearance.

Police Chief Barry Rikard said he had also received conflicting reports about whether or not the officer's siren was on, but they hope the car's dashboard will show whether they were activated. There are no surveillance cameras at the intersection - or in the whole town of Bartlett - but police said local businesses might have caught the crash on their security cameras, WREG reported.

"The race for the New Hampshire Senate seat is too close to call after shock polls suggested that the Republican candidate - former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown  - has a one-point lead. The virtual tie raises the prospect that he could pull off a surprise win tomorrow in his race against sitting New Hampshire Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen. Pollsters for New Hampshire television stations NH1 and WMUR discovered that Republican Brown is neck and neck with Democrat Shaheen, and either candidate could claim victory in tomorrow's election. 'This one is way too close to call. Things that happen over the next couple days could certainly make the difference,' WMUR's poll-taker, Andy Smith of the University of New Hampshire survey center, said. In a last-minute push to turn her supporters out to the ballot box, Shaheen brought in presumed 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton to give her campaign a boost on Sunday. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, right,  joins New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen  at a reelection campaign rally on Sunday. Republican Scott Brown is now running even with Shaheen, a new poll shows . Clinton and Shaheen are pictured here rallying voters with New Hampshire Gov. Maggie Hassan, left, at Nashua Community College. The former first lady was called in to help push Shaheen over the top on Election Day . Clinton, who had not campaigned in the state since she ran for president in 2008, reportedly drew a crowd of 700 people and packed the gymnasium of Nashua Community College. There she gave her now familiar midterm stump speech, in which she invoked her granddaughter Charlotte Clinton Mezvinsky and encouraged the audience to back the reelection efforts of the top Democrats on the ballot in New Hampshire tomorrow if they want their children and grandchildren to have the opportunity to live out the American Dream. Republicans, on the other hand, she said, are 'trying to instill fear. They’re staking everything on it.' 'Fear is the last resort of those who have run out of ideas and run out of hope,' Clinton added, according to the Boston Globe, noting that New Hampshire Gov. Maggie Hassan and Shaheen are 'fearless.' Touting her support for female-friendly policies, Clinton again claimed that 'women’s rights, here at home and around the world, are like the canary in the mine'. 'You start taking away, you start limiting women’s rights, who’s next?' she asked. The New Hampshire Republican Party pushed back on Clinton's speech on Sunday and attempted to tie both her and Shaheen to the Democratic Party's beleaguered leader, President Barack Obama. The women 'share one thing in common — they have both supported Obama’s failed leadership', New Hampshire Republican State Committee Chairwoman Jennifer Horn said in a statement after the event. She similarly told the Boston Herald that Obama’s policies 'have failed, and they have failed with particular pain here in New Hampshire'. Especially when it comes to the effects of Obamacare, which has cost 20,000 New Hampshire residents their healthcare, and the economy, which is 'sluggish at best' in the Granite State, she elaborated. Former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown, who is now the Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate in New Hampshire, is pictured here at his campaign headquarters in Manchester on Friday . Brown rallied volunteers at his campaign headquarters by doing push ups. A poll released today shows Brown leading Shaheen by a single digit, while another survey that came out this morning has Shaheen two points ahead of him . Horn also disputed reports that the Clinton spoke before a packed house. If just 700 people attended the event, that 'must have been disappointing,' she told the Herald, because the Democratic Party 'booked a space that could hold at least twice as many.' 'Certainly I think that everybody in the community is surprised at the turnout, and it doesn’t seem to have created quite the energy that maybe they had hoped for,' she continued. 'I would suggest that having Hillary Clinton there is the next best thing to having Barack Obama there. She’s spent the past six years supporting his policies, executing his policies, and she is a voice for the policies of Barack Obama.' A key attack on Shaheen this election cycle has been her backing of Obama while serving in the Senate. The Democratic lawmaker has voted with the president 99 percent of the time, Brown and the state Republicans have said. A fact-checking website recently rated Brown's claim as mostly true, noting that over her career, Shaheen has voted for the president's preferred legislation just 98 percent of the time - that number only jumps to 99 percent when looking at recent years. Republican candidates for office also rallied their supporters on Sunday night. 'There’s 48 hours left. Do not wake up on Nov. 5 wishing you had done more,' Brown said, per WMUR, at a GOP event featuring former New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu and New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte. Though the campaign event did not attract a major surrogate like Clinton, notable Republicans such as New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a likely 2016 presidential candidate, have come to Brown's aid in recent week, as well. Polls show that anything could happen in tomorrow's battle between Brown and Shaheen, with NH1 finding Brown up by a single digit in its weekend survey and WMUR claiming Shaheen has the edge. Just a month ago Shaheen lead Brown by as much as 10 points. Her lead has since eroded in rapid fashion. 'This race is a complete toss-up,' Wayne Lesperance, a professor of political science at New England College, told NH1. The WMUR survey may not be as on the nose as NH1's, however, as it was taken over a longer stretch of time and began before the state's final Senate debate. Still, Republicans could find themselves on the losing side if the female duo of Hassan and Shaheen are able to fire up women in the state with the help of Clinton. Women favor Shaheen over Brown by nearly seven points, NH1's poll found. Meanwhile, Brown has a significant lead among men -nine percent. 'This thing is going to go late into the night,' WMUR's pollster Smith predicted.","New polls show Republican Scott Brown neck and neck with Democrat Jeanne Shaheen; either could claim victory tomorrow .

Because of the facility's security it is believed to be one of the busiest stores in the world, according to The Washington Post. Many cannot leave during the working day to simply grab a cappuccino or a muffin, which means the queues often stretch down the hallway. One agent, who was annoyed at the time it takes to get a beverage, is said to have once whispered to someone at the back of the line: 'What have you done for your country today.' A food services supervisor, who wanted to create a more relaxed atmosphere, tried to get customers to start writing their names on cups. But the change in policy quickly made the agents feel uncomfortable. He said: 'They could use the alias ""Polly-O string cheese"" for all I care. But giving any name at all was making people — you know, the undercover agents — feel very uncomfortable. It just didn't work for this location.' It also has to be staffed 24 hours a day for agents working in different time zones or in the middle of an operation. According to employees, this means that sugary Frappuccinos and double espressos are popular orders at night, while vanilla latte and lemon pound cake are frequently ordered during the day. But, when they get home, they cannot boast where they work only saying it is in a 'federal building'. There are no reward cards as agents fear the data could fall into the wrong hands and undermine their security - or even identify them. Hidden identity: When customers order their drinks, their names are not written on the cups. A food supervisor considered the idea to speed up lines, but it quickly made agents feel 'uncomfortable' Like many others around the globe, the shop is the site of many job interviews. 'Coffee goes well with those conversations,' one officer said. For example, the chief of the team that tracked down Osama Bin Laden recruited a key deputy for the effort at the Starbucks. The manager of the store is reportedly trying to humanize the store, creating a more relaxed environment for those who work there. Many of the federal employees sit in windowless offices for long periods of time and cannot even check their phones during a break - they have to leave them in their car for security.","Cafe is deep inside the agency's Langley, Virginia, forest compound .

"She's long been a fan of sailing, famously beating husband Prince William during a race around Auckland Harbour during the Royal Tour Down Under. Now Kensington Palace has announced that the Duchess of Cambridge has become royal patron of a new sailing charity, The 1851 Trust, which aims to help bring the America's Cup home. In a statement released by the palace, the Duchess spoke of her love of sailing and said she hoped the trust would inspire a new generation to take up the sport. Scroll down for video . Fan: The Duchess of Cambridge, pictured here during a visit to Auckland, has long been a fan of sailing . Kate, who has not been seen in public since August due to severe morning sickness, said: 'I am delighted to be royal patron of The 1851 Trust. “I feel very fortunate to have enjoyed sailing from a young age and I know it is a great way of providing young people with the opportunity to develop skills and confidence. 'It is a hugely exciting time for sailing as the British challenger bids to bring the America’s Cup back to Britain. 'I am looking forward to being part of this journey and I hope that through The 1851 Trust we can engage and inspire a new generation into sailing along the way.' The 1851 Trust is the charitable arm of the British challenger’s bid to bring the America’s Cup back to Britain and is supported by Ben Ainslie Racing. Eyes on the prize: With Sir Ben Ainslie, she helped launch Britain's bid for America's Cup glory . Leading the charge: Sir Ben Ainslie - and team mate Matt Cornwell (left) - is spearheading the bid for victory . It will work with young people under 25 years old to encourage them to become involved in sailing and the marine industry. Known affectionately as the 'Auld Mug', the America's Cup was first offered as a prize by Queen Victoria in 1851, who volunteered to present it to the winner of a sailing race around the Isle of Wight. After a schooner named America from New York took the trophy, which was made especially for the race by jewellers Garrard, the cup was renamed in its honour, and both cup and race have carried the moniker ever since. A two-yacht race, the America's Cup is fought between the previous year's winner - known as the 'defender' - and a challenger, which is usually the best boat from a series of run-off rounds. Sailing fan: The Duchess with Sir Ben Ainslie during the launch of Britain's America's Cup bid in June . Victory: The Duchess last showed off her sailing skills when she beat Prince William during a trip to Auckland . The real deal: The race took place in two yachts used for New Zealand's own America's Cup bid . But while Britannia might rule the waves in other respects, a British team is yet to take the trophy which, despite having been won by Swiss and Australian teams in the past, has for the most part been doggedly defended by the Americans - among them last year's winner, San Francisco's Golden Gate Yacht Club - throughout its 132-year history. That, however, is something the Duchess of Cambridge and Sir Ben hope to change, and hope, given enough sponsorship, to assemble a race-winning boat and the sailors to crew it over the next three years. Sir Ben Ainslie, who is also a patron of the 1851 Trust, spoke of his excitement about the challenge ahead and what it could mean for the marine industry. 'We’re really excited about what the Trust can do,' he said. 'We are dependent on the oceans and the marine industry needs to become a leader in environmental stewardship, and in finding solutions. 'Young people are the key, there are great opportunities in the marine industry, and we want to open those opportunities up to as many people as possible – the more talent you have working on a problem, the better the solutions will be.' It might be named for the new world, but the America's Cup has very British origins. First offered by Queen Victoria in 1851, the inaugural America's Cup race was run around the Isle of Wight. After a boat from New York named America triumphed, the cup was renamed and teams from the US have dominated the winner's roll call of honour ever since. However, all that could be about to change if the Duchess of Cambridge and Sur Ben Ainslie get their way. With the 2017 event in their sights, the pair plan to put together and train a winning team and hope to have the cup back in Britain within three years.","The Duchess has become patron of the 1851 Trust, it has been announced .

"Our most ancient ancestors were battling climate change to survive droughts, freezing and flooding. And now a growing number of scientists believe that shifts in the Earth’s climate are responsible for creating some of our most distinctive characteristics. Their research suggests that large evolutionary leaps, such as the development of our bigger brains and ability to create and use complex tools, coincided with periods of volatile climate change. A growing number of scientists believe that shifts in the Earth’s climate are responsible for creating some of human's most distinctive characteristics such as our big brains and ability to develop tools. This conceptual image shows four stages of human evolution: Australopithecus, Home habilis, Homo erectus and Homo sapien . Peter deMenocal, of Columbia University, admitted to Smithsonian that the scientific theory is currently based on ‘coincidence’ but experts are examining ancient teeth and seafloor sediments to support the idea. The data could help scientists unravel just how climate may have sparked dramatic advances in our evolution and seems to support the idea that big leaps were not driven by our adaptation to one environmental change, but to a series of changes as the environment alternated between wet and dry. Rick Potts, of the Smithsonian Institution's Human Origins Programme, said that at least two major evolutionary ‘leaps’ can be linked to climate change. They happened around three million years ago when Australopithecus afarensis  - known as Lucy - became extinct and Homo appeared, with fossils revealing the evolution of a larger brain and the very first tools. The data could help scientists unravel just how climate may have sparked dramatic advances in our evolution and seems to support the idea that big leaps were not driven by our adaptation to one environmental change, but to a series of changes as the environment alternated between wet and dry. A drought is pictured . Dr Maslen of UCL said there are many theories as to why climate change correlates with bursts of human evolution – and any one of them could be correct until more evidence is found. He suggested that humans may have developed larger brains to work out how to feed themselves in times of drought. He also said that conversely, in wet periods when lots of resources were available, females may have been more careful to select the most successful men as partners. John Stewart of Bournemouth University, thinks people moved around the land responding to environmental changes so that populations became isolated and evolved quickly in groups. The other example cited is between two and 1.5 million years ago, when Homo erectus used sophisticated bladed axes, leading to early humans leaving Africa. Dr Potts says that both these events coincide with dramatic shifts in climate when wooded areas turned to grassland as the temperature warmed. He suggests that the change in environment three million years ago led to humans walking upright instead of climbing. Dr deMenocal said samples taken from the sea floor along the coast of Africa show different layers of sediment that are darker in times of drought and light in wet periods. The cores show that every 20,000 years the climate swapped from wet to dry and the effect was very pronounced during the two important periods of early human evolution. Mark Maslin of University College London (UCL) said further evidence can be found in the Great Rift Valley, which runs through Ethiopia, Kenya and Tanzania. By studying the rock record, he found that lake basins were very sensitive to changes in climate approximately 2.7 million and 1.5 million years ago. Three million years ago  Australopithecus afarensis, known as Lucy (a skeleton is pictured left and copy of the skull, right) became extinct and Homo appeared, with fossils revealing the evolution of a larger brain and the very first tools. One expert says the evolutionary leap coincides with 'pulses' in climate change . Dr Maslin said: ‘We found that these particular periods, or “pulses” when the lakes come and go correlate directly with major changes in human evolution. The two records are absolutely compatible.’ Scientists have also looked at our ancestors’ fossilised teeth to understand how their diet changed according with the climate. They found that early humans ate a varied diet, indicating they became flexible to cope with a changing environment. However, the research does not explain why a shifting climate may have triggered evolutionary leaps. Dr Maslin acknowledged any one of many theories could be correct, including the idea that humans had to develop larger brains to work out how to feed themselves in times of drought when nutrients were scarce. He also said that in wet periods when lots of resources were available, females may have been more careful to select the most successful men as partners, leading to smarter and stronger children. John Stewart of Bournemouth University, thinks people moved around the land responding to environmental changes so that populations became isolated and evolved quickly in pockets of the land. Dr Mark Maslin said that rock samples from the Great Rift Valley, which runs through Ethiopia, Kenya and Tanzania indicate that lake basins were very sensitive to changes in climate approximately 2.7 million and 1.5 million years ago, when a burst of human evolution took place. The lakes still disappear in times of drought and fill up with heavy rainfall today. Here, hippos relax in one of the lakes in Kenya .","Research suggests evolutionary leaps such as the the development of human's big brains, coincided with periods of volatile climate change .

"A spa manager received third-degree burns when a scented candle set light to acetone she was using to clean an elderly woman's nails. Julia McKeown, who works at the four-star Dalmeny Hotel in Lytham St Annes, Lancashire, was badly burned on her hands, arms, chest and stomach and had to spend three months in hospital having skin grafts after the accident. Today Blackpool Magistrate's Court heard Mrs McKeown, 38, also suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder. The customer, 96-year-old Mary Heyworth, was unharmed. Julia McKeown (pictured, left) was burned on her hands, arms and chest after a scented candle set light to acetone she was using to clean a customer's fingernails . The accident happened when Mrs McKeown spilled the chemical on herself and the candle. Staff rushed to help her but she suffered third-degree burns and had to have skin grafts . The accident happened in January last year when Mrs McKeown spilled acetone on herself during a spa treatment in the pool area of the hotel. Mrs McKeown was engulfed in flames after the liquid also spilled on to a scented tea light candle which was being used in a decorative lantern. Staff rushed to help her and managed to put out the flames, but Mrs McKeown was already very badly burned. Michael Hayton QC, prosecuting, said: 'Mrs Mc Keown the salon manager was using a pad soaked in acetone from a two and a half litre bottle. 'The bottle spilled and splashed on the beautician’s arms and body and the table.She and her clothing ignited from the naked flame of a tealight type of candle which was lit and placed in a open topped lantern. 'Staff went to her aid but she had to undergo extensive skin grafts some of them full depth. 'The local council investigated and found a a the hotel company failed in its duty to protect its employees.There was no training and no supervision when it came to using what is known to be a significantly hazardous product. 'The investigation showed there had been previous spillages of acetone and the company had been previously warned about health and safety issues.' The accident happened in January last year at the four-star Dalmeny Hotel in Lytham St Annes, Lancashire . Fining Dalmeny Hotel Ltd £16,000 and ordering the company to pay £9,075 in costs, District Judge Joanne Hirst said: 'The woman suffered significant and horrific burns to her body. 'She has suffered a loss of self esteem as a result and her marriage has been affected, as has her social life. 'The hotel failed to heed earlier warnings about health and safety. There had been previous problems with the use of acetone and a systematic failure in safety and risk to staff.' Charles Lavery, defending, said: 'The directors of the hotel deeply regret what happened. They believe the size of the bottle their member of staff purchased was unsuitable to use to take off nail varnish. 'After the incident, caused by failings which conspired together, the company brought in health and safety consultants and has totally addressed any problems.' Mrs McKeown, who has worked at the spa since 2006, is now back at work but has launched a compensation claim against her employers.","Julia McKeown, 38, was using a bottle of acetone to clean a woman's nails .

"Girls Gone Wild creator Joe Francis has become a father for the first time after girlfriend Abbey Wilson gave birth to twins today. In an announcement published on his Instagram feed this afternoon, the couple of two-and-a-half years announced that they had welcomed two girls, named Alexandria Claire and Athena Olivia. It revealed that the babies were born in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico and described the new mom and dad as 'proud first-time parents.' Scroll down for video . New parents: In an announcement published on his Instagram feed this afternoon, Joe Francis announced that he and girlfriend Abbey Wilson had welcomed two girls, named Alexandria Claire and Athena Olivia . Video producer Mr Francis, 41, and Miss Wilson, 26, first revealed that they were to become parents in April. The announcement sparked controversy at the time because the couple told how they conceived via IVF in order that they could choose the gender of their children. Miss Wilson told Us Weekly at the time: 'We both wanted girls and we wanted them to be healthy and free of genetic diseases so we chose to do IVF.' Mr Francis added: 'I believe people will finally understand my love, respect and admiration for women. I love girls.' Almost here! Mr Francis, 41, shared a photo of himself in scrubs at the hospital this morning . The new dad gave a clear sign that the babies' birth was imminent when he shared a photo of himself in hospital scrubs this morning. He captioned the image: 'He we go!!! Babies are coming now! [sic]' Mr Francis, who has long been a hero to teenage boys in spite of his multiple lawsuits and arrests, was introduced to Abbey Wilson when she won Girls Gone Wild's 'Search for the Hottest Girl in America'. The couple boast many famous friends, who they said had been offering plenty of parenting advice. 'Kourtney and Scott were the first in the Kardashian family we told and they have already given us so much amazing advice,' Mr Francis said. Miss Wilson also noted that Mario and Courtney Lopez had taken them baby shopping already. Girl power: Mr Francis and his girlfriend of two-and-a-half years used IVF to pick the sex of their twins . Model example: Mr Francis met Miss Wilson when she won his magazine's 'Search for the Hottest Girl in America' contest in 2012 . Mr Francis' notoriety came with the launch of his company Girls Gone Wild in the late 1990s. Gender selection is not an open practice, particularly for couples having their first children, but some doctors do bend the rules. Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, China and India all have outright bans on genetic selection for non-medical purposes, but the United States does not. In the United States, pre-natal genetic diagnosis tests are available which allows the couple to determine the gender of the embryo before it is implanted. Fertility clinics make their own rules on where they stand in the issue, so certain clinics allow sex selection on any grounds while others dictate that couples need a medical reason- like certain developmental disorders or genetic diseases- as grounds for dictating the sex. An example of a more loose interpretation of the law used by some couples is when they already have several children of the same sex and opt to use IVF to make sure their next child is the opposite sex. His crew would go to debaucherous events like Mardi Gras and Spring Break resorts to make videos of female college students who took their tops off in front of the camera. Business boomed: the company was established formally in 1997 and had profits of more than $20million in their first two years. In their first five years, they had created more than 80 different Girls Gone Wild videos. The films, like 'Girls Gone Wild: Horny Schoolgirls – Orgy Party' and 'Girls Gone Wild: Sex Starved Young & Horny', were available on pay-per-view channels and later through a streaming service on their website. A string of lawsuits and Mr Francis' own personal criminal troubles contributed to the downward spiral of the company, and Girls Gone Wild filed for bankruptcy in February of last year. Mr Francis spent time in jail after pleading no contest to child abuse and prostitution charges in 2008 and spent nearly a year in jail. More recently, he was charged with false imprisonment and assault in 2013 stemming from a night in 2011 in which he grabbed a woman by the neck and slammed her head into the floor of his soon-to-be repossessed home. Mr Francis became violent when he tried to separate one woman from a group of three that went back to his home against their will and they objected. He then tried intimidating the other two into not calling the police. In 2012, Mr Francis was ordered by a judge to pay $19million to casino magnate Steve Wynn in a defamation lawsuit. He was sentenced to 270 days in jail and forced to complete and anger management course. He later said that he was wrongly accused and accepted the plea deal in order to end his time in jail.","In an announcement on Instagram this afternoon, Mr Francis revealed that the babies were named Alexandria Claire and Athena Olivia .

"One man claims that the New York subway is a great place to meet women - in fact, he's talked to roughly 500 while on the train. Brian Robinson, the author of How to Meet Women on the Subway, points out that the NYC transit system is a cost-efficient alternative to bars and restaurants, and offers endless options with its millions of daily commuters. 'Women wouldn't expect to meet nice guys on the subway, so you can have a surprise attack,' the 48-year-old tells MailOnline. Scroll down for video . Love train: Brian Robinson, seen in a promotional image for his new book How to Meet Women on the Subway, says the NYC transit system is a great place to find dates . He spent roughly 14 years using this technique before he eventually met his wife on Match.com and got married last year. Mr Robinson says his go-to icebreaker was asking for directions. He'd add: ‘It sounds like you have an accent. Where are you from?’ 'Since 98per cent of people in New York City are from someplace else, no matter what their answer is, I’d go ""Oh, that’s amazing, I've always wanted to go to Montreal, or Paris,"" or wherever she’s from.’ Icebreaker: Mr Robinson, who used this technique for 14 years, says his go-to move was asking for directions . Screen time: He'd then say his stop was approaching and ask for the woman's email address to keep the conversation going . He would then say, 'Oh, my stop is coming up, I would love to keep talking to you,' and ask for her email address. Icebreaker: Ask a woman for directions, then continue the conversation by asking where she's from and saying you've always wanted to visit. Exit strategy: Ask for her email, then get off the train immediately - don't ask for a date while on the subway. Dress for success: 'You could be flipping burgers at night, but definitely wear a suit and look professional,' he says. Friendly visitors: Seek out tourists, who are often 'looking to meet nice people' and 'in a good mood,' in popular shopping districts. Free ride: Use an unlimited MetroCard to swipe in women when they're fumbling for their own, then pass along your business card and invite them to a party. 'I don’t care if your stop’s not for 30 minutes - you get off immediately. Once you've gotten some interest, then you leave. So you're not asking her out on the subway, because it's just too awkward,' he advises. The Brooklyn resident, who has spent most of his career in advertising sales, says that the key to not seeming creepy is to be genuine. 'If you're polite and you're genuine and you're nice, women will sometimes let the wall come down and they're like ""he’s not so crazy after all."" And before you know it, you've got the email or the phone number and you leave and they haven’t really thought ""Oh, I've just given someone my number on the subway,""' he says. 'When you meet somebody that’s interesting, it doesn't matter if you’re downtown at the court waiting to pay a ticket. You’re going to start engaging with somebody who’s charming.' While he says a few of these encounters turned into six-month-plus relationships, not every attempt went smoothly. 'There was one woman who almost pulled out her Mace when she looked at me. I’m a nice guy and I don’t know what happened, but she got scared and she reached into her purse and all I said was '""Hey, how’s it going?""' he says. Well suited: Mr Robinson says it helps to dress professionally when approaching women . Welcome to New York: Mr Robinson says that tourists are usually 'really friendly' and 'looking to meet nice people' For those who think his book advocates harassment, he wants to clarify that it's meant to be lighthearted and humorous. 'It’s not about sleeping with women, it’s about meeting women,' he adds. Mr Robinson offers plenty of other tips in the self-published book, which was released October 9 - for example, it's important to dress for success. The art of small talk: Mr Robinson says that more men could meet women on the subway if they knew how to strike up a conversation . 'Even if you’re unemployed and living in your mom's basement, a suit gives the perception that you're working, that you're successful, that you've got a job,' he says. Pick-up artist: Mr Robinson imparts his dating expertise in his new book . He also suggests using an unlimited MetroCard to offer women free swipes when they're fumbling for their own. 'As you go up to swipe them, you have your business card in your other pocket and you say, ""I’d love to invite you to a party, or a book-signing. My contact information is on my card."" If you give five of those cards a day, five days a week, that's 25 cards given out a week.' He also advises talking to tourists. 'Women who are tourists here are really friendly, looking to meet nice people. They're relaxed, they’re in a good mood. So go to the shopping districts and you’ll see them pulling out their maps, carrying their Century 21 bags. They're definitely prime targets.' Mr Robinson says that more men could find dates on the train if they knew how to approach women properly and strike up a conversation. 'A lot of men and women have this perception that they're going to be relaxed and open to meeting somebody on a date or on a dating site or restaurant or being introduced by friends. But people meet all the time in the most unfamiliar settings,' he says. 'You can get dates anywhere, but the subway’s a great spot because it’s New York City and everybody has to take it.'

"This is the terrifying moment a motorcyclist veers across a winding country lane and ploughs head-on into a lorry. The biker is seen failing to take a bend properly and drifting into the opposite carriageway as the HGV approaches. The man's motorbike was torn in half by the impact - but miraculously the rider escaped with just a broken shoulder. Scroll down for video . Footage filmed by a lorry's cabin camera shows the bike skid into the path of the truck near Rye, East Sussex . The bike was ripped in half in the incident but the motorcyclist escaped with only a broken shoulder . Police investigated the accident to see if the lorry driver was speeding but decided nobody was to blame . Police launched an investigation amid suspicions the lorry driver could have been guilty of speeding, dangerous driving or poor lane discipline. But the footage, filmed with a  SmartWitness Vehicle Accident Camera mounted on the dashboard of the truck, proved that the driver was not to blame for the 30mph smash in Rye, East Sussex. Mark Chamberlain, managing director of John Jempson & Son who own the lorry, said: 'The driver was travelling safely and within the speed limit on the country lanes near where we are based. 'You can see on the video that he is passed first by a motorcyclist, who turned out to be the female partner of the injured rider. 'The second rider follows very closely behind her. If you slow the video right down you can see that he hits a pothole and veers over the road into the path of our truck after coming out of a corner. 'There is a collision but thankfully the motorcyclist is lucky and he escapes with a broken shoulder.' The footage shows the moment the biker hits the pothole in the middle of the road as he rounds a country bend . Initially following another bike, the rider then loses control and slides across road into the path of the truck . The bike then ploughs into the front of the lorry and a cloud of smoke rises as it is ripped to shreds . The owner of the lorry says he is pleased he was using the camera, which showed his driver was not to blame . Mr Chamberlain added: 'He is already coming off the bike at the point of impact and he ends up falling to the side of our truck. 'Our driver is understandably badly shaken by what has happened and is immediately given a week off work to recover. 'The police quite properly investigate the incident and the first thing they want to see is the footage from Smart Witness.

Bumpy ride: An antenna was broken and a side panel was removed by the vandals . The incident is still being investigated by the Medina Police Department. The Klauses have surveillance cameras installed on the property, and they are hoping the footage they had handed over to the police will help investigators track down the perpetrators. The boxy blue-and-white RV, covered in splotches of rust, was purchased by Mark Klaus and his wife from a Los Angeles movie prop shop a year before the Christmas museum opened its doors in November 2013. The exhibit space features costumes and accessories from nearly every Christmas classic, including Will Farrell's green coat from the 2003 film Elf and a life-size model of Jim Carrey's The Grinch.

"A Chinese elevator engineer was crushed to death when the chair he had wedged in the door to stop the lift from moving was pulled away. Repair man Wu Ming was standing on top of a lift in a block of flats in the city of Fuzhou, south-east China, when the chair was removed by someone who did not want to use the stairs. Mr Ming was killed instantly when the lift moved upwards, crushing his head and torso. Repair man Wu Ming was crushed to death when the chair he had wedged in the door to stop the lift from moving was pulled away . Mr Ming had been called to the 16-storey block of flats to carry out routine maintenance on the elevator. Instead of cutting off the power, he had simply stuck a chair in the door to stop it moving, and then climbed up onto its roof. The police said the person who moved the chair would not face criminal proceedings because they would not have known the fatal consequences when they decided not to take the stairs. A spokesman for the company that employed Mr Ming said: 'We are investigating but it is company policy and part of our training that the power is always cut off while work is being carried out. 'It certainly isn't standard to put a chair in the door in the hope that it will remain there while work is being carried out.' The crush was recorded as an accident at the workplace. Health and safety inspectors are investigating the incident.","Wu Ming was carrying out routine maintenance on a lift in Fuzhou, China .

"Police believe a 78-year-old man shot dead his daughter, 39, and 11-year-old granddaughter in a tragic murder-suicide at their home in Seattle, Washington on Monday. The bodies of grandfather Honorario Yango, his daughter Christine Dela Isla and granddaughter Anahlia Cowherd were found by local police around 8:15pm after the suspected shooter's 10-year-old grandson called 911. While police have not yet released a motive in the murder-suicide, Anahlia's personal blog tells the shocking story of how she was allegedly sexually-abused by her grandfather for years and how he threatened to kill her just hours before her death. Scroll down for video . Seattle police believe Honorario Yano, 78 (left), shot dead his daughter Christine Dela Isla (right), and 11-year-old granddaughter Anahlia Cowherd (center) in a murder-suicide on Monday . Police have not released a motive for the murder. Just hours before her death, Anahlia wrote a blog post about her grandfather allegedly threatening to kill her . In the aftermath of the murder-suicide, Anahlia's distant father Terrell Cowherd discovered a blog his daughter appears to have been writing for months, in which she claimed her grandfather had been molesting her since she was in the third grade. The same day as her murder, Anahlia wrote a frantic post on that same blog saying her grandfather had threatened to kill her. In a post titled 'Help... Me...' Anahlia writes: 'He threatened me... He actually threatened to KILL my family. Right now I'm in my mom's room, the door locked, my dog close, my brother here, my Grandpa somewhere, my Grandma is not home. My mom is coming...I'm so scared.' Above, the scene of the horrific murder-suicide on Monday. In blog posts written in the seven months leading up to the shooting, 11-year-old Anahlia claimed her grandfather was sexually abusing her . Anahlia posted a series of disturbing accounts on Wattpad, a free use website where writers can post their work and members can browse through the content and exchange ideas. The blog had been up for months, but Anahlia wrote her name for the first time on the website hours before she was killed. She posted: 'I’m Anahlia Chandris Cowherd, 11 years old, in 5th grade, and I’m gonna bring justice to all girls who have been touched.' News that her posts have been online for a considerable amount of time has raised questions about how they remained unreported. 'Where is the level of accountability for a social media page to share information. How in the world can anybody, including wattpad, have knowledge of this and NEVER call the police?' one user wrote today under her final post. According to Wattpad, 35 million people have joined their digital community and members currently spend 9 billion minutes a month engaging in the content. Earlier this year a One Direction fan's online fantasy fiction about the boyband which was posted on Wattpad, proved so popular that it has won her a six-figure publishing deal. Anna Todd, a 25-year-old from Texas, decided to try her hand at fan fiction after stumbling upon Wattpad, which has an entire section dedicated to fan fiction. Mr Cowherd, who hasn't seen his daughter since she was six years old, was able to find his Anahlia's Wattpad blog online after simply searching her name. Though her username is anonymous, Anahlia names herself in one piece she wrote more than six months ago, in which she details long-term sexual abuse at the hands of her grandfather. 'When I Googled my daughter's name, the blog popped up,' Mr Cowherd told KIRO. 'The only conclusion I can come to is that she must have actually got to the point where she was about to call police, and I guess that was his way of preventing her from doing so.' In the initial confessional post, Anahlia writes that her grandfather has been touching her since she was about eight or nine years old. She also wrote about finally telling her mom about the abuse, and it appears Ms Dela Isla came to her daughter's defense. 'My mom said the next f****** time he does this she's gonna call the police,' Anahlia wrote at the time. While Anahlia appears triumphant in the post, vowing to 'bring justice to all girls who have been touched', her posts in the following months become more and more helpless. About a month later, Anahlia writes that her grandfather has started molesting her again, and she starts writing about cutting herself and wanting to die. Anahlia's 10-year-old younger brother was the only witness and survivor of the murder-suicide. Yango has no criminal history. He told officers his grandfather had first waved a handgun at his mother and sister before shooting them, and had then turned the gun on himself. Assistant Police Chief Nick Metz said the boy was 'shaken up' but unhurt. He has been placed in the care of his extended family. Seattle's mayor Ed Murray, who also attended the scene on Monday night, said the shooting appeared to be a 'family tragedy'. Anahlia writes that her mother - Christine Dela Isla, pictured - threatened to call the police if her grandfather touched her again. The girl's distant father Terrell Cowherd believes the prospect of being revealed as a pedophile may have led Yango to kill the girls and himself . Lone survivor: Anahlia's unidentified 10-year-old brother (right) was the only survivor. He called 911 after the attack . He added: 'One thing I would say is the neighborhood itself is safe.' Students at Aki Kruose Middle School, where Anahlia was a student, were sent home with a letter from the principal on Tuesday about the incident. 'As a community, I know we will come together to not only support the surviving family members, but work to ensure our larger community is a safe place for us to live, learn and work,' Principal Mia Williams wrote. Assistant Police Chief Nick Metz and Seattle Mayor Ed Murray talk to reporters at the scene . Police said there were only four people in the house at the time, confirming the dead man was the adult woman's father and the teenage girl's grandfather .","Police believe Honorario Yano, 78, killed his daughter Christine Dela Isla, 39 and granddaughter Anahlia Cowherd, 11, before committing suicide .

"A pensioner who manufactured fake detectors which he claimed could locate ivory, bombs and even help find missing Madeleine McCann, has been jailed for three and a half years. Samuel Tree, 68, had the devices made China before assembling them in his garden shed in Dunstable, Bedford, along with his wife, Joan, 62, who was given a suspended two year jail sentence. The couple were the final pair to be found guilty in a fraud case stretching back to 1999 which is thought to have netted a gang of con artists up to £80million. The crooks claimed the detectors could locate oil, drugs, and explosives up to three miles away, when in fact the devices were nothing more than empty plastic boxes filled with shredded paper. Samuel Tree, 68, has been jailed for three and a half years after being found guilty of selling fake the fake detectors, which his wife Joan, 62 (right) was given a suspended two year sentence . The couple claimed the detector, known as Alpha 6, could help find bombs, drugs, ivory and even missing people such as Madeleine McCann, while in fact it was an empty box filled with shredded paper . The device came with a label attached to it listing the item it was supposed to look for, and the Trees claimed it used the body's static electricity to power an aerial which would point to the object. Despite the 'Alice in Wonderland' science behind the device, known as Alpha 6, the Egyptian government placed an order worth £1million, while Thai officials paid £25,000 for a single unit. The device even duped Giles Paxman, brother of journalist Jeremy Paxman, who championed it while he was the UK's ambassador to Mexico. Units of Alpha 6 were bought by Saudi Arabia, India, Pakistan, China, and were also sold for use in the Green Zone in Iraq while British troops were serving there. Passing sentence on the Trees at Kingston Crown Court, Judge Richard Marks QC said: ‘You decided to market this device along with the other defendants previously convicted. ‘Thereafter you commissioned the device’s production in China, where the cost of an individual piece was just over £5. ‘You had the device stamped ""Made in Britain"", which in my view is plainly dishonest. ‘The device underwent various name changes over the years, but for all practical purposes it was the same thing. ‘The modest production cost is a reflection of the fact that this device was effectively a black plastic box, one similar to what might look like a small radio. The 'sensor' had a label on the front listing the item it was supposed to detect, and the Trees claimed the body's static electricity powered an antenna which would point towards the object being looked for . Despite the 'Alice in Wonderland' science behind the device, the gang of crooks that the Trees were part of managed to sell them to governments in Saudi Arabia, Thailand, China, Egypt, India and Pakistan . At Kingston Crown Court, Judge Richard Marks gave Joan Trees a suspended sentence after hearing that she would not have been involved in the scam if it weren't for her husband, but will likely still lose her house . ‘The way in which it worked was that a piece of card or paper would be attached to it, an image reflecting what it was proposed to be looking for. ‘The aerial would then point to the vicinity or direction of the person or object being searched for. ‘One only has to look at the bare facts to see this as a bizarre and fantastic proposition akin to something out of Alice in Wonderland. ‘This device was completely ineffectual. The basis on which it worked was a complete fantasy. ‘Even if you had not written line by line your own sales literature, the most customary glance at it would had put you on notice that all manner of scientific claims were mad. ‘That you decided not to sell the products in this country and not expose it to closer scrutiny, suggests a great deal about your motives.’ Fellow swindler Jim McCormick, 58, from Langport in Somerset was jailed for ten years last May after raking in £60million from the scam. Gary Bolton, also 58, from Chatham, Kentwas given seven years last August after making £45million, while Anthony Williamson, 59, from Gosport, Hampshire, was also convicted last May. Brendan Kelly QC, defending Samuel Tree, said: ’It is agreed that Mr Tree played a significant role in this offending, there can be no doubt argument about that. While the Trees sold the detector under the moniker Alpha 6 (far right, top) it was also sold in variations called XK9, GT200 and The Mole (pictured), which were all effectively the same product . The Alpha 6 model, which was sold by the Trees, consisted of a plastic box with an aerial attached, which would be filled with shredded paper, and cost just £5.10 to manufacture . The couple bought the items, which were falsely stamped 'Made in Britain', from China before selling them on for up to £25,000 to foreign governments . ‘Mr Tree is content for me to say on his behalf that the role played by Mrs Tree herself is substantially different to his. ‘I submit on his behalf that had it not been for him she would not have involved herself in this plot.’ Judge Marks added: ‘Financially this case will be disastrous for you because it will inevitably mean that you will lost all of your assets.’ The court heard that the Trees will likely lose their £180,000 house and £10,000 at a confiscation hearing set for 27 February 2015. Joan Tree was also ordered to carry out 300 hours of unpaid community work. Judge Marks QC concluded: ‘Joan Tree, you are in a significantly different situation to the one of your husband in my view. ‘It is undoubtedly the case that you played a significantly lesser role. ‘You were concerned with assisting your husband, not marketing or selling like him or in training. ‘You were, I am satisfied, acting under direction from your husband and would not have become involved in this situation had it not been for him. ‘I have given anxious consideration as to whether there is scope for suspending your sentence, and I have by the narrowest of margins decided that by this lesser role this is just possible. ‘You should consider yourself extremely fortunate as you have come as close to anyone to receiving a custodial sentence.’ The devices were even sold to Iraqi authorities while British troops were serving in the county . Detective constable Joanne Law, who led the investigation for the City of London Police, said: ‘Sam and Joan Tree were a couple driven by personal greed. They manufactured useless detectors which they knew were being marketed around the world as being able to locate anything from hidden explosives to missing persons. ‘The devices cost the couple only a few quid to make but were being sold on by agents for prices ranging from several thousand to half a million pounds, despite the fact they were nothing more than plastic boxes with a handle and antennae. ‘The sentencing of the Trees is the concluding act in a highly complex investigation into a global criminal network, which over a ten-year period turned-over up to £80 million. 'Thousands of false substance detectors were produced and sold putting both the users and the people they were bought to protect in grave danger. ‘The demise of these individuals sends a strong warning to anyone else who believes they can make criminal capital abroad while trading off the good name of British business.’","Samuel Tree, 68, jailed for three and a half years after selling fake devices .

"A Jamaican man faces life behind bars for allegedly prostituting women to work as sex slaves, including his 18-year-old wife, in Queensland. Damion St Patrick Baston, 37, will face trial in South Florida next month after a joint federal investigation between Australian and US police led to his arrest in New York last December. He is accused of running a global prostitution racket, which began when he met a Lithuanian woman who he allegedly abused, raped and put to work as a sex slave in NSW before setting up on the Gold Coast. On trial: Jamaican man Damion St Patrick Baston will face a US court for the alleged role he played in courting women for prostitution purposes while living on the Gold Coast . While on the Gold Coast in 2009 he began a relationship with an 18-year-old woman whom he married a year later. Police allege she was also raped by Baston and had her life threatened before escaping. Despite the seriousness of the allegations against the 37-year-old, his lawyer David Rowe described him as 'an affable character of amicable disposition' when applying for bail in a US court. He said Baston was 'a lover not a fighter of women'. 'Perhaps Mr Baston misunderstood women's capacity for jealousy and has now found himself in an unanticipated tangle, which has landed him behind bars,' The Gold Coast Bulletin reported. Police say the women are just a number of victims who have independently told them of Baston's sexual and physical abuse. None can be identified for legal reasons. The 37-year-old has pleaded not guilty to charges of the illegal importation of a person for prostitution, transporting people for prostitution, use of a passport secured by false statement, identity theft and three counts of money laundering. He will go trial in a Miami court next month. MailOnline contacted the Australian Federal Police who could not comment on the case because but Baston is being tried in the US. US Special agent Wendy Bashnan said US authorities appreciated the work of the AFP.'A team of Miami and international Diplomatic Security Service resources worked closely with the Australian authorities to locate and apprehend Damion Baston,' Ms Bashnan said.","Damion St Patrick Baston, 37, was arrested in New York by US authorities .

"A married nurse called a patient ‘yummy’ and ‘very sexy’ in a barrage of texts. Sarah Bailey sent hundreds of messages to the diabetic man after treating him at the GP practice where she worked. They jokingly used a saucy phrase to refer to the man’s testosterone treatment during the frantic text exchange over Christmas 2012. Scroll down for video . Sarah Bailey sent hundreds of messages to the diabetic patient after treating him at the Waterfield Practice in Bracknell, Berkshire, where she worked . But Bailey got cold feet when she realised she might lose her job at the Waterfield Practice in Bracknell, Berkshire, the Nursing and Midwifery Council was told. She used company policy of staying in touch with new patients as an excuse to text the man, known as Patient A, in December 2012. She first texted the man after he had been told off by another nurse about his refusal to tackle his unhealthy lifestyle. The text read: ‘Hope you are not feeling too down after ticking off. Enjoy your Christmas and I’ll see you when you’re back.’ Patient A replied and invited Bailey to dinner. Over the next few days they exchanged hundreds of text messages. Bailey said she was ‘thinking’ of the patient, adding: ‘Not sure how to respond to these advances, I have decided to do the ironing to keep my mind neutral.’ Others read: ‘Even though you are yummy we are going to have to be discreet, I’ve never crossed professional boundaries before. The nurse used company policy of staying in touch with new patients as an excuse to text the man, known as Patient A, in December 2012 . ‘You are gorgeous and very sexy, but I’m married and have a good career and could get struck off if you tell anyone we’re having an affair.’ Bailey visited the man’s home on January 2, 2013, to try to put an end to the texting, as she feared he was growing an ‘attachment’. She also feared losing her job and marriage. But she continued to text the patient after he expressed disappointment at her change of heart. He later revealed the texts to a member of staff at Waterfield and an investigation was launched. Bailey told the panel in Central London she was deeply remorseful for her actions. She said she was aware that she ‘hurt’ Patient A. Handing Bailey a three-year caution, NMC panel chairman Elizabeth Burnley said: ‘The panel concluded your behaviour was unacceptable and would be seen as deplorable by other members of the profession and the public. ‘Patient A was a vulnerable patient who had been recently prescribed with a new medication which he was not managing very well…The panel considered that by sending text messages of an explicit and sexual nature, however much this may or may not have been encouraged by Patient A, your actions fell well below the standards expected of a registered nurse.’ She added the panel was ‘impressed by the steps you have personally undertaken to remediate your behaviour’. Bailey was dismissed from the Waterfield Practice following a disciplinary hearing in early 2013. She admitted sending Patient A inappropriate, sexually motivated text messages.","Sarah Bailey sent hundreds of texts during exchange over Christmas 2012 .

"Police took away a mother's panic alarm in a 'huge catalogue' of failings just months before she was strangled by her ex partner - who had already killed before. Marc Chivers - who had been convicted of murdering another woman in 1992 - used a dog lead to kill Maria Stubbings at her home in Great Baddow, Essex in December 2008. A four-week inquest into the  death has revealed a series of  failures by Essex Police in 'almost every part of its investigation'. Marc Chivers, right, used a dog lead to kill Maria Stubbings, left, at her home in Great Baddow, Essex in December 2008 . Ms Stubbings' family has lashed out at police claiming they were as much to blame 'as the murderer himself'. The inquest in Chelmsford heard Ms Stubbings began a relationship with Chivers without knowing he had killed his last partner. Ms Stubbings was considered to be 'high risk' after she reported an assault by Chivers in July 2008 and was given a panic alarm. But  this was taken away a day later when Chivers was arrested. Later that year he was found guilty of assault but was freed having already spent three months in jail awaiting the hearing - but Ms Stubbings was not told of his release. The jury heard that she then made repeated 999 calls to police, but officers did not go to her house for a week. When they finally did, Chivers, who had previously been jailed for murder in Germany, answered the door only for police to leave when he told them Ms Stubbings had gone away. Her body was found the next day hidden under a pile of clothes in her bathroom. Chivers was jailed for life at Chelmsford Crown Court in 2009. In 1992, Chivers, who was born and raised in Germany, strangled his first victim with a rope before burying her body in a shallow grave and going on the run. He was arrested three months later before being jailed. Speaking after the jury returned a damning narrative verdict, Ms Stubbings' family launched a scathing attack on Essex Police. A statement issued by her brother, Manuel Fernandez, her daughter Celia Peachey and son, Benji Stubbings, said: 'Maria's murder is as much the fault of Essex Police as the murderer himself. Ms Stubbings made repeated 999 calls to police, but officers did not go to her house (pictured) in Great Baddow, Essex for a week . 'They assessed Maria as being at high risk of death or serious harm from Chivers. 'Yet when she called asking for help, they found every excuse to do nothing.' The family confirmed Essex Police have now admitted civil liability in a case brought against them. 'After six years of fighting for justice we are grateful to the jury for finding a huge catalogue of police failures,' they added. Essex Coroner Caroline Beasley-Murray is sending a report about the case to the Government. Afterwards Chief Constable Stephen Kavanagh admitted Essex Police did not protect Ms Stubbings and apologised to her family. He said: 'I know nothing can ever bring Maria back but I want them to know the way we deal with domestic abuse in Essex has changed greatly. 'Maria's family have shown great courage and determination in holding us to account for the mistakes we made. In 2012 an investigation found a catalogue of police failings allowed sadistic killer David Oakes (pictured) to murder his ex-partner and daughter . This is not the first time Essex Police has been accused of failing a victim of violent crime. In 2012 an investigation found a catalogue of police failings allowed killer David Oakes to murder his ex-partner and daughter. The police watchdog said officers took 'inadequate action' to arrest the 50-year-old before he shot Christine Chambers, 38, and Shania, two, at their home in Braintree, Essex. Oakes, of Steeple, near Maldon, was given two whole-life jail terms after being found guilty of the murders, which happened in June 2011. It emerged during his trial at Chelmsford Crown Court that police had visited either his address or Miss Chambers' home six times in the two years before the murders. The trial heard that Oakes stormed Ms Chambers’ house and blasted her and their daughter Shania with a shotgun just weeks after the family gained a restraining order against him. He then shot himself in the face, but survived. A damning report released by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) concluded there was a number of failings by Essex Police, including missed chances to arrest Oakes before the killings. Responding to the report, Essex Police said it accepted the findings and apologised for the failings which had been identified. In March, it was revealed that police had failed to attend a call just hours before a mother was brutally murdered by her jealous ex-partner. Jeanette Goodwin, 47, was stabbed more than 20 times by her former lover Martin Bunch at her home in Southend, Essex, in July 2011. Jeanette Goodwin (left), 47, was stabbed more than 20 times by her former lover Martin Bunch (right) at her home in Southend, Essex, in July 2011 . Bunch had stalked his ex-partner for months and was on bail for harassment when he broke into her back garden in a jealous rage with a kitchen knife. A domestic homicide review by the Southend Community Safety Partnership said police failed to attend a call on the day of the murder. Mrs Goodwin called police at 2.30pm on July 24, 2011, to inform them she was being harassed by Bunch and arranged for officers to check up on her at 4.30pm. But police failed to attend the arranged meeting and only came hours later when a panic alarm was sounded during the frenzied attack at around 7.30pm. 'I have made it a personal mission that a situation like hers must never be allowed to happen again. 'Protecting every single person at risk of domestic abuse is a huge challenge for the police and our partners, but it is one we are determined to meet.' In May last year, the Independent Police Complaints Commission judged Essex Police 'missed a large number of opportunities' to deal with Ms Stubbings' case before she was killed. It concluded: 'It is ironic that Ms Stubbings was offered the most support and protection while Chivers was in prison, when the risk from him was minimal. 'When he was released both she and her son were left completely vulnerable.. 'All the risks that were there when Ms Stubbings called the police in July still existed after his release; indeed arguably the risk was even higher, as Chivers had just served several months in prison as a result of her complaint. 'Ms Stubbings was then murdered by Chivers and her son has endured profound and ongoing trauma as a result of his mother's brutal death.'","Marc Chivers used a dog lead to murder Maria Stubbings at her home .

"The Amazons - an ancient coalition of all-female warriors - smoked cannabis, bore tattoos and fought in fierce battles like men, according to a new historical investigation. 'Archaeology has now proven without a doubt that there really were women fitting the description that the Greeks gave us of Amazons and warrior women,' historian Adrienne Mayor tells National Geographic. 'They fought, hunted, rode horses, [and] used bows and arrows, just like the men.' Keen to dispel long-standing beliefs that these women were mere fiction, Ms Mayor, based in Palo Alto, California, studied a wealth of textual, artistic and archaeological evidence about them before penning her book,The Amazons. Scroll down for video . No myth: 'Archaeology has now proven without a doubt that Amazons fought, hunted, rode horses, and used bows and arrows, just like the men,' historian Adrienne Mayor finds . The Amazons belonged to a nomadic people the ancient Greeks called Scythians, who roamed areas north and west of the Mediterranean. The excavations of thousands of burial sites from these regions have turned up skeletons - originally presumed to have been male - which were buried with weapons and battle horses. Modern DNA testing has proved that many of these skeletons are in fact female, and bear the same sorts of war injuries found on male remains. Every one of these Scythian skeletons, both male and female, were also found to be buried with their own 'hemp-smoking kits' and, sometimes, their own 'tattoo kits.' Ms Mayor points to the ancient historian Herodotus, who described gatherings in which Scythians would burn a plant he specifically referred to as 'cannabis' and become 'intoxicated' around the fire. Modern discoveries: Amazons were known to 'intoxicate' themselves with cannabis and were buried with their own 'hemp-smoking kits' and, sometimes, their own 'tattoo kits' Evidence also exists that Scythian women often bore 'beautifully, lovingly detailed tattoos.' For a long time, Amazons - among those who believed they actually existed - were painted as ruthless lesbian war-wagers who hated men so much that they maimed and murdered their own sons. No archaeological evidence supports the notion that they did this to their children, says Ms Mayor. Their name was also believed to imply in Greek that these women would cut off one of their own breasts in order to better wield a bow and arrow. 'Anyone who's watched The Hunger Games, or female archers, knows that that is an absolutely physiologically ridiculous idea,' points out Ms Mayor. 'Indeed, no ancient Greek artworks - and there are thousands - show a woman with one breast.' Ancient slander: Theories that Amazons were ruthless lesbian war-wagers who hated men so much that they maimed and murdered their own sons have been proven highly unlikely . The widespread allusion that Amazons were all lesbians is a myth too, one that didn't develop until the 20th Century. While their 'strong bond of sisterhood' was depicted in classical art and literature, ancient Greeks did not, Ms Mayor insists, refer to them as lesbians. She argues that the ancient Greeks and Romans were 'not shy' about discussing or engaging in homosexuality, male or female, and if the Amazons had been lesbians, this would have been mentioned. What was mentioned, was that Amazons may indeed have been 'man-killers' but they were also 'man lovers.' Rumors to bed: Ms Mayor (right) based in Palo Alto, California, studied a wealth of textual, artistic and archaeological evidence in order to write her book, The Amazons (left) According to popular folklore, they refrained from having sex with men except for once a year, when they would visit neighboring tribes and copulate with male members so that their race wouldn't die out. As the legend goes, girls were kept but baby boys were either mutilated, killed, or sent back to their fathers. Sending sons to be raised by other tribes was indeed customary, Ms Mayor says, but more as a common way of 'sealing treaties' and 'preventing incest.' At the time of their existence, Amazons seem generally to have been admired. 'The Greeks were both fascinated and appalled by such independent women. They were so different from their wives and daughters,' explains Ms Mayor. 'Yet they were captivated by them. Pictures of Amazons on vase paintings always show them as beautiful, active, spirited, courageous, and brave.' Here and now: As Ms Mayors mentions, female warriors still exist today; most notably of late,  a young Kurdish woman called Rehana who was reported to have killed 'more than a hundred ISIL fighters' Popular theme: Fictional female fighters from recent times include Xena: Warrior Princess in the 90s (left), The Hunger Games' Katniss Evergreen (center) and Game of Thrones' Arya Stark (right) As Ms Mayors mentions, female warriors still exist today; most notably of late, the Kurdish Peshmerga women currently fighting ISIS.

"Police in California are toasting the arrest of an alleged thief dubbed ‘El Mustachio The Magician’ – after the offer of beer glasses printed with his signature facial hair led to a tip-off that identified him. The suspect acquired his nickname for his ability ‘to make merchandise disappear from store shelves’, Santa Cruz Sheriff's Department said, as well as for his distinctive handlebar moustache. Police said that the suspect in recent months had taken merchandise on a number of occasions from a Costco. Police in California are toasting the arrest of an alleged thief dubbed ‘El Mustachio The Magician’ – after the offer of beer glasses printed with his signature facial hair led to a tip-off that identified him as one Shawn Fialho from Boulder Creek . He was captured on the store’s CCTV system on a number of occasions. Although he sported a variety of facial hair looks, he wore Ugg boots that firmed up police suspicions that they were looking at the same man each time. The Sheriff’s Department asked for the public’s help in identifying him on its ‘Name That Thief’ blog, with the offer of commemorative El Mustachio beer glasses signed by police chief Kevin Vogel as an incentive for information. An anonymous tip led to him being identified as 45-year-old Shawn Fialho from Boulder Creek. Caught on camera: Suspected thief El Mustachio was spotted by a Costco's CCTV system on a number of occasions, each time sporting a slightly different look . A Sheriff’s Department blog said: ‘This fabulous and priceless reward did its job. He [Fialho] was picked up by the Sheriff’s Office in Soquel last week on an unrelated arrest. 'We have attached our cases to his arrest for prosecution.

"Having the Pope he succeeded living in retirement at the Vatican is like having a 'wise grandparent' at home, Pope Francis has said. In a speech at St Peter's Square, he hailed the value of the elderly, including his predecessor Emeritus Pope Benedict XVI, who made a rare public appearance at the ceremony to help honor the contribution of grandparents to society. Tens of thousands of people, many of them elderly couples and their grandchildren, applauded today when Francis told them that Benedict's living in papal retirement at the Vatican was 'like having a wise grandparent at home.' Pope Francis (right) embraces his predecessor Emeritus Pope Benedict XVI (left) during the ceremony . Benedict (pictured) was the first Pope in 600 years to step down from his role of Pope while still alive . Pope Francis (left), embraced his predecessor Benedict (right) during the ceremony and said homes for the elderly were like 'prisons' Francis warmly embraced the frail, 87-year-old Benedict, who used a cane and wore a long white coat despite the warmth of a summerlike morning. Francis, 77, decried homes for the elderly that are like 'prisons,' saying the elderly are often 'forgotten, hidden, neglected' in society, tantamount to a kind of euthanasia. He said elderly persons transmit 'wisdom and faith, the most precious inheritance.' Benedict announced his decision to resign as Pope on February 11, 2013 and formally stepped down on February 28. By doing so, he broke a 600-year-old tradition that Popes remain in their elected position until their death. And two weeks after he relinquished his duties, Francis was elected the first non-European pope in 1,300 years. Pope Francis told the crowds at St Peter's Square that the elderly transmit 'wisdom and faith' An elderly woman at the ceremony holds a placard reading: 'Holy Father I'm 106 years old' Benedict said at the time that he was stepping down because he no longer had the physical and spiritual strength to run the 1.2billion member church and that his decision had been taken in full freedom. However, since his retirement there has been speculation he continues to lead as a ‘shadow’ Pope. Benedict has kept his Papal name, lives in the Vatican and continues to wear pontifical white, though he says this is because there were 'no other clothes available' when he stood down.","Pope Francis: Benedict's presence at the Vatican like that of a grandparent .

"A four year-old boy has written a poignant poem to his baby sister who is battling a rare form of cancer. Ruby Young, two, was diagnosed with aggressive neuroblastoma after doctors found a growth in her stomach. Her older brother, Freddy, has now written a verse to encourage people to give money for cancer research. Freddy Young wrote a poem after his sister was diagnosed with neuroblastoma, a rare form of childhood cancer, to encourage people to give money for research into the disease . Ruby was diagnosed soon after her second birthday and the disease has now progressed to stage 4 - the highest grade - and spread to her bone marrow. She now faces a two-year course of treatment at London's Royal Marsden Hospital. Her brother's poem, written with the help of grandma Shirley Rayfield, 50, begins: 'What can we do for Ruby Roo, the little girl who is only two; The poor little honey; has a tumour in her tummy; Give a penny, give a pound; so a cure can be found.' The children's mother, Vikki Young, 29, said: 'I was in the hospital constantly in August when she was first diagnosed so Freddy was spending a lot of time with his grandma. 'She told me they had written something for Ruby and I didn't know what to expect. 'I just broke down when I read it, it's an amazing poem and I am so proud of him. It just broke my heart reading it, I find it hard to read it even now.' The family were left devastated when a tumour was found in Ruby's stomach in August this year . Ruby now faces a gruelling two-year course of treatment, including chemotherapy and possible surgery . Mrs Young and husband Rob, who run their own refrigeration business in Rainham, Kent, first spotted signs of the disease when Ruby, lost her appetite and began losing weight. Neuroblastoma is a rare childhood cancer which develops from nerve cells called neuroblasts. It usually starts in the child's abdomen and can then spread to other areas such as the bone, liver and bone marrow. The cancer affects about 100 children in the UK each year. It is the most common form of solid tumour cancer in childhood after brain tumours. The most common symptom when the cancer has developed is a lump or swelling in the child's abdomen. Because the early symptoms are vague, the cancer is often not diagnosed until it has spread around the body. Source: NHS choices . A growth found in her stomach in August was pressing on her internal organs, including her lungs, making it very difficult to breathe. Ruby now has to undergo a long course treatment, involving chemotherapy and radiotherapy and possibly surgery. Mrs Young added: 'When we found out about Ruby's diagnosis we were in complete shock, it all seemed surreal (and still does) and we were absolutely devastated. We couldn't believe this was happening to our little Ruby.' She added: 'When they first told me all I thought was is she going to die? I had to ask that. I will do anything I can for my little girl.' Mrs Young says there is a high chance Ruby will relapse even if the treatment works and further treatment in America costs £500,000. The family are now raising money for the Neuroblastoma Children's Cancer Alliance (NCCA), which funds the treatment in America.","Ruby Young diagnosed with aggressive neuroblastoma this summer .

"A New Zealand family uncovered a nasty surprise when they cracked open a can of fruit salad, finding a dead gecko hidden among the chunks of produce. Sharyn Malcolm, from Waihi - south-east of Auckland, took to social media to showcase the grisly find in her can of Wattie's Pick of the Crop fruit salad. Wattie's are now investigating Mrs Malcolm's claims as well as an incident where a Northland woman found black mould inside of hers, The New Zealand Herald reported. Sharyn Malcolm, from New Zealand, posted a photo of a gecko she found in her can of Wattie's fruit salad . Mrs Malcolm told the newspaper the gecko had been floating at the bottom of the can and the tail had broken off. The mother-of-four said the tail had either been eaten by one of her sons or he had disposed of it. On Friday, she took to Facebook after speaking with a Wattie's customer representative who had given her a lacklustre response. Mrs Malcolm claimed the Wattie's employee had advised her to keep the incident to herself. 'Mmmmm watties pick of the crop fruit salad topical (sic) in fruit juice... wait a minutes is that a baby lizard or alligator since this was canned in Thailand?' she wrote. A gecko expert identified the critter to The New Zealand Herald as a type of gecko that was believed to be from Thailand. Mrs Malcolm said it had been floating at the bottom of the can and the tail had broken off . Mrs Malcolm's story sparked another woman to come forward with her story. Diane Moore, from Northland - located at the tip of New Zealand, said she found black mould growing in six cans of her fruit salad also from the brand Wattie's. When she contacted Wattie's Ms Moore claimed the company put the onus on her, saying transport from the supermarket to her home must have caused the issue. But Ms Moore said the cans went straight from the supermarket to her home and were kept in suitable conditions before consumption. She added Wattie's sent her an $8 coupon to rectify the situation but barely covered the price of spoiled food. A spokeswoman for the food producer said complaints made to Wattie's were taken seriously and they were 'very disappointed' to hear about the experiences of Ms Malcolm and Ms Moore. 'Wattie's people are very passionate about their products and seek to ensure nothing but happy and satisfied consumers,' the spokeswoman told the New Zealand newspaper. 'From reports we're reading these consumers are not and we need to investigate these matters.' Daily Mail Australia have contacted Wattie's for comment.","Sharyn Malcolm, from New Zealand, found a gecko inside a can of fruit .

Video captured by a City fan and posted online captures between 70 and 100 supporters punching and kicking each other on Albert Street in Beswick . United hooligans are then said to have thrown bottles and a flare at rival fans who were drinking on a terrace at the rear of bar. A number of City supporters ran out of the bar to confront the group, throwing chairs and other missiles. Video captured by a City fan and posted online appears to show between 70 and 100 supporters punching and kicking each other on Albert Street in the Beswick area of the city. The footage also captures supporters hurling vile insults. Police say hooligans attacked each other with wooden poles. The violence left one man, 48, on the ground after it appears he had been punched and kicked in the head. Police were on the scene moments later and arrested one man they found using a chair as a weapon. Four others were arrested nearby. Paramedics were called to the scene but the man who had been felled declined to go to hospital despite a broken nose, cuts and other head injuries.

The five suspects who were arrested have been released on police bail pending further enquiries into the street brawl. The five arrested were among eight made by police. Three United fans were also arrested inside the Etihad. Manchester City won the hotly anticipated game thanks to a second half strike by Sergio Aguero while the match also featured a red card for United's Chris Smalling. Police had been on alert after a handful of known United hooligans were free to attend the game as their football banning orders had expired. Before the game, police issued 35 'dispersal orders' to prevent trouble-makers getting to the ground. Police bosses say the derby passed off relatively peacefully. A spokesman for GMP confirmed officers attended Stanley Road in Beswick at 4.45pm, some 90 minutes after the final whistle but by then the mob had disappeared. They confirmed they found a man of 48 with head injuries, although he was conscious.

"He may be the oldest male member of the Royal Family but the Duke of Edinburgh looked a picture of health as he was spotted crunching through the autumn leaves yesterday. The 93-year-old appeared sprightly as he took a 40-minute stroll around Windsor Great Park in Berkshire as he observed the Canada geese before making his way back to the castle. Prince Philip is now the oldest and longest-serving spouse of any British monarch, after his marriage to the Queen in 1947. The Duke of Edinburgh looked sprightly as he took a walk around Windsor Great Park, Berkshire, yesterday . The record for the longest-lived male descendant of Queen Victoria is currently held by Count Carl Johan Bernadotte of Wisborg who lived to be 95 years, 6 months and 5 days old. This record could be surpassed by the prince on 15 December, 2016. Despite suffering health scares recently the Duke seemed fit and healthy yesterday afternoon. In June 2012, during his wife's Diamond Jubilee celebrations, he was taken to hospital with a bladder infection, which recurred in August while staying at Balmoral Castle. The following year he as admitted to the London Clinic for an exploratory operation on his abdomen and spent 11 days in hospital. He also appeared earlier this year with a bandage on his hand after a 'minor procedure' was performed in Buckingham Palace. He spent 40 minutes strolling around, taking in the wildlife and watching Canadian geese fly over his head . Over the years there have been some health scares for the 93-year-old including a recurring bladder infection . Despite the recent health cares, the monarch appeared a picture of health yesterday as he walked a private stretch of the 4,800 acre park. Its present area was determined in the 1360s and was popular with Saxon kings as a hunting forest and legend has it it's haunted by the ghost of Herne the Hunter. Today the areas open to the public are often busy with visitors taking walks, picnics, bike rides and horse riding.","Prince Philip was spotted taking walk around Windsor Great Park yesterday .

"Daniel Rye Ottosen was held for 13 months by Isis and was freed after a ransom was paid . A freed Isis hostage is making a desperate plea for cash in a Facebook campaign that reveals he is saddled with 'overwhelming debts' after paying a huge ransom for freedom. Daniel Rye Ottosen, who was held for 13 months with the Americans and Britons beheaded by Jihadi John, was freed after a secret fundraising campaign by his family and friends. The move is controversial because the four men were executed after the Obama and Cameron administrations refused to give in to demands to trade their lives for cash - and Britain claims it is against the law to pay ransoms. But in the dramatic appeal for money on Facebook, Daniel's older sister Anita Rye Ottosen confirms that a huge sum was paid for her brother's release in June. She writes: 'Daniel struggles every day -- a struggle to make sense of the violent experiences and find his way back to normal life. 'Daniel's situation right now limits his ability to earn money, and he therefore hopes that anyone interested will be able to help him.' Jihadi John savagely executed his four fellow hostages – US journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff and the UK aid workers David Haines and Alan Henning – after the Obama and Cameron administrations told the families not to give in to a blitz of death threats. The Danish government claims it has a similar policy. In a statement to MailOnline, a British Foreign Office spokesman said it was against international law to pay ransom to terrorists. US Journalist James Foley, who was held alongside Daniel Rye Ottosen, was apparently beheaded in a video on August 19 . Briton David Haines was apparently beheaded in a video released on September 13 . However, in her Facebook posting, Anita, a 32-year-old engineer, appears to confirm that ISIS spared Daniel in return for ransom. Danish Press reports have said the fee was paid with the help of a private security firm. She writes: 'On Thursday, June 19, 2014, my little brother, Daniel Rye, was released after 13 tough months as a hostage in Syria. 'Due to the circumstances, Daniel did not go public (about this), which is why I have chosen to do so on his behalf. 'A secret collection, started by Daniel's family and friends , allowed Daniel's release. 'Unfortunately, the total cost to get Daniel released proved to be higher than the amount already collected. Daniel is therefore obliged to ask for an extra helping hand, so he is not left alone with debts of around 1 million kroner (£86,000). 'Throughout this collection, we have used the motto 'many small, makes a big river' and the hope is that many small contributions can make a big difference, so Daniel can concentrate on getting back to life in the best possible way and without for the rest of that life having to contend with overwhelming debts on top of the psychological challenges.' US journalist Steven Sotloff was apparently beheaded in a video released on September 2, while former British taxi driver Alan Henning was killed at the beginning of October . The New York Times alleged yesterday that Daniel was freed suddenly after his family 'cobbled together a multimillion-euro ransom.' A Danish newspaper, Ekstra Bladet, estimated the amount at about £1.3 million. In an exclusive interview with MailOnline, Anita confirmed that Daniel is drowning in debt. As of October 17, the Facebook appeal has brought in only about £25,300 towards the £86,000 shortfall. 'I do not have much confidence in getting there. I actually don't think we can collect as much,' she said. Daniel was kidnapped just three days after he went to Syria, where he planned to photograph the suffering of refugees from the civil war. Last spring, the militants shot dead a Russian who was one of his fellow hostages, Sergey Gorbunov. 'They filmed his body. Then they returned to show the footage to the surviving hostages,' The New York Times reported. Daniel also is said to have witnessed the torture of another cellmate, James Foley, who was waterboarded and subjected to mock executions. Anita Rye Ottosen, Daniel's older sister, is co-ordinating a Facebook campaign to raise money to repay the debts he has incurred by apparently paying off a ransom to Isis . After his release, he telephoned Mr Foley's mother, Diane, to pass on a letter that the despairing American had asked him to memorise. Mrs Foley visited Copenhagen to meet him. Just a week later, James became the first hostage to be beheaded on camera by the masked Londoner known as Jihadi John. In a grief stricken TV interview, she said that the Obama administration threatened to prosecute her family if they paid ransom for him. A spokesman for the Sotloff family claimed they received similar threats. President Obama's chief of staff, Denis McDonough, said that under a US counterterrorism law, it would have been illegal to for either family to have paid the group money. 'We didn't threaten anybody, but we made clear what the law is,' he said. A Foreign Office spokesperson told MailOnline that the UK has a similar law. 'The UK Government's policy of not making or facilitating substantive concessions to hostage-takers, including the payment of ransoms, is long standing and clear,' he said. 'Not paying ransoms to terrorists prevents millions of pounds reaching terrorists. Ransoms fuel the cycle of terrorist violence and encourage further kidnappings.' Photographer Daniel Rye Ottosen was held for 13 months but is one of the few Isis hostages to be released thanks to a secret fund that his family and friends contributed to . He added: 'In the case of terrorist kidnaps, it is illegal to pay ransoms to terrorists under UK and international law.' A Cameron administration insider elaborated that under two United Stations resolutions – the most recent of which was affirmed in 2012 – it is illegal for member states, including Denmark, to pay ransom to ISIS. Denmark has an 'obligation,' the insider claimed, to enforce this law and 'prevent terrorists from benefiting directly or indirectly from ransom payments.' Anita declined to comment when asked if the Danish government had given its blessing to the payment that secured her brother's release. The senior public diplomacy and press attache for Denmark's US Embassy refused to respond to MailOnline's questions about whether ransom money was illegally paid by Daniel's family, saying 'as a matter of principle, the Danish authorities do not comment on hostage cases.' She added: 'The Danish government does not negotiate with hostage-takers and does not pay ransoms.'","Daniel Rye Ottosen was held for 13 months by Isis fanatics in Syrian desert .

"A major rift has emerged within the English-speaking world, pitting Barack Obama against Kim Kardashian and Eminem against David Beckham. The division is between ‘ummers’ and ‘errers’, and, while you may not be aware of it, your gender and age could have a huge influence on which group you fall into. Men and older people prefer to use ‘er’ during gaps in speech, while women and teenagers are more likely to use ‘um’, according to recent research. Scroll down for video . In a two-minute clip of an interview with Barack Obama (left) about ISIS, the president used ‘uh’ – the US equivalent of ‘er’ – nine times. But in a five minute interview on the Today Show, Kim Kardashian (right) used ‘um’ four times, and didn't revert to using 'uh' once . For instance, during a two-minute clip of an interview with Barack Obama about ISIS, the president used ‘uh’ – the US equivalent of ‘er’ – nine times. ‘Um’ was not mentioned once. But in a five minute interview on the Today Show, Kim Kardashian used ‘um’ four times, and didn't revert to using 'uh' once. Research by Josef Fruehwald, a lecturer in sociolinguistics at the University of Edinburgh, has backed up these observations. He recently studied 25,000 examples of people in Philadelphia using ‘um’ or ‘uh’. ‘I was kind of surprised because I found both that there was differences between men and women, and that it seemed to be changing over generations,’ Professor Fruehwald told MailOnline. Eminem (top left) and David Beckham (top right) both use 'um' and 'er' an equal amount of times. Taylor Swift (middle right) and Kim Kardashian (middle left) use um more often. Meanwhile Ukip leader Nigel farage (bottom left) and Barack Obama (bottom right) tend to use 'er', or the US equivalen 'um', more often . Footballer David Beckham (pictured) is classed as a 'betweener'. He used the word 'um' during 67 per cent of a recent interview. Research has discovered that, overall, women tended to say ‘um’ 22 per cent more than men, but men used ‘uh’ more than twice as often as women . Some people, fall into the ‘betweener’ category. Speaking with Zane Lowe last year, a random two minute-segment of his interview showed Eminem (left) using ‘uh’ and ‘um’ four times each. In a recent two-minute interview, singer Jessie J (right), used 'um' five times and ‘er’ only once. Ummers: . Kim Kardashian (100 per cent) Taylor Swift (71 per cent) Miranda Hart (75 per cent) Jessie J (83 per cent) Steven Gerrard (90 per cent) Errers: . Nigel Farage (88 per cent) Barack Obama (100 per cent) Cheryl Cole (75 per cent) Betweeners: . Eminem (50 per cent) David Beckham (67 per cent 'um') Benedict Cumberbatch (50 per cent) Professor Fruehwald found that men prefer to say ‘uh’ more often than women, and people born more recently prefer ‘um’ more than the older generation. He added that the data showed women’s preference for ‘um’ instead of ‘uh’ was much more significant, and ranged somewhere between 400 per cent and 120 per cent stronger than men’s. ‘It’s not surprising that women are leading the change because for most language trends, women are about a generation and a generation and a half ahead of men.’ ‘I don’t know why that is,’ he said. ‘we don’t have a good answer for to that.’ In a separate study, Mark Liberman, at the University of Pennsylvania, found the use of ‘um and ‘uh’ can reveal the speaker's gender, language skills and life experience. He transcribed 14,000 phone conversations, totalling more than 26 million words from 12,000 speakers across the US. In a separate study, Mark Liberman, at the University of Pennsylvania, (graphic pictured) found the use of ‘um and ‘uh’ can give reveal the speaker's gender, language skills and life experience . Professor Liberman discovered that men, essentially, speak like old women. ‘The rate of “um” usage for the younger men is almost the same as the rate of “um” usage for the older women,’ he said. Overall, women tended to say ‘um’ 22 per cent more than men, but men used ‘uh’ more than twice as often as women. And when men and women speak to each other, they try to find a middle ground, using a more equal mix of 'uh' and 'um', . In his earlier research, Professor Liberman also found that use of ‘uh’ increased with age for both men women. ‘Males use uh about 14 per cent less often when talking with a female rather than a male, and females use uh about 20 per cent more often when talking with a male rather than a female,’ Professor Liberman writes. Captain of the Liverpool team, Steven Gerrard (in yellow), used nine ‘ums’ and one ‘er’ in two and a half minutes during a post-match interview . MailOnline discovered that during a recent two-minute interview, singer Jessie J, used 'um' five times and ‘er’ only once. Cheryl Cole bucked the trend. During a 3 minute-segment of an interview with Pier Morgan, Cole used 'er' three times and 'um' just once.' Some people, however, fall into the ‘betweener’ category. Speaking with Zane Lowe last year, Eminem used ‘uh’ and ‘um’ four times each in two minutes. David Beckham is also classed as a 'betweener'. He used the word 'um' during 67 per cent of a recent interview according to The Times. Oliver Moody in The Times also notes that Nigel Farage, the Ukip leader, used 15 ‘ers’ and just two ‘ums’ on The Andrew Marr show in March this year. Meanwhile, captain of the Liverpool team, Steven Gerrard, used nine ‘ums’ and one ‘er’ in two and a half minutes during a post-match interview. There are a number of different theories for the ‘um’ and ‘uh’ divide. Some scientists believe Hollywood culture has influenced others through film and television. Actor Benedict Cumberbatch is a 'betweener'. He used 'um' and 'er' three times each during a two minute segment of an interview at the Malaysian Grand Prix . A two-minute interview with comedienne Miranda Hart showed her use ‘um’ 75 per cent of the time, and ‘er’ only once. Cheryl Cole bucked the trend. During a 3 minute-segment of an interview with Pier Morgan, Cole used 'er' three times and 'um' just once . But ‘um’ and ‘er’ could also mean different things in our speech, with ‘um’ suggesting a longer break, and ‘er’ a shorter pause. Professor Liberman says people tend to use ‘um’ when they're trying to decide what to say, and ‘uh’ when they're trying to decide how to say it. ‘As people get older, they have less trouble deciding what to say [because they know more stuff], and more trouble deciding how to say it [because they know more words and fixed phrases, and so have a harder time making a choice],’ Professor Liberman told The Atlantic. However, Professor Fruehwald told MailOnline that no one can conclusively proove why there are differences in using 'um' and 'er' between men and women. Professor Fruehwald found that men prefer to say ‘uh’ more often than women, and people born more recently prefer more ‘um’ than the older generation.

"The moon may seem like a placid, barren satellite today, but it was once host to a series of violent volcanoes that scarred its surface. For decades, researchers have believed rivers of magma flowed on the moon around a billion years ago, and then stopped abruptly. But a new study suggests volcanic activity was still present on the moon 100 million years ago – the same time that dinosaurs were roaming the Earth. The feature called Maskelyne is one of many newly discovered young volcanic deposits on the moon. Called irregular mare patches, these areas are thought to be remnants of small volcanic eruptions that occurred much later than the commonly accepted end of lunar volcanism, 1 to 1.5 billion years ago . If confirmed, the finding could suggest the presence of radioactive elements keeping the moon's insides warm. The discovery was made using images from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO), which suggest a number of lunar rock deposits were less than 100 million years old. 'This finding is the kind of science that is literally going to make geologists rewrite the textbooks about the moon,' said John Keller, LRO project scientist. The deposits are scattered across the moon's dark volcanic plains and are characterised by a mixture of smooth, rounded, shallow mounds next to patches of rough, blocky terrain. This image shows the moon seen in visible light (left), topography (centre, where red is high and blue is low), and gravity gradients (right). The Procellarum region is a broad region of low topography which was formed by volcanic activity. Some activity may still have occurred on the lunar surface 100 million years ago . Because of this combination of textures, the researchers refer to these unusual areas as irregular mare patches. The features are too small to be seen from Earth, averaging less than a third of a mile (0.5km) across in their largest dimension. One of the largest, a well-studied area called Ina, was imaged from lunar orbit by Apollo 15 astronauts. Ina appeared to be a one-of-a-kind feature until researchers from Arizona State University in Tempe and Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität Münster in Germany spotted similar regions in high-resolution images taken by LRO. The team identified a total of 70 irregular mare patches on the near side of the moon. The findings have major implications for how warm the moon's interior is thought to be.'The existence and age of the irregular mare patches tell us that the lunar mantle had to remain hot enough to provide magma for the small-volume eruptions that created these unusual young features,' said lead author Sarah Braden . The large number of these features and their wide distribution strongly suggest that late-stage volcanic activity was not an anomaly but an important part of the moon's geologic history. A recent study has found that the famous shapes that make up the 'man in the moon' are likely to have been created by magma bubbling up to the moon’s surface. The 1,800-mile-wide (2,897km) section of the moon’s Procellarum basin was formed by large plumes of molten rock, the US scientists believe. The latest theory, published in the journal Nature, was established by analysing high-definition maps of the moon’s surface. Using Nasa data, a research team from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) found that the circles are not circular - as would be the case if they were caused by asteroids. The researchers discovered that they are instead made up of sharp angles produced by giant tension cracks in the moon’s crust as it cooled around upwelling plumes of hot material from the deep interior. The numbers and sizes of the craters within these areas indicate the deposits are relatively recent. Based on a technique that links such crater measurements to the ages of Apollo and Luna samples, three of the irregular mare patches are thought to be less than 100 million years old, and perhaps less than 50 million years old in the case of Ina. The steep slopes leading down from the smooth rock layers to the rough terrain are consistent with the young age estimates. In contrast, the volcanic plains surrounding these distinctive regions are attributed to volcanic activity that started about 3.5 billion years ago and ended roughly 1 billion years ago. The findings have major implications for how warm the moon's interior is thought to be. 'The existence and age of the irregular mare patches tell us that the lunar mantle had to remain hot enough to provide magma for the small-volume eruptions that created these unusual young features,' said Sarah Braden, a recent Arizona State University graduate and the lead author of the study. The new information is hard to reconcile with what currently is thought about the temperature of the interior of the moon. 'These young volcanic features are prime targets for future exploration, both robotic and human,' said Mark Robinson, LROC principal investigator at Arizona State University. The shapes making up the 'face' of the man in the moon are likely to have been created by magma bubbling up to the moon’s surface, new research reveals. This image shows a full moon as seen from the Earth, with the Procellarum border structures of 'face' superimposed in red .","Discovery made by images from Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO)

"Two Britons have died from heart attacks at a popular holiday spot in Cyprus during a desperate rescue attempt after one of them got into trouble in the sea. Bernard Harris, 53, from London, and Christine Elizabeth McLeish Sugarhood, 66, from West Sussex, died after Mrs Sugarhood passed out in the water near Paphos. According to police Mrs Sugarhood went into the water to help her husband Montague - who is known as Norman - who got into difficulty in rough waves. Police say Norman made it back to shore, but Mrs Sugarhood then suffered a heart attack and lost consciousness, at which point Mr Harris swam out in another rescue attempt. Christine Sugarhood, 66, has died in Cyprus after suffering a heart attack while swimming into the sea to help her husband, Montague, 88 - known as Norman (right) - who got into trouble but survived . Bernard Harris, 53,  noticed Mrs Sugarhood was struggling and dragged her to shore, but while giving her CPR he also had a heart attack and died at the scene (pictured, the hotel where the couples were staying) He managed to drag her back to the beach where he began performing CPR, when he also had a heart attack and died instantly. Paramedics pronounced Mr Harris dead at the scene, and took Mrs Sugarhood to a nearby private clinic where she was pronounced dead on arrival. A spokesman for the police in Paphos said: 'A man from England was swimming yesterday and his wife tried to save him because he had a problem in the sea. 'The wife saved her husband but got into a problem in the water. A third person tried to save the woman. He got her out of the water but they both died, because of a heart attack.' The spokesman said that following post-mortem examinations a coroner today found they both died from heart attacks. The incident occurred in the Yeroskipou area of the tourist resort in the south-west of Cyprus, near to the Athena Beach Hotel, police said. Mrs Sugarhood lived with her 80-year-old husband Montague at a £1million home in Lindfield, West Sussex. Monatague has three children from a previous marriage, while Mrs Sugarhood has two, again from a previous union. The couple are not thought to have had any children together. Mr Montague had been a senior banker at Barclays, where the couple met, before they retired. Neighbours today spoke kindly of the retired pair. One said: 'They were such a lovely couple – really friendly. Christine always had a smile on her face, and she absolutely loved swimming. 'They bought the house just because it had a pool, I think.She would forever be talking about swimming – I gather she must have been quite good. Mrs Sugarhood lived in this £1million house with her husband Montague. The pair met at Barclays, where they both worked, but had retired . 'I don’t know their children very well, but I think they have a son and two daughters.Their son is flying out to Cyprus today to be with his father.' Another neighbour, who asked not to be named, said: 'Christine was a massive fan of swimming. I think she used to go swimming in her pool almost every day. 'It’s such a tragedy – we’re all absolutely shocked. All our thoughts are with her husband, children and grandchildren at this sad time.' Norman, who is still in Cyprus, was too distraught to speak at length today, but revealed that three people had given his wife CPR on the beach, including Mr Harris. He confirmed that he has been in contact with his son following the tragedy, and added: 'You can imagine what the loss means.' Mr Sugarhood's first wife, Marylin, told The Times: 'It is a complete shock because she was extremely fit and active. They were enjoying retirement together and were living life to the full. 'Christine was such a wonderful person and I was so pleased that Norman had found someone like her and they got on so well.' The couple are thought to have travelled to the Greek island with the Lindfield Bowling Club. Speaking to MailOnline, secretary Mike O'Donnell said: 'We at Lindfield Bowling Club were shocked to hear the circumstances and that Christine has passed away. Our thoughts are with her husband and family. 'Christine was an active and popular member involved in all aspects of the club and she will be greatly missed.' Police say holidaymakers on the beach at Paphos saw Mrs Sugarhood struggling in the water at around 5pm yesterday. Officers say Mrs Sugarhood fell unconscious in the sea but didn't go under the surface, adding that Mr Harris did appear to know her. Mr Harris was on holiday with his wife Janet, and the pair were staying at the four-star Athena Beach Hotel, which they have visited for the last ten years, along with the Sugarhoods. A post mortem will be carried out later today ascertain the exact cause of death for Mr Harris. Paphos is notorious for its strong currents and there are several deaths in the coastal resort every year, despite efforts by the authorities to warn swimmers of the dangers. The port city remains one of the island's biggest tourist attractions with more than 2million people visiting every year, almost half of them British. A spokeswoman for the Foreign Office said: 'We can confirm the deaths of two British nationals on November 4 in Cyprus. We are providing consular assistance at this difficult time.'","Bernard Harris, 53, and Christine Sugarhood, 66, have died in Cyprus .

"Homeowners could be stung with fines of up to £2,500 if they allow invasive plants such as Japanese knotweed of giant hogweed  to spread from their properties under anti-social behaviour legislation. The Home Office has published a briefing document on the reform of anti-social behaviour powers, which normally control drunkenness, drug taking and objectionable conduct. The legislation will target plants which can cause illness, threaten biodiversity or even damage property. Japanese knotweed can grow up to 10cm per day and can force its way through tarmac causing damage . Under the new plan, homeowners or businesses could be fined for failing to tackle invasive plants . Giant hogweed is also a dangerous invasive plant whose sap can cause blistering on the skin . According to a Home Office briefing document: 'Japanese knotweed, for example can grow through tarmac and can cause structural damage to property, whilst giant hogweed can cause harm to human health. 'The Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014 does not explicitly refer to Japanese knotweed or other, similar invasive non-native plants, as the new anti-social behaviour powers are intended to be flexible. 'Howver, frontline professionals can stop or prevent any behaviour that meets the legal test in the powers.' Under the scheme, the legislation can be used to order an individual to prevent the growth and spread of 'plants that are capable of causing serious problems to communities'. Japanese knotweed - which has the scientific name fallopia japonica - was introduced into Britain by the Victorians. Incredibly invasive, it can grow four inches (ten centimetres) in a day from April to October and a tiny root can establish itself as a plant in just ten days. Apparently solid structures such as tarmac and flooring in houses are no barrier to its growth and the weed also creates a risk of flooding if leaves clog waterways. Knotweed is recognised by its shovel-shaped leaves, bamboo-like stem and white flowers produced in autumn. People who fail to act to stop the spread will be deemed to be acting unreasonably and could face possible sanction. The Home Office said that local councils or the police have the power to issue notices which can place restrictions on someone's behaviour - if they are over 16 - or 'force them to take steps to rectify the behaviour that is having a detrimental effect on the quality of life in the community'. The document states: 'Breach of any requirement of a community protection notice, without reasonable excuse, would be a criminal offence.' According to the Home Office, failure to act could leave the homeowner facing a Level 4 fine which is currently set at £2,500. If a company fails to act they could face a £20,000 fine. Under the legislation, an individual could complain to the council or the police about an invasive plant in a neighbour's property which threatens their home or land.","New laws could see homeowners fined for allowing pesky plants to spread .
Japanese knotweed and giant hogweed are both deemed objectionable .
Homeowners will have to take 'reasonable steps' to control the plants .
Businesses also face fines of up to £25,000 according to the plan .
As well as a fine, homeowners could also be hit with a criminal conviction ."
"A man who looks just like accused cop-killer Eric Frein claims to have been stopped at gun-point and tackled to the ground repeatedly by police searching for him. James Tully, 39, lives in Canadensis, Pennsylvania, where state troopers and the FBI have been hunting for Frein since September 12, when he allegedly shot dead a state trooper, and badly wounded another. He walks to work every day for five miles through the heart of the search zone, bringing him into daily contact with troopers trying to find the elusive Frein, who has now dodged the authorities for 39 days. Scroll down for video . Lookalike: James Tully, left, looks like Eric Frein, who has been hunted by state police for more than five weeks after allegedly shooting dead a trooper and wounding another . Stopped: Tully, pictured walking near his workplace in Canadensis, Pennsylvania, says he has been stopped more than 20 times . Tully says overzealous officers have held him face-down in the gravel, knee in his back, while shouting at him to identify himself. He has taken to carrying photo ID everywhere to prove he is not one of America's most wanted men. Tully, a separated father of two who works at an aerospace manufacturing firm, says he has been stopped at least 20 times. Speaking to the Pocono Record, he described how he was walking home Friday down Route 447, after finishing work at midnight. Violent encounter: Tully says that one officer who stopped him late at night pointed a rifle at him and pinned him to the floor with his knee . Necessary: Tully has started wearing visible photo ID to convince police he is not Eric Frein . He was stopped twice without incident - but the third officer to spot him leaped from his SUV 'screaming like a lunatic' and aiming his rifle straight at Tully, he said. He said: 'The only ID I saw was the barrel of the gun. He yelled at me to get down on the ground with my arms out wide and he demanded my name.' Despite tearing the ID badge out from under Tully, the officer, he said, continued to hound him. He allegedly said 'I will break you right here - what is your name?' while pressing down on his bad back with one knee. After a while a state trooper who had seen Tully before pulled up and calmed the situation - and promised to tell other searchers about him. He says he was stopped three times the next day. Survivalist: Frein, right, has been on the run from state police and the FBI for 39 days now - and has yet to be taken in despite frequent sightings . He later checked into hospital, where he was told his ribs were bruised in the encounter. He told the Record that due to budget constraints he doesn't have a car - and said nobody is available to give him a lift home because of his late hours. Despite a bad knee and back, he walks to work every day - a 5-mile trip which takes him two hours each way. Pennsylvania State Police declined to comment on any encounters with Tully, but noted that he has not filed any complaints to them. Police have spend weeks searching for Frein in the woods around his parents' home in Canadensis, around where Tully lives and works. School search: The Pocono Mountain School District Swiftwater Campus was closed Tuesday while officers scoured the buildings for Frein . Lockdown: A Pennsylvania State Police Trooper patrols the cemetery at St. Paul's United Church of Christ Tuesday during the ongoing search for Frein . Manhunt: FBI agents (pictured) have joined state and local police in their efforts to track down Frein . Armed: Significant resources have been piled into tracking Frein down. Above are U.S. Marshals riding in an armored vehicle . Chopper: Even helicopters have been deployed in the hunt. Here one chopper lands in a school at the heart of the search area . But they have now shifted their primary search area 5 miles southwest after a woman out for a walk Friday night reported seeing a rifle-toting man with mud on his face near Pocono Mountain East High School. On Monday afternoon, an officer with Pocono Mountain Regional Police spotted a man dressed in green in the woods near the Swiftwater post office, less than a half-mile from the school. That prompted an intense police search as students were heading home for the day - a potentially volatile situation that had some parents fuming. With classes canceled Tuesday, state police and the FBI searched the school district's Swiftwater campus, clearing and securing the high, junior high and elementary schools. The manhunt is now concentrated along the heavily trafficked Route 611 corridor in the heart of the Poconos. Major attractions and businesses in the vicinity include Mount Airy Casino Resort and pharmaceutical company Sanofi Pasteur, where Frein worked briefly. On Tuesday, police with dogs were seen searching a clothing collection bin across the street from a popular restaurant. Troopers: Frein is accused of murdering Pennsylvania State Police Cpl.

"A man has been sentenced to life in prison for killing his ex-girlfriend because he was upset that she broke up with him. Murderer: Andrew Kugler from Maryland flew into a rage and murdered his girlfriend Amber Schinault . Andrew Kugler, 39, from Maryland flew into a rage and murdered his ex-girlfriend Amber Schinault, 36, by cutting her throat during a violent dispute in June 2012. Police found her body in the basement of her house in Berwyn Heights, Maryland, a month later. Officers discovered her lifeless body with 'lacerations to her neck' while they were performing a welfare check at her home on 57th Avenue at about 3:30pm. Prince George’s County police Sergeant Sonya Rorls told NBC 4: 'Once they got here, they had to force entry in to the home. 'They discovered the victim in the basement suffering from lacerations to her neck.' Less than a day after Schinault's body was found, police arrested Kugler. They located him in the College Park Metro Station with his wrists  slit. He was taken to hospital where he was treated and then taken to jail. In May 2014, he was found guilty of her murder after police discovered that he had crawled through a basement window and killed her. Kugler was described as being Schinault’s ex-boyfriend and evidence at trial showed that he had become depressed after they broke up. However, they had a long history of domestic violence during their relationship. Victim: Kugler killed Amber Schinault, seen here, then dumped her body in the basement of her house . Basement: Police discovered Schinault's lifeless body in the basement of her house, pictured here, . In June 2012, Kugler was arrested for allegedly assaulting Schinault in a dispute in which she jumped on his car and severed her finger when it became caught in the wiper blades. She obtained a protective order. After the judge sentenced Kugler to life with 10 years, Prince George's County State's Attorney Angela Alsobrooks criticized him for his violent act. She said: ‘The breakup of a relationship can be a difficult thing but there is absolutely no excuse for Mr. Kugler's violent response.’ Her family have also paid tribute to her memory  on a website and set up a petition on 'Care2 petitions' which hopes to 'protect her and other victims.' They described her as 'Our beautiful 36-year-old daughter Amber Schinault...the most loving and kind individual.'

"A U.S.-born militant fighting in Syria has revealed how he went from being a normal American kid to joining an al Qaeda-linked group. The interview sheds light on why Americans - more than a dozen - have traveled to Syria to join militant groups. Speaking to CBS News, the Somali American, who grew up in the Midwest, kept his identity hidden and instead asked to be known as Ibn Zubayr. 'When I was living in America, I was just a normal kid,' Zubayr said. 'I liked sports and whatnot, growing up, watching movies, just like any other American.' Scroll down for video . Speaking out: A Somali American, who calls himself Ibn Zubayr, has spoken to CBS about why he moved from the U.S. to fight for Syrian militants. He said the country is under terrorist attacks from America . But during college, he dropped out to study Islam in the Middle East and was moved by the plight of the Syrian people who were under attack by their own government. So two years ago, he joined rebel group Jabhat al Nusra to fight against the government. Now he says that the country is under attack from America. 'I don't hate America,' he said. 'That's my home. That's where I grew up. I don't have a need to hate America itself. But the government and their policies as far as the Muslim lands, that's another story.' His home was recently hit in U.S. airstrikes in Syria. The U.S. government says the strikes targeted terrorists planning to attack America - but Zubayr said any attack would be a reaction to the U.S. Interview: He spoke with CBS' Clarissa Ward and told her the Muslim world experiences 9/11s every day . Militant: He joined rebel group Jabhat al Nusra two years ago but says he does not hate America . 'I wouldn't consider it a terrorist attack,' he said. 'If anything happened there, I would consider it a reaction to this action... There is no threat from us if we don't get hit.' He said that the U.S. is killing innocent people in Syria, which he deems to be a terrorist attack. 'There's no tears being shed from me if something happened in America,' he said. When CBS reporter Clarissa Ward said that the way he looked up to Osama bin Laden could upset his fellow Americans because of 9/11, he responded: 'We have 9/11s every day in the Muslim lands.' He added that he himself would not take part in an attack on America - not because he would not want to, but because the U.S. authorities are watching him. He told CBS that authorities know he is fighting in Syria and have visited his family in the Midwest. As a result, he is not allowed to travel anywhere that would require using his passport. Zubayr would not reveal his American identity to protect family members. 'Terrorism': A photograph taken from Turkey on Thursday shows smoke rising following U.S.-led airstrikes in Kobani, Syria. Zubayr says the attacks will cause militants to react and attack the U.S. Battle: Another Western-born militant, Yilmaz, who was previously with the Dutch Army, previously spoke to CBS about moving to Syria when seeing how Syrians were being killed by President Assad's regime . Former life: Yilmaz, pictured when he was in the Dutch Army, left Holland two years ago for Syria so he could fight for fellow Muslims. He said ISIS's brutality comes nowhere close to that of Assad's regime . Ward traveled undercover to Syria to interview Zubayr and another Westerner - a former Dutch Army fighter known as Yilmaz - battling against the U.S. While both men oppose the United States, they are not members of the Islamic state. Ward told the Associated Press she would not have traveled into Syria to meet with members of that group. She has been to Syria 11 times since the civil war began there, but this was the first time she has gone since Islamic state rebels beheaded two American journalists and two British aid workers. 'I felt comfortable and secure,' Ward said. 'While any trip into Syria or Iraq or Gaza entails a certain amount of risk, I did not feel this trip was riskier than many others that journalists have made.' Ward said she had several discussions with Yilmaz online and talked in person with people who said they knew him. In turn, Yilmaz made her aware of Ibn Zubayr.

"Michigan coaches have come under fire for keeping quarterback Shane Morris in Saturday's game following a massive hit that left him barely able to stand. Morris suffered a series of blows during his team's 30-14 loss to Minnesota but coach Brady Hoke failed to pull him - to the anger of ESPN's game analysts, who branded the decision 'atrocious'. One tackle in the fourth quarter by Minnesota's Cameron Botticelli left Morris, 20, limping on his left leg and turning to teammate Ben Braden for support. Then a monster helmet-to-helmet hit by Minnesota's Thieren Cockran  left him struggling to get up off the ground - and fans and commentators wondered if he had suffered a concussion. Scroll down for video . Pained: Michigan's Shane Morris winces in pain in the third quarter of an NCAA college game against Minnesota on Saturday evening. He remained in the game despite suffering a number of nasty hits . Still, he remained in the game. 'That No. 7 is still in this game is appalling,' ESPN's Ed Cunningham said. 'It is appalling that he was left in on that play to throw the ball again as badly as he was hit by Cockran. 'He can barely stand, they've got to get him out... That is terrible looking after a young player.' As the crowd booed, Morris threw an incompletion on the next play and Devin Gardner was eventually put in the game in his place. Vicious: Morris (7) falls to the ground as he is tackled by Minnesota's Cameron Botticelli in the fourth quarter . Injured: He could be seen writhing around on the ground and reaching for his left ankle after the fall . Struck: Next he was knocked to the ground by Minnesota's Thieren Cockran and struggled to get up . Suffering: He stayed on the ground and grabbed his head after being knocked down - but his coaches said they did not know if he had suffered a concussion and that he could have come off if he wanted to . But when Gardner's helmet was knocked off during a play, Morris was entered again. 'Shane Morris cannot be going back into this game,' Cunningham said. 'This young man looked groggy after that hit, he's being put back on the field. He can barely stand up. 'This is not good player management. We've talked about player safety in this game, guys getting hit in the head. This is atrocious to me.' As the end of the game, Morris left on a cart. But Hoke said he hadn't known anything was wrong with his player and didn't see him get hit. 'I don't know if he had a concussion or not,' he told the Detroit Free Press after the game. Dismissive: Coach Brady Hoke, pictured right during the game, came under fire for failing to pull Morris from the game but he later insisted that the safety of his athletes was his top priority . 'Shane's a pretty tough kid and Shane wanted to be the quarterback. Believe me, if he didn't want to be, he would have come to the sideline, or stayed down.' He would not address the quarterback's status following the game but after being lambasted for his decision to keep Morris on the field, he released a statement defending it. 'The safety of our student-athletes is always our top priority,' he said, SBNation reported. 'Shane Morris was removed from yesterday's game against Minnesota after further aggravating an injury to his leg that he sustained earlier in the contest.

'Our coaches have no influence or authority to make determinations if or when an injured player returns to competition. The health and welfare of our student-athletes is and will continue to be a top priority.' The team was plagued with  injuries throughout the game. Cornerback Jabrill Peppers was injured in practice - his second injury of the season - and did not appear on the sideline, while lineback Desmond Morgan missed the game due to an arm injury.

"A woman has escaped jail after revealing she has been binge drinking since she was just eight years old. Hell-raising Hayley Jones, 34, of Brierfield, near Burnley in Lancashire, would erupt into drunken violent rages after knocking back cider and wine during wild nights out. She was given a 44-week suspended sentence in December after an incident In April last year, when she mauled a terrified chip shop boss in a 'wolf-like' attack as she complained about her food. Scroll down for video . Hayley Jones, 34, has been given another suspended sentence after a judge heard she has been binge-drinking since she was just eight years old . But she soon got drunk again and in August launched a vicious attack on a policeman who arrested her for brawling in the street with another woman. During the incident Jones shouted: 'Why me ? You should be taking her, you b***h,' referring to the other woman as she was being spoken to by an officer. She then repeatedly kicked PC Gavin Entwistle as he tried to shut her inside a police van. Burnley Crown Court heard Jones had a 'significant record' for assault with other previous convictions for common assault from 1998 and 2002 and possessing an offensive weapon in 2003. She admitted being drunk and disorderly, assault on police and breaching a suspended term. Last December Jones was in court over an attack on chip shop owner Paulos Iasonides (pictured) Mr Iasonides told police Jones was 'like a wolf' after she bit him on the arm, scratched and kicked him - this picture shows the bite mark left on his arm following the incident . Last December Jones was in court over an attack on chip shop owner Paulos Iasonides. The court heard she was so angry about her portion of potato scallops she lunged at Mr Iasonides, clamped her teeth around his arm - and then clung on for around 40 seconds while he tried to shake her off. During the violent struggle, Jones also used her nails to scratch behind 67-year old Mr Iasonides' ear and draw blood and also kicked him. She also tried to force her way behind the counter at Reedley chippy in Brierfield towards the till but he managed to block her - fearing she might grab a knife to stab him. Recorder Roger Farley said he fully accepted Jones had 'a chaotic and troubling background' The victim's wife Hariklitsa, 59, who was running a hairdressers upstairs, heard screaming and shouting and came downstairs to help her husband restrain Jones and eject her from the shop. Police found the her  pacing up and down outside the shop screaming and shouting at her victim. Mr Iasonides who is now scarred for life later told police: 'She was like a mad person. She was like a wolf.' Jones avoided jail after a judge decided to give her a chance to 'break her cycle of alcohol abuse.' But last August Jones was on a drunken night out with friends when she got involved in a bust up with a group of people. Lisa Worsley, prosecuting, said police were called to reports of a fight on Commercial Street at 1.15am. The court heard Jones was agitated, shouting loudly and a number of people were concerned about her behaviour. Ms Worsley said Jones, who was in a rage, was arrested but began to struggle and was handcuffed and put in the back of a van. She lashed out with her feet, striking the officer on the chest and thigh. She blocked the cage door with her feet, lay on her back with her feet in the air and kicked the officer again. Jones was eventually stopped from striking out and the officer was eventually able to close the van door. In mitigation defence lawyer Laura Barbour said : 'She began drinking alcohol when she was eight. 'Drink is something that's been a feature not only in her her adult life - but the majority of her life.' She said Jones had tried very hard to fight her addiction.

Jones was given eight weeks in custody, suspended for a year, to run consecutively to her previous suspended sentence of 44 weeks in prison suspended for two years. Passing sentence the judge Recorder Roger Farley, QC, said he fully accepted Jones had has a chaotic and troubling background. Andrew Langford, chief executive of the British Liver Trust, said they do occasionally hear of cases where youngsters have started drinking at eight or nine. He said: 'More often we hear of 12 or 13 year olds binge-drinking, but this woman is certainly not the only one - it does happen. 'I think drinking from that early of an age will have definitely had some effect on her liver. 'Drinking large amounts from a young age will increase her risk of quite a lot of different cancers, as alcohol is a carcinogen. 'She should be worried. Unfortunately, the younger people start drinking, the more likely it is to damage the liver and body. 'She should ask her GP to screen her for liver disease. 'She may well have some form of liver disease from drinking at such a young age, as well as increasing her risk from cancers.'","Hayley Jones, 34, acted 'like a wolf' when she drunkenly bit chip shop boss .

"Wal-Mart Stores Inc. plans to eliminate health insurance coverage for most of its part-time U.S. employees in a move aimed at controlling rising health care costs of the nation's largest private employer. Starting January 1, Wal-Mart said that it will no longer offer health insurance to employees who work less than an average of 30 hours a week. The move, which would affect 30,000 employees, follows similar decisions by Target, Home Depot and others to eliminate health insurance benefits for part-time employees. A worker pushes shopping carts in front of a Wal-Mart store in La Habra, California in May 2013. The world's largest retailer said today that it will no longer offer health insurance to employees who work less than an average of 30 hours a week from January 1 . 'We had to make some tough decisions,' Sally Wellborn, Wal-Mart's senior vice president of benefits, said. Wellborn says the Arkansas company will use a third-party organization to help part-time workers find insurance alternatives: 'We are trying to balance the needs of (workers) as well as the costs of (workers) as well as the cost to Wal-Mart.' Walmart made $17billion in profits last year, according to Fortune. The Walton family, who founded U.S.'s largest retailer, are America's richest family with a combined fortune of $140billion. They still hold 50 per cent ownership of the company, according to Forbes. The announcement comes after Wal-Mart said far more U.S. employees and their families are enrolling in its health care plans than it had expected following rollout of the Affordable Care Act. Wal-Mart, which employs about 1.4 million full- and part-time U.S. workers, says about 1.2 million Wal-Mart workers and family members combined now participate in its health care plan. That has had an impact on Wal-Mart's bottom line. Wal-Mart now expects the impact of higher health care costs to be about $500 million for the current fiscal year, or about $170 million higher than the original estimate of about $330 million that it gave in February. But Wal-Mart is among the last of its peers to cut health insurance for some part-time workers. In 2013, 62 percent of large retail chains didn't offer health care benefits to any of its part-time workers, according to Mercer, a global consulting company. That's up from 56 percent in 2009. Three cheers for us! Wal-Mart Stores billionaire family members (left to right) Jim Walton, Alice Walton and Chairman of the Board of Directors Rob Walton at the annual shareholders meeting in 2013. The company announced today that it will no longer provide health care for part-time workers . 'Retailers who offer part-time benefits are more of an exception than the rule,' says Beth Umland, director of research for health and benefits at Mercer. Wal-Mart has been scaling back eligibility for part-time workers over the past few years, though. In 2011, Wal-Mart said it was cutting backing eligibility of its coverage of part-time workers working less than 24 hours a week. And then in 2013, it announced a threshold of 30 hours or under. Wal-Mart, like most big companies, also is increasing premiums, or out-of-pocket costs that employees pay, to counter rising health care costs. Wal-Mart said that it's raising premiums for all of its full-time workers: For a basic plan, of which 40 percent of its workers are enrolled, the premiums will go up to $21.90 per pay period, up from $18.40, starting January 1. Wal-Mart also said that changes in the co-insurance, or the percentage workers pay before coverage kicks in, for the health reimbursement accounts and the health savings accounts will result in the company paying 75 per cent of the eligible costs of doctor visits, tests, hospitalization and other services within the network after employees meet their deductible. That's down from 80 percent.","Starting January 1, Wal-Mart said that it will no longer offer health insurance to employees who work less than an average of 30 hours a week .

"Suspected Nazi war criminals were quietly paid millions by US taxpayers to leave the country without putting up a fight, an investigation has revealed. Dozens of people, including members of Hitler's SS who guarded death camps where millions of Jews were slaughtered, were handed the cash in exchange for leaving the country and giving up citizenship. A scientist who used slave labor to invent the Third Reich's V-2 missile was also caught up in the so-called 'Nazi dumping' strategy which saw at least 38 people linked to Hitler's murderous regime leave the US since 1979. Four living people are still receiving monthly checks from the U.S. government valued at around $1,500. Over a lifetime total payments could easily have reached $375,000 per person. Scroll down for video . SS guards: Martin Hartmann (left), anbd Jakob Denzinger (right), who patrolled Auschwitz for the SS, both agreed to leave the United States in a deal which let them keep receiving benefits. Hartmann lives in Berlin now, while Denzinger is in Croatia . Death camp: Some of those the U.S. paid - and continues to pay - after they left the United States and renounced citizenship, were involved with the infamous Auschwitz death camp in Poland, where hundreds of thousands of Jews were systemically slaughtered . The practice was uncovered by a lengthy investigation by the Associated Press, which found how successive US administrations used the promise of state cash to speed up the removal of suspected criminals. The loophole allowed officials to avoid lengthy and expensive deportation hearings, which could drag on for as long as a decade before the suspect had to leave - and ran the risk of failing completely. But governments, usually of European nations who were lumbered with the suspects after they renounced US citizenship, objected strenuously to the process, prompting diplomatic backlashes. The payments, underwritten by American taxpayers, flowed through a legal loophole that gave the US Justice Department leverage to persuade Nazi suspects to leave the US. Until their deaths: Two other suspected war criminals - rocket scientists Arthur Rudolph (left) and SS guard Martin Bartesch (right), left the US and continued to receive Social Security until their deaths - in 1996 and 1989 respectively . If they agreed to go, or simply fled before deportation, they could keep their Social Security, according to interviews and internal US government records. There are at least four living beneficiaries. They include Martin Hartmann, a former SS guard at the Sachsenhausen camp in Germany, and Jakob Denzinger, who patrolled the grounds at Auschwitz. Hartmann moved to Berlin in 2007 from Arizona just before being stripped of his US citizenship. Denzinger fled to Germany from Ohio in 1989 after learning denaturalization proceedings against him were underway. He soon resettled in Croatia and now lives in a spacious apartment on the right bank of the Drava River in Osijek. Denzinger refused to discuss the situation when questioned. His son, who lives in the U.S., confirmed his father receives Social Security payments and said he deserved them. The other two known living beneficiaries are Peter Mueller, 90, a former guard at the Natzweiler camp in France, Wasyl Lytwyn, 93, who served in the SS. Still taking the cash: Jakob Denzinger, pictured in his Croatian home earlier this year, refused to answer questions about the financial arrangements . Meuller lives in a nursing home in Worms, Germany, while Lytwyn, whose SS Trawniki unit took part in the destruction of the Jewish ghetto in Warsaw, is believed to be living in Ukraine. The deals allowed the Justice Department's former Nazi-hunting unit, the Office of Special Investigations, to skirt lengthy deportation hearings and increased the number of Nazis expelled from the U.S. But newly-unearthed government records  reveal heated objections from the State Department to OSI's practices. Social Security benefits became tools, U.S. diplomatic officials said, to secure agreements in which Nazi suspects would accept the loss of citizenship and voluntarily leave the United States. 'It's absolutely outrageous that Nazi war criminals are continuing to receive Social Security benefits when they have been outlawed from our country for many, many, many years,' said Carolyn Maloney, a Democrat congresswoman and  member of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. She said she now plans to introduce legislation to close the loophole. Since 1979, the new investigation found, at least 38 of 66 suspects removed from the country kept their Social Security benefits. Overseeing persecution: According to internal documents, the government departments involved in ridding the U.S. of Nazis saw striking the Social Security deal as preferable to drawn-out deportation battles in court . The Social Security Administration expressed outrage in 1997 over the use of benefits, the documents show, and blowback in foreign capitals reverberated at the highest levels of government. Austrian authorities were furious upon learning after the fact about a deal made with Martin Bartesch, a former SS guard at the Mauthausen concentration camp in Austria. In 1987, Bartesch landed unannounced at Vienna's airport. Two days later, under the terms of the deal, his US citizenship was revoked. The Romanian-born Bartesch, who had emigrated to the U.S. in 1955, was suddenly stateless and Austria's problem. Bartesch continued to receive Social Security benefits until he died in 1989. 'It was not upfront, it was not transparent, it was not a legitimate process,' said James Hergen, an assistant legal adviser at the State Department from 1982 until 2007. 'This was not the way America should behave. We should not be dumping our refuse, for lack of a better word, on friendly states.' Neal Sher, a former OSI director, said the State Department cared more about diplomatic niceties than holding former members of Adolf Hitler's war machine accountable. Amid the objections, the practice known as 'Nazi dumping' stopped. But the benefits loophole wasn't closed, allowing all the recipients to keep on claiming. 'War criminals': Pictured above as Nazi officers talking to Jews in the Warsaw ghetto - many of whom were brutally killed. A living Social Security recipient - Wasyl Lytwyn, 93 - was part of the unit that killed them . Justice Department spokesman Peter Carr said in an emailed statement that Social Security payments never were employed to persuade Nazi suspects to depart voluntarily. The Social Security Administration refused the AP's request for the total number of Nazi suspects who received benefits and the dollar amounts of those payments. Spokesman William 'BJ' Jarrett said the agency does not track data specific to Nazi cases. A further barrier, Jarrett said, is that there is no exception in U.S. privacy law that 'allows us to disclose information because the individual is a Nazi war criminal or an accused Nazi war criminal.' The department also declined to make the acting commissioner, Carolyn Colvin, or another senior agency official available for an interview. Rabbi Marvin Hier, the founder and head of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles, said the loophole should be closed. 'Someone receiving an American pension could live very well in Europe or wherever they settled,' Hier said. 'We, in effect, were rewarding them. It didn't make any sense.'","Suspects including SS guards and Nazi scientists got government payouts .

"Diverting the ill-fated Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 around hostile Ukrainian airspace would have cost the airline just $66 a passenger, calculations  have revealed. The additional 45 minutes of flight time that would have been required to divert the flight - accounting for costs such as fuel, maintenance, and cabin crew - would have cost the airline between $15,500 and $18,750. That figure is based on direct operating costs running at up to $25,000 an hour for the 777-220ER aircraft. The equation roughly comes to $66 per passenger, The Australian newspaper has reported, and aviation experts believe the cost-saving mechanism is why many airlines have opted to take cheaper, more direct routes. Scroll down for video . Rerouting the passenger jet would have cost the airline roughly $66 a passenger . If the plane was rerouted with an additional 45-minute flight time, it would have added roughly between $14,500 and $18,750 to the Boeing 777-220ER total operating costs . It has been confirmed since the crash, which killed 298 people, that MH17 was flying at altitude and in airspace approved by Eurocontrol, which has since closed the route over the Eastern Ukraine region of Dnipropetrovsk 'until further notice'. 'All flight plans that are filed using these routes are now being rejected by Eurocontrol,' a statement said. But aviation experts - including the former head of Qantas safety - are raising questions as to why it was even open at all. The boss of international aviation consultancy AvLaw International, Ron Bartsch, said it was ultimately up to the airline to decide what route it wishes to take and that is tricky given the savings it can make on fuel, travelling direct. He has called for an international body, possibly through the International Air Transport Association, to give carriers a better indication of the risks associated with trouble spots. Mr Bartsch said there had been instances, such as the recent volcano eruption in Chile, when Australian airlines had chosen not to fly even though the airspace was declared safe by authorities. 'It is up to the individual, in the case of airlines, to make that (decision),' he told the Sydney Morning Herald. He said deciding not to fly over a conflict zone would come at a commercial cost to an airline, because more fuel would be required at a time when prices are high. Airlines are responsible for deciding to choose which flight paths to take . In the case of MH17, Ukrainian and Russian air traffic engineers had given directions to the flight to observe a minimum altitude of 32,000ft minimum, and it was warned that the there was 'combat actions on the territory of the Ukraine near the state border with Russian Federation' hours before it took off. Malaysian Transport Minister Llow Tiong Lai said the route was a major traffic zone, confirming that its flight operators 'followed the rules'. He cited that many more flights - up to 400 a day - had been used along the same route. Singapore Airlines denied it flew the same route taken by MH17, as did Etihad. However both have found themselves in hot water after flight-tracking software indicated that they had. Qantas confirmed it didn't use that airspace and had rerouted all flights about 800km south of that region earlier this year.","Flight MH17, a Boeing 777-220ER aircraft, costs $25,000 an hour to run .

"She has been voted the sexiest woman alive, but now it emerges that one reason may be that Scarlett Johansson apparently has the perfect nose. Plastic surgeons have analysed the ideal shape for a woman’s nose and found it should be slightly upturned. They found Scarlett Johansson, The Duchess of Cambridge, Kate Beckinsale and Jessica Biel all fit the bill. Scroll down for video . Jessica Biel, the Duchess of Cambridge, Kate Beckinsale and Scarlett Johansson all have 'perfect' noses according to the study. Plastic surgeons have analysed the ideal shape for a woman’s nose and found it should be slightly upturned. Measured from the lip up, the optimum angle of rotation at the nasal tip - the amount the nose is turned up - should be 106 degrees to enhance a woman’s looks, says new research. A nose that is rotated less than 90 degrees to the face looks droopy, long and masculine. But an expert said surgeons always strive to get the perfect look for the individual, rather than sticking to a textbook formula. ‘There is a range of rotation that’s usually applied, which is 90 to 100 degrees for men and 95 to 110 degrees for women – this study has ended up somewhere in-between’ said Charles East of the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons. Measured from the lip up, the optimum angle of rotation at the nasal tip - the amount the nose is turned up - should be 106 degrees to enhance a woman’s looks, says new research. A nose that is rotated less than 90 degrees to the face looks droopy, long and masculine. U.S. plastic surgeons behind the research claim there has been no universally accepted standard that defines the most aesthetic combination of nasal features until now. Dr Omar Ahmed, of New York University, said attempts to capture the ideal shape have been ‘elusive and ongoing for decades.’ He said: ‘Throughout history artists and scholars have been engrossed in the pursuit of capturing what constitutes beauty. ‘Dating back to ancient Egypt artists idealised facial proportions in their works.’ In a bid to ‘design’ the most beautiful nose for a young woman, the researchers tested public reaction to a range of different angles and rotation. They used digital portraits of young white women aged 18 to 25 years, which were ranked online by almost 4,000 men and women drawn from the same age group. They were asked to compare photos of women with noses 96, 101, 106, 111 and 116 degrees to their face. The study used focus group and online social network participants and 106 degrees is consistent with previous research stipulating 104 and 108 degrees as being highly favourable angles. Dr Ahmed said ‘To our knowledge this is the first population-based study to attempt to simultaneously determine the ideal NTP - nasal tip projection - and rotation. A rotation of 106 degrees was found to be the most aesthetic.’ Charles East, of the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons, one of the most experienced and sought after specialists in rhinoplasty, or nose jobs, said there were classical features involved in creating the perfect nose. He said the study’s verdict meant the slightly upturned nose of American actress Scarlet Johansson – hailed for performances in Lost In Translation and Girl with a Pearl Earring – had the ideal shape. Mr East does get asked by patients to replicate Ms Johansson’s nose, ‘but the commonest request is to look like Kim Kardashian’. However, he says surgeons always strive to get the perfect look for the individual, rather than sticking to a textbook formula. how to work out if you have the perfect nose: The team used three measurements, known as the Crumley 1, Crumley 2, and Goode measurements (shown here as a,b and c) to work out the anglt of the nose. An upturn of 106° was found to be the most aesthetic. ‘There is a range of rotation that’s usually applied, which is 90 to 100 degrees for men and 95 to 110 degrees for women – this study has ended up somewhere in-between’ he said. ‘In the past there was a stigma attached to having surgery on the nose, largely because they all ended up looking the same. ‘Today we are making a nose that is best for that face, so people compliment them on their lovely smile or beautiful eyes as the face as a whole looks good. The angle of the nose is only one of the variants used in a personalised approach,’ he added. The study, published online in JAMA Facial Plastic Surgery journal looked only at young white women and researchers said the finding was not necessarily applicable to men, or other ethnicities.","The Duchess of Cambridge, Kate Beckinsale and Jessica Biel all have 'perfect' noses according to the study .

"Tory grandee Nicholas Soames last night refused to apologise for launching a four-letter tirade of abuse at rebel Conservative MP Adam Afriyie in the Commons Tea Room. Shocked fellow MPs looked on as Mr Soames, grandson of wartime leader Winston Churchill, tore into Windsor MP Mr Afriyie over his plan to force David Cameron to hold a referendum on Britain’s membership of the EU before the next Election. Mr Soames told Eurosceptic  Mr Afriyie: ‘You are a chateau bottled nuclear powered ****. You are totally f***ing disloyal, a f***ing disgrace to your party, your fellow MPs, your Prime Minister and your country.’ Tea room row: Shocked fellow MP's looked on as the grandson of Winston Churchill launched a foul mouthed tirade at Windsor MP Adam Afriyie . Mr Afriyie hit back: ‘If you want to have a serious discussion, Nicholas, then I am prepared to do so. But this  is not the way to go about it.’ Tory whip Amber Rudd tried to stop the row last Tuesday afternoon, saying: ‘This is not doing any good for anyone.’ But Mr Soames refused to be silenced and told Mr Afriyie: ‘This  is nothing more than a grotesque f***ing vanity project to promote your absurd f***ing campaign to become party leader. You aren’t up to it, man!’ The clash between pro-European  Old Etonian Mr Soames and Mr Afriyie, brought up by a single mother on a council estate in South London, shocked onlookers. ‘You could hear the shouting and swearing from one end of the tea room to the other,’ said one. Mr Soames’s colourful ‘chateau’ phrase is believed to have originated in Anthony Powell’s series of novels  A Dance To The Music Of Time. In the final book, Hearing Secret Harmonies, the character Widmerpool is described as a ‘chateau-bottled s**t’. Not backing down: Eurosceptic Mr Afriyie has made it clear he will not be cowed by Mr Soames and said he woukld not be bullied into submission . Mr Soames told The Mail on Sunday last night: ‘Yes, I was very robust in what I said to him, and yes, I did swear, but I have no regrets. I feel very angry about what Afriyie has done. He has made no secret of the fact that he is running a putative leadership campaign against the PM. Hardly a single MP supports him. ‘The Tory Party was totally united at . its party conference a few weeks ago. But within days Afriyie tried to . blow that unity sky-high with his nonsense referendum idea. What really . worries me is all the hard-working Conservative MPs who could lose their . seats as a result of his ludicrous and deeply irresponsible antics.’ One . Tory MP who witnessed the exchange said: ‘Nick’s barrack room language . was over the top but the vast majority of us agree with him. Adam is . being totally reckless and is in danger of becoming a pariah among his . colleagues. It is totally impractical to have a referendum next year.’ But . a defiant Mr Afriyie made it clear last night he would not be cowed by . Mr Soames. He refused to comment on the blow-up but criticised the . ‘vicious backlash’ against him and said he would not be ‘bullied’ into . backing down. He claimed he had widespread . public support for his demand for an EU referendum in 2014, not in 2017, . as promised by Mr Cameron if he wins the next Election. Self-made millionaire Mr Afriyie is determined to force MPs to vote on the issue on November 8, less than three weeks away. ‘I have received hundreds of supportive letters and emails from people across the country,’ he said. ‘Their message is clear: fight on. ‘As an MP it is my job to suggest changes to legislation and it is important nobody is bullied out of doing so.’ The attacks on him showed the ‘political establishment’ did not want ordinary voters to have a say on whether Britain should stay in the EU.","Mr Soames called Windsor MP Adam Afriyie 'a f***ing disgrace to your party, your fellow MPs, your Prime Minister and your country'

Some 26 MPs earned more outside Parliament than they did as an MP, the latest register of members’ interests reveals. Tory MP Nadine Dorries, pictured in London with her dog Darcey today, earned more from writing novels than she did working as an MP . Barrister and Tory MP Geoffrey Cox, with his dog George, and former Conservative chief whip Andrew Mitchell were in the top 10 biggest earnings MPs . The top earner – according to research carried out by the Guardian – is former Prime Minister Gordon Brown, who declared £492,331 in outside earnings, mainly for public speaking. Mr Brown does not receive any of the cash himself – but instead has all the money paid to the Office of Gordon and Sarah Brown to run his charity. The biggest earner other than Mr Brown is the Tory MP Geoffrey Cox, who took home £368,322 as a barrister outside of the Commons. Fellow barristers Stephen Phillips and Sir Edward Garnier – who both make the top 10 best paid politicians – also earn in excess of £200,000. Mr Garnier said working outside Parliament was good for democracy. He said: ‘The two-jobs stab is a bit lame and unoriginal. ‘Parliament is the better for having MPs who do not spend and have not spent their whole time inside politics.’ Gordon Brown was the best paid MP in outside earnings, but has the cash paid to the Office of Gordon and Sarah Brown and does not benefit personally . The former Prime Minister  declared £492,331 in outside earnings – mainly for public speaking . Conservative Nadine Dorries earned £167,140 – mainly from her best-selling novel The Four Streets. She told the Guardian: ‘My outside earnings are mainly as a result of my writing, which I began when my youngest daughter left home for university and I found myself no longer required as a cook, chauffeur and laundress at the weekends,’ she said. ‘I find it really interesting that no one ever queried the time I gave to being a mother and an MP. I am however absolutely delighted that my writing, which is in effect my weekend hobby, is so lucrative and I urge anyone who has ever considered writing to not wait as long as I did and to give it a go.’ The Liberal Democrat MP John Hemming, who declared £187,000 of income, mainly from an IT company he founded before becoming an MP, said he was good value because he paid ‘more in taxes than my net parliamentary salary’. Hard-left Respect MP George Galloway was last year’s third highest-earning MP. The socialist firebrand picked up £265,350 – mainly speaking . Respect MP George Galloway (left) earned £265,350 on top of his £67,000 House of Commons salary while Tory MP John Redwood (right) pocketed £215,000 in work outside Parliament . Mr Galloway earned £265,350 – almost four times his parliamentary salary – in outside earnings, primarily from paid weekly appearances for the Iranian state-owned broadcaster Press TV, for which Galloway received £100,650, and a further £96,000 – not including air fares – for fortnightly broadcasts from Beirut for Al Mayadeen. A spokesman for Mr Galloway defended his TV appearances. He said: ‘His programmes enable him to reach a far greater audience than would otherwise be the case for his views, both domestically and internationally. No one from these TV stations determines editorial content.’ Other top earners included Tory Charles Hendry, who was until September 2012 an Energy Minister. Mr Hendry – who is leaving Parliament next year – said he received an income of £100,000 from three companies working in the energy sector: Forewind, an offshore wind group, Atlantic Superconnection, a proposal to bring energy into the UK from Iceland, and the energy and commodities group Vitol. Andrew Mitchell, whose was forced to resign as chief whip following the fallout over the Plebgate row, is another former minister with substantial private sector earnings. Mr Mitchell declared £103,000 in earnings. There is no suggestion that any of the MPs has broken Parliamentary rules governing outside earnings. But anti-lobbying pressure groups said the amounts of money being earned by MPs raised concerns shifted ‘loyalty and attention away from the public interest to representing the narrow private interests of their other employer’. Tamasin Cave of the Alliance for Lobbying Transparency told the Guardian: ‘As their paymasters, the public has the right to know far more about MPs’ jobs on the side. What, for example, is a property developer that pays an MP £10,000 a year getting for its money? ‘It’s also valid to question whether the promise of future employment is having an influence on ministerial decisions, as well as what advantages they are bringing to the private sector, like their insider knowledge of how government works.’","More than 20 MPs earned over £100,000 in outside earnings last year .

Theft: 18 of the vehicles were stolen from addresses in London, Surrey, Hertfordshire, Northamptonshire, Germany and the Netherlands . Many of the other stolen cars belonged to finance companies who had been duped into loaning them to bogus customers or to hire companies. Police also discovered a container filled with valuable parts from at least 29 stolen BMWs that had been broken down. Prestigious vehicles are highly prized by criminals themselves and also retain their value for resale wherever they are transported in the world. Tom Dowdall, of the NCA’s Border Policing Command, said some criminal networks have begun paying for consignments of drugs with cars. He said: ‘Exporting and selling stolen vehicles on the black market is a lucrative business for organised crime groups as they also avoid tax or import duties. ‘This type of crime not only affects car owners but also manufacturers, insurance companies and vehicle-related businesses such as rental companies and garages.’ Moved: Prestigious vehicles are highly prized by criminals and also retain their value for resale wherever they are transported .

Last year 90,000 vehicles were stolen in Britain and the authorities believe and many of these will have been exported, according to the ACPO Vehicle Crime Intelligence Service, which was involved in the operation. Many steal vehicles to order with four wheel drive among the most commonly stolen because they can be used in countries with poor roads. Methods used to steal vehicles include hacking into onboard computer systems, taking keys during burglaries or the use of fake documents to hire vehicles or obtain them on finance. Gangs can break into a car and programme a new electronic key or use devices to ‘grab’ security coding when the owner uses their fob. Experts are concerned that thieves may even be using computer malware to take over vehicle systems via satellite, issuing remote commands for them to unlock and start up. Many devices can be bought cheaply online, often from websites based in Bulgaria. They are accompanied by video tutorials posted online. The problem was first exposed several years ago in certain models, but police now suspect that all modern makes are potentially vulnerable. Police advise car owners to leave their cars in well-lit areas, to consider using steering, gear shift and pedal locks, as well as tracking devices.","Organised criminals are targeting sought-after BMWs, Range Rovers, Audis and even trucks and diggers .

"The teenage boy who was killed after being struck by lightning in New South Wales' Hunter Valley as wild weather lashed the state has been identified as Jayden Morrissey. The 15-year-old was holidaying with family friends at One Mile Beach when the tragic accident happened on Saturday afternoon. Friends of the young rugby league referee - who was from the Thornton and Beresfield area near Newcastle - paid tribute to him, saying they were shocked by the loss. Jayden Morrissey (right) died on Saturday after being struck by lightning in NSW's Hunter Valley region. He is pictured here with a friend before the tragic accident . Melanie Hutchinson, whose sons were friends with Jayden, said his death was 'so devastating'. 'Our sons were mates with Jayden through school and sport - rugby league and touch footy,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'He was such a respectful, happy young boy who always had a smile.' The 15-year-old was a rugby league referee in Thornton and surrounding areas. Referees operations manager for Newcastle Rugby League Gavin West - who had known Jayden for two years and his father for a long period of time before that - said the teenager got into refereeing because he loved his football. 'He was very small in stature, Jayden, At that stage, his friends were stronger than him and that's why he got into refereeing to keep up with his rugby,' Mr West told Daily Mail Australia. 'He comes from a family very strong rugby league background. 'His father was an assistant coach for the West Newcastle Rosellas and he also takes part in Newcastle Knights development programs.' Jayden was a young rugby league referee who lived in the Beresfield/Thornton area near Newcastle . Mr West said Jayden was respectful to his elders unlike most children his age and enjoyed watersports, such as surfing. 'At his age, he was a kid with the right attitude towards life and kept himself busy,' he said. 'If he wasn't at the footy ground, he would be at the beach. 'He was very likable character.' Mr West recalled how the 15-year-old had his own distinctive look, in particular his blond locks. 'He was quite a stylish lad with a long blond fringe and long blonde hair,' he said. 'When he was refereeing, he was always playing with his fringe to keep it out of his eyes.' Mr West said Jayden's untimely death was a time for the community to remember life was a gift. 'We start to realise how precious life is with someone as young as 15 taken away from us,' he said. One Mile Beach in Port Stephens, where the 15-year-old boy died after being struck by lightning . Witnesses told NSW police the 15-year-old was leaving the water after surfing with an adult and friends when he was struck by lightning. He had only walked about 20m from the water onto the sand as a severe storm rolled over the seaside town about 5pm on Saturday, The Sydney Morning Herald reported. Emergency services arrived at the scene about 5.10pm at Hannah Parade in One Mile near Port Stephens. Friends of the Jayden administered CPR on him before the arrival of paramedics who took over and spent an hour trying to revive him. Investigations have been launched into the teenager's death and a report is being prepared for the coroner. Social media has been flooded with tributes to Jayden and condolence messages to his family. 'Such a polite young man. Would never hesitate to say hello as he went past. So sad to see a kid like him leave us so soon. Miss ya little man,' one friend wrote. While another said they could not believe the news. 'This was such a shock to find out about Jayden's passing. Way too young. We would like to send our deepest sympathies to [his family]. Shine bright in heaven Jayden,' she posted. One Mile is located in NSW's Hunter Valley region about 5pm as wild weather lashed the state . An hour earlier before this incident, a 50-year-old man was struck by lightning standing outside a house on Rodd Street in Birrong - in Sydney's south-west. Officers from Bankstown Local Area Command attended the scene and he was taken to Liverpool Hospital in a serious condition . The storms also came with damaging winds that brought down power lines, trees and ripped off roofs. A lightning strike also sparked a house fire in the south-west suburbs. A woman felt a tingling sensation after her two-level Lansvale home was struck but managed to escape the house before it was ravaged by fire. The State Emergency Service (SES) logged more than 1,100 jobs by Saturday night, with the Penrith, Blacktown and Liverpool areas the hardest hit. Wind gusts reached up to 100km/h in Sydney and ripped part of a roof off a medical centre in Kingswood. More than 25,000 homes in Sydney were also left without power, according to Endeavour Energy. SES spokeswoman Sue Pritchard said on Saturday night volunteers had gone to more than 200 calls and had another 900 to go. 'People that have been away for the day and come home may find damage so we could see an influx of calls (on Sunday),' she told AAP. Police are urging anyone with information in relation to these incidents to call Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 or use the Crime Stoppers online reporting page.

"Things have gone from bad to worse for Rob Ford, but despite being told   his cancer has a survival rate of only 50 percent, the Toronto mayor said Thursday he's 'going to give it everything I have.' Ford. 45, has refused to resign from the mayor's office over the diagnosis, even though it comes after numerous scandals including his revelation that he has a long-running crack cocaine addiction. Visibly weakened by chemotherapy treatments, Ford was at city hall Thursday for a full day's work after attending a debate Wednesday and being spotted at the scene of a fatal crash Tuesday. Scroll down for video . Weakened: Chemotherapy treatments had 'knocked the you-know-what' out of Toronto Mayor Rob Ford, who is battling malignant liposarcoma . 'The kids, it's ripping my heart out,' said Ford about his two children, ages 9 and 7, adding that they know exactly what's happening with their father's diagnosis. 'Some nights I just cry myself to sleep, but what can you do, there's only that many tears that can be shed,' he told reporters. CBC reports that Ford began chemo treatments in September shortly after doctors found signs of malignant liposarcoma in his abdomen. The cancer is extremely rare, affecting only about 2.5 people for every million, and doctors say the survival rate is a coin toss. He told reporters he 'sees the glass as half full' and that he is taking it 'day to day.' In spite of his refusal to resign, he dropped his re-election campaign for the mayor's office after his diagnosis and will compete instead for a Toronto city council seat.

"More people have voted early in at least 10 states than in 2010, as Republicans make the final push to control the Senate in midterm elections. Nationally at least 16.4 million ballots have been cast early in 31 states and women make up 55 percent of this vote, two points higher than 2010. The race between Democratic Senator Kay Hagan and Republican challenger Thom Tillis in North Carolina is one of the most fiercely fought contests that will decide who takes control of the Senate. Nationally at least 16.4 million ballots have been cast early in 31 states, pictured is voters in Durham, North Carolina on Saturday . Registered Democrats in the state have out-voted registered Republicans by almost 16 percentage points through Sunday, casting 47.6 percent of the 1.15 million early ballots. The overall total is up by almost 200,000 votes from 2010. Ben Ray, a spokesman for the Democrats' joint campaign office in North Carolina, said the gap exceeds Democrats' nine-point advantage at this point in 2010. The raw numbers also give Democrats reason for optimism, as both blacks and women make up a larger share of the early vote than in 2010, when Republicans swept statewide races in the state. The overall total of early voters is up by almost 200,000 votes from 2010 in North Carolina (pictured) The race between Democratic Senator Kay Hagan (left) and Republican challenger Thom Tillis (right) in North Carolina is one of the most fiercely fought contests that will decide who takes control of the Senate . Blacks, who support Mr Hagan by an overwhelming margin, have cast about a quarter of the early vote, compared to 21 percent in 2010. Women have cast 55 percent, two points higher than 2010. But Republicans say they also faced a 16-point early voting gap in 2012, but rallied on Election Day to give Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney a two-point win over President Barack Obama. GOP spokesman Michael Short said Democrats 'are going into a hostile Election Day scenario without the margin they wanted.' About 16 percent of early North Carolina voters - 183,523 so far according to an analysis by Democrats -  did not vote four years ago. Mr Ray said just more than half are Democrats, while almost 26 percent are Republicans and the rest are unaffiliated. Nationally, at least 16.4 million ballots have been cast in 31 states, according to a tally conducted by The Associated Press. The figures include in-person early voting and mail-in ballots that have been returned. Ten counties across Georgia opened their polling places in the largest effort this year to test Sunday voting . A Board of Elections Investigator, left, helps voters cast their ballots during early voting in Chicago in 2008 . Four years ago, 26.9 million out of 89 million overall votes, or about 30 percent, were cast away from traditional precincts. Along with North Carolina, the states included Arkansas, Georgia, Florida, Iowa, Louisiana, Maryland, Montana, Utah and Wisconsin. In Iowa 21,200 registered Republicans have voted earlier compared to 8,500 Democrats, increasing the chances of Joni Ernst becoming elected. Voting almost entirely by mail for the first time, registered Republicans have an 9-point lead over registered Democrats in returned ballots in Colorado. Louisiana had the largest proportional increase of any state with early turnout 181 percent of its 2010 figure. Registered Democrats have a 19-point advantage, compared to 4.4 points in 2010. But Republican Sen. David Vitter still won that year by almost 19 percentage points. Georgia voters don't register by party, but African-Americans have accounted for about a third of the early votes, higher than the 2010 midterms and the 2012 presidential election. With early voting about a quarter higher than four years ago in Florida registered Republicans have a 4.3-point advantage over registered Democrats as GOP Gov. Rick Scott seeks a second term.","More people have voted early in at least 10 states compared with 2010 .

"Distraught Michelle Simmons was so sure her beloved Labradoodle Gracie had plunged to her death playing during a hike in Oregon on Sunday, that she immediately held a memorial service for her dog on the side of the cliff. However, as Simmons and her family stood at the top of the 200-foot ravine they heard the unmistakable sound of Gracie barking from down below - sparking a dramatic rescue for the lucky year-old pup.

"Discrimination: Stanley Wilson, producer at CNN, alleges that the company failed to promote African Americans outside of its Atlanta and New York offices . A veteran field producer at CNN is suing his former company for $5million over claims age and racial discrimination after going 17 years with only one promotion. Stanley Wilson, who is now 51, was fired from his job as producer at the Los Angeles bureau, where he had worked since 1996. The wrongful termination and discrimination lawsuit filed by Wilson claims that Pete Janos, who became bureau chief in 2004, 'never wanted him at the bureau' because of Wilson's 'race, color and ancestry.' Janos, the lawsuit alleges, 'ruled the Los Angeles bureau through fear and intimidation.' At the time of his termination, the lawsuit claims Wilson was the sole African-American producer at CNN in the western region, and Wilson often noted to CNN that African-American men outside of New York and Atlanta failed to be promoted. Wilson had contributed significantly to the network throughout his time at CNN, producing stories on the Los Angeles cop killer manhunt and the effect of Hurricane Katrina. He also contributed to the Soledad O'Brien documentary series Black in America and produced Homicide in Hollenbeck, which investigated Los Angeles street gangs and which the lawsuit says was one of the top rated documentaries in CNN history. A 2001 performance review praised Wilson praised his work reporting on a corruption scandal in the Los Angeles Police Department and the lawsuit says Wilson received numerous awards for reporting. In 2003 Wilson was promoted, but with the arrival of Janos in the bureau chief position, Wilson's growth at CNN stopped. He would not receive a promotion for the next 10 years in spite of repeatedly applying. In addition to age and racial discrimination, the lawsuit claims the company discriminated against Wilson because it was worried about the cost of his wife's medical complications. Blocked: The lawsuit claims that Pete Janos (left) was responsible for keeping African Americans in the western region from being promoted at CNN . In 2013, Wilson's wife became pregnant that became 'high risk' and Wilson took a five-week paternity leave to help care for her, telling Janos and CNN's HR manager he and his wife planned for more children if conditions allowed. When Wilson returned, he found that Janos had replaced a senior producer with a white employee younger than Wilson who the lawsuit alleges had less experience. The new producer worked on field assignments for Anderson Cooper 360 and prime-time documentaries while Wilson performed in-house packaging and fill-in work at the assignment desk. By 2014, the lawsuit alleges the network had phased out any need for Wilson. When a copy editor noticed a story with three lines of copy needing attribution, Janos spiked the story and initiated an audit of Wilson's work at CNN. Wilson was fired soon after without mention of the audit's findings. The lawsuit notes that  Fareed Zakaria was only suspended by the company in spite of significant accusations of plagiarism surfaced in 2009. It notes that Wilson was not given the two week's pay package normally offered to employees leaving the company and that Wilson has not been successful finding work after his termination.","Stanley Wilson produced network coverage on the 911 hijackers, Hurricane Katrina and a corruption scandal in the LAPD .
In spite of applying for promotions, Wilson never received one after Pete Dorn became bureau chief, and even saw a less-experienced white colleague be promoted ahead of him .
The lawsuit also stipulates Wilson was punished for taking a five-week leave to care for his wife, who had a high-risk pregnancy .
It also claims Janos used an incident where a copy editor found three lines of copy that lacked attribution to fire Wilson, though the results of a plagiarism audit of Wilson's work were never released ."
"When playing Patrick Swayze with a 300lbs alligator, you better hope you 'had the time of your life' as one wrong move can turn your dance partner into a killing machine. Alligator whisperer Lance Lacrosse even manages to make the huge reptile look graceful, as he lifts it above his head in a scene reminiscent of Dirty Dancing. The 29-year-old father-of-three has been performing the stunt for years in the swamps of Louisiana, where he works as a tour guide. Nobody put's baby in a corner: Alligator whisperer Lance Lacrosse lifts a gator, thought to weigh around 300lbs, above his head . The original: Patrick Swayze lifts Jennifer Grey in the 1987 cult classic Dirty Dancing . Amazed onlookers can be heard shouting in disbelief as he dives in the murky, alligator infested waters, and after emerging, he quickly begins playing with the alligators as they snap inches from his head and hands. Lance told local media: 'I don't disrespect them, I don't try to drag them out the water, hold them down, wrestle them. 'As you seen in the video, I pick 'em up and put 'em right back down. I'm never rough with them.' Lance's antics went viral after he was filmed feeding a marshmallow to a alligator using his mouth - but has since been dissuaded from performing that particular stunt after it was pointed out to be against Louisiana law. However, Lance - who has been swimming with alligators since the age of nine - says he uses quick hands to prevent the alligators taking a bite out of him. Hold me close: The 29-year-old has been swimming with alligators in the swaps since he was nine years old . Risky game: Lance holds a marshmallow in his mouth as an alligator approaches him in the water, a stunt he has now had to stop doing after it was pointed out to be against rules in Louisiana . Gatornom: The alligator looks pleased as it swims away with the  marshmallow after a previously filmed stunt . The closest he has come to being badly maimed was when one nipped his finger. He was also chased back to the boat by a 10ft alligator who narrowly missed him with a snap of his jaw. Father-of-three Lance, from Marrero, Louisiana, said: 'Half an alligator's body is his tail. So if he even nips me a little bit, he can drag me under water. 'I make sure I got a good foot. When an alligator is coming up close to me, I'm going to reach my hand out under water and I'll judge, just right, to close his mouth. 'I'm going to close the bottom. He can swim straight up to my face but I got his mouth closed. 'So if he lunges at me, the only thing he can do is push me. He might get a little bit. But he's not going to get a big old face bite.' Playtime: The tour guide says that despite having spent two decades swimming with the reptiles he has never been seriously injured . Tricksters: Lance makes sure he can get a grip on the bottom of a gator's mouth so that it cant lunge after him and bite . Itai Etzman, who shot the spectacular video during a swamp tour last May, said: 'Everyone on the boat reacted with shock when he jumped in. We were trying to make sense of what this guy was doing. 'We weren't sure if this was a joke or not. There was one point where he had four large alligators approaching him at once and I was nervous as to how he would handle that situation. 'The alligators swam up to him and attempted to take his face off. 'I think after a couple of unsuccessful attempts, they got bored and left him alone. But he enticed them back for more with some splashing.'","Tour guide Lance Lacrosse, 29, has been swimming with alligators since he was nine years old .

"A California man has claimed that he was sacked from his job because he complained to Comcast about being overcharged on his cable bill. Conal O'Rourke, who worked at accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), alleged that the cable giant charged him more than $1,800 for equipment that he did not order and never received. Following a year-long dispute with the firm, during which his unpaid bills were turned over to a collections agency, he contacted its chief accounting officer and controller, Lawrence Salva. Soon after speaking with Mr Salva's assistant, his employer - which does consulting work for Comcast - reportedly called him in for an internal ethics investigation. He was fired a week later. Scroll down for video . Allegations: Conal O'Rourke (left), who worked at PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), has claimed that he was sacked from his job because he complained to Comcast (right) about being overcharged on his cable bill . Now, Mr O'Rourke has sent a letter to the firm, via his attorney Maureen Ryan, in which he threatened to sue Comcast, the largest broadcasting and cable firm in the world by revenue. The document also stated that the customer should be given 'a full retraction and apology, his re-employment with his former employer and $100,312.50' by next Tuesday. Today, Mr O'Rourke told CNN he initially had a 'pleasant' telephone conversation with Comcast's corporate office, during which he told the firm its billing practices should be investigated. However, he said the chat quickly turned 'aggressive', saying: 'I don't know how I could have handled any differently because I tried for months and months to just have somebody just look at my bill.' Ex-employer: After Mr O'Rourke spoke on the phone with Comcast, PwC (pictured) - which does consulting work for Comcast - reportedly called him in for an internal ethics investigation. He was fired a week later . In a letter to Ms Ryan, Comcast said it had notified Pwc that a person claiming to be an employee had yelled at cable firm's workers who had tried to assist him during the call. It added that Mr O'Rourke had attempted to use his employment at PwC as leverage, but Ms Ryan argued: 'He didn't have any improper leverage and he didn't use it.' She added: They went to his employer and said he had violated accounting ethics. That's not a minor charge to make.' Earlier this week, Comcast's new vice president of customer experience, Charlie Herrin, who was hired to 'improve' the firm's service, issued a public apology to Mr O'Rourke. Interview: Today, Mr O'Rourke (pictured with his attorney, Maureen Ryan), told CNN that during his phone conversation with Comcast's corporate office, he told the firm its billing practices should be investigated . In the apology, published on Comcast's website, he admitted the customer's service problems were completely unacceptable, but denied that the firm sought to have him fired. He wrote: 'What happened with Mr. O’Rourke's service is completely unacceptable. Despite our attempts to address Mr. O’Rourke’s issues, we simply dropped the ball and did not make things right. 'Mr. O’Rourke deserves another apology from us and we’re making this one publicly. We also want to clarify that nobody at Comcast asked for him to be fired. Apology: Earlier this week, Comcast's new vice president of customer experience, Charlie Herrin, who was hired to 'improve' the cable giant's customer service, issued a public apology (pictured) to Mr O'Rourke . Denying the claims: In the apology (pictured), published on Comcast's website, Mr Herrin admitted that Mr O'Rourke's service problems were completely unacceptable, but denied the firm sought to have him fired . 'We’re also determined to get to the bottom of exactly what happened with his service, figure out what went wrong at every point along the way, and fix any underlying issues.' PwC told the TV station that Mr O'Rourke, from San Jose, had been sacked from the firm after violating its standards and practices. However, Mr O'Rourke, who claims his billing problems go back to at least February 2013, has denied any ethics violations or telling Comcast that he worked for PwC.","Conal O'Rourke, of California, was employed by PricewaterhouseCoopers .

"A man has filmed the terrifying moment he was attacked by a dive-bombing magpie as he cycled along the street. Trent Nicholson captured the black and white bird swooping and pecking his helmet six times in a short video he filmed with his GoPro camera. Even a mouthful of worms didn’t stop the magpie from its frenzied assault. Mr Nicholson said he was cycling down Shellharbour Rd, in Shellharbour, near Wollongong, NSW, when the lone bird took aim. Scroll down for video . This frenzied magpie swooped in on a cyclist in Shellharbour, near Wollongong, NSW . ‘For most of the year magpies are fascinating and endearing native birds. However, during breeding, a small percentage of them can be aggressive, swooping at passers-by in their territory,’ he wrote on YouTube. ‘Just avoid the known area for a couple months is my best advice.’ Magpie breeding season began in September and close calls with the birds have been well-documented on social media with posts from people recounting the moment they are terrorised by the bird. The bird returned to peck at the man's helmet six times on the quiet stretch of road . Even a mouthful of worms didn’t stop the magpie from its frenzied assault . Mr Nicholson advised people to avoid the known area for a couple months . Mr Nicholson captured the bird on his GoPro camera . In one Facebook photo, a magpie with its wings spread in full flight is seen diving towards - and just missing - the scalp of a surprised University of Western Sydney student in Bankstown, Sydney. On Twitter, people have told of their brushes with the pesky bird in 140 characters or less. 'Apologies to anyone in New Zealand who may have just heard the blood-curdling shrieks of someone caught off guard by a magpie swoop,' Canberra's Farz Edraki wrote. Keeping up with current affairs, Phil S. Stein, Esq. posted: 'So when are ASIO doing something about upping the Magpie Swoop Threat level? That's the real danger.' While Richard Tuffin issued a warning: '#canberra #Breakeing (sic) RT: I have seen a tweet on Twitter by a cyclist they have had their first magpie swoop of the season.' This photo shows a magpie narrowly missing the scalp of a University of Western Sydney student . People have taken to social media for the past couple of days to tell of their experiences of magpie swooping . But screaming, yelling and making a big fuss is not the way to deter these native creatures from leaving you alone. Sydney Wildlife's education officer Eira Battaglia said the best way to deal with a rogue bird was to quietly walk away. 'They can swoop past your head and it’s a warning but it's only occasionally that people have had them peck their head,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'If you stand still and put your hands over your head, they’ll stop because you’re not threatening them. 'Do not wave your arms around, walk quietly don’t make a big fuss, and they’ll leave you alone.' The more fuss you make over a bird attacking, the more likely it will continue . September is when magpies breed and swooping is way for them to protect their young . Walking away quietly with your hands over your head is the best way to cope with swooping magpies . Ms Battagalia said the season would only last for about a month - depending on when eggs are laid - and it was always the male bird that was swooping because he was trying to protect his young. Wildlife Animal Rescue and Care's Jacky Hunt also warned people not to pick up young birds they found. '[Magpie] parents will often leave them on the ground for two or three days at a time to teach them to be independent, so they can learn how to feed themselves and hunt,' she said. 'That’s when young magpies are taken into care [by people] because they think the magpies have been abandoned, but they haven't.' And the best way to defend oneself from magpies was to protect your head. 'People use ice cream containers with eyes to scare them off,' Ms Hunt said. 'But it doesn’t stop the magpie from swooping. It may not come as close but it will swoop. 'It will protect the head - that’s a main thing. 'I actually suggest people who are walking to wear a wide-brimmed hat or an umbrella. 'It’s also important to have your eyes protected. This is more about protecting than deterring them.' Magpies are also selective when it comes to their targets. Ms Hunt said research had found there were four kinds of stimulus magpies would attack and they would stick with that one type. 'There are magpies who will attack people on a motorbike - like posties - or other fast moving vehicles that they consider an animal,' she said. 'Then there’s the magpie that attacks someone on a bike. That’s a fast moving predator not quite as noisy. 'Then someone who is jogging and then there’s a magpie that will attack someone walking. 'They will only go for one type. If one goes for a motorbike, it won’t attack someone who’s walking. 'It depends on their experience with a stimulus. They may have had some sort of encounter and think that it’s a threat.' Experts recommend wearing a wide-brimmed hat and carrying an umbrella as protection against the birds . Always wear protection to safeguard yourself from injuries when attacked by the birds .

"Immigrants trying to make their way into the UK from Calais are being offered 'package deals' costing up to £4,000 by human traffickers, a court has heard. Desperate migrants were offered an £800 'budget' option, meaning they would be stowed inside a lorry destined for the UK, but were not guaranteed entry to this country. Paying £4,000 for a 'luxury' package meant would-be immigrants were stowed in a car boot, with the driver's consent, meaning the scheme had a much greater chance of success. Scroll down for video . Traffickers in Calais offered migrants deals for getting to the UK, with budget transport organised for £800 and luxury options costing as much as £4,000 per head (pictured, migrants rush into a truck in Calais today) For £800 people are bundled into the back of a lorry, often in a refrigerated compartment, but are not guaranteed entry to the UK. For £4,000 they are concealed in  a car boot, which has a higher chance of success . The shocking details were revealed during a trial of eight Egyptian men and one Tunisian who made hundreds of thousands of pounds from the schemes in the last two years alone. Lawyer Stephane Duchateau told the court in Boulogne: 'There were two packages. The first was the standard one which involved being stowed in a lorry and cost up to £800 per head. 'Often this would involve breaking into lorries parked up in a part of Calais where they waited before boarding ferries. Sometimes these vehicles were refrigerated. 'The guaranteed package was usually in a car boot, with a driver who knew they were there. This had a much higher rate of success and costed up to £4,000.' The men were jailed for between ten months and six years each for running the scheme. The case appeared in court yesterday as Natacha Bouchart, the mayor of Calais, called the UK an 'El Dorado' for migrants because of generous state handouts. Blaming the British government for the escalating crisis in the French port city, Ms Bouchart said those fleeing disasters in Africa and the Middle East were 'prepared to die' to reach Britain. Giving evidence to the Commons home affairs select committee, she said: ‘The real magnet is not the city of Calais but the benefits that are perceived in Great Britain. There are around 2,500 African and Asian migrants currently in squalid camps around the French port city, with authorities saying the situation is the worst it has been for 20 years . Yesterday Calais mayor Natacha Bouchart laid the blame on the UK government, saying poor and desperate people view this country as an 'El Dorado' because of generous state handouts . ‘The weekly benefits of £36 that are given to migrants or asylum seekers is a huge amount for people who have nothing in their lives. ‘They have no idea about the value of money … But they know from those people who have got through [to Britain] that … they can easily find work, don’t have to declare their work, they can find accommodation and can get some money every week. 'People who have got through call and say,… ""this is El Dorado and we’re staying here"".’ Migrants are flocking to Calais in increasing numbers this year, with up to 2,000 people living in makeshift shelters as they wait to cross the English channel. The impoverished conditions in the port city has lead Ms Bouchart to announce a new refuge for migrants, likened by many to the infamous Red Cross camp at Sangatte. The failed camp acted as a base of operations for many trying to cross in the UK before it was closed in 2002. French authorities insist they have been left with few options after fighting between migrant groups lead to 70 people being injured this summer, while people have also been targeted by criminals. Ms Bouchart is planning to build a refuge centre for those who arrive in Calais after infighting in the camps lead to 70 people being injured, but some fear it will simply attract more . Just last month a crew aboard a P&O ferry were forced to turn a firehose on a crowd of around 250 people as they tried to force their way on to the boat. The lorry driver who filmed the chaotic attempt to board the ferry, bound for Dover, described Calais as a 'war zone' saying the situation was at its worst for 20 years. He said many drivers are threatened at knifepoint and forced to let people hide in their vehicles. Anywhere within three hours drive of the port is considered a risk, he added. A row erupted this week after Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said that parts of the UK were being 'swamped' by migrants, only to retract the comment under pressure from Downing Street. However his view was backed by former Labour Home Secretary David Blunkett, who said politicians cannot avoid speaking about immigration, adding that Mr Fallon was right to ‘voice the concerns of ordinary voters’. Both the Labour and Tory parties have been forced to take a tougher stance on the issue after UKIP saw its first MP, Douglas Carswell, elected in the Clacton by-election by a huge margin. The anti-Europe party also saw a huge increase in its vote-share in Heywood and Middleton, where it came within 617 votes of taking the seat from Labour.","Eight Egyptians and one Tunisian man offered to help migrants get to UK .

"A man has been indicted for first-degree murder two years after his wife mysteriously plunged 50 feet to her death as they hiked in Rocky Mountain National Park. Harold Henthorn, 58, was arrested near his Douglas County, Colorado home on Thursday by the National Park Service and the FBI and is due in Denver federal court on Thursday afternoon. Henthorn had told authorities that his wife, Dr Toni Henthorn, 50, accidentally fell as she prepared to take a photograph during their anniversary hike on Deer Mountain on September 29, 2012. The coroner concluded that he could not rule out homicide and the FBI launched an investigation. Scroll down for video . Accused: Harold Henthorn, left, has been accused of murdering his wife, Dr Toni Henthorn, right, who fell to her death while the couple took a hike at Rocky Mountain National Park in September 2012 . Reports have since emerged showing that Dr Henthorn, who had one daughter, had life insurance policies to the value of $4.5 million - and that a claim was made on one of the policies just two days after her death. The indictment says Harold Henthorn, who was the only witness to her death, 'willfully, deliberately, maliciously and with premeditation and malice aforethought did unlawfully kill his wife', CBS reported. After she passed away, it emerged that his first wife had also died in mysterious circumstances, and the investigation into that death has since been re-opened. Sandra Lynn Henthorn, 37, was crushed to death after the couple's car slipped off a jack while she and Harold Henthorn were trying to change a flat tire one late night  in 1995. Watch the full report on CBS Denver here. Family: Dr Henthorn, a skilled ophthalmologist, left behind a seven-year-old daughter when she died in 2012 . Mystery: Harold Henthorn told authorities his wife slipped on a steep mountainside while taking a photo . He told authorities that his wife had been reaching under the car to help him change the front tire on their Jeep Cherokee on the rural road, when the jack slipped. Loss: His first wife, Sandra Lynn, was killed when their car crushed her as she changed a flat tire . Detectives closed the case just one week after the investigation, ruling the death an accident, but the Douglas County Sheriff's Office told CBS4 that they have now re-opened the investigation. A source told the channel that Henthorn had taken out a $300,000 insurance policy on his wife. It added that three life insurance policies had been taken out on his second wife - each valued at $1.5 million - and that efforts had been made to collect on it on the first business day after her death. One of the policies named the Harold and Toni Henthorn Trust as the beneficiary and a claim was sent in for the policy on October 1, 2012, CBS reported. No payment was made, however. It is not clear who attempted to file a claim for the policy. The claim was made before her body was cremated or a memorial service was held. Dr Henthorn, an ophthalmologist, had been married to her husband for 12 years. She left behind a daughter, then seven. Toni Henthorn's family told CBS4 that they learned of her husband's arrest on Thursday morning. Her brother Todd Bertolet  expressed relief that federal authorities had made an arrest. Scene: The couple were on an anniversary hike - they had been married 12 years - on Deer Mountain in Rocky Mountains National Park on September 29, 2012 when Dr Henthorn fell to her death . 'We've always had the utmost confidence in very talented people with the FBI and the National Park Service,' he said. 'We've always felt that justice would come one day and this is a satisfactory day in knowing that justice for Toni is proceeding along.' Harold Henthorn's attorney, Craig Truman, added: 'We know when all the facts are known in this difficult case that justice will be done.' If convicted, Henthorn faces a mandatory life sentence in prison with no possibility of parole and a fine of up to $250,000.","Harold Henthorn told friends that his wife Toni had slipped while trying to take a photograph during their hike in September 2012 and fell 50ft .

"Former President Jimmy Carter recently said he 'could have wiped Iran off the map with the weapons we had' during the Iranian hostage crisis. Carter also claimed that if he proved himself 'manly' and used military force, a second term in the Oval Office would have been possible. Carter made the remarks during an episode of CNBC Meets after Tania Bryer asked him 'Do you feel there were any choices you would have made differently?' 'I think I would have been re-elected easily if I had been able to rescue our hostages from the Iranians,' Carter said on the program. 'And everybody asks me what would do more, I would say I would send one more helicopter because if I had one more helicopter we could have brought out not only the 52 hostages, but also brought out the rescue team, and when that failed, then I think that was the main factor that brought about my failure to be re-elected. So that's one thing I would change.' Scroll down for video . Big birthday! Former President Jimmy Carter blew out birthday candles on his birthday cake Wednesday . Carter also said 'I could've been re-elected if I'd taken military action against Iran, shown that I was strong and resolute and, um, manly and so forth. 'But, er, I think if I, I could have wiped Iran off the map with the weapons that we had, but in the process a lot of innocent people would have been killed, probably including the hostages and so I stood up against all that, er, all that advice, and then eventually my prayers were answered and every hostage came home safe and free. And so I think I made the right decision in retrospect, but it was not easy at the time.' Carter lost in the 1980 presidential election to Republican candidate Ronald Reagan. The fifty-two hostages were eventually released in January 1981. Sixty-six Americans were originally taken hostage from a US embassy in November 1979, CNN reported. Carter also celebrated his 90th birthday Wednesday in Atlanta, blowing out three candles representing the past, present and future and thanking family and friends for their support and love. 'It's been a good first 90 years,' the 39th president joked before telling the crowd gathered in a chapel on The Carter Center grounds that he is looking forward to much more work. Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, founded the international health and human rights organization after leaving the White House. Not 'manly' enough? Carter, seen here with his family in 1980, claimed that if he proved himself 'manly' and used military force, a second term in the Oval Office would have been possible . Carter is the second-oldest of the five living U.S. presidents. Carter said his life was most shaped by his marriage to Rosalynn and growing up in Plains, Georgia, where he worked and played with black children who didn't have the same rights as he because of their race. Carter said he still feels guilt for not realizing sooner how wrong that was. Being elected president, he said, was the highlight of his political life. However, he said he's had the 'best times' of his life since establishing The Carter Center, 'this beautiful place on earth that has set moral and ethical standards that exemplify what a superpower like America ought to be.' Rosalynn Carter choked up while introducing her husband, telling him she's proud of him for both his work and the family they built together. As for what's next, Rosalynn Carter said only one thing is certain. 'It will be something because Jimmy Carter is miserable if he's not doing something,' she said, laughing with the crowd. Carter is the second-oldest of the five living U.S. presidents. He was born 111 days after President George H.W. Bush, who celebrated his 90th birthday earlier this year.","Former President Jimmy Carter has said he 'could have wiped Iran off the map with the weapons we had' during the Iranian hostage crisis .

"America's middle class is less wealthy in 2014 than at any other time since the 1940s. The bottom 90 percent of families in the United States collectively owns just  23 percent of total U.S. wealth. Meanwhile, those at the top end of society are getting richer with senior company executives and successful entrepreneurs earning pay packets that far exceed those of their predecessors. It means that ordinary middle class American families living the 'American Dream' are now worse off than during wartime. The startling statistics have been revealed in a new working paper put together by economists Emmanuel Saez of the University of California, Berkeley, and Gabriel Zucman of the London School of Economics. Debt has been the big force driving net wealth lower for the middle class, according to Saez and Zucman. Brief bubbles in stock and home prices in the 1990s and 2000s only temporarily offset the steady, depressing rise in mortgage, student-loan, credit-card and other debts for the bottom 90 percent . Wealth inequality, it turns out, has followed a spectacular U-shape evolution over the past 100 years. From the Great Depression in the 1930s through the late 1970s there was a substantial democratization of wealth . The pair claim that the economic imbalance that exists between the top members of society and those at the the bottom, is not simply a matter of rising pay packets but also as a result of great wealth inequality. From the Great Depression in the 1930s through the late 1970s there was a substantial democratization of wealth but the last four decades has been wealth inequality creep into society. Put simply, only a tiny fraction of the population saw its wealth grow - namely those at the top 0.1 percent. The top 1 per cent of families earned 20 per cent of the country's income - up from 10 per cent in the 1970s. At the very pinnacle, the extremely wealthy (the top 0.1 percent) includes 160,000 families with total net assets of more than $20 million in 2012. The fortunes of those families who are seen as 'rich' and within the top 10 per cent of society did not rise as much as those at the very top (the 0.1 per cent). In other words, those who already had money saw their wealth continue to grow as they continued to earn off the returns of their wealth, whilst those families who did not make it into the top spots saw their fortunes grow at far slower pace. This rising inequality of wealth can only lead to more inequality of income and wealth in the future, Saez and Zucman warn. The very rich will just keep getting richer by living on the returns from their wealth, while the rest of us will keep falling behind . While the share of wealth of the bottom 90 percent of families did gradually increase from 15 percent in the 1920s to a peak of 36 percent in the mid-1980, it then dramatically declined. By 2012, the bottom 90 percent collectively owns only 23 percent of total U.S. wealth, about as much as in 1940 . When it comes to the middle class, that particular section of society appears to have fared far worse. Saez &Zucman note that although there is a widespread belief that wealth among the middle class has been rising and that better more productive lives are lead as a result, with greater home ownership and the rise of pensions, there has in fact been an erosion of wealth among the middle class and the poor. Whilst the wealth of the bottom 90 percent of families did gradually increase from 15 percent in the 1920s to a peak of 36 percent in the mid-1980s, it then dramatically declined. By 2012, the bottom 90 percent collectively owned just only 23 percent of total U.S. wealth, about as much as in 1940. The reason for the awkward position of America's middle class is because they have taken on more debt than ever before. Although many middle class families own homes and have pensions, these same families also have much higher mortgages to repay with larger loans to repay. And while the value of assets also tends to rise as it did during the stock-market bubble of the late 1990s and the housing bubble of the early 2000s, values then plummeted during the Great Recession of 2007-2009. The average wealth of bottom 90 percent of families jumped during the stock-market bubble of the late 1990s and the housing bubble of the early 2000s. But it then collapsed during and after the Great Recession of 2007-2009 . Incomes have stagnated for most Americans over the past few decades, once adjusted for inflation. Along with rising debt levels, stagnant wages have made it impossible for most families to save very much money . Since the housing and financial crises of the late 2000s there has been no recovery in the wealth of the middle class and the poor. The average wealth of the bottom 90 percent of families is equal to $80,000 in 2012—the same level as in 1986. At the top of the tree, the average wealth for the top 1 percent more than tripled between 1980 and 2012. For the wealthiest members of society, the Great Recession was a mere bump in the road on an upwardly inclining path towards even greater wealth. Saez & Zucman explain the growing disparity in American wealth is due to a number of reasons. Apart from a lack of real wage gains, it appears that people's inability to save is helping to create a widening gulf between America's richest and poorest. At the top, wages sky rocketed, but at the bottom 90 per cent, with salaries barely moving, most families are unable to put any money away and save for the future. The worrying trend looks set to continue so long as wages at the top keep on rising and the middle class continue to fail to save. The economists suggest a number of policies that could be introduce to redistribute or at least reduce the concentration of wealth and encourage savings. They believe new regulations could be introduced to dissuade 'predatory lending' where borrowers take on far more debt than they can realistically repay. They also suggest that people need to be encouraged in to saving more and that salaries at the lower end of society need also increase so that families can afford to save.","The rise in mortgages, student-loan, credit-card and other debts for the bottom 90 percent of society means poor are getting poorer .
Stagnant wages have made it impossible for most families to save very much money .
However, the top 0.1 percent of Americans' incomes have kept rising .
This rising inequality of wealth will lead to more inequality of income and wealth in the future ."
