"Tokyo (CNN) -- Radiation readings near tanks holding toxic water at Japan's crippled nuclear power plant have jumped to a new high, the plant operator said Wednesday. Tokyo Electric Power Company, which has been struggling to deal with a series of leaks at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, said it detected a radiation level of 2,200 millisieverts near the tanks on Tuesday. That's up from a previous high of 1,800 millisieverts on Saturday. Those levels, detected around the same tank, are strong enough to kill an unprotected person within hours. But TEPCO said the type of radiation is easy to shield against. How did we get to this point? The announcement of the increased reading came a day after the Japanese government officially stepped into the effort to deal with the contaminated water crisis at the Fukushima plant, which was severely damaged by the massive earthquake and tsunami that struck northeast Japan in March 2011. The government said Tuesday that it would spend the equivalent of $470 million on measures that included an ambitious plan to freeze the ground surrounding the plant's stricken reactors to prevent the contamination of groundwater at the site. TEPCO has accumulated a vast volume of tainted water in roughly 1,000 huge storage tanks at the site, some of them hastily assembled in the aftermath of the tsunami. More leaks feared at Fukushima . And the amount of radioactive water at the plant keeps growing day by day, as groundwater seeps in and the company pumps liquid around the damaged reactors to keep them cool. Last month, TEPCO said one of the tanks at the site had leaked 300 tons of toxic water, prompting Japan's nuclear regulator to declare the situation a Level 3 serious incident, its gravest assessment since the reactor meltdowns at the plant in 2011. TEPCO looks for outside help to stabilize crippled Fukushima nuclear plant . The nuclear watchdog, the Nuclear Regulation Authority, said this week that the recent high radiation readings have raised suspicions of more leaks from other water containers. TEPCO said Wednesday that it hadn't found any leaks from this tank and that the cause of the high radiation reading was under investigation. Japan fed up with 'whack-a-mole' approach to Fukushima .","TEPCO says it measured radiation of 2,200 millisieverts at the plant .
The reading came from near a tank holding contaminated water .
The previous highest reading around that tank was 1,800 millisieverts on Saturday .

"(CNN) -- Scientists are more convinced that human activity is behind the increase in global temperatures since the 1950s, which has boosted sea levels and the odds of extreme storms, according to a leaked draft of an upcoming U.N. report. ""It is extremely likely that human influence on climate caused more than half of the observed increase in global average surface temperature from 1951 to 2010,"" according to a summary of the draft obtained by CNN. ""There is high confidence that this has warmed the ocean, melted snow and ice, raised global mean sea level and changed some climate extremes in the second half of the 20th century."" Those conclusions come from the upcoming report of the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the fifth in a series of multiyear reports seen as a benchmark on the subject. The panel's last report, in 2007, concluded that it was 90% certain that rising temperatures were due to human activity; the new draft raises that figure to 95%. Climate change may increase violence, study shows . The panel's report is slated for release in sections, starting in September, and could be revised. But Marshall Shepherd, a research meteorologist at the University of Georgia and the president of the American Meteorological Society, said the report is expected ""to strongly identify the significant human impact on the climate system."" ""There are certainly some uncertainties that should be acknowledged, but the consensus is very clear that humans are playing a significant role,"" said Shepherd, who contributed to the 2007 report but was not involved in compiling the upcoming document. Increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide and other emissions have driven up global average temperatures by about 0.6 degrees C (1 degree F) since 1950, the report states. That's likely to go up by between 1 and 3.7 degrees C (1.8 to 6.6 F) by 2100, the draft states. Climate change sticker shock: Arctic thaw could cost $60 trillion . Meanwhile, the rise of sea levels, currently about 3 mm (1/8 inch) per year, is ""very likely"" to speed up. Global average sea levels are expected to go up between 50 and 97 cm -- 20 inches to more than 3 feet -- by 2100, according to the draft. ""Emissions at or above current rates would induce changes in all components in the climate system, some of which would very likely be unprecedented in hundreds to thousands of years,"" it states. Those changes are likely to occur ""in all regions of the globe"" and affect the water cycle, rising ocean acidity and changes in the water cycle. ""Many of these changes would persist for many centuries,"" it added. Opinion: Obama is right on climate change . The effect has already been seen in shrinking summer icepacks in the Arctic Ocean and warming permafrost in the Northern Hemisphere, it states. ""It is very likely that the Arctic sea ice cover will continue to shrink and thin and that Northern Hemisphere snow cover will decrease during the 21st century as global temperature rises,"" the draft states. The science of global warming is politically controversial but generally accepted as fact by most researchers, who point to heat-trapping carbon emissions from the burning of fossil fuels as the major cause. A May study of research papers published between 1991 and 2011 found that more than 97% of those that expressed an opinion on the cause of increasing temperatures supported that consensus. Skeptics point to the fact that the rate of warming has slowed since 1998, a record warm year. But two more years, 2005 and 2010, have topped that record -- and the report notes that each of the last three decades have been warmer than the last. Meanwhile, the insurance industry and urban planners are treating sea-level rise as a real threat. A study published over the weekend in the scientific journal Nature Climate Change warned that the world's largest coastal cities will face tens of billions in flood losses a year even with improved defenses. The most vulnerable city on the list was the Chinese city of Guangzhou, with Miami, New York, New Orleans and Mumbai rounding out the top five. New York and much of New Jersey are still rebuilding from 2012's catastrophic Superstorm Sandy, and a federal government report released Monday said reconstruction should take into account ""the existing and future threats exacerbated by climate change."" ""More than ever, it is critical that when we build for the future, we do so in a way that makes communities more resilient to emerging challenges such as rising sea levels, extreme heat and more frequent and intense storms,"" Housing Secretary Shaun Donovan wrote in the report's preface. CNN's Tristan Smith, Dave Hennen and Brandon Miller contributed to this report.","Sea levels are ""very likely"" to rise more rapidly, draft finds .
An upcoming U.N. report says scientific consensus is hardening .
The report says it's 95% certain that humans are behind rising temperatures .

"(CNN) -- The leaders of three world religions will be visiting the United States this week, and although the media spotlight is focused on Pope Benedict XVI and the Dalai Lama, thousands of Ismaili Muslims are celebrating a rare U.S. tour by the Aga Khan. The Aga Khan says a ""clash of ignorance"" has led to friction between Islam and the West. The Aga Khan doesn't exactly fit the image that may be expected for the spiritual leader of 20 million Ismaili Muslims across the world; he usually wears a suit and tie. But his followers see him as the final authority on interpreting the Quran. One one Muslim scholar said that in that regard, ""he is more powerful than the pope."" The Aga Khan, 71, arrived Friday in Austin, Texas, where he met with Gov. Rick Perry and signed a memorandum with the University of Texas on behalf of his Aga Khan University. The two schools agreed to share research and cooperate in what was described as ""a move towards narrowing the gap between the West and Islam."" Aga Khan University is an international University with teaching sites in eight countries: Afghanistan, Kenya, Pakistan, Tanzania, Uganda, Syria, Egypt and the United Kingdom. The agenda for the Aga Khan's first U.S. tour in 20 years includes stops in Chicago, Illinois; Los Angeles, California; and Atlanta, Georgia; places he described as having ""particular importance to the Ismaili Community over the last half century.""  Watch the Aga Khan's arrival in the U.S. Â» . His trip to the United States and to other Ismaili communities around the world is in celebration of his ""Golden Jubilee"" -- which actually fell last year -- marking 50 years as the spiritual leader. ""It's not very often that the Ismaili community gets this opportunity,"" said Saloni Firasta Vastani, a volunteer community leader in Atlanta. The Aga Khan ""has a worldly responsibility in addition to spiritual,"" Vastani explained. And that is why the centerpiece of his role is his $150 million nonprofit, nondenominational foundation that focuses on helping the poor. The imam's personal life has sometimes overshadowed his message of tolerance, which a spokesman for the U.S. Ismaili community says has ""not been well covered"" by the media. ""In the Western world, he is not as well-known, except for the British tabloid press, which will talk about his racehorses and the private life of his father,"" Dr. Mansoor Saleh said. The Aga Khan repeatedly focuses on a ""clash of ignorance,"" not a clash of cultures, that has led to the current friction between Islam and the West. ""The hope is that this visit will provide the impetus ... for the West to understand what he does and what he stands for,"" Saleh said. Last year, Forbes Magazine listed the Aga Khan, who lives in the Paris suburbs, as the 10th richest royal in the world, valued at $1 billion. In a previous article, the magazine heralded him as ""venture capitalist to the world,"" saying the Aga Khan ""was early among experts in Third World development to grasp that government handouts and multilaterally funded megaprojects often foster dependence, not self-reliance, in the people they're meant to help."" Prince Karim al-Husseini became the current Aga Khan as a 20-year-old Harvard student, after his grandfather passed the title on to him and not his father, Prince Aly Khan, who was once married to the American actress Rita Hayworth. Despite the Aga Khan's immense wealth, the imam shuns the title of ""philanthropist"" because he feels that the Aga Khan Foundation is part of his mandate as a religious leader. His teachings also stress respecting other cultures and faiths, Vastani said. ""There's not enough education on both sides, and we're living in such a global place now, so learning about each other is important,"" she said. ""That's the way the Ismaili community views it."" Dr. Liyakat Takim, who teaches Islamic studies at the University of Denver, said it is not the Aga Khan's wealthy lifestyle that draws the most criticism from fellow Muslims but his authority to interpret the Quran for Ismaili Muslims. ""Ismailis see him as the final authority in today's world,"" Takim said. ""His word is law."" That means as a spiritual leader, the Aga Khan ""is able to reinterpret"" the teachings of Islam and has the authority to ""nullify or supersede religious practices."" ""That would include things like daily prayers,"" Takim said. ""Ismailis see themselves firmly within the Islamic tradition but of course other Muslims have problems with that."" But for many Ismailis, the Aga Khan's role transcends that of spiritual leader. Those who feel that way include Zarifmo Aslamshoyeva, who credits his foundation with saving her life, as well as the lives of her husband and their two children. Now an editor with CNN in Atlanta, Aslamshoyeva saw her life as a television news anchor in her native Tajikistan came crashing down after the collapse of the Soviet Union sparked a civil war in her country in 1992. Aslamshoyeva lived in the remote, mountainous Pamir region of Tajikistan, isolated from the aid that flooded in following a lull in the fighting. ""There was aid in the capital and in the surroundings, but they could not reach us in the mountains,"" she said. Pamir residents normally stockpile food for the harsh winters, but nearly everyone ran out of food in the middle of winter partly due to an influx of refugees fleeing the fighting in the capital, Dushanbe. ""At home, there was no electricity, no food. I would just sit there and look at my children,"" she said. Their faces were pale and thin. Without any paychecks from Moscow, many people were forced to beg on the streets. ""By then, who cares if you have an education or if you are a doctor or journalist? We all had nothing, and we were worried about our children."" It felt like the world had forgotten about her small region and their suffering, she said. ""Pamir was just a little tiny place,"" she said. ""People know Tajikistan but not Pamir."" Despite intermittent power, television remained the only way to communicate. She says her life changed on the day she was called in to the tiny TV station to read an announcement telling residents that food from the Aga Khan Foundation had finally arrived in Pamir. ""I never heard of the Aga Khan Foundation, but I had heard of the Aga Khan,"" she said. Her grandmother had spoken of ""the imam"" in hushed tones during the Communist period. Since that day, Aslamshoyeva said, aid began pouring in, changing her life forever. ""He helped everyone who lived in Tajikistan: Russians, Germans, Jews,"" she said. ""It didn't matter what religion you were."" E-mail to a friend .","Aga Khan is spiritual leader of 20 million Ismaili Muslims around world .

"(CNN) -- There's no evidence the heated political environment played any role in the shooting spree that left Rep. Gabrielle Giffords in critical condition and killed six others, but observers say if nothing else, the tragedy will force politicians to re-evaluate their rhetoric. Militant-themed messages and speeches laced with fear have marked recent dialogue in Washington and on the campaign trail, but in the aftermath of the massacre in Arizona, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are calling on their colleagues to tone it down. ""An event like this really ought to make us rethink the way we speak to each other every day about politics and policy in the country, especially in the Congress,"" said Thomas Benson, professor of rhetoric at Penn State University. The night before Saturday's shooting in Tucson, Arizona, Giffords issued a new call for more civility in politics. She sent an e-mail to outgoing Kentucky Secretary of State Trey Grayson, a Republican, that included a remark about the need to ""tone our rhetoric and partisanship down."" Giffords e-mail: Need to 'tone our rhetoric and partisanship down' The suspected shooter's motive is unclear, but Pima County, Arizona, Sheriff Clarence Dupnik was quick to criticize the ""vitriolic rhetoric"" heard on the radio and television. ""That may be free speech, but it's not without consequences,"" he said Saturday. Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin's political aide removed a controversial Web post this weekend that featured cross hairs over the congressional districts of 20 Democratic candidates, including Giffords. A Palin aide denied the Web posting from the 2010 congressional campaign was designed to incite violence. Adviser: Linking Palin to shootings 'appalling' Florida conservative radio host Joyce Kauffman took heat after remarking at a Tea Party rally, ""If ballots don't work, bullets will."" Biting language has also come from those on the left, with Democrats and President Obama pegging Republicans as""hostage takers."" Despite all the nastiness, Richard Vatz, professor of political communication at Towson University in Maryland, said the notion that the rhetoric caused the violence is ""fallacious."" That connection, he said, is born out of recognition that such violent incidents can't be eradicated. ""The motive I think is the frustration that a congresswoman can be shot and that a judge can be killed and that an utterly innocent little girl can be killed and we can't preventatively stop these matters. The frustration is that we cannot stop this,"" Vatz said. Poll: Charged speech not to blame for Arizona attacks . David Gergen, a senior political analyst for CNN, said that until the gunman's motive is clear, pointing fingers ""only contributes to what we must end in America: a toxic political environment."" ""This is not a moment to point fingers and make accusations. But it is a time to pray for the victims -- and to pledge to each other that we will struggle for a more civil and decent America,"" he wrote in a commentary on CNN.com. Despite the disconnect between cause and effect, Vatz said he predicts there will be a softening of the tone on Capitol Hill as Congress returns to business as usual. ""There will be an effort to avoid incendiary rhetoric. But as to whether that will have any effect in a macro sense on nationwide violence, I think it will not,"" he said. Before the shooting at the Arizona political meet-and-greet, House lawmakers were preparing to vote on the repeal of the health care legislation this week. The debate leading up to the passage of the Democrats' health care plan was bitterly partisan, and the attempt to repeal the legislation was expected to be equally volatile. The House of Representatives instead decided to postpone all legislation scheduled for this week, replacing the health care vote with a resolution to honor the victims of the tragedy. The question remains whether Congress will be able to take up such an emotional and divisive issue without the negativity that surrounded the debate last year. House action postponed . ""It isn't just a question of heated rhetoric. Of course, we are going to have heated rhetoric,"" said Benson, the Penn State professor, ""but even with extreme partisanship there can be and needs to be civility."" Vatz said an avoidance of the more incendiary language could last ""as long as the sensitivity to the possibility of a connection between violence and language is around."" ""But I think it will have diminishing returns. I think eventually the language will ratchet up again,"" he said. Benson said that while the impact of words is difficult to measure, language can create an atmosphere, evoke emotion and drive people apart. ""Rhetoric can definitely have severe consequences or we wouldn't employ it,"" he said.","Militant-themed messages and speeches laced with fear mark political dialogue .
Lawmakers on both sides of aisle call on colleagues to tone it down .
The notion that rhetoric caused the violence is ""fallacious,"" professor says .
Health care debate looms again in House; it could be volatile ."
"(CNN) -- All this excitement over recent Russian public diplomacy on Syria is a bit odd to those of us who have been following that diplomacy strategy for over a decade. That Vladimir Putin chose to write an op-ed in The New York Times this week is not at all shocking. It is part of a broader pattern of Russian outreach that began in 2001. What confuses people about Russian public diplomacy is that it often veers from a closed fist approach to an open handshake depending on its narrow objective -- all the while testing America as it seeks to build its own popularity around the world. Since the end of the 1990s the Russians have been aware that America and other nations see a weakened former Soviet empire behaving badly in the world, and they have sought to correct that perception beginning with the hiring of an American public relations firm back in 2006, which generated interest at the time. For years the Russians have worried about how they are portrayed in American media, about Hollywood's depiction of Russians as mobsters and thugs, for example. Scholars of Russia have written often about Russia's near-obsession with its place in the world, including a fixation on polls -- like Gallup's -- about Russia's popularity with the outside world. Over the years, Russian officials have looked for opportunities in the media to portray Russia as helpful and constructive -- even when it was not. They attempted to use Russian television, and later the Internet, to brandish a better image in the West -- creating a news agency, RIA (The Russian Agency for International Information) which operates 80 news bureaus around the world and Russia Today which boasts a following of 630 million people in over 100 countries. The Russians are also fans of inserting newspaper supplements of Russia Today in American newspapers just to remind readers of their relevance. Let's face it. Russia remains relevant but its image in the world has suffered throughout the last decade, for good reason. Think of some of the recent events: the conflict Russia had in 2008 with its southern neighbor, Georgia, over the disputed territory of South Ossetia. Then there was the feud with Ukraine in 2009 which resulted in Russia cutting off gas to Ukraine. There was a series of international corruption scandals around a Russian oil firm, Gazprom, including accounting charges involving U.S. financial firms. One cannot, of course, forget the Magnitsky case which emanated from the arrest, and subsequent death in custody of a Russian lawyer who became a whistle-blower about human rights. That case led to a feud with the United States, congressional sanctions, and the release of a list in April of Russian individuals not allowed into America. Add to that the Russian imprisonment of a feminist punk rock group -- Pussy Riot -- for daring to protest against the Russian government. Oh, and let's not forget Russia's hosting of NSA leaker Edward Snowden. Russia often finds itself in the odd situation of doing negative things and trying to get positive press. It cracks down on dissidents one day but then bids for the Olympics the next. It woos the United States and then bashes it. And then its leader writes an op-ed. Writing op-eds in American newspapers is not new for the Russians. A good example comes from three years ago. In March 2009, on the eve of a G-20 meeting with President Obama, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev wrote an op-ed in the Washington Post, telegraphing a new U.S.-Russian relationship based on the concept of mutual interests. He cleverly invoked the writing of the French philosopher, Alexis de Tocqueville, author of ""Democracy in America."" In the op-ed the Russian president predicted ""a great future for our two nations,"" adding that ""So far, each country has tried to prove the truth of those words to itself and the world by acting on its own. I firmly believe that at this turn of history, we should work together."" What is worth remembering is that the Russians don't mind twists and ""turns of history"" -- and they don't mind a bit of confusion about whether or not they are good guys or bad. This op-ed in The New York Times has generated both outrage and curiosity -- with some predictable criticism by the anti-Russia crowd on Capitol Hill, who believe America will be duped. For Americans, there is something emotional about Russia. It inevitably evokes fear and fascination in the United States and the West perhaps because of its long and complex history, its culture, and memories of Cold War days when so much time, effort and money was spent defending ourselves against the Soviet Union. Russia's latest attempt to win hearts and minds is intriguing and is likely to be effective if the result is some kind of interim deal over chemical weapons. A positive step by Syria, at the urging of Moscow, to acknowledge its chemical stockpiles and surrender even a portion of them would be a good development -- and Russia will claim credit for saving the day. If the diplomacy fails, and the U.S. decides to strike Syria, Russia will lay the blame for any damage on America. So either way, the gamble makes sense from Putin's view. As for the United States, we have no choice but to take Russia up on the offer to press the Syrians to relinquish control over the weapons. Americans like peaceful solutions and we certainly should test the proposition with Russia. But while we are diplomatically dueling with Russia, we must remain mindful of their public diplomacy strategies, watch closely as they maneuver and, in the end, do what is in our own national security interest.

"(CNN) -- Winter-weary residents in the Great Plains are bracing for yet another blow this week, compliments of a system that spent Sunday pounding those in and around Denver with high winds and heavy snow. The Colorado capital had already gotten over 8 inches of snow by 5:30 p.m. MT (7:30 p.m. ET). The snow socked the city's main airport, where more than 200 of 1,500 flights had been canceled and other travelers faced average delays of more than 4 hours on Sunday night, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. Even more snow had fallen in other places, including 19 inches in Jefferson, about 70 miles southwest of Denver. By Sunday night, the worst was over for much of Colorado, though not for points east, which are expected to be hammered to start the workweek. That includes several Plains states, which are already reeling from a dizzying few days of harsh winter weather. Last Thursday, for instance, a storm dumped up to 22 inches of snow on parts of Kansas. Two days later, Teresa Moore said her street in Kansas City, Kansas, still hadn't been plowed, making it impossible for her to take her husband to his doctor's appointments or visit her son at the hospital. ""If we have an emergency or a fire, the rescue can't come down here. So what are we to do,"" Moore told CNN affiliate KCTV. ""... It just doesn't make any sense."" She got some relief when plow trucks finally hit the roads around her home later Saturday, but it won't last long. That city is expecting 9 to 15 inches of snow Monday night into Tuesday. Forecasters have upped their predictions for the amount of snow expected in northwest Oklahoma to 8 to 10 inches, with 15 inches in spots. This may be a shock to some, given that temperatures in places reached the mid-60s on Sunday. ""May see 4-6 foot drifts!"" wrote National Weather Service meteorologist Rick Smith on Twitter. ""Traveling is beyond discouraged!"" Such forecasts raised alarms throughout the Plains, leading to crowded stores as residents prepared for the storm. Amanda Roberts, an entrepreneur and blogger in Warrensburg, Missouri, was one of them. Writing on Twitter, she said she made out well in her preparations. ""The snow has everyone stocking up on groceries,"" she said. ""Fresh produce is basically gone but i got the last gallon of chocolate milk. I call it a win."" Record-setting February . Kansas City International Airport set a February 21 record of 9 inches of snow, 4 more inches than the amount that fell the same date in 2010. Monday might bring 6 to 10 more inches, forecasters said. Kansas City is approaching its February snowfall record of 20.7 inches, set in 1960. The state of Kansas is also still digging out in many places. Wichita saw its second-highest storm snowfall total on record last week with 14.2 inches over two days, the National Weather Service said. The town of Russell in the state's middle lay under a 22-inch layer of white by the time the storm roared by. Silver lining . The snowstorm turned out to be a welcome one to many Kansans and many others throughout the Great Plains, who have been suffering a drought for a third straight year. Kansas, Nebraska, Iowa, Missouri and a host of other farm-heavy states have seen crop losses as a result. The Kansas Department of Agriculture expects those conditions to continue into April, but near-record levels of snowfall will ease the problem and could help the drought end faster. ""It snows so infrequently here. Now we've been in a really bad drought for several years; really, really hot summers and just no moisture. So we're thrilled to see snow or ice -- whatever moisture we can get,"" Wichita resident Kristen Woodburn said. Ranchers embraced the storm, even though bitter cold snow can be deadly during calving season. Frank Harper, a Kansas rancher from Sedgwick and the immediate past president of the Kansas Livestock Association, said the storm caused more work for him because he had to bring his calves inside to warm them up. But he called the snowstorm a blessing for bringing good moisture to the winter wheat. Rain, flooding the issue in Southeast . While millions will see snow -- including Chicago, where 3 to 5 inches of snow and sleet are expected Tuesday -- rain may rule for the next few days in parts of the Southeast. Mobile, Alabama, on the Gulf Coast, had overcast skies and a temperature of 68 degrees at 5 p.m. CT Sunday. But within a few hours and through Monday night, residents there can expect heavy rains and wind gusts as strong as 30 mph. The rain is part of a band affecting five Southeastern states where flash flood watches are in effect from Monday afternoon through Tuesday morning. Some areas from Louisiana to South Carolina could see up to 4 inches of rain. CNN's Judson Jones and Steve Almasy contributed to this report.","NEW: Denver gets over 8 inches of snow, but worst appears to be over .

"(CNN) -- Police deaths in Afghanistan have doubled this year after NATO forces handed over security responsibility to poorly equipped and poorly trained local security forces. The country's new Interior Minister, Mohammad Omar Daudzai, said that 1,792 Afghan policemen had lost their lives and more than 2,500 had been injured since March. That's double the number of a year ago. Roadside bombs planted by the Taliban and other insurgent groups inflict the most damage, according to Daudzai. Afghan, NATO troops repel Taliban attack on U.S. base near Pakistan . Local police suffer because they lack modern weapons, armored vehicles and adequate training, he said. The security forces remain dependent on NATO air support during their operations. On the front lines, the frustration is obvious. Security forces need better equipment. ""My job is to save the lives of my people,"" said Abdullah Khan, who mans a checkpoint in the city of Jalalabad. ""That is not possible with a few AK-47 guns and the soft-skin Ford Ranger vehicle that I have."" He said it doesn't help that most of his officers are illiterate. The situation illustrates the difficulties local forces face as NATO and American troops largely exit the county by the end of 2014. The plan is to withdraw all combat troops but keep a residual force in the country to help train Afghans and carry out counterterrorism operations when needed.

"(CNN) -- Muslim and moderate.Two words that describe Bangladesh, where Hillary Clinton arrived Saturday as part of a three-nation tour of Asia. She left China where diplomatic drama over a Chinese human rights activist overshadowed all else and stepped foot in Bangladesh amid political turmoil involving the disappearance of a key opposition leader. Her presence, the first by a secretary of state since 2003, reflects America's interest in growing ties with Asian nations and puts Bangladesh, one of the world's most impoverished nations strategically located near India, China and Myanmar, on center stage. Cinton's trip, said a senior State Department official, is an opportunity to improve America's bilateral relationship with Bangladesh, a democratic Muslim-majority nation that is seen by Washington as a viable alternative to extremism. It's a bilateral relationship that was initially troubled because of U.S. support for Pakistan in Bangladesh's war of independence, won in 1971. But ties between the two nations have improved considerably and the United States is now Bangladesh's largest trading partner. Clinton will meet with Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and Foreign Minister Dipu Moni, and is expected to stress the importance of democratic institutions and ways to improve conditions for the 160 million Bangladeshis who live in a country the size of Iowa. Washington sees Bangladesh, the world's largest contributor of personnel to U.N. peacekeeping forces, as a willing partner on counterterrorism and global security, the State Department official said. Clinton will discuss development issues with micro-credit guru and Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus and Fazle Hasan Abed, the founder of BRAC, a large non-profit that works to alleviate poverty. Clinton will also meet with Khaleda Zia, leader of the opposition Bangladesh National Party (BNP) amid considerable political tension. Zia's party and the ruling Awami League have accused each other in the abduction of key BNP lawmaker Ilyas Ali. The disappearance has sparked rallies and strikes that have led to deaths of at least four people, according to Amnesty International. Ali's disappearance is the latest in a spate of disappearances in which security forces have been implicated, although they deny detaining those missing, Amnesty said. More than 20 people have ""disappeared"" in Bangladesh this year, the global monitoring group said. Clinton is visiting Bangladesh 12 years after her husband, Bill Clinton, did so as the first U.S. president to make such a trip. Hillary Clinton goes next to neighboring India, where she is scheduled to stop in Kolkata, near the Bangladeshi border, and New Delhi. There, she will meet with the feisty chief minister, Mamata Bannerji, who dismantled 34 years of communism in last year's West Bengal state elections but is very much opposed to allowing large foreign retailers like Wal-Mart in India. Ironically, Clinton's visit to New Delhi coincides with that of an Iranian trade delegation that is looking for ways to circumvent tough U.S. sanctions that have proven crippling to the economy of the Islamic republic.","Washington sees Bangladesh as a viable alternative to extremism .

"(CNN) -- The small, black-and-white newspaper ad offered a discount: Nine holes of golf for $9.11 -- on September 11. The management of a Wisconsin golf course said the idea was to remember the victims of the September 11, 2001, attacks, but the ad turned into a public relations disaster on social media. By Tuesday, TumbleDown Trails Golf Course was reporting death threats. The golf course in Verona, Wisconsin, placed an advertisement in Monday's Wisconsin State Journal offering to ""commemorate"" the 12th anniversary of the terror attacks with ""9 holes with cart for only $9.11 per person or 18 holes with cart for only $19.11!"" The ad quickly began circulating on social media, and the golf course's Facebook page was flooded with angry comments. ""It's an abomination and a disgrace,"" one commenter wrote. ""To make an opportunity out of a national tragedy is outrageous,"" another said. The management of the course posted an apology on Facebook Tuesday and on a recorded message on the course's main phone line. ""Please accept our sincere apologies,"" the recording said. ""Our attempt to remember the tragedy of that day has been met with negativity and now even death threats. We ask that you please take a moment to reflect and remember those we lost that day, as we were trying to do."" By Tuesday afternoon, many Facebook commenters were defending the course. Some called the ad an honest mistake, and some said outsiders were pumping up the outrage. ""They shouldn't have to apologize for anything! Who are you people to judge,"" one commenter wrote. ""I've played the course before. Nice staff and seem like good people."" Another called the ad ""badly worded, ill thought out"" but added, ""I'm not any more offended than I have been throughout the years every time I see a 9/11 limited edition coin on TV or exploding towers with an eagle crying on a T-shirt or ... the hundreds of others exploiting a tragedy for profit."" A message left on the course's voice mail was not returned Tuesday. Management said in a Facebook post the course may be closed Wednesday because of security concerns.","Social media erupts after course offers discount to ""commemorate"" terror attacks .

"London (CNN) -- With her glossy dark hair, exotic outfit and ruby-red pouting lips, she's every inch the classic pin-up... except, that is, for that greenish-blue skin. And yet her image was every bit as popular, in its day, as those of the latest Hollywood starlets. She is the ""Chinese Girl,"" by Vladimir Tretchikoff, the Russian-born South African who became king of the kitsch portrait. In the 1950s and '60s, no self-respecting suburban home was fit to be seen without a print of her on the living room wall. At one point, the picture was reputed to be the most reproduced image in the world; on Wednesday, the original sold for almost $1.5 million (ÃÂ£982,050) at Bonhams auction house in London, far outstripping pre-sale estimates of $750,000. Speaking to CNN before the auction, Giles Peppiatt, director of South African art Bonhams said that the picture's kitschy popular appeal ""isn't necessarily a bad thing."" ""It is an extraordinary image... and it certainly seems to have caught everyone's eye. It is, I suppose, the 'Mona Lisa' of kitsch, but it is a great work of art as well."" Tretchikoff's biographer, Boris Gorelik, says the picture was ""one of the most important pop culture icons"" of the mid-20th century; Peppiatt agrees, ""the word iconic is so often-used and almost debased now, but this really is an iconic image."" The painter himself wrote that ""my heart and soul went into this painting,"" and whatever the secret, it was certainly a success. ""Millions of people -- perhaps your parents or grandparents -- bought a lithograph of the painting, hung it on their wall and admired it for years, if not decades,"" wrote Gorelik. ""Maybe you even grew up looking at it."" While cheap copies of the picture flooded the globe, the original disappeared from view: Taken to the U.S. by Tretchikoff for a hugely successful tour in the 1950s, it was bought by a young fan, and hung in the family home, a world away from the art scene's latest fads and fashions. The identity of the model for ""Chinese Girl"" was a mystery for decades, too. After she was eventually identified three years ago, CNN visited Monika Pon at home in Johannesburg. Now in her 70s, she explained how, as a teenager, she came to pose for the painting. ""My uncle had a laundry and I worked in the office. Tretchikoff used to pop in there every second week or so. He said to me, 'Hello... I'm Tretchikoff... I would like to paint you, would you like to sit for me?"" But she said that although her image went on to feature in the homes of thousands of people around the world, modeling for the picture -- for which she was paid about $10 -- did little to change her life, much of which was spent in poverty during the Apartheid era. ""He wasn't famous. People hardly knew him,"" she said, adding that she was no fan of the finished work: ""Ugh, green face... Why is my face green?"" Cabaret artist Tricity Vogue, whose entire stage show is based on the ""Blue Lady"" of Tretchikoff's painting, said it was a ""dream come true"" to come face-to-face with her muse in London this week, ahead of the sale. ""She's been a constant in my life for so many years, but I didn't think I would ever get to see her in person,"" she told CNN. ""When I was doing my research, I read that she was lost, possibly even destroyed."" Peppiatt said the first version of ""Chinese Girl"" was indeed believed to have been ruined -- possibly by one of his enemies on the South African art scene, a world which disapproved of his decision to sell paintings through department stores, rather than galleries. ""Tretchikoff had a lot of antagonism towards him... and just before he set off to the U.S., a lot of his paintings were slashed. One of them was the 'Chinese Girl.' ""He repainted a new version of it, and this is... the famous version, the one from which all the prints were made, and the one everyone knows. The first one, no-one even knows what it looked like."" Several other, lesser-known Tretchikoff pieces, including ""Balinese Dancer"" and ""Lady with Crayfish"" are also set to go under the hammer in the sale. There has been a massive renewal of interest in the artist's work since a major retrospective of his work at the South African National Gallery two years ago -- the first time ""Chinese Girl"" had been seen in public since its sale some 60 years before. ""Prior to that, he was perhaps regarded as a bit of a joke,"" Peppiatt said, but the show ""brought him back into the mainstream"" and meant he could take his place alongside other international artists. ""Art is so subjective,"" he explained. ""Some people love it, some people loathe it, but that would be the same of any work of art, be it a Van Gogh, a Titian or a Tretchikoff."" Whether the artist deserves to be mentioned in the same sentence as the long-time stars of the art world is a matter of personal taste, but the sale of ""Chinese Girl"" appears to have cemented his reputation as a commercial, if not critical, success.","'Chinese Girl' by Russian-South African artist Vladimir Tretchikoff sells for $1.5m .

"(CNN) -- Rory McIlroy says he needs to cut out his ""stupid mistakes"" if he is rediscover his form ahead of the Masters at Augusta in two weeks' time. The 23-year-old lost the world no.1 spot to Tiger Woods this week and is still searching for his first tournament win in 2013 . Woods, a 14-time major winner, climbed back to the top of the rankings with victory at the Arnold Palmer Invitational at Bay Hill, Florida on Sunday. In a friendly text message, the American challenged McIlroy to respond at the Houston Open tournament which began on Thursday at the Redstone Golf Club, Texas. But it was a difficult first round for McIlory who carded a one-over-par round of 73 to leave him in danger of missing the cut unless he improves over the next 18 holes. The 2012 PGA Champion bogeyed the par-four second before needing seven strokes to sink the par-five eighth hole. ""Stupid mistakes, silly bogeys"" The back nine was a happier hunting ground for McIlory as he mixed four birdies with two bogeys but when he was asked in Houston what he needed to do to improve he said: ""I'm not too sure. ""I think if I just eliminate the stupid mistakes and the silly bogeys then I feel like I'm playing OK and hitting the ball well."" McIlroy's slump in form has been linked to his switch to Nike equipment this year in a deal reported to be worth $250m. The 23-year-old indicated that he was still not comfortable with his competitive game. ""I'm still maybe a bit tentative out there on the golf course,"" he added. ""I'm not committing to my shots fully. ""Hopefully another three rounds this weekend and some good scores will give me confidence going into the Masters."" American D.A Points held a one-shot lead over compatriots Cameron Tringale and John Rollins after finishing on eight under for the day in Houston. Points revealed he was using a refurbished version of his Mom's putter that he had borrowed from her golf bag when he was a teenager.","Rory McIlroy wants to cut out ""stupid mistakes"" before Masters .

"Washington (CNN) -- It might not really matter if President Barack Obama made his case on Syria to the American people. He didn't really ask them for anything in his televised address but to sit tight and watch the graphic videos of chemical weapons on YouTube as the surprise diplomatic track he's now chosen plays out. The question now for Americans on Syria -- rather than whether the United States should launch military strikes after the regime of Bashar al-Assad used chemical weapons on his own people -- is who they think is a better negotiating partner for Obama: Congress or Vladimir Putin? ""All eyes are on the Russian president -- President Putin,"" Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said on Wednesday. ""We all know that he was former head of the KGB. We all know about the KGB. He is president of that very big country and we are all so grateful that even though relations aren't perfect with Russia they are OK."" All eyes turn to U.S.-Russia talks . There probably aren't many people in Washington who would use ""OK"" to describe Obama's relationship with Congress. Whether getting on this diplomatic track was a good idea or not probably has a lot to do with how you view the president and his leadership style already. It's a bit more complicated than a simple choice of who he'd rather negotiate with, but Obama essentially chose Putin. A brief flirtation with Congress suggested lawmakers were more than willing to reject a president's request for the use of force for the first time in recent memory. On the one hand, after going from an imminent strike to seeking congressional authorization to taking a diplomatic route, critics have described him as being about as indecisive as an American president can be. On the other, the Russians and Syrians are at the negotiating table and Syria has promised to join the Chemical Weapons Convention. That's something he tangibly achieved without dropping bombs. 5 questions: Did Obama answer them? How he got there was messy. That's the word his own staffer used. ""Messy is fine. Messy means progress,"" an administration official told CNN's John King as the diplomatic solution was presenting itself. Whether the solution actually pans out remains anyone's guess. But that's OK with most lawmakers, many of whom didn't really want to vote on Syria anyway. Even an unsure diplomatic solution is better than a military one for war-weary members of Congress. ""We do have to keep in mind an imperfect application of the Russian proposal is better than anything we can accomplish through the (president's military plan),"" said Rep. Brad Sherman, D-California, in a speech on the House floor on Wednesday. Sen. Bob Corker, the Tennessee Republican who favored giving the president authority to launch military strikes, told CNN's Dana Bash that the president is making it hard for Congress to work with him on just about anything. ""The president just seems to be very uncomfortable with being commander in chief of this nation,"" Corker said, although he added that he hopes the new diplomatic track pans out. ""He just can't follow through,"" said Corker, who was clearly frustrated that the president hadn't made a stronger argument to the nation that when an American president draws a red line, no country should be able to cross it without repercussions. Obama will need senators like Corker to work with him now that Syria has been paused on Capitol Hill. Given Americans' continued focus on the economy, this president may be judged more for how he handles the looming two-headed fiscal dragon of government funding and debt ceiling authority. Those issues will fester over the next two weeks until government funding runs out October 1 and the debt limit is reached as soon as October 18. On those matters, he's not going to get any help from Putin. He must figure out how to work with Congress.","Who is a better negotiating partner for Obama -- Congress or Putin?

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Got a problem with your dishwasher? Does your oven not work? Is the toy you bought defective? Well, you're not alone, according to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission. The CPSC has released a summary of its Top 10 product categories which consumers have most often complained about online in the past year. Since last March, the top five most frequently reported product types are electric ranges/ovens, dishwashers, footwear, refrigerators and microwave ovens. Appliances accounted for one out of every three complaints. ""We are looking for patterns,"" said Patty Davis, CPSC spokesperson. ""Random complaints, taken together, help us piece together the puzzle. It enables us to act more quickly to get dangerous, defective products off the market,"" Davis said. The CPSC says public website complaints about a harmful product or risk have led to recalls. The safety commission announced a voluntary recall last year involving the Disney Princess Plastic Racing Trikes after children reportedly were hurt. About 9,000 trikes were sold in the U.S. and 700 in Canada. ""The plastic castle display and the princess figures protruding from the top of the handlebar pose a laceration hazard if a child falls on it,"" said the CPSC in a news release. In December 2011, consumers were urged to stop using a specific ice cream dipper after the distributor, The Pampered Chef, based in Illinois, received reports of personal injuries including lacerations, bruises and redness caused by caps coming off the base of the handle. A voluntary recall was issued for about 20,000 dippers. The CPSC says it has received from consumers and manufacturers an average of 600 reports each month at SaferProducts.gov or about 7,000 incidents since the publicly available website began a year ago. Nursery equipment tallied more than 8% of the online complaints, with toys and shoes each receiving 4.5%. Consumers can use the online tool to look for safety information about products they own or may be thinking about buying as well as read reports that others have submitted along with comments from manufacturers. ""This product incident website ... is empowering those who use it,"" said CPSC Chairman Inez Tenenbaum in a statement marking National Consumer Protection Week. The bottom five Top-10 categories on the list are complaints about heating and air conditioning units, indoor lighting, cookware, laundry and a tie for bedroom bedding, furniture and grills. The Commission points out on its website it does not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or adequacy of the contents of SaferProducts.gov, ""particularly with respect to information submitted by people outside CPSC.""","Consumer Protection Safety Commission released Top 10 product consumer complaint categories .

"(CNN) -- House Speaker John Boehner and the President Barack Obama continue to play chicken. Boehner has indicated that unless the president sits down and negotiates some spending cuts or changes in the Affordable Care Act, there will be no budget or debt ceiling increase. President Barack Obama refuses to negotiate until after a ""clean"" budget is passed by the House and there is an unconditional debt ceiling increase. Boehner complains that the president is willing to negotiate with Iran without any preconditions, why not the House Republicans? The president responds by saying as a matter of principle he will not allow the House Republicans to hold as hostage the U.S. economy by using the budget and debt ceiling as leverage in negotiations. The president emphasizes that he is willing to negotiate, but first Congress must enact a budget and debt ceiling increase. Boehner responds by claiming that this is the same as offering to negotiate a cease-fire with Republicans only after they first surrender and lay down their arms. This is a costly and dangerous game. Each day there is no national budget many services are not available, parks and monuments remain closed, and thousands of federal employees are on furlough. A failure to raise the debt ceiling is much more serious. If the United State defaults on its debt risks, catastrophic effects on our economy would follow: It would jeopardize the government's ability to borrow on favorable terms and would lead to higher interest rates; it would disrupt international credit markets and might well plunge the United States into another recession. In my last book ""Bargaining with the Devil: When to Negotiate, When to Fight,"" I address the question: When you are locked in the hardest sorts of conflicts -- those with an adversary whom you don't trust, who has hurt you in the past and may hurt you in the future, whom you may even think is evil -- how do you decide whether to negotiate? Some in my field claim you should always choose to negotiate. After all, you can only make peace with your enemies. Without sitting down and discussing things, how will you ever figure out whether there might be a solution that better serves your own interests than fighting it out? Others, pointing to the Faustian legend, argue that you should never negotiate with the devil. To do so risks soiling your soul and giving up what is most important to you. I reject both categorical claims. The challenge is to make a wise decision in a particular context by carefully weighing the costs and benefits of alternative courses of action. Here, wisdom requires the president to negotiate, but to do so without sacrificing his most important interests. If the president persists in his refusal even to explore with Boehner what deals might be possible, Boehner may be the first to blink. That would be a clear victory for the president and a clear loss for the Republicans. But what if the speaker, no doubt fearful he will lose his job as speaker if he blinks, refuses to relent? When our national economy falls over the proverbial cliff, the Republicans may be blamed more. But the president's legacy will be seriously damaged as well. Both Boehner and the president should try to reach a deal that has face-saving elements for both, one that is not a clear loss for either. Better still would be a deal that might allow both to claim victory and be good for the country to boot. Such a deal is possible. It would involve two critical elements. 1. The House and Senate should pass a ""clean"" budget bill and a ""clean"" debt extension -- i.e., ones that do not themselves have provisions jeopardizing the Affordable Care Act or federal entitlements. 2. As this legislation is being enacted, the president and speaker should jointly announce in a press conference the creation of a bipartisan commission that within six months will submit to both houses for an up or down vote a combination of tax and entitlement reforms that over the next eight years will address the long-term deficit problems. In other words the two elements should occur simultaneously. This arrangement would allow both Boehner and the president to declare victory. How can this happen? The discussions leading to the deal must be kept private. Both leaders have constituents who would object to it, and who would claim their leader sold out for too little. Many Democrats oppose any entitlement reform. No doubt tea party Republicans will claim that Boehner would be giving up the leverage of the debt ceiling without any specific spending cuts being enacted. Making sure that House Majority Leader Eric Cantor supports the deal is important; Boehner wants to keep his job. With Cantor's support, Boehner can be confident that he will remain speaker. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Robert Mnookin.","Robert Mnookin: Boehner, Obama in dangerous game of chicken over debt celing.

He says a deal must save face. How? Congress must pass ""clean"" budget and debt bills .

"(CNN) -- Never has social media been so fin-tastic. Twitter is awash in the bloody aftermath of ""Sharknado"" -- the latest Syfy channel disaster flick, which made its bow Thursday night. The title says it all. It's the story of a menacing storm that spews hungry man eaters on Southern California. It's perfect fodder for the Twitterverse, where hashtag #Sharknado was a top trending topic early Friday. Judging from the crack, one-line reviews, the online commentary may be better than the movie itself. ""If youre looking for one dimensional characters, terribly inconstant lighting, & sharks getin thrown out of tornadoes I recommend #SharkNado,"" said filmmaker Brian Naughton. Hookjaw Rox added: ""We are SO fortunate to have this blessing to keep us entertained in between basketball and football season! #SharkNado #killme"" The feeding frenzy continues with Raven Brooks who said, ""Al Gore warned us about the #sharknado but you laughed at him."" Then there were the plot spoilers, although some seemed to take exception to the notion that there's an actual storyline. ""How did these people not notice the 4,000 foot waves coming to crash on them? #SharkNado,"" posted Jonnathan Ritland. But there was some practical advice as well. ""Ways to kill an airborne shark. Shotgun, revolver, chainsaw, knife, big stick, bomb, Car, fire, pickax, sudden stop,"" tweeted Mike'l Severe, an Omaha, Nebraska, sports talk show host. Then there's this classic debate. ""#SharkNado: Better with or without beer? Discuss. (Still trying to form an opinion here.),"" asks a post from Draft Magazine, an online publication for beer enthusiasts. Then there are the opportunistic . ""We survived the #Sharknado!"" Red Cross Oklahoma tweeted. ""Be prepared for real situations, though. Download #RedCross Tornado & First Aid apps."" Tornadoes in May and June claimed dozens of lives in central Oklahoma. Of course, Hollywood had to weigh in. ""Just pitched my script ""hurricanine"" to the producers of #Sharknado about a hurricane filled with pugs,"" tweeted actor/producer Kirk Fox. ""It's a very cute but deadly movie."" Actor Josh Gad suggested a time-traveling solution to the whole ""Sharknado"" phenomenon. ""If (Steven) Spielberg could go back in time and stop Jaws from happening to prevent 2013's #SharkNado, I believe he would."" Of course, there were some regrets. ""Can't believe I slept through a #SharkNado I didn't even get to use my new (umbrella)!"" lamented blogger Shanna Stephens. ""I probably shouldn't joke about this I heard lives were lost!"" Then there was the sublime, if not sarcastic. ""I thought life could not get any more complete and then I saw it,"" said a tweet from Lee J. And finally, nirvana. Thank you, Jessie Jessup. ""20 yrs from now kids will ask 'was there EVER a time when everybody laughed as one' & we can smile & tell them about the #sharknado of 2013,"" Still chasing reports that ""Sharknami"" will be the sequel.","#Sharknado blows up the Twitterverse .

"(CNN) -- The judge who will take over the case of a Florida man accused of shooting an unarmed teenager has high ratings from defense lawyers but isn't known as a ""soft touch,"" one Florida attorney said Wednesday. Seminole County Circuit Judge Kenneth Lester Jr. will start by presiding over a bond hearing for George Zimmerman on Friday. Lester was assigned the intensely scrutinized case Wednesday afternoon after the recusal of Judge Jessica Recksiedler, who had been asked to step aside by Zimmerman's lawyer. Bond hearing set for Friday; Recksiedler steps aside . ""He's a great judge,"" Orlando lawyer Diana Tennis told CNN sister network HLN. ""He's been on the bench a really long time. He's very no-nonsense. He's a real fast talker, very efficient, gets the cases in and out."" Tennis said Lester is ""not known as a soft touch"" but has a reputation for listening to both sides of a case. ""I would definitely not call him a huge friend to the defense particularly, but he's very fair if you go in and do the right thing,"" she said. Mike Snure, whose Winter Park law firm handles criminal and juvenile trials and appeals, said Lester's appointment is ""good fortune for both sides."" ""He's known to be friendly with all the people who appear before him, on both sides,"" Snure said. ""He's a lawyer's judge."" Snure, who said he has tried about 50 to 100 cases before Lester, said he has a professional relationship with the judge. They see each other only in the courtroom. ""Nobody thinks he's unfair,"" the attorney said. ""When both sides think the guy's fair, he's probably fair."" Referring to the defense and prosecution, Snure said, ""I don't think anyone went to bed tonight thinking, 'Boy, we got a break.' "" Lester has been a judge since 1996 and has previously handled juvenile, probate and mental health cases. A 2011 poll by the Central Florida Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers rated him the top judge in Seminole County for legal knowledge and diligence. He had the second-highest overall score among Seminole County circuit judges in that survey, which also ranked the jurists for impartiality, freedom from bias and demeanor. Lester has practiced law since 1980, after getting his legal education at the University of Florida. He and his wife have been married 29 years and have two children, and he teaches wrestling on the side, Seminole County court spokeswoman Michelle Kennedy said. He'll be in a national spotlight when he takes on the case of Zimmerman, who is charged with second-degree murder in the killing of Trayvon Martin. The 17-year-old was shot to death February 26 while walking through the Sanford, Florida, community where Zimmerman, 28, served as a neighborhood watch volunteer. Case divides city of Sanford . Martin was unarmed, but Zimmerman told police the teen was beating him. Sanford police decided not to immediately bring charges against Zimmerman, sparking protests and a furious debate about race, guns and a Florida law that allows residents to use deadly force in public without first retreating from a confrontation. Martin was African-American; Zimmerman is Hispanic. Zimmerman's lawyer, Mark O'Mara, had asked Recksiedler to step aside because her husband is a law partner of Mark NeJame, an Orlando lawyer and CNN legal analyst.

"ILULISSAT, Greenland (CNN) -- From the air, Greenland's ice sheet, the second largest on Earth, appears to be perfectly still. A boat sails by an iceberg floating in the Jacobshavn Bay near the town of Ilulissat, Greenland. But below the surface, the ice sheet is in constant motion, as ice built up in the interior pushes toward the coast in the form of massive glaciers. During warmer months, ice from these glaciers melts into the ocean. It's an age-old process that scientists say has sped up in recent decades because of global warming. The fear is that melting ice from Greenland and other Arctic areas could cause sea levels to rise enough to flood low-lying cities, such as Shanghai, China, and New York City, displacing millions of people in the process. A recent report from the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, made up of scientists from around the world, estimates the sea level rise by 2100 could be as much as 1Â½ feet. ""That sea level rise is only based on melt from ice sheets, and does not include a new fast flow of ice we have detected in Greenland that is generating additional icebergs,"" said Dr. Konrad Steffen, a climate scientist with the University of Colorado, Boulder.  Watch how greenhouse gases cause temperatures to rise Â» . Steffen estimates sea levels could rise three feet over the next century, a stark prediction that could wreak havoc around the world if it comes to pass. Greenland holds enough ice to cause sea levels to rise 23 feet if the entire ice sheet melted, a development few scientists expect to happen anytime soon. But global sea levels have been rising at the rate of three millimeters per year since 1993. For each of the past 17 years, Steffen has spent one month at a remote research site called Swiss Camp, located 300 miles north of the Arctic Circle in Greenland. He monitors the changing ice sheet through a network of global positioning systems and weather stations, which have recorded a dramatic rise in temperatures since the mid-1990s. ""When we came here in 1990, the first two, three years were actually colder than normal. Then in 1994, 1995, it started to warm steadily and since then, we've had a temperature increase during the winter months of 4.5 degrees centigrade, 8.1 degrees Fahrenheit, which is very large, the largest temperature increase on earth,"" he said. The rising temperatures feed what scientists call a ""positive feedback loop."" As the air warms, it melts ice on the sea and snow on land. This exposes more water and land to the sun. Those surfaces in turn absorb more of the sun's heat, leading to more snow melt and ice melt. ""When you look at our satellite analysis, we can see the melt area of Greenland over 30 years has increased by 30 percent,"" Steffen said. Despite all the changes in Greenland, this is not the first time temperatures have risen on the world's largest island. During the 1920s and 1930s, there was a significant warming trend that occurred without the level of man-made greenhouse gases recorded in our atmosphere today. The majority of scientists say greenhouse gases are the chief cause of global warming. The fact Greenland has warmed before leads some scientists to question how worried we should be about the current warming trend. Dr. Patrick Michaels, a climatologist, is part of a small group of climate change skeptics. He said Greenland's warm past didn't cause the ice sheet to disappear. ""Well, this happened for 50 years in the early 20th century, and it happened for a millennium after the end of the last ice age,"" he said. ""And the ice didn't shed off it."" But Dr. Jay Zwally, a climate scientist with NASA, said he thinks the latest trend is different. ""The current warming trend in Greenland is very extensive and is not likely to be explained by natural variability alone,"" he said. Zwally said the warming is consistent with scientific predictions about the effects of man-made greenhouse gases. Last year, satellite data collected by NASA scientists revealed Greenland is losing 100 billion tons of ice each year, more than it is gaining from snowfall in the interior. Steffen and others have also detected a new, faster movement of the ice sheet, causing the glaciers to dump more ice into the ocean, where it melts and contributes to sea-level rise. Part of this faster flow is caused by moulins, deep holes in the ice sheet that allow water to flow beneath the surface. ""During the summer months, as the ice sheet melts, large running rivers of melt water snake down through the ice, to the bedrock base below,"" Steffen said. Last year, researchers lowered a camera into a moulin to explore the depth and flow of the melt water. Once the melt water from the surface reaches the bedrock below the ice, it can lift the ice sheet and provide a layer of viscosity for the ice to move faster toward the sea, a process that could accelerate as Greenland continues to warm. Steffen hopes his prediction of a three-foot rise in global sea level by 2100 won't become a reality. But he warned that even if we are able to reduce the world's carbon output from cars and power plants, it will take a long time for Earth's climate to stop warming and seas to stop rising. ""Even if we reduce our carbon dioxide output, the climate will continue to warm,"" he said. ""So even by stopping the increase of carbon dioxide today, we will have a warming, we will have sea level increase.""

"(CNN) -- U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry is usually so careful not to expose his French connection -- his mother was born and educated in Paris and he speaks fluent French -- especially since this tie arguably cost him the U.S. presidency in 2004 when the nation was being vilified as ""cheese eating surrender monkeys"" by a conservative columnist. But Kerry's gushing praise for France, and in French, on Saturday during his visit to Paris, couldn't have been more dramatic. And revealing. France is indeed one of the very few world powers that seem ready to join the U.S. in a military strike on Syria's Assad regime, with or without U.N. backing. Since Britain ruled itself out from such intervention through a No vote in parliament on August 29, to the world's surprise and David Cameron's dismay, the U.S. and France have had to appear even more resolute and closer partners on the world stage than before. News emerged of lengthy phone conversations between Presidents FranÃÂ§ois Hollande and Barack Obama and one-to-one meetings at the G20 last Friday in St Petersburg, with David Cameron conspicuously sidelined. Sidelined and vexed. After it was reported that an adviser to Putin had dismissed the UK as this ""little island nobody listens to"", the British prime minister strangely felt compelled to justify his country's standing in an improvised and passionate tirade. ""Yes, we are a small island, in fact a small group of islands. But I would challenge anyone to come up with a country with a prouder history, with a bigger heart, a greater resilience. We are a country that's invented many of the things that are most worthwhile -- everything from the industrial revolution to the television to the worldwide web. ""If I go on too long about our literature, our art, our philosophy, our contribution - including the world's language -- if I start talking about this blessed plot, this sceptered isle, this England, I might have to put it to music."" So while Britain was busy licking its wounds, the U.S. and France were left to show up their unity and determination. Words were uttered such as ""France is our oldest ally"" (a historical fact but a hurtful truth to hear for the British, the U.S.'s most loyal ally), however, they didn't manage to hide the increasing discomfort felt by public opinions both in the U.S., France and the world at large. The British MPs had, probably despite themselves, opened a Pandora's Box, also called democracy. By conveying what they probably rightly think is the country's reluctance to engage in what appears as a vaguely-defined military intervention, British MPs did nothing more than to give a voice to their constituents' concerns. Disturbed by the British ""No"", President Obama, an isolationist at heart, decided to follow the British route and went on to seek Congress' approval, even though he constitutionally didn't need to. This, of course, has left Hollande in a tricky position. Here he is, forced to wait for American congressmen to decide on France's course of action -- not a happy position to be in when you are the president of a country which, despite its current Atlanticist foreign policy, has had a long tradition of independence. A debate over the question of Syria in French Parliament last Wednesday, granted by the president but without a vote, furthermore revealed how divided within itself France is. The French opposition demands that military action be pursued with a U.N. mandate. ""If Russia keeps blocking the Security Council over the issue, let Hollande convoke the General Assembly for an Emergency Special session. Under article 377, the general assembly can overrule the security council"" said former Sarkozy minister Jean-Louis Borloo. An argument to which French public opinion is very sensitive. So far though, despite the fact that 68% of the French oppose the participation of their country's troops in an intervention in Syria, FranÃÂ§ois Hollande has stood firm with strong words coming both from the ElysÃÂ©es Palace and France's foreign affairs minister Laurent Fabius. The French media has been visibly split as whether to support the president or warn him against an ill-advised adventure with probable repercussions against French interests at home and in the region. Many observers in France can't help thinking that Hollande seeks on the world stage the charisma and legitimacy that he lacks at home. The only time the French supported him massively since his election is when he launched a military intervention in Mali last year which, by all accounts, was a great success. A French diplomat recently confided: ""In Mali, Hollande walked on water. He wants to repeat the experience."" Except Syria is not Mali, nor is it Libya or Iraq. In 2003, France tried to convince its allies, the U.S. and Britain, that there was no ground to the Weapons of Mass Destruction's scare which so diligently triggered Iraq's invasion. The French Secret Intelligence services had indeed warned President Jacques Chirac that Saddam Hussein's arsenal could not attack Europe within 45 minutes as Tony Blair claimed before the British parliament. In a now historical speech at the U.N., on February 14, 2003, the then French Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin outlined France's position. Although applauded by the wider world community, France's statement was attacked by American Republicans with a violence that both astounded and saddened French opinion. Today, France is not more hawkish than in 2003. However, the shadow of the allies' painful rift may have played a part in President Hollande's current determination. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Agnes Poirier.","France is ready to join the U.S. in a military strike, writes Agnes Poirier .

"London (CNN) -- The landscape of German politics is changing. Angela Merkel has just been re-elected chancellor and is considered the country's most powerful female politician ever. And now, for the first time in its history, two black politicians are entering parliament. Charles Huber of Merkel's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and Karamba Diaby from the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD), were elected in this month's general election to Germany's parliament, the Bundestag. Huber, 56, is a television actor in Germany well-known for starring in the detective TV series ""Der Alte"" (""The Old Man"") for years. He was born in Munich to a Senegalese father and a German mother. Diaby, 51, was born in Senegal and gained German citizenship in 2001. After his election he told CNN: ""We are a country of diversity, people of all religions, ethnicities and skin colours live here, but it's time that this is being reflected in politics and public service. There is urgent need for action."" Angela Merkel's recipe for success . Diaby studied at university in Dakar: in 1986 he was awarded a scholarship and moved to Halle in former communist East Germany to undertake a doctorate in chemistry. ""German society is changing and there have been several positive developments,"" said Diaby. Measures he cited included the introduction of legislation to recognize degrees obtained abroad and the implementation of the Immigration Act in 2005, which opened up Germany to immigration. ""The language has also changed,"" Diaby said. ""We don't use the word 'foreigners' anymore, but now we say 'people with a migration background'."" Video: Immigration and integration in Germany . Diaby's first priority now that he is a lawmaker in the Bundestag is to tackle the issue of education to ensure that everyone in Germany, no matter what their ethnicity, skin colour or financial background, has access to good schooling. ""Educational success is very much dependent on how big the parents' wallet is,"" he said. He also wants to debate the introduction of dual citizenship as at the moment German citizens born to non-German nationals have to choose a citizenship before they turn 23. ""I hope that my candidacy will make a change and put an end to some prejudices,"" he said. In addition to the election of Germany's first two black lawmakers to the Bundestag, Merkel's party now also has its first Muslim lawmaker in the parliament, with Cemile Giousouf -- who was born in Germany to Turkish immigrant parents -- representing the city of Hagen in North-Rhine Westphalia. Muslim politicians have been elected to Germany's parliament in the past -- the first in 1994 -- but they have mainly represented the Social Democrats or the left-wing Die Linke. Multiculturalism is no failure . Out of the 630 seats in parliament, 34 -- or just over 5% -- are now taken by lawmakers with immigrant backgrounds, up from 21 in the previous term, Migration Media Service, a group that researches immigration in Germany, said in a statement. ""It's a positive development when the parliament is starting to reflect society,"" said Tanja Kiziak of the think-tank Berlin Institut, which researches demography and development. But it's still a way off from reflecting Germany's 81.9 million population as a whole: around 20% of people have immigrant roots, with a large majority of those from Turkey. ""The issue of integration is being discussed more and more, of course it's a controversial topic in society,"" said Kiziak, ""but at least now it's on the table.""","Charles Huber (CDU) and Karamba Diaby (SPD) are the first two black politicians in the Bundestag.

"(CNN) -- A policeman in China has been arrested after he allegedly hurled a baby to the ground, local officials say. The officer, Guo Zengxi, from the city of Linzhou in China's central Henan Province, was on his way to a karaoke bar after drinking with friends on the evening of July 20, state news agency Xinhua reported. When the off-duty officer came across a couple taking their 7-month-old daughter for an after-dinner walk, he reportedly grabbed the baby from her father's arms and threw her to the ground, injuring it, Xinhua reported. The infant is now in a stable condition, and may be taken to Beijing for further treatment, an official told CNN. Guo was initially detained for 15 days as punishment following the incident, but received no additional punishment, according to local media. However, he was re-arrested Sunday after the incident sparked an outcry on Chinese social media, and an investigative team was sent to probe further, Xinhua reported. It is the second recent incident of children being assaulted by unknown adults to have made headlines in China. In July, a 2-year-old was killed in Beijing after a man grabbed her from her stroller and threw her to the ground in a confrontation with her mother over a parking spot.

"Longmont, Colorado (CNN) -- Food and water are running low in some of the Colorado communities cut off by epic flooding, but well-organized residents are holding their own while awaiting rescue, officials said Monday. ""Within the communities, all of these people are helping one another out,"" deputy incident commander Chuck Russell told reporters in Larimer County. ""They're being very resourceful."" Helicopters from the U.S. Army and Colorado and Wyoming National Guards took to the air Monday morning, fanning out across the region to rescue people stranded across hundreds of square miles of Colorado flooded when intense rainfall last week pushed streams out of their banks and sent walls of water crashing down mountain canyons. ""Our birds are up and flying,"" the Wyoming National Guard tweeted. ""If (you're) in trouble, we will find you! We will get you to safety!"" Among those cut off were 15 Colorado National Guard members and other emergency workers stranded Sunday when rising floodwater forced them to abandon efforts to evacuate residents from flooded areas near Lyons, a National Guard spokeswoman said. U.S. Army helicopters rescued the civilian evacuees and some of the National Guard troops and emergency workers, Colorado Air National Guard Master Sgt. Cheresa Theiral said. A local family offered shelter to the stranded Guard members Sunday night, and on Monday the Guard rescuers went back to work with a door-to-door evacuation of some 18 houses in the area, according to Guard Lt. James Goff. Goff added that on Sunday, more than 90 residents in Boulder County were rescued by Guard members. While rescue flights resumed Monday, hundreds of civilians stranded by the flooding face a similar plight -- and a potentially long wait with so many needing to be rescued. More than 1,000 people in Larimer County alone were cut off and in need of rescue, officials said Monday. If they remain cut off by ground and military crews can't find a way to land helicopters for rescues, authorities will drop food and water to keep people going until rescues are possible, Russell said. More than 600 people remained unaccounted for in Boulder and Larimer counties alone, officials said Monday. More than 1,200 had been reported unaccounted statewide as of Sunday night. But while authorities said the presumed death toll of six could rise, most of the people on the unaccounted list are likely alive and well but have failed to check in with authorities to let them know, officials said Monday. Lessons from Vermont's epic flood . Huge rescue effort . Despite bad weather that kept helicopters grounded much of the weekend, crews from the Colorado and Wyoming National Guards and U.S. Army had used helicopters to rescue more than 700 people as of Saturday night, a National Guard official said. More than 2,100 people and more than 500 pets had been rescued by air and ground as of late Sunday, according to the National Guard. Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Craig Fugate said Monday that FEMA teams were on the ground in Colorado to provide emergency assistance. ""We've already had 3,000 families register"" since Sunday for FEMA aid, Fugate said, emphasizing that federal assistance will be granted based on need. The air efforts may be the largest such evacuation in the country since Hurricane Katrina in 2005, National Guard Lt. Col. Mitch Utterback said Saturday. In some cases, pilots had been flying night missions using night-vision goggles to rescue people, he said. Among the rescues: Saturday's recovery of 78 children who got stranded while on a field trip. ""The helicopters -- those were the best,"" said 10-year-old Luca Voeller, one of the students on a field trip to a high-elevation camp when the flooding began. Colorado floods: Stories of grief, generosity and gratitude . Death and destruction . Eight people across the state have died, according to the Colorado Office of Emergency Management. Four of those deaths include a man and a woman, both 19, who were swept away after leaving their car Thursday in Boulder County. Authorities said the woman left the car first, and the man jumped out to try to save her. Another body was found in a collapsed home in Jamestown in the same county. Rescuers recovered a fourth body on a roadway in Colorado Springs in El Paso County. Details were not given on all the deaths. Earlier Monday, CNN reported that there were two others presumed dead -- a 60-year-old woman and an 80-year-old woman, both in Larimer County. As of late Monday afternoon, it was unclear whether those people were indeed among those officially counted as fatalities by emergency management. The flooding has washed out or damaged dozens of roads, damaged nearly 18,000 homes and destroyed 1,500 homes, according to the state. Larimer County Sheriff's Office Executive Officer Nick Christensen said Monday that 1,500 homes may have been destroyed in his county, but it wasn't clear if that number was in addition to the state figure. He also said some 200 businesses may have been destroyed, with 500 damaged in what was a once-in-a-1,000-years flood in some parts of Larimer County. Boulder County alone will need an estimated $150 million to repair 100 to 150 miles of roadway and 20 to 30 bridges, county transportation director George Gerstle said. The repair bill will be ""10 to 15 times our annual budget,"" he said. Adding to what is already an unpleasant experience for thousands, residents who have been able to remain in their homes in some towns have been ordered to limit water use and to not flush toilets to avoid sewer backups and other problems. The latest town to issue such an order was Sterling on Monday. In Firestone, some residents were having to rely on bottled water after two of the city's three water supply lines were destroyed in the flooding, a police department spokeswoman said. Boulder Mayor Matthew Appelbaum told CNN's ""New Day"" on Monday that the city will be dealing with the aftermath of flooding for years to come. ""There is a huge amount of damage and a huge amount of repair and a huge amount of cleanup around town that people will be dealing with for a long time,"" he said. President Barack Obama signed a major disaster declaration for Colorado on Sunday and ordered federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts in Boulder County. Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper said he spoke by phone with U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx, who ""was adamant that the $5 million that was released Friday was just the beginning"" of federal assistance. At a news conference Monday, Hickenlooper said efforts continued to be focused on ""search and recovery."" The situation is ""surreal,"" CNN iReporter Erich Toll said. ""I have never seen anything like it,"" Toll said Sunday. ""There are raging rivers in many places where there have never been rivers -- or even water -- before. There are huge swaths of boulder fields where there used to be parks."" Matthew O'Rourke, an iReporter, said he's fearful of Coal Creek in Lafayette, which threatened to take out his business as it overflowed. ""The currents in the river -- they are impossible to describe how violent and diverse and angry they were and are right now,"" he said Sunday. ""There is no way any human could survive if they were swept into this."" How to help . Michael Pearson reported and wrote from Atlanta; George Howell reported from Longmont.

"New York (CNN) -- It's primary day in New York City, where a whole lot of Democrats and not that many Republicans will select their nominees for mayor and a slate of other city offices. Given the city's liberal bent, the primary serves as a de facto general election. Most of Tuesday's Democratic winners will sail to victory in November against token Republican opposition. But New York hasn't elected a Democratic mayor since 1989, when David Dinkins became the city's first African-American mayor. This is shaping up to be the year that streak ends. Mayor Michael Bloomberg has presided over more than a decade of economic expansion in the city, but his tenure has left a sour taste in the mouths of rank-and-file Democrats, who say the mayor cares more about wealthy Manhattan elites than the outer borough middle class. The issues flaring this election season all seem to come back to Bloomberg: affordable housing, income inequality, education, a city council vote that handed the mayor a third term, and the controversial New York Police Department tactic known as stop-and-frisk. Bloomberg fatigue is the prime reason that Bill de Blasio, the city's public advocate, has surged into the lead in a crowded field of underwhelming Democratic candidates. De Blasio is promising a ""clean break"" from the Bloomberg years. He's running as an unabashed liberal, pledging to raise taxes on the wealthy and end stop-and-frisk. De Blasio, who is white, also happens to be leading his opponents among African-American voters, in part because of his telegenic mixed-race family, which has been at his side throughout the campaign. Polls suggest De Blasio is certain to win Tuesday's primary. The main question is whether he can run up the score high enough to avoid a runoff against one of his two main challengers: City Council Speaker Christine Quinn, a lesbian who would be New York's first female mayor, and Bill Thompson, the city's former comptroller. Former U.S. Rep. Anthony Weiner, whose campaign imploded in July after he admitted to sending another round of lewd online chats well after he resigned from Congress, is running in a distant fourth place. Here are five things to watch in Tuesday's election, which will also determine whether former New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer can make a political comeback after a prostitution scandal forced him from office five years ago: . 1. Can de Blasio avoid a runoff? De Blasio was handed a big fat gift over the weekend when New York Magazine posted a buzzy new interview with Bloomberg in which the mayor described de Blasio's campaign, which has showcased his interracial family in a bid to win African-American support, as ""racist."" The New York City Public Advocate promptly put his family in front of television news cameras to hit back against the mayor, who has steadfastly backed the NYPD's stop-and-frisk policy, a deeply unpopular practice in the city's black community. A former political operative and onetime city councilman from Brooklyn, de Blasio was already surging before the comments hit the Web on Saturday morning. Now de Blasio might be able to reach the crucial 40% threshold needed to avoid a three-week runoff campaign, a once unthinkable scenario given the number of Democrats in the race. A Marist poll released Monday by NBC 4 New York and the Wall Street Journal pegged de Blasio's support among Democrats at 36%. With all the political wind in the race at his back, it's possible he might win the nomination outright on Tuesday. 2. Where do African-American voters go? The most influential person in the mayor's race isn't even on the ballot. That would be de Blasio's 15-year old son Dante, who starred in a memorable television ad that vaulted his father to the top of the polls in August. He hasn't looked back since. In the ad, Dante, who boasts an impressive Afro, looks into the camera and pledges that his father is ""the only Democrat with the guts to really break from the Bloomberg years"" and ""end a stop-and-frisk era that unfairly targets people of color."" The Dante spot, produced by former Obama campaign media consultant John del Cecato, sparked one of the most intriguing developments of the primary: de Blasio has steadily been growing his support among African-American voters -- even against Bill Thompson, the lone black candidate in the field. De Blasio now leads Thompson among black voters by a 39-25 margin, the Marist poll showed. He's also identified as the candidate most likely to end stop-and-frisk. Thompson was the 2009 Democratic nominee for mayor and bucked conventional wisdom -- and many polls -- by coming within five points of defeating Bloomberg that November. If Thompson is to have any chance of making the runoff and beating de Blasio, he better hope the polls are wrong again. 3. Chelsea and the Village . Quinn's city council district encompasses Chelsea and stretches of Greenwich Village, which represent the historic heart of New York City's gay and lesbian community. The Moonstruck Diner, on the corner of 23rd Street and Ninth Avenue, serves as Quinn's second office. Last Friday evening, Quinn rallied hundreds of gay and lesbian supporters outside the Stonewall Inn, site of the historic 1969 gay rights demonstrations against the New York Police Department. But disgruntled Quinn supporters have faulted her for not drawing more attention to the history-making nature of her candidacy. Quinn, once the front-runner, now desperately needs her West Side base to show up if she has any hope of making a runoff. There are hints her support could be fracturing under the weight of her complicated relationship with Bloomberg in the city council, and de Blasio's late burst of momentum. When de Blasio showed up late last week to campaign in Quinn's backyard, on the corner of 23rd Street and Eighth Avenue, he was mobbed by photo-seeking supporters and held court for nearly an hour, jamming up foot traffic and putting the City Council speaker on notice. On Monday night, Quinn's campaign added a last-minute campaign swing through Chelsea to shore up her base. 4. Can Spitzer make a comeback? Spitzer, who resigned from office in a 2008 prostitution scandal that roiled Albany, surprised pretty much everyone in politics in July when he suddenly jumped into the Democratic race for city comptroller, the city's chief fiscal officer. With the help of his real estate fortune, his unabashed anti-Wall Street rhetoric and his near universal name recognition, Spitzer led his Democratic primary opponent, Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer, for most of the summer. But Stringer has worked overtime to remind voters of Spitzer's baggage, attacking him in debates, in the mail and on the television airwaves. Spitzer has returned fire, accusing Stringer of being a lifelong member of the political establishment who accomplished little during his public career. The race is the most intriguing head-to-head match-up on Tuesday. Recent polls paint a mixed picture but suggest the race is something of a toss-up, though Spitzer may have a slight edge thanks to his steady 2-1 edge among African-American voters. If he wins the nomination, he's a sure bet to become comptroller against nominal Republican opposition and see his name bandied about as a potential future mayor, attorney general or governor. A win Tuesday would be his first step toward political redemption. 5. The end of ""Cats"" The Republican primary contest has been largely overlooked given the city's Democratic leanings. Roughly 700,000 Democrats are expected to cast ballots in Tuesday's primary, while Republican turnout may be as low as 60,000. Joe Lhota, a fedora-wearing veteran of Rudy Giuliani's administration, is expected to win the GOP nod. If the liberal de Blasio wins the Democratic primary as expected, Lhota might have an outside shot in the general election if he's able to enlist Bloomberg allies and the business community, no fans of de Blasio's tax-the-rich agenda, to help defeat him. But a Lhota win would also be the political death knell for John Catsimatidis, arguably the most colorful figure of the 2013 election cycle. Catsimatidis, the Greek-born billionaire founder of the Gristedes grocery store chain and a longtime Republican donor, poured millions of dollars of his own money into the race, blanketing the television airwaves with quirky television ads. According to The New York Times, ""He has even created his own eight-page newspaper, The Cats Chronicle, which includes no fewer than 27 photographs of Mr. Catsimatidis."" Politically incorrect, often disheveled and definitely overweight, Catsimatidis has some regular guy appeal but is nevertheless prone to missteps and cringe-worthy statements that make him hard to take seriously. He even fell asleep in the middle of an interview with a New York public radio reporter, who recorded him snoring and used the sound in her story. Russell Schaffer, a New York Democrat who tweets prolifically under the handle @RussOnPolitics, spoke for political junkies everywhere on Sunday when he mourned Catsimatidis' imminent demise: . ""I'll never let @JCats2013 go, even after he loses the GOP primary for NYC mayor on Tuesday,"" he tweeted. ""He is a treasure to behold and quote.""","Mayoral race will mark the end of Bloomberg's decade of control of mayor's office .

"(CNN) -- As many as 400 armed Muslim rebels are holding at least 20 people hostage in a southern Philippine city after coming ashore by boat, authorities said Monday. Philippine police and armed forces have blockaded the areas of Zamboanga City, a mainly Christian city on the southern coast of Mindanao, where the rebels are holed up, Mayor Isabelle Climaco-Salazar told CNN. She said the rebels had planned to march on the city hall. City officials hope to talk to the rebels, who are believed to be from the Moro National Liberation Front, to try to negotiate the hostages' release, she said. The MNLF, a separatist movement founded in 1971 by Nur Misuari with the aim of establishing an autonomous region for Muslims in this mainly Catholic country, signed a peace deal with the central government in Manila in 1996 -- though some of its members have broken away to continue with a violent campaign. According to a statement issued by Climaco-Salazar, the current crisis began at around 4.30 a.m. local time when government forces clashed with armed rebels heading for the city by boat. Six people, including a policeman, a navy serviceman and four civilians, were killed during the course of these clashes. The statement added that six districts in this coastal city of 800,000 people have been affected by the ""infiltration of alleged MNLF members,"" with 20 hostages taken in the district of Santa Catalina. In a televised press conference Monday, a police spokesman said a further 200 people were currently stranded in the city because of the blockade by security forces. They are not being classified as hostages. No demands have been made by the rebels, he added. Under the terms of the 1996 agreement, Misuari was named as governor of an expanded Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM). He served until 2001. Last month Misuari issued a ""declaration of independence"" for the Moro nation -- referring to Mindanao's indigenous Muslim population -- after complaining that the MNLF had been left out of a recent wealth-sharing agreement with an another insurgent group, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), which has fought for decades to set up an independent Islamic state on the resource-rich island of Mindanao.

"Philadelphia (CNN) -- ""Good afternoon,"" Megan Zor calls out over the din of the seventh-grade English class taking their seats inside Mastery Charter School's Shoemaker Campus. ""Good afternoon,"" the class repeats before reciting the school's code of conduct. A hush comes over the room when Zor holds up three fingers, signaling a student to stop talking, her compact frame pacing across the front of the classroom. ""We're not speaking,"" she scolds, her face stern. Zor's no-nonsense approach is the Mastery way, and motto: ""Excellence. No Excuses."" And that teaching style is getting results: Better test scores, more college-bound students. But in other Philadelphia communities, student walkouts and community unrest are raising questions about charter-based turnaround programs. Some said their public schools haven't been given a chance to succeed. Some don't trust charter school operators. Similar debates are happening in school districts across the country, from Providence, Rhode Island, to Los Angeles. Nationwide, more than 1.6 million public school students attend nearly 5,000 publicly funded, independently operated charter schools. Charters were first established in Pennsylvania in 1997, and there are now 135 charter schools with more than 50,000 students. Success in Philly . In 2005, the School District of Philadelphia asked the Philly-based charter school operator Mastery Charter to take over some of the city's violent, low-performing schools, including Shoemaker. Since then, Pennsylvania state test results show that Shoemaker's seventh-graders are scoring 80% proficient in math and 66% proficient in reading, up from 16% in math and 20% in reading. It will graduate its first class this year. Senior Leroy Hayes attended Shoemaker before Mastery took over, when it was a failing middle school on the city's north side. ""If the school stayed the same, I would not be going to college,"" said Hayes, who will attend the University of Vermont with a partial cycling scholarship in the fall. ""When I was in middle school at Shoemaker, I didn't really care about even going to high school. All I cared about was going out there and making that money."" Mastery's academic gains caught the attention of President Barack Obama, who recognized the charter school provider in a speech to the National Urban League in July. In September, talk show host Oprah Winfrey, through her Angel Network, gave Mastery Charter $1 million to continue its teaching efforts in Philadelphia. The gift came on the eve of the release of the controversial documentary ""Waiting for Superman,"" which touted charter schools as a possible solution to public education's biggest problems. Today at Shoemaker, droves of students wearing a uniform of white polo shirt and khakis quietly make their way down the hallway during the change of classes. As they pass the dean's office, an oversized hand-painted poster of Winfrey watches over them. ""My students have just as much potential as every other student in the country, regardless of what ZIP code they were born into, regardless of what social-economic level they were born into. And, our students the past five years have proven that,"" said Zor, a former traditional Philadelphia public school teacher turned co-founder of the Shoemaker Campus. ""There's no debate around it anymore."" In January, the district announced 18 public schools were slated for turnaround as part of the city's Renaissance Schools Initiative. Six more schools will become charter schools, two of them overseen by music mogul Kenny Gamble's Universal Companies. Universal Companies received a $500,000 planning grant from the U.S. Department of Education to develop a Promise Neighborhood within an impoverished area of south Philly. The area will offer intensive social services for children with the aim of improving educational outcomes. Audenried High School in South Philadelphia is on the list. Universal pledges to revamp Audenried and create a neighborhood similar to the Harlem Children's Zone, led by Geoffrey Canada, which is designed to keep student on track through college by focusing on a specific geographic area while providing a comprehensive range of services. Some students, teachers and community members aren't sold on the plan. Another school, another debate . Audenried was closed by the school district in 2005 because of its failing status. After erecting a new building and hiring new staff, it reopened as a public school with a clean slate in 2008. This year, Audenried students took state standardized tests for the first time since it reopened, but results aren't in yet. According to the district's predictive assessment, Audenried has 37% of students proficient or advanced in math and 38% proficient or advanced in English. Still, many thought the new school and staff were making great strides. Some aren't convinced charter schools can solve their problems, and they're leery of Universal, which has operated in the city since the 1990s but has never before operated a charter high school. The Obama Administration's ""Race to the Top"" program encourages charter school expansions, but the Center on Reinventing Public Education warns that that the schools aren't an automatic success. According to a 2009 National Charter School Research Project report, ""States and localities can use charter schools as a tool for better schools, but they must be prepared to close charter schools when they fail to succeed. Some states rarely close a charter school; others consider it a regular and necessary function."" Hope Moffett, an English teacher at Audenried, was shocked to learn her school would be converted to a charter school. ""It's a short-term solution for a long-term problem,"" Moffett said of the charter takeover. ""In the end you will underserve more students in the future."" Students and parents were upset, too, saying it was too soon to label Audenried a failure. ""Recognizing that a 'one-size fits all' approach would not yield maximum results, I encourage parents and community members to take an active part in the process,"" Superintendent of Schools Arlene Ackerman said in a statement regarding the changes. Participate they did. In February, frustrated Audenried students staged a walkout, saying they had been displaced enough already and did not want to convert to a charter operated by Universal. The walkout was one of three protests in a single week by district teens upset that their schools were slated for overhauls. Eva Reeves, a junior at Audenried, led her classmates in protest. Although not totally opposed to charter takeovers, Reeves said her school has the right mix of student and teachers and fears the new operators will disrupt their progress. ""We should have a say in what they were trying to do to our school,"" she said. ""Just because it turns into a charter school doesn't mean it's going to be a good school."" Moffett, who allowed her students to leave school to attend the protest rally, was removed from the classroom after the walkout. The district said her actions endangered students. Moffett waited out the suspension in the district's ""rubber room"" while officials decided her job status. She returned to her classroom in March. ""There was no justification for why they considered Audenried a failing school,"" she said, adding that the decision was made before standardized tests scores were available. There are more challenges ahead for Pennsylvania schools, too. In April, the district announced that it stands to lose $292 million in funding, or 10%, if Gov. Tom Corbett's state budget is passed. The overall school operating budget would be reduced from $3.2 million to $2.7 billion. As a result, Philadelphia would need to cut the work force by more than 3,800 positions, including 1,260 teachers and a 50% personnel reduction at district headquarters. ""This is unprecedented,"" Michael Masch, the district's chief financial officer, said at a recent school board meeting. ""But we have to balance the budget."" Reeves' grandfather and community activist, Charles Reeves, is concerned the district and Universal do not have the best interests of the students in mind, but are more interested in saving money or making money. He was removed from the recent school board meeting where the district voted to approve Universal's takeover of Audenried after he spoke without registering. ""I will die and go to hell before I sit back and let them pull this trick they trying to pull on us,"" Reeves said. ""They just gonna tell people they gonna give (Universal) a public school in September ... for what?"" Eva Reeves, who will enter her senior year in a high school under new management, said she will continue speaking out. ""I would like for Audenried to be just left alone the way it is,"" she said. ""We won't be silenced.""","Mastery Charter School's Shoemaker Campus has seen big rise in students' test scores .

"(CNN) -- The United Nations won't help, good pal Britain is sitting this one out, so President Barack Obama will take his case for a military attack on Syria directly to the American people next week. Obama wrapped up his trip to the G20 summit in Russia by telling reporters he will address the nation on Tuesday as Congress prepares to vote on a resolution authorizing limited military strikes against Syria over its alleged use of chemical weapons. Facing public opposition reflected by legislators hesitant to support him, Obama said Friday that he understands the skepticism over his call for punishing the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad for what U.S. officials call a sarin gas attack on August 21 that killed more than 1,400 people. ""The American people have gone through a lot when it comes to the military over the last decade or so,"" Obama said. He also cited a responsibility borne by the United States as a global power to lead what he hopes would be an international response in order to maintain the credibility of treaties and conventions against weapons of mass destruction. ""I believe when you have a limited proportional strike like this, with manageable risks, then we should bear that responsibility,"" Obama said, noting that military interventions often lack broad public support but that critics also decry inaction in the face of atrocities abroad. Foreign interventions unpopular . ""When people say that it is a terrible stain on all of us that hundreds of thousands of people were slaughtered in Rwanda, well imagine if Rwanda was going on right now and we asked: 'Should we intervene in Rwanda?'"" the president said. ""I think it's fair to say that it probably wouldn't poll real well."" Opposition by permanent Security Council members Russia and China has scuttled Obama's hopes for U.N. authorization of a military response against al-Assad's regime, and usually reliable ally Britain's Parliament decided against joining a military response. The inability to muster a significant international coalition, like the NATO-led mission with Arab League support that intervened in Libya, caused the president to seek political cover by requesting congressional authorization. ""We will be more effective if we are unified moving forward,"" Obama said in explaining why he asked for support from Congress for what he argues is a necessary response to the violation of international norms by Syria. In a likely foreshadowing of Obama's address to the nation next week, U.N. Ambassador Samantha Power told the liberal Center for American Progress on Friday that non-military alternatives to attacking Syria had been exhausted. She cited repeated steps by Russia, joined at times by China, to undermine U.N. Security Council action on Syria over the past two years. Because of Russia, Power said, ""the Security Council was not even able to put out a statement expressing its disapproval"" of the August 21 chemical weapons attack. Administration lobbying blitz . Obama's speech on Tuesday will culminate an aggressive outreach strategy intended to woo members of Congress to back his pitch for limited strikes, which are expected to be missile attacks at Syrian military command targets but not chemical weapons stockpiles. The administration says it has intercepts and other intelligence that show the Syrian regime planned the attack and then attempted to cover it up. Secretary of State John Kerry told a Senate committee this week that U.S. intelligence shows the rockets carrying chemical weapons were launched from territory controlled by the Syrian regime and landed in opposition or contested areas of suburban Damascus. Kerry and British officials say the gas used in the attack was sarin, according to test results. U.N. inspectors who collected samples from the stricken area are expected to provide their own results in coming weeks. However, after a week of classified briefings, two congressional hearings and other aggressive lobbying by the administration, a majority of the Senate and House remain ""undecided"" on whether to give Obama authorization to attack, according to CNN's latest count. In addition, a growing number of legislators say they oppose the move, though it remains too early to predict an outcome. A heavy lift for Obama . ""I knew this was going to be a heavy lift,"" Obama said during Friday's news conference in St. Petersburg, Russia. Supporters and critics have called for the president to directly address the American public and make his case for why a military response was necessary. ""Members of Congress represent the views of their constituents, and only a president can convince the public that military action is required,"" said Brendan Buck, the spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner, who has said he backs Obama on the issue. ""We only hope this isn't coming too late to make the difference."" In the past two weeks, the Obama administration has spoken to at least 60 senators and 125 House members on the issue, a White House official confirmed Friday. On Thursday alone, while the president was in Russia, he and senior administration officials made more than 25 individual calls to what the White House described as bipartisan members of the House and Senate. Obama called five senators himself, the White House said, but officials refused to reveal the names of the recipients. In addition, members of the House and Senate were meeting at the White House on Friday with Vice President Joe Biden, an administration official confirmed to CNN. It was Biden's second straight day of meetings with legislators to try to convince them to authorize a military response. Obama cancels trip . Go it alone? Should Congress reject Obama's request to authorize military strikes, Deputy National Security Adviser Tony Blinken said Friday on NPR that ""the president of course has the authority"" to act in Syria without support from Capitol Hill, but ""it's neither his desire nor intention to use that authority absent Congress backing him."" A senior administration official from the National Security Council later clarified Blinken's remark, saying ""the president's intention is to act with congressional authorization, and we believe they will vote to provide that authorization."" Asked several times at the news conference about Blinken's remark and whether he would attack Syria anyway without authorization from Congress, Obama acknowledged that he would avoid providing a direct answer. ""It would be a mistake for me to jump the gun and speculate because right now I'm working to get as much support as possible out of Congers,"" he said. On Wednesday, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee approved an amended version of the White House's resolution for authorization to attack Syria by a 10-7 vote. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid on Friday praised the panel's Democratic and Republican leaders for working together to craft a compromise that was able win approval. Reid spoke at a brief Senate session that allowed for the procedural step of setting up next week's consideration of the resolution by the full Senate. Election politics at play . Meanwhile, the House also is expected to take up the Syria issue starting Monday, with Majoriy Leader Eric Cantor of Virginia telling his Republican caucus to expect a vote on military authorization ""in the next two weeks."" Approval of a resolution is considered more likely by the Democratic-led Senate than the Republican-led House. 45-day delay? In a step that would buy time for Obama to get more international and domestic support, Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia is working on a proposal that would put off any military action for 45 days while demanding that Syria sign an international convention against chemical weapons or face U.S. military repercussions, according to an aide to Manchin. It was unclear if the idea would gain any traction among legislators considering the Syria issue. On the sidelines of the G20 summit Friday, Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin met for what Obama described as a ""candid, constructive"" conversation despite increasingly strained relations between the two leaders. Obama acknowledged that Putin was unlikely to shift his position on military action against Syria, and Putin gave a similar account of their meeting, telling reporters that ""he doesn't agree with me, I don't agree with him, but we listened to each other."" The two leaders both said they could work together to seek a political solution to the Syrian crisis, which reiterated their longstanding positions. How will House vote? How will Senate vote? CNN's Ted Barrett, Kevin Bohn, Virginia Nicolaidis and Gloria Borger contributed to this report.","NEW: House GOP leader Cantor tells members to expect a vote in the next two weeks .

"(CNN) -- According to new data released by the U.S. Census Bureau this week, median household incomes adjusted for inflation declined by 2.3% in 2010 over the previous year. The data also showed that 46.2 million Americans lived in poverty in 2010 -- the highest number in the 52 years the Census Bureau has been tracking such data. But that data is even more depressing in contrast to the skyrocketing fortunes of America's super-rich. Between the second quarter of 2009 and the fourth quarter of 2010, our nation's total income rose by $528 billion. Of that economic growth, $464 billion went to pretax corporate profits. Just $7 billion went to wages and salaries. In other words, 88% of the brief recovery went to corporate profits and just 1% -- that's right, 1% -- went to workers, according to a study by economists at Northeastern University. By contrast, when the United States was recovering from a downturn in the early 1990s, 50% of the growth in the national income went to wages and salaries. (And actually, in that period leading up to the tech boom, average corporate profits declined 1%.) It's not that working Americans aren't working hard. Worker productivity has risen steadily, but wages have still been stagnant. But the income of the top 1% of Americans? Rapidly rising. At what point do we realize enough is enough -- that giving more and more money and power to big business and the super-rich will never translate into more jobs, better wages and a better economy but simply more yachts and luxury villas? At what point do we realize that conservative anti-tax extremism is nothing but blatant greed masquerading as lousy economics? At what point do we realize that class warfare isn't a liberal goal but in fact a conservative reality, advanced through decades of policies that help the rich cheat the middle class? According to Republican economist and former White House adviser Bruce Bartlett, the actual tax rate paid by the wealthy and big business is the lowest in several generations. Thanks to the Bush tax cuts, the super-rich paid an average of 17% on their federal income tax in 2007 -- less than many middle class Americans paid. For instance, multibillionare Warren Buffett pays a lower percentage of income tax than everyone else in his office, including the secretaries. In 1992, the rich averaged a 26% income tax. A study earlier this month reported that 25 of the largest and most profitable corporations in the United States paid their CEOs more money than their entire corporations paid in taxes. Meanwhile, corporations are earning record profits and sitting on record cash reserves -- upwards of $2 trillion dollars. Anyone who can look at these numbers and think the rich need more help is crazy. Stop calling big business the ""job creators."" They have all the resources imaginable and they're still not creating jobs. It's time to put more money in the pockets of working Americans so they can spend it, create demand and finally kick-start the economy. President Barack Obama has proposed a comprehensive plan that will create good jobs while rebuilding America's infrastructure for the 21st century. In the president's plan, a portion of the costs will be offset by reducing the tax-deductible exemptions for well-off families, taxing hedge fund manager income as income rather than discounted capital gains, closing loopholes that give government handouts to the oil and gas industry and taxing corporate jets with the same depreciation schedule as personal jets. For crying out loud, why not? Why we should continue to let working Americans suffer while helping the super-rich get richer? Most Americans agree with the president. Almost three in four Americans support raising taxes on the wealthy so we can put government to work getting all of America working again, according to a Washington Post-ABC News poll. In fact, even among Republican voters, raising taxes on the rich is more popular than cuts to Social Security or Medicare -- putting the leading Republican presidential candidates squarely out of touch even with their own base. The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. We've already drastically cut taxes for the rich and corporations, which has only made them richer while our economy remains in the gutter and no jobs are created. But in light of the depth and breadth of our economic crisis, continuing to put the interests of a few wealthy people and big corporations ahead of the needs of millions and millions of struggling and suffering Americans isn't just insane. It's immoral. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Sally Kohn.","Number of poor highest in 50 years, Sally Kohn says, as the rich get super rich .

"(CNN) -- It is well know that leaders at the highest echelons of politics and business tend to be taller -- an advantage called the ""height premium."" Now, research shows a similar correlation with voice pitch: the lower a CEO's voice, the larger his company and paychecks tend to be. The new study, led by professors at Duke University's Fuqua School of Business and the University of California at San Diego, looked at the voice pitches of nearly 800 male CEOs speaking in public in the U.S. Past research already showed that in a laboratory, where researchers played voices that had been artificially manipulated to various pitches, people preferred the lower ones as leaders. So this latest report took the study to the next step, seeing if the experiments translated to the success level of real CEOs. ""It appears that the labor market is matching deeper-voiced individuals with larger firms, which means this is influencing boards of directors' judgments, perhaps,"" said William Mayew, associate professor at Fuqua, who headed the study. But Mayew says researchers still need to figure out why this matching is happening for it to have meaningful applications. ""What we don't know yet is where the benefit comes from. Does it come from cutting through red tape in a big corporation a bit faster if you're more authoritative or dominant vocally?"" he said. Read more: Bullying bosses dominate their way to power . Voice pitch could also be related to other physical characteristics that suggest dominance, such as how tall you are, how big you are, what your facial structure is -- and it is still unclear if other factors like these are the true influencers of becoming a high-earning CEO. While research like this may imply that aspiring leaders who are short and have a high voice pitch are genetically disadvantaged, Mayew says this view places too much weight on a few physical traits. ""It takes a lot of different features that come together in order to make a person who he or she is, and I think it'd be premature to suggest that if you had a high-pitched voice or if you were short that you just have no shot of ascending to leadership ranks. There's much more to it,"" he says. While Mayew acknowledges there are ways for CEOs to change how to speak, such as through presentation training, he is skeptical about the usefulness of speaking in an unnatural way or dressing a certain way to make up for physical disadvantages. If executives all take the same measures, he says, then one's position relative to other CEOs does not change. ""There are certain bounds that we're just born with,"" he says. Read more: Neurotics make good teammates . But leadership coaches, part of whose job it is to help leaders improve their self-presentation, have long been advising clients on ways to speak to come across as more commanding. ""Voices can indeed be changed and the pitch, pace, tonality and voice pattern can be modified to exude power, control, and position someone as the obvious leader,"" says Gloria Starr, an image and etiquette consultant. Using words with two, three or four syllables gives the perception of a high education, she says. Using fewer words, and omitting complaints or explanations are other ways to convey power. ""Women tend to give their power away when they 'chat,' go on and on endlessly,"" Starr says. Starr says to look successful in the workplace, executives should dress in one color, which adds height, and wear plain fabric rather than patterned styles. Women should maintain a consistent business look and avoid open-toe sandals, bare legs and dangling or sparkling jewelry in the workplace. ""Trust is higher when an elegant, sophisticated business look is consistently presented,"" she says. Read more: Why we pick bad leaders . When one of her male clients moved into an executive role, she says, she suggested that he stop wearing short-sleeved shirts, because it is a ""blue-collar look."" Starr also advises against dressing down on the weekends or when traveling. Not only does professional attire lead to more upgrades and perks at restaurants, on flights and in hotels, but there is always a chance of striking up business relationships during this downtime, like when seated on a plane. As for how executives, especially men, should carry themselves: ""No hands in your pockets ever,"" she says.","A new study shows that the lower a CEO's voice, the larger his company and paychecks tend to be .
It is still unclear why lower-voiced CEOs are more successful .

"Washington (CNN) -- Federal authorities are investigating a potential case of human trafficking at the suburban Washington home of a Saudi diplomat, officials said Wednesday. Authorities were called Tuesday afternoon to an upscale neighborhood in McLean, Virginia, where they ""removed two potential trafficking victims,"" U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokesman Brandon Montgomery told CNN. A State Department official said the McLean house is the home of the Saudi military attachÃÂ©. The case is under investigation by Homeland Security Investigations, a unit within ICE. The two women, who are from the Philippines and currently work at the Saudi Embassy in Washington, claim they were mistreated, according to the State Department official. The women are charging, according to a different State Department official, that the Saudi attachÃÂ© kept their passports, made them work extremely long hours and did not pay them. The source said they had not seen anything to indicate the women were physically harmed. The official also pointed out these allegations are similar to several other cases they heard from domestic workers who work for diplomats from the Persian Gulf. According to ICE, cases like this are very ""victim-centric,"" meaning that once there is ""confirmation of suspicions,"" authorities immediately go in and remove the victim and then begin the investigation. There was no word on the identity of the Saudi diplomat who lived there. The Saudi Embassy in Washington did not respond to requests for comment.

"(CNN) -- Being in the NFL is a bit like being a Wall Street banker or a pop star -- the job title comes with a laundry list of assumptions.

Well, not exactly, as burgeoning filmmaker Matthew Cherry seeks to reveal in his first feature film, ""The Last Fall."" The indie, which premiered at SXSW this year and has racked up accolades on the film festival circuit, follows a 25-year-old pro football player who finds himself back at home, cash-strapped and trying to find his place in the world after his athletic career ends. The film's inspired by Cherry's own experience as a former NFL player, and the 30-year-old director/writer/producer hopes his feature directorial debut will educate audiences. ""A lot of people, they look at the guys who sign the big contracts -- the Peyton Mannings, the Tom Bradys, the Calvin Johnsons -- and I think that what ends up happening is that people automatically assume it's like that for every player,"" Cherry said. ""And I think a lot of times people compare it to basketball and baseball contracts. In the NFL, there's no guaranteed contract."" For example, upon exiting the University of Akron in 2004 with a degree focused on radio/TV broadcast and media production, Cherry said he signed a three-year deal that allowed around $225,000 his first year year and escalated to $350,000 in his third -- but he ended up getting cut during training camp. ""What happens is that if you get cut at any point, they only owe you what they paid you,"" he explained. ""When I got cut they reassigned me to the practice squad, and when I was on the practice squad, that base salary was $80,000."" ""After taxes and everything else, it's roughly $30,000 (to) $40,000,"" he said. ""I'm in the NFL, and people were thinking that I'm making all of this crazy dough, and it ended up being like, maybe a couple thousand a week. But it's only for those 16 weeks of that season. It was really hard to even make that stretch out for a year, let alone to put it in savings for years to come."" So when he was released from the league, a then 25-year-old Cherry had to figure out how to rebound. The answer seemed obvious: to pursue a longstanding passion for movies. ""The reality of it is, in regards to playing ball, I could probably still be playing in Canada somewhere, or doing arena football, or something,"" he said. ""But I didn't want to live that life that I was living for the past three years for another seven."" He picked up and moved to Los Angeles around 2007 after gaining acceptance to an organization called Streetlights, which helps place minority men and women on sets as production assistants. At first, his transition to his new life left him shell-shocked as he tried to adjust from being a football player to being the humble PA fetching coffee. Cherry treated his production assistant gig like film school, soaking in all he could. He also used equipment made available to him to gain experience as a music video director. ""Every artist that charted, I cross-referenced it on YouTube, and the artists that didn't have music videos for songs that were charting, I wrote them a message on MySpace,"" Cherry said. The aspiring director offered a full music video treatment to musicians with no charge, just to get experience. After reaching out to several artists over the span of a few months, Cherry began to make inroads in the music industry. He served as second assistant director on videos for artists including Sean ""Diddy"" Combs and Raheem Devaughn. But while his career as a director was taking shape, it wasn't until he was shooting an independent documentary about the NFL lockout in 2011 that the idea for ""The Last Fall"" hit him. ""We were interviewing all these different fans, and we were asking people: 'Who do you blame, the players or the owners?' And everyone blamed the players, surprisingly,"" Cherry said. ""Saying they're greedy, what do I care these guys get $8 million, $9 million, calling them arrogant. I found myself defending these players and educating people and opening their eyes to that process, and I thought wow, maybe there's something here."" He began writing the screenplay, his first, last March, and approached Lance Gross (""Our Family Wedding,"" ""House of Payne"") to play the lead. By July, they were embarking on a 15-day shoot. ""The biggest goal that we wanted to do with the film is to show that these guys are human beings,"" Cherry said. ""With so many people, they just look at them like, 'Oh, he's just a piece of meat. He dropped a pass, let's kill him. He's an idiot, he gets cut -- whatever, he sucked anyway. To make it to the league, nobody sucks."" Gross, who's also an executive producer on ""The Last Fall,"" was taken from the moment he read the script. And as an actor, Gross understood the fear of failure that comes with constantly placing one's fate in the hands of higher-ups. To get this far, ""it took a lot of hard work, knocking down doors, making sure that I was at the right auditions, working with the right people,"" he said. ""You get what you work for."" Yet the biggest hurdle for the film's director wasn't a professional obstacle but a personal one, as Cherry faced the devastating unexpected passing of his mother last May. ""The day before my mother passed, I wrote her a message. Similar to the character in the movie, we really didn't talk that much, we weren't super-duper close. I just kind of felt compelled to hit her up,"" he said. He thanked her for helping to support him financially, and told her he loved her. And in the last line of his e-mail, he added that he was ""working on something big, and that if it goes well, hopefully I'd be able to buy her that house that I wasn't able to buy her back when I was playing ball. "" Cherry's mother responded, and the next day after their exchange, she died at 57 of a heart attack. That, he said, was really what pushed him to see ""The Last Fall"" through. At the time, Cherry said, ""The Last Fall"" was going to be ""ultra-low-budget."" After his mother passed, he was able to use most of her life insurance money to co-finance the project along with executive producer (and NFL player) Ellis Hobbs. ""In a way,"" Cherry said, his mother ""sacrificed herself so that I can live out a dream."" Unfortunately, that was just the first challenge for Cherry. Ten minutes following their last SXSW screening, Cherry received word that his father, who'd been in poor health, had also died. With his first movie bowing in theatrical release in Los Angeles today and headed for DVD release on January 15, Cherry's already working on his next projects, one of which will revisit the world of football. ""You definitely have to have a strong faith in God to try to get through, because this filmmaking thing, this is 10 times harder than trying to make it into NFL,"" Cherry said. ""Seriously. It's the hardest thing I've ever done in my life.""","Former NFL player Matthew Cherry is a rising filmmaker .

"Dr. Sanjay Gupta, a neurosurgeon, is author of the new book ""Cheating Death,"" which will be published next month. This article originally appeared in the September 20, 2009, issue of Parade and Parade.com. (Parade) -- I am going to let you in on a secret: When a person's heart stops beating, it's not the end. Contrary to what you may think, death is not a single event. Instead, it's a process that can be interrupted. Sanjay Gupta says the latest CPR techniques can save the lives of vicitims of cardiac arrest. Mike Mertz knows this firsthand. On January 23, 2008, the 59-year-old Arizona man was driving home from work. The last thing he remembers is pulling into his complex's driveway. Then his heart stopped. Corey Ash, a passing UPS driver, noticed a silver Saturn wedged between a palm tree and a wall, with the engine running and a person slumped at the wheel. Ash stopped to investigate. He switched off the car's engine, pulled Mertz out, and laid him on the ground. Ash called 911 and started pumping the older man's chest. The next few minutes would be absolutely critical for Mertz. If you had been there, standing over Mertz's lifeless body, would you have known what to do? A person's life can slip away in a few minutes. Without a heartbeat, circulation slows to a halt. Blood no longer flows to the organs, and the brain is the first one to suffer. In normal times, the brain, which constitutes 2 percent of our body mass, consumes about 20 percent of the oxygen the body takes in. After 10 seconds without oxygen, the brain's functions slow. Without oxygen or signals from the brain, other organs begin to break down. Diaphragm muscles no longer contract and release to bring in air. The kidneys stop filtering blood. At the same time, an elaborate chain reaction triggers a breakdown in cells throughout the body. Parade.com: 4 diseases you can fight with exercise . Scientists and physicians are now learning that this process can be reversed. When it comes to cardiac arrest, however, the chances of surviving an episode outside a hospital are poor. Only 2 percent of victims pull through without long-term damage. The No. 1 thing that has been shown to make a difference is the action of a bystander. If a passerby jumps in and gives CPR, as Corey Ash did, the likelihood of survival rises significantly. But if onlookers do nothing, those chances drop -- fast. According to the American Heart Association, for every minute that goes by without someone attempting CPR, the survival rate decreases 7 to 10 percent. Studies have found that bystanders perform CPR in only 20 to 30 percent of cases. Researchers say it's not because people don't want to help -- it's because they're apprehensive about putting their mouths on someone else's, especially if the person is dying. But what I'm about to tell you may change your mind about what you can do in a situation like Mertz's. More than 15 years ago, cardiologist Gordon Ewy and researchers at the University of Arizona's Sarver Heart Center were puzzling over how to get more people to give CPR. To simplify the method, they wondered what would happen if they advocated performing compressions without mouth-to-mouth respiration. After running successful laboratory trials, Ewy spoke to emergency-services directors in Arizona, Wisconsin, and Missouri. They were intrigued by his findings and agreed to promote the use of compression-only CPR among people in their states. They also implemented a protocol for their paramedics and firefighters that emphasized giving chest compressions with minimal interruptions to keep the patient's blood circulating. Parade.com: 8 ways to stay healthy . The results were remarkable: Not only were survival rates for people who got only compressions just as good as those for people who got traditional CPR, they actually were better. Why was it so effective? Mouth-to-mouth resuscitation supplies oxygen, which we need continuously. As it turns out, our bloodstreams contain plenty of oxygen at any moment. Even if we stop breathing, our oxygen levels remain normal for quite a while. If we do stop breathing, however, the sole way to make the oxygen circulate is by having someone pump our chests. In 2007, Japanese researchers revealed the results of a massive study on bystander intervention. They looked at cases where a person (not in a hospital) suffered cardiac arrest in view of a bystander -- and with his or her heart in a rhythm that would respond to a defibrillator. The survival rate was 11 percent for those who got standard CPR -- mouth-to-mouth plus chest compressions -- before an ambulance arrived. The rate was 19 percent for those who got only compressions. The act of keeping oxygen circulating could increase a victim's chances of surviving by as much as 70 percent. This is not a fancy technology born in a gleaming lab, yet it is one of the most significant recent breakthroughs in medicine. Because heart disease is the biggest killer in the United States, this simple act could save thousands of people's lives every year. Like Mike Mertz's. Shortly after Corey Ash began CPR, paramedics trained in the compression-only technique arrived. Thanks to them and to an alert bystander, Mertz survived. One day, the bystander could be you. Parade.com: 7 habits for a longer life . Remember: As soon as you see someone suffer what you think may be cardiac arrest, call 911, start giving chest compressions 100 times a minute, and don't stop for anything. To get more information and to find classes in your area in emergency cardiovascular care, go to the American Heart Association Web site. Advances in saving hearts . â¢ Stem cells: Back when I was in medical school, I learned that any damage to the heart from a heart attack was permanent. This past summer, Mayo Clinic researchers working on mice converted adult scar cells into stem cells, which they injected into damaged hearts. The cells restored heart-muscle performance, stopped the progression of damage, and regenerated injured tissue. Scientists at Mayo tell me this will soon be tested on humans. â¢ Drug-releasing stents: People at risk for heart disease who have a blockage in the vessels supplying blood to their hearts may undergo an angioplasty to open the vessel. Afterward, doctors often insert a stent (a mesh tube) to continue holding the artery open. The newest stents serve a dual role: They also release medication that prevents scar tissue from developing. â¢ CRP testing: You should have your cholesterol levels checked regularly. But you might also ask your doctor about getting your C-reactive protein, or CRP, checked. It is a marker for inflammation, a powerful risk factor for heart disease. Changes in diet and exercise can usually reduce high CRP levels.","Gupta: Death is not a single event; it's a process that can be interrupted .

"CNN (CNN) -- Veteran DJ and TV personality Jimmy Savile, who entertained generations of British children on television and radio, has died at the age of 84. Savile was one of the most recognizable figures in British showbiz from the 1960s to the 1980s, presenting shows on BBC TV and radio. He was the first host of the BBC's hugely popular ""Top of the Pops"" music show, and his own program, ""Jim'll Fix It,"" ran for almost 20 years. The show saw him helping to grant the wishes of hundreds of children, ""fixing it"" for them to take part in episodes of their favorite TV shows, sing with chart-topping bands, and meet their heroes. In the most famous ""fix,"" he arranged for an entire Cub Scout troop to eat their lunch on a roller-coaster as it sped around its track -- with predictably messy results. At the height of its popularity, the BBC says, ""Jim'll Fix It"" attracted up to 20,000 letters a week. A colorful character, Savile was as well known for his bright tracksuits, chunky jewelry and cigars as he was for his catchphrases: ""Now then, now then,"" and ""How's about that then?"" which were much copied by impressionists. Mark Thompson, Director-General of the BBC, said he was ""very sad"" to hear of Savile's death. ""From 'Top of the Pops' to 'Jim'll Fix It,' Jimmy's unique style entertained generations of BBC audiences. Like millions of viewers and listeners, we shall miss him greatly."" Savile was also well known for his fund-raising efforts, and ran several marathons for charity. He was awarded a knighthood for his charitable work. Savile's body was found at his home in Leeds, northern England, on Saturday. Police were called to the scene, but said they were not treating his death as suspicious. UK media reports said he had recently been hospitalized suffering from pneumonia.","Jimmy Savile entertained generations of British children on TV and radio .

"(CNN) -- Bill and Hillary Clinton never fail to confound Americans. Their political and public service accomplishments often appear diminished by the stumbles in their private lives, real or imagined. No holder of high office, obviously, is ever judged simply for policy initiatives, and that seems especially true of the Clintons. As Hillary Clinton positions herself for a likely 2016 run for president, the scrutiny she will endure extends, inevitably, to her husband. Journalists and critics on the right will probably have to mine new material, however. What happened in Arkansas and the Oval Office have been more topically tortured than Benghazi. Fortunately, for the traffickers of faux outrage, the Clintons have offered up the Clinton Foundation, a ponderously complex institution that looks like it might be troubled by internecine squabbles, naked ambition, a touch of greed and an almost impossible to identify set of operational boundaries. Regardless of altruistic goals and achievements, the Clinton Foundation has blended friendships and political relationships along with corporate and nonprofit endeavors in a structure that will feed material into the Hannity-Limbaugh-O'Reilly GOP commentary complex through the next presidential election cycle. Clinton will likely not cross a room in the next few years without it being framed through the perspective of her unstated political plans to become president. News that she was moving with her staff into two floors of the Time-Life building, where the Clinton Foundation is located, may be a part of what prompted the New York Times to publish a detailed account of the nonprofit's operations and their possible implications for a second Clinton presidency. The former secretary of state is planning initiatives on jobs, women and children under the organization's new title of the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation, which, undoubtedly, will add to her already substantial resume. There are, of course, always legitimate questions for global nongovernmental organizations and potential conflicts between their programs and the profit motives of their large corporate donors. Increasing her association with the foundation means Clinton will be judged partly by the operational relationships of an institution that has previously been driven by her husband's global celebrity and fundraising skills. This is not a uniformly positive development. During her primary race against President Barack Obama, the Clinton Foundation ran a deficit of $40 million, possibly because its fundraising was competing with her campaign's. Even though the foundation and the associated Clinton Global Initiative and the Clinton Health Access Initiative had operating revenues of $214 million last year, it still ended with an $8 million deficit. The Clintons are either very astute at navigating the nether world between corporate millions and honorable charity work, or they are still dealing with the bedazzlement of wealth and power and haven't figured out how to clearly understand what is appropriate and ethical. The latter can hardly be argued. American presidential politics runs on the billions of multi-national businesses and winning elections is inextricably connected to finessing that dependency to give the converse appearance of independence. The Times report suggests the Clintons are still figuring this out, and regardless of any philanthropic motivations to help with global problems, they may be harmed by their institutional ineptitude. One example cited by The Times is a consultancy named Teneo, which was founded by a close associate of Bill Clinton. Monthly retainer fees were said to be up to $250,000 and the former president was a paid advisor, until the bad publicity and collapse of Jon Corzine's MF Global investment firm, a significant client. Hillary Clinton was reportedly angry about the negative media but it's unknown if she had previously commented or had ethical concerns regarding Teneo's recruitment of Clinton Foundation corporate donors to be clients. Surely, all of this is not without meaning? Well, maybe. The Clintons cannot be accused of not trying. Their political ambitions are as grand as their visions of global philanthropy. In just the 2013 meeting of the Clinton Global Initiative, public and private organizations made more than 70 commitments totaling $1.6 billion, estimated to impact about 2 million American lives. The Clinton Foundation has created significant partnerships around the planet to resolve issues related to health and wellness, economic inequality, climate change and childhood obesity. Execution in all of these endeavors has been, undoubtedly, imperfect, and, yes, Hillary Clinton's public evaluation as a presidential candidate may be connected to some of those shortcomings. But the greater failure would be to make no effort to help improve a troubled world. Perhaps the Clintons should simply return to Hope, Arkansas, rent a little house on a quiet side street and paint self-portrait watercolors. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of James C. Moore.","The Clinton Foundation has come under scrutiny for its operations and finances .
James Moore: As Hillary Clinton will likely run for president, critics are looking for mistakes .
He says evaluation of Clinton as a presidential candidate may be tied to the foundation .

"(CNN) -- Something I love about American politics: A political candidacy can be sunk by a fishing license. Liz Cheney's run for the Republican Senate nomination from Wyoming suffered a setback after it was discovered that she bought a $24 fishing license last year without having lived in the state for a year. With surreal seriousness, a spokesman for the Wyoming Game and Fish Department said of the scandal, ""We have an ongoing investigation. The law is extremely complicated."" A Republican strategist living in Wyoming added, ""It's a serious misstep. Allegedly poaching in a state where being a resident sportsman is, by law, an earned privilege. Wyoming people will take this very seriously."" Will they really? The primary election between challenger Cheney and the popular incumbent, Sen. Mike Enzi, is a whole year away, and I struggle to believe that it'll be lost for want of a fishing license. But it is a sign of trouble ahead for Cheney. Polls show that she's perceived to be an outsider -- and she's starting to learn that you can make a big name for yourself in national conservative politics but still fail to get traction at a state level. For good reason. Cheney's only real, substantive link to Wyoming is through her father, Dick, who served for 10 years as a congressman. Otherwise, she was born in Wisconsin, lived much of her life in the D.C. area, went to college in Colorado and Chicago and made her name working for the George W. Bush administration. Not a lot of Wyoming in that CV at all. Instead, her credentials to represent the state are partly political rather than local. Cheney is a talented administrator and activist -- a strong public speaker who can bring a tea party crowd to its feet. The level of respect that she's engendered speaks to her abilities, but also her links to the national, rather than Wyoming, political establishment. When The Washington Post wrote a friendly profile of Cheney, the Daily Caller (significantly, a scrappy conservative website) took the big names quoted in support of her and showed up their hyperbole. ""She was tea party before there was a tea party,"" said Mary Matalin (that was clever). ""She is not just her father's daughter,"" said Bill Kristol (what else could she be?!). ""I was excited about Palin; I'm more excited about Liz,"" said Michael Goldfarb (big shoes to fill). The most absurd remark came from Matalin: ""[Cheney] really is a cowgirl through and through, and raised by accident in Washington. Babies don't move wherever they want; they have to go with their parents."" Now, Matalin ought to know that cowgirls are raised, not made, and babies rarely show a preference for one state over another. Although the image of baby Liz in a ten gallon hat crying for Wyoming is a beguiling one. So Cheney has arrived in Wyoming with a lot of national conservative sentiment behind her but precious little local backing. That's reflected in her campaign, which has had a lot more to say about undoing the Obama administration than standing up for her state. Her basic argument is that A) Republican incumbent Enzi is too nice to Obama and B) ""obstructionism"" is ""patriotism."" Perhaps there's some local right-wing sentiment that agrees Enzi has been bipartisan once too often, but Cheney is mistaken if she thinks that her state will vote for someone who pitches herself purely as a ""Senator No."" That sort of thing gets a big applause at meetings of the Conservative Political Action Conference, but it might it might not be so attractive to Wyoming voters looking for someone to bring home the bacon. And do we really want yet another senator who refuses to do business with anyone? It's not as if Congress is unpopular because it's too compromising. Finally, there's the problem of Cheney being an all-round anachronism in this age of tea party populism. Yes, her gender and relative youth make her seem like fresh leadership. But her name is a hindrance and deserves to be. America needs to put its political dynasties out to graze: It's perverse that a republic of free people should keep voting for the scions of the Kennedys, Clintons, Bushes or Cheneys. The USA is starting to look less like a democracy and more like an aristocracy. Furthermore, Cheney's politics are a little old-fashioned, too. She might be on the zeitgeist by being for same-sex marriage, but her neoconservative stance on foreign policy is about 10 years out of date. The next generation of Republican leadership is going to be populist, small state, critical of getting overinvolved overseas, civil libertarian and intensely loyal to its birthplace. Carpetbaggers need not apply. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Timothy Stanley.","Timothy Stanley: Running for Senate, Liz Cheney misstepped over fishing license .

"(EW.com) -- At this point, Robert De Niro has built an entire subgenre of movies in which he sticks his tongue out at his cinematic legacy. After inventing our modern idea of a wiseguy in films like ""The Godfather Part II"" and ""Goodfellas,"" the actor has spent much of the last 20 years lampooning it in farces like the funny ""Analyze This"" (and its disappointing sequel ""Analyze That"") and the very funny ""Meet the Parents"" (and its very disappointing sequels ""Meet the Fockers"" and ""Little Fockers""). The results have been mixed, but De Niro's star hasn't faded â maybe because the line between those movies and his more serious work (eg, ""Silver Linings Playbook"") has remained so clear. But the new comedy-thriller ""The Family,"" directed and co-written by Luc Besson (""The Fifth Element""), doesn't just wink at De Niro's history, it leans on it, hard. The actor might as well be playing an older version of his Scorsese-era persona as Giovanni Manzoni, a former mob boss who snitched and now has to hide in the Witness Protection Program in northern France. With a grizzled FBI agent (Tommy Lee Jones) as a guardian angel, the Manzoni family members all try to act as humdrum as possible to avoid attention. Giovanni pretends to be an author at work on a WWII book. His tough-as-nails wife (Michelle Pfeiffer) plays hausfrau, his hot-tempered daughter (""Glee's"" Dianna Agron) flirts with her math tutor, and his whip smart son (John D'Leo) makes allies at school. These fish-out-of-water B-plots mostly look for laughs in the Manzoni family's inverted, Addams-esque morality. To them, crime is good, normal people are boring, and a brutal beating is a perfectly acceptable solution to mundane problems like a stolen pencil case or a rude plumber. Sometimes it works, especially in Pfeiffer's scenes, where she shows off a darkly comic edge that hasn't had this much of a showcase since the last time she played a wiseguy's wife in 1988's ""Married to the Mob."" Yet the movie's violence level is so strangely high that it jars the comedy. There's only so long you can laugh at a person getting savagely pummeled before you start imagining how much it would hurt. ""The Family"" also doesn't have any real twists in store beyond its basic setup. You know that Giovanni's past â in the form of bounty-hunting hitmen â will catch up to him. And it does, turning the third act into a generic thriller with a weirdly high body count. Before that, though, there are some memorable scenes, including one wry meta-moment in which the movie outright acknowledges the fact that Robert De Niro himself is playing Giovanni. It'll probably make you laugh â and wonder if the movie is about to head in a much smarter, kookier direction. (It isn't.) But mostly it makes you wish that you were watching De Niro add to his movie legacy instead of scrapping it for gags. Grade: B- . See the original story at EW.com.

"(CNN) -- Barely two days ago, their paths crossed in the worst possible circumstances -- a man armed with an assault rifle had entered Antoinette Tuff's school, and she called police. On Thursday, Tuff and Kendra McCray, the 911 dispatcher on the other end of that line, were together again, sharing an emotional hug and tears before sitting down to recount the episode with CNN's Anderson Cooper. ""We made it!"" Tuff joyfully declared, with McCray responding, ""We did."" The atmosphere for the reunion was starkly different than their original encounter as voices on opposite ends of a telephone line. That happened at 12:51 p.m. Tuesday when, according to DeKalb County, Georgia, Police Department spokeswoman Mekka Parrish, authorities got their first call about a shooting at the Ronald E. McNair Discovery Learning Academy in Decatur, just outside Atlanta. Shortly before that, the gunman had slipped into the school and gone into its main office, where he shot one round into the ground. ""I knew then that it was for real,"" recalled Tuff, who was in there with him. ""And that I could lose my life."" It was then that Tuff, bookkeeper in that school's front office, dialed 911. But she wasn't the only person that could be heard a few miles away at police dispatch -- at times, there was the voice of the suspect, later identified as Michael Brandon Hill, in the background. The gunman used Tuff as a conduit to relay information to police, which in this case meant McCray, who took Tuff's call at the dispatch center. In their voices, both women sounded calm throughout the call -- even as gunshots were ringing out around Tuff, and later when the suspect reached into a bag to reload his AK-47-type assault rifle. But inside, they now admit, they were terrified. McCray recalled Thursday how her hands were shaking, though she knew that she couldn't reveal her fears in her voice. And Tuff said she was trying to incorporate the lessons she'd learned in church to stay strong for herself, the 800-plus elementary school students in the classrooms behind her -- and for the gunman whom she came to feel for. ""I was actually praying on the inside,"" she recalled. ""I was terrified, but I just started praying."" Antoinette Tuff hailed a hero . Early in the call, Tuff was blunt in what amounted to a vital assessment of the situation: ""He doesn't want the kids. He wants the police. So back off,"" she told McCray. In the next breath, Tuff asked him, ""And what else sir?"" The suspect darted from the office to outside a few times, becoming particularly ""agitated"" in Tuff's words when police fired back with bullets ""coming from everywhere."" ""And I said to him, come back in here right now,"" said the school bookkeeper, who admitted she had to go ""to the bathroom so bad"" the entire ordeal. ""... Don't worry about it, stay with me, we're both going to be safe,"" she told the man. The scariest moment, Tuff said, came when -- after having fired shots, several times, at police positioned outside -- the suspect went into his bag, reloaded his gun and packed his pants and jacket pockets with yet more bullets. ""I knew when he made the last call that he was going to go,"" she recalled on CNN. ""Because he had loaded up to go."" But the tone changed over the next few frenetic minutes, much like what was happening at the school. In the beginning, the gunman appeared ""like he didn't care,"" giving the impression that he'd come ""in purposely knowing that he was going to die and take lives with him,"" said Tuff. But his language, and actions, softened -- and so did Tuff's feelings for him. ""I really began to feel sorry for him,"" she told Cooper, adding that the suspect told her he was off his medication and considering suicide. ""I knew that where he was at mentally was not a good place. But I knew that he was there, for whatever particular reason, in life."" The man with the rifle eventually let it be known, via Tuff, that he was no longer threatening to shoot any police officers who approached; by then, he was communicating with them about where he should put his gun, where he should get down on the ground in surrender, and how police would come and get him. As all of this unfolded, the dispatcher talking to Tuff largely remained silent -- except a few brief acknowledgments about what she'd heard and the constant clatter of her keyboard. In her heart and behind the scenes, though, McCray was sweating it out. Thankfully, she had a ""true hero"" partner in Tuff who, with her clear descriptions and calm demeanor, made it so the call-taker and thus police could very easily ""visualize what she was seeing and what she was going through."" Even to the end, emotions ran high. The suspect started getting ""agitated"" after he'd decided to surrender, standing back up and taking a drink of water because police had yet to come and get him. Recognizing what was happening, McCray said she put her phone on mute. ""I'm hollering across the (dispatch) room: 'Hey, he's getting agitated, we need to move.'"" They did get inside the Decatur school in a flurry soon thereafter, surrounding and detaining Hill. That was then, finally, both Tuff and McCray could breathe a sigh of relief. ""You did great,"" McCray said to Tuff 31 long minutes after that first call came in. ""You did great."" Hill, meanwhile, was swiftly taken away by law enforcement officers and now sits in a Georgia jail awaiting charges that likely will include aggravated assault on a police officer, making terroristic threats and false imprisonment, according to authorities. Tuff would like to visit him, calling him a ""hurting soul"" who she'd like to help. ""We all go through something,"" she said, with her 911 call reflecting on her challenges raising a disabled child and suicidal thoughts after the end of her marriage after more than two decades. ""And I believe that God gives us a purpose in life."" And Tuff believes she was meant to be at McNair on Tuesday, even though she'd originally been scheduled to be off. She thinks she was meant to be up front to first encounter the gunman -- in that location at that time because she'd been delayed from going back to her desk. She said it was all part of God's plan -- for her, for the suspect and for McNair's students. But that doesn't mean Tuff knew she had it in her, to face down a gunman and potential death so calmly, and to live to tell about it. ""No, no. If somebody would have told me that I was going to be doing that that day, I wouldn't have believed it,"" she told CNN. ""God has a way of showing you what's really in you.""

"(CNN) -- New Jersey Sen. Robert Menendez felt sick after reading it. The White House says it is ""irrelevant"" to Russia's proposal for Syria to hand over chemical weapons. Certainly, Russian President Vladimir Putin's direct appeal to the American people over the Syria crisis has prompted a flurry of commentary in response. But do his claims stack up? We take a look at some of the most contentious claims in Putin's New York Times opinion piece. From the outset, Russia has advocated peaceful dialogue enabling Syrians to develop a compromise plan for their own future. Not exactly. Russia has continued to supply the al-Assad regime with military hardware including attack helicopters, air defense systems, and military advisers. No one doubts that poison gas was used in Syria. But there is every reason to believe it was used not by the Syrian army but by opposition forces to provoke intervention by their powerful foreign patrons, who would be siding with the fundamentalists. Not according to the U.S., Britain and others who claim the evidence is clear that Bashar al-Assad's forces were behind the attack. ""We assess that the scenario in which the opposition executed the attack on August 21 is highly unlikely,"" a White House statement said. ""The body of information used to make this assessment includes intelligence pertaining to the regime's preparations for this attack and its means of delivery, multiple streams of intelligence about the attack itself and its effect, our post-attack observations, and the differences between the capabilities of the regime and the opposition."" Britain agrees, with Prime Minister David Cameron saying last week that there was ""further"" evidence that al-Assad's forces used chemical weapons, after research by the UK military laboratories in Porton Down suggested that traces of sarin gas in the soil and on clothing taken from a patient who was treated near an alleged attack were unlikely to have been faked. Millions around the world increasingly see America not as a model of democracy but as relying solely on brute force. Putin's condemnation of brute force sits uneasily with Moscow's own track record of force during a conflict with Chechen separatists that claimed tens of thousands of lives, many of them civilians. In 1999, Putin took to the New York Times opinion page to defend Russian action in Chechnya, arguing that ""decisive armed intervention was the only way to prevent further casualties both within and far outside the borders of Chechnya."" And Georgians won't have forgotten Russia's invasion of their country five years ago last month, when Putin served as prime minister. My working and personal relationship with President Obama is marked by growing trust. Remember Edward Snowden? Obama took office pledging a ""reset"" in ties with Moscow. But the famously awkward body language at the G8 summit in June was for many a sign of how that has gone. That was even before the former NSA contractor was granted asylum in Russia, despite American requests that he be extradited. And back in 2011, Putin accused Obama's then-secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, of encouraging opposition protests after parliamentary elections that December. Time for another reset? We are all different, but when we ask for the Lord's blessings, we must not forget that God created us equal. Russia's gay community might not be feeling very equal right now. A vaguely worded anti-gay propaganda law was passed overwhelmingly in Parliament this year and signed into law by Putin. The law bans public discussion of gay rights and relationships anywhere children might hear it. Those found in breach of it can be fined, or deported if they are foreigners. It is extremely dangerous to encourage people to see themselves as exceptional, whatever the motivation. So ""unique"" is OK, then? The Financial Times reported last year on a strategy document produced by a Kremlin commission that argued, ""Thanks to the unifying role of the Russian people ... a unique sociocultural civilisational community on the historical territory of the Russian state has formed: the multinational Russian nation.""","Russian president makes appeal to American people in New York Times .
He says poison gas was probably used by opposition, not Syrian army .

"(CNN) -- A cease-fire has been forged between the Philippine army and the separatist Moro National Liberation Front, state media reported on Friday, citing Vice President Jejomar Binay. He made the announcement during an interview. The truce, which was to take effect at midnight, effectively ended five days of fighting that left people dead and wounded. The army and the militants were locked in a tense standoff in southern Zamboanga City. Binay said Defense Secretary Voltaire Gazmin and MNLF founding chair Nur Misuari informed him of the cease-fire. Binay said that he will fly to the city on Saturday to help in the peace arrangements. Days of unrest . The unrest has fueled fears of increased instability in a region where the central government is pursuing a new peace plan after decades of violence. The crisis in Zamboanga City began when large numbers of rebels from the Muslim militant group came ashore at the start of the week. The outbreaks of violence have killed 11 rebels, five members of the security forces and two civilians, Brig. Gen. Domingo Tutaan, a spokesman for the Philippine military said Friday. Dozens of others have been wounded, he said. Authorities estimated about 180 rebels are holding roughly 170 hostages in six districts. Security forces blockaded affected areas, and the two sides have sporadically exchanged gunfire over the past five days. Speaking Friday at the Armed Forces of the Philippines' headquarters in Zamboanga City, President Benigno Aquino III warned rebel hostage-takers that they face the use of force if they further threaten civilians. ""There are limits, if there is an increased threat to the safety to innocent civilians,"" Aquino said. ""There are lines that they cannot cross. If they cross those lines, we will be obligated to use the state's force against them."" Some hostages have managed to escape, and about 20 rebels have been detained, authorities said. Thousands of people have been evacuated from the rebel-held districts in Zamboanga, a city of about 800,000 on the southwestern tip of the island of Mindanao. Separatist movements . The MNLF, a separatist movement founded in 1971 by Misuari with the aim of establishing an autonomous region for Muslims in the mainly Catholic Philippines, signed a peace deal with the central government in Manila in 1996. But some of its members have broken away to continue a violent campaign. Last month, Misuari issued a ""declaration of independence"" for the Moro nation -- referring to Mindanao's indigenous Muslim population -- after complaining that the MNLF had been left out of a recent wealth-sharing agreement with another insurgent group, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, which has fought for decades to set up an independent Islamic state on resource-rich Mindanao. Under the agreement signed this year, Muslims will get a 75% share of income derived from the exploitation of metallic minerals in the area -- reported to include gold and copper. Aquino wants to achieve a lasting peace in the region by 2016, when his term ends. Agreements have yet to be reached on power-sharing and normalization, which means giving up arms. A report published last year by the International Crisis Group warned that the peace process needed to find ways to support insurgents as they build normal, civilian lives. CNN's TIm Schwarz and Peter Shadbolt contributed to this report.","NEW: Vice President announces cease-fire for midnight Friday .

"(CNN) -- One of the most valuable routes in the airline industry is the one that joins New York to London. It is the world's busiest route, one particularly frequented by business travelers, and currently, it is dominated by United Airlines. All that is set to change, thanks to a pivotal partnership between Delta Airlines and Virgin Atlantic. Last month, the two airlines unveiled a codeshare agreement across 108 routes, with Delta acquiring a 49% share of the British carrier. For Delta, the deal provides access to a market that, though lucrative, has been difficult for them to crack. ""Heathrow is the most important destination for the U.S. business traveler, and we've not been able to provide the global frequency that our customers need,"" admits Edward Bastian, Delta's president. ""Virgin was the best way to get to them."" Unlike Virgin Atlantic, which has experienced two years of steady financial losses, Delta has been in an upward expansion. It is the fastest-growing carrier in New York -- abetted by a massive expansion of two of the city's major hubs, including a $1.4 billion renovation of Terminal 4 at JFK, and $100 million upgrade of its facilities at LaGuardia Airport. While Delta is gaining momentum in North America, procuring slots at Heathrow has proved arduous for the airline, according to George Ferguson, senior airline and aerospace analyst at Bloomberg Industries. Read more: Luxury jets for the long haul . ""The largest number of slots at Heathrow are dedicated to Virgin and British Airways flights. Delta has had a hard time getting in there,"" he admits. ""This deal really gives them a lot of access to Heathrow, which is an important market in New York."" Currently, Delta has nine flights operating between Heathrow and the U.S. When the partnership takes effect, that number will jump to 23. Compared to Delta, Virgin is a much more niche airline. It serves a smaller, predominately British clientele, providing them with a more upmarket experience. Despite Virgin's strong brand, its image doesn't resonate as well outside the United Kingdom. Ideally, the deal with Delta will introduce the carrier to a wider audience. ""I think the spirit of our company will be very attractive to the U.S.-based customers that Delta currently serves,"" says Craig Kreeger, CEO of Virgin Atlantic Airways. ""I think that by becoming more successful and being able to generate more fans in the United State, it's going to spur even more innovation (at Virgin)."" As the two companies join houses, so to speak, experts are pondering which brand will be more prominent. ""From a Virgin perspective, I expect not much will change, at least not for a while"" says Ferguson. ""Virgin has a pretty strong brand across the Atlantic -- the better brand right now -- and Delta's going to want to leave that in place."" Discover which airport is the worst for delays . Asked if there's a chance Virgin might lose its identity in the process, Kreeger says he's not worried. ""The Virgin brand and Virgin style is one of the things that attracted Delta to us in the first place,"" he says. ""I think they're looking forward to being able to offer their customers more choice."" For the deluge of passengers that fly Delta and Virgin across the pond, the partnership could ideally result in cheaper fares. ""I see them being able to give corporate customers much more options, and I see them really being able to kick off some extensive routes with above-average yields,"" says Ferguson, who adds that in the airline industry, fuller planes usually results in cheaper tickets. ""London and New York are sort of dominated by the financial services business, which has taken it on the chin lately,"" notes Ferguson. ""As a result, you have a consumer that is more price conscious and you need to find a way to get them a cheaper ticket while still making money. That's why you need to get planes full. For Virgin, this is the start of that process.""","Delta takes 49% stake in Virgin Atlantic .

"(CNN) -- Five people were killed and a 6-year-old girl was taken to a hospital after a shooting in a tiny western Illinois village early Wednesday, officials said. The gunman, identified as Rick Odell Smith, 43, was killed after a chase and shootout with police hours later, authorities said. ""There is no reason to believe there is any further danger to the communities or that there are any other suspects,"" Illinois State Police Lt. Col. Todd Kilby said Wednesday. Police said they were called to an apartment building in Manchester -- roughly 40 miles southwest of Springfield -- at about 4:30 a.m. (5:30 a.m. ET). Smith, last known to live in Morgan County, Illinois, forced his way through the back door of an apartment and shot six people inside with a shotgun, police said. Officers found five people dead, Kilby said. Their identities will not be released until autopsies are performed, Kilby said. The dead included two women, one man and two boys, police said. A 6-year-old girl was transported to a hospital with gunshot wounds after the gunman ""put her in the hands of a neighbor,"" Kilby said. She was in critical condition, he said. Witnesses gave police a description of the vehicle in which the attacker fled, and police found Smith in an undisclosed location at about 7:15 a.m., Kilby said. Police chased and eventually exchanged gunfire with Smith, who was wounded. He was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead, Kilby said. He said that Smith and the victims were acquainted, but not related, and that authorities are still investigating the exact nature of the relationship. The victims inside the apartment were related, he said. The incident disrupted the village of about 290 people and surrounding communities, with area schools closing for the day, according to police in nearby Winchester. Manchester is in sparsely populated Scott County. The county had fewer than 6,000 residents as of the 2010 census. ""Fortunately, this type of thing doesn't happen here very often, but this is proof that it can happen,"" Scott County state's attorney Michael Hill told reporters. CNN's Karan Olson, Jason Hanna, Carma Hassan and Kara Devlin contributed to this report.","NEW: Police identify gunman as Rick Odell Smith, 43 .

"(CNN) -- Veteran golfer Ernie Els took advantage of a remarkable collapse by long-time leader Adam Scott to win the British Open for the second time at Royal Lytham and St. Annes Sunday. The 42-year-old South African posted a two-under 68 in testing conditions on the links course in North West England to go into the clubhouse on seven-under 273, but Australia's Scott still looked set to claim his first major title. However, a disastrous run of four straight bogeys from the 15th saw the 32-year-old finish one shot adrift of former world No. 1 Els, who won his fourth major title and his first since claiming the British Open in a playoff in 2002. Son's autism gives veteran star Els added spur . Scott, who had led by four shots going into the final round, pulled his tee shot on the 18th into a bunker, but a fine third left him with an eight-foot putt to force a playoff. It went agonizingly wide of the hole to leave him with a final-round 75 and his hopes of glory cruelly dashed. By contrast, Els finished with a birdie on his final hole and had been on the practice putting green preparing for a possible playoff. He had immediate words of sympathy for the beaten Scott. ""First of all I feel for Adam. He is a great friend of mine,"" he said. ""We both wanted to win very badly but it's the nature of the beast."" A stunned Scott, who had started the day four shots ahead of American Brandt Snedeker and Graeme McDowell of Northern Ireland, admitted he had blown it. ""I'm pretty disappointed. I had it in my hands and managed to hit a poor shot on each of the closing four holes,"" he said. ""But I played so beautifully for most of the week I certainly should not let this get me down."" The expected challenge from Tiger Woods petered out after he made a triple bogey on the par-four sixth. He eventually carded a three-over 73 to end three under alongside playing partner Snedeker in a tie for third. McDowell, the 2010 US Open champion, also disappointed and fell away with a 75 to tie for fifth at two under with England's world number one Luke Donald, who raced up the leaderboard with a 69. Els is the 16th different winner of a golf major in a row, but it looked an unlikely scenario when he was six behind Scott after dropping two shots to the turn. But he picked up birdies at the 10th, 12th and 14th before his last-hole flourish to put the pressure on the Australian, which eventually paid dividends. Els has slipped down the world rankings in recent years and did not qualify to play in this year's U.S. Masters at Augusta. He had gone without a win in 36 major starts since his 2002 British Open triumph at Muirfield, but had never lost faith. ""It was my time for some reason,"" Els said. ""A lot of people never thought I would win another one. I started believing this year."" He is the same age as last year's surprise British Open winner Darren Clarke, who missed the cut in his title defense.","Ernie Els wins British Open at Royal Lytham and St Annes .

"(CNN) -- A federal appeals court has upheld an obstruction of justice conviction against Barry Bonds, according to court documents released Friday. The court ruled that the evasiveness of the testimony the former baseball star gave to a grand jury investigating sales of performance-enhancing drugs was sufficient to convict him. In an opinion filed by the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, Judge Mary M. Schroeder said the three-judge panel rejected Bonds' contention that he could only have been indicted for obstruction if his testimony had been flatly false. Attorneys for Bonds had argued that Bonds' statements to the grand jury were factually true, and that language in the federal statute under which he was charged is unconstitutionally vague. The appeals court rejected that argument. ""When factually true statements are misleading or evasive, they can prevent the grand jury from obtaining truthful and responsive answers,"" Schroeder wrote. ""They may therefore obstruct and impede the administration of justice within the meaning of the federal criminal statute."" Bonds' testimony in December 2003 was part of an investigation that targeted his personal trainer, Greg Anderson, and employees of the California drug testing laboratory known as the Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative, or BALCO. The testimony that led to Bonds' conviction came when a grand jury prosecutor asked Bonds whether Anderson ever gave him ""anything that required a syringe to inject yourself with."" Bonds told the grand jury that only his personal doctors ""ever touch me,"" and he then veered off the subject to say he never talked baseball with Anderson. A jury in U.S. district court convicted Bonds on the obstruction count in April 2011. A mistrial was declared on three perjury counts of perjury after jurors reported they couldn't reach an agreement. Prosecutors declined to retry Bonds on the perjury charges. He was sentenced to two years' probation and 30 days of house arrest. The seven-time National League MVP, now 49, set baseball's all-time home run record in 2007. The San Francisco Giants did not renew his contract after that season and though he never officially retired, he has not played since.","Evasive testimony sufficient for obstruction conviction, federal appeals court rules .

"(CNN) -- German Thomas Bach was elected as the new president of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in succession to Jacques Rogge following a ballot of 94 members of the IOC in Buenos Aires Tuesday. Bach won on the second round of voting, beating off the challenge of five other contenders for the top job in the Olympic organization. He has been elected for an initial eight year term to succeed the 71-year-old Rogge, who has stepped down after 12 years in charge. Bach paid tribute to Rogge as he addressed IOC members following his election. ""You are leaving a great legacy and a strong foundation on which we can continue to build the future of the IOC,"" he said. ""This is an overwhelming sign of trust and confidence,"" added Bach, who is the ninth president in the 119-year history of the IOC. Ukrainian athletics great Sergey Bubka, Singapore's Ng Ser Miang, Wu Ching-Kuo of Taiwan, Switzerland's Denis Oswald and Richard Carrion of Puerto Rico were the unsuccessful candidates. Bach achieved a majority in the second round by polling 49 votes. Carrion was the next best with 29. Former world pole vault champion Bubka received just four. ""I want to win your confidence too,"" said Bach, referring to his beaten opponents. ""I know of the great responsibility of being president of the IOC."" The 59-year-old Bach is a lawyer by profession, but represented West Germany at the 1976 Olympics in Montreal, winning a gold medal in fencing's foil discipline. He was one of four IOC vice-presidents, having been a member since 1991, serving during this period on the anti-doping commission. An outspoken critic of doping, Bach commissioned an academic report, published in July, which alleged that like their East German neighbors, West German athletes had also been involved in malpractice during the Cold War and before the unification of the two countries. His first task in succeeding Rogge will be to steer the IOC through the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi, which has been dogged by controversy of Russia's new anti-gay legislation, concerns over budget and fears of warm weather. Under rules adopted in by the IOC in 1999, which ended lifetime terms for its delegates and presidents, Bach will initially serve for eight years, with the possibility of one further term of four years.","German Thomas Bach is the new president of the International Olympic Committee .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Actor Charlton Heston died at his Beverly Hills home at the age of 84 Saturday, his family said. Heston was suffering the late stages of Alzheimer's disease. Heston, known for portrayals of larger than life figure including Moses and Ben Hur, was suffering the late stages of Alzheimer's disease. Heston's wife of 64 years, Lydia, was at his side at the time of his death, according to the family statement. Heston is survived by a son, a daughter and three grandchildren. ""We knew him as an adoring husband, a kind and devoted father, and a gentle grandfather, with an infectious sense of humor,"" the family said. ""He served these far greater roles with tremendous faith, courage and dignity. He loved deeply, and he was deeply loved."" While no funeral plans have been announced, the family said it would hold a private memorial service. The Internet Movie Database listed 126 movies and television production credits for Heston, starting in 1941. He rose to fame in the 1950s with starring movie roles including Ben Hur, for which he won an Oscar. He played Moses in the ""Ten Commandments."" Heston's last acting credit was for playing an elderly Josef Mengele, the Auschwitz Nazi surgeon who performed medical experiments on concentration camp refugees during World War Two in the 2003 movie ""My Father, Rua Alguem 5555."" Heston was also known for his political activism. He was a high-profile supporter of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and his civil rights movement. He attended King's 1963 March on Washington and stood near the podium as King delivered his ""I have a dream"" speech. He was president of the National Rifle Association from 1998 to 2002, a role that cast him as a conservative. Heston was born John Charles Carter in Evanston, Illinois, on October. 4, 1924. He took the surname Heston after his mother divorced and remarried when he was 10. E-mail to a friend .","Heston was suffering the late stages of Alzheimer's disease .

"(CNN) -- The New York Yankees' Andy Pettitte, the winningest pitcher in post-season history, will retire after this season, the Yankees said Friday. Pettitte, 41, owns a 255-152 career record with a 3.86 ERA in 529 appearances over 18 Major League seasons. In the post-season, he went 19-11 with a 3.81 ERA in 44 career starts. It's still possible for Pettitte to see another post-season, since the 80-73 Yankees are still eligible to go to the playoffs in the post-season as a wild card. ""I've reached the point where I know that I've left everything I have out there on that field. The time is right. I've exhausted myself, mentally and physically, and that's exactly how I want to leave this game."" The lefty played most of his career for the Yankees but had a brief stint in the last decade with the Houston Astros. His career wasn't without controversy. In December 2007, he was cited by a group led by former Sen. George Mitchell in a report on illegal use of performance-enhancing drugs in baseball. Pettitte was among dozens named in its findings, and the report became the basis of a hearing two months later by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. He later admitted to using growth hormones in 2002 and 2004, one of the few players to admit to the use of such drugs. What will future hold for Yankees? 'Tip my cap' to Yankees fans . But Pettitte's career has been filled with highlights. A three-time All-Star and 2001 American League Championship Series MVP, he's the only pitcher in the majors to pitch at least 17 seasons without a losing season, the Yankees said. This year, he has gone 10-10 with 3.93 ERA in 28 starts. Pettitte will end his career as one of 12 players to spend at least 15 seasons with the Yankees, the team said. A Louisiana native and Texas resident, he pitched three seasons with the Houston Astros and appeared in the 2005 World Series, when the Chicago White Sox swept the Astros. He also posted a winning record in each of the first 13 seasons of his career, from 1995 to 2007. That was the third-longest such streak to begin a career all time, the Yankees said, behind Hall of Famers Grover Cleveland Alexander, at 17, and Cy Young, at 15. ""I'm announcing my retirement prior to the conclusion of our season because I want all of our fans to know now, while I'm still wearing this uniform, how grateful I am for their support throughout my career. I want to have the opportunity to tip my cap to them during these remaining days and thank them for making my time here with the Yankees so special,"" Pettitte said.

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- When Ken Umeano went to watch the summer sci-fi blockbuster ""District 9,"" he stormed out after 30 minutes. ""District 9"" was directed by South African filmmaker Neill Blomkamp, who also co-wrote it. ""I was so angry,"" said Umeano, a Nigeria native living in Atlanta. ""They were showing Nigerians as corrupt, eating aliens, saying they have sex with aliens. I could not watch that."" The movie set in South Africa is a story about an alien space ship that breaks down over Johannesburg -- leaving the stranded creatures in a fierce battle with humans. In the film, Nigerians jump at an opportunity to exploit the aliens, who are being kicked out by their South African hosts. A Nigerian gangster provides the aliens with a range of paid services including prostitutes, food and weapons. The depiction has sparked an outcry, including a Facebook group condemning its portrayal of Nigerians. Officials in the West African country have banned it and are demanding an apology from Sony Pictures, the film's principle distributor through Tri-Star Pictures. ""Why do they want to denigrate Nigerians as criminals, cannibals and prostitutes who sleep with extra-terrestrial animals?"" said Dora Akunyili, information minister. ""We've had enough with the stereotypes they have branded us with ... we are not going to sit back and allow people to stigmatize us."" The movie will not be shown in Nigeria unless Sony apologizes and edits out any references to the country, she said. Sony pointed out that Nigerian authorities cleared the film for release, and it screened in that country for two weeks. ""'District 9' is a work of science fiction, and no offense was intended toward any country or person,"" the company said.  Watch how the film reflects South Africa's former apartheid Â» . The film was directed by South African filmmaker Neill Blomkamp, who also co-wrote it, and it was adapted from Blomkamp's 2005 short, ""Alive in Joburg."" ""Lord of the Rings"" producer-director Peter Jackson produced ""District 9."" Sony's involvement was limited to distribution. Malawian actor, Eugene Khumbanyiwa, 33, who plays the top Nigerian gangster, defended his role in the movie. ""I was just doing my job as an actor,"" Khumbanyiwa said. ""My job was to play a character as an underworld gangster and I did ... I'm just going to run away from this whole controversy."" Khumbanyiwa said the outcry was a surprise because his Nigerian co-stars did not have an issue with it. The scenes depicting Nigerians make up less than 10 minutes of the 113-minute film. In some places, Nigerians are shown trying to eat alien flesh to cure illnesses and acquire superhuman powers. Khumbanyiwa's character is named Obesandjo -- which Akunyili said is an attack on former Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo. Some Nigerians said the movie feeds off stereotypes associated with the country. ""Everyone has this image of Nigeria,"" Umeano said. ""A lot of people have given Nigeria a bad name, but that does not mean the whole country is bad."" While Clement Nyirenda believes the director should have used a fictional country, he said the outcry is much ado about nothing. After all, he said, the Nigerian movie industry, Nollywood, is filled with the same characterizations. ""The (Nollywood) movies show Nigerians as witch doctors, corrupt, a lot worse,"" Nyirenda said. ""Nigeria is mostly known for 419 scams ... the government officials should focus on cleaning the image."" The term ""419 scams"" refers to spam e-mails that ask for money and bank information. Akunyili said the country is trying to ""rebrand itself away from such images."" The Nollywood industry is undergoing a makeover, too, she added. ""District 9"" made $73 million in its first 10 days. Blomkamp, who grew up in Johannesburg, told CNN last month that he didn't want the sci-fi tale about aliens and apartheid to be defined by politics. ""I didn't want to go, 'Here's a whole bunch of people oppressed by this apartheid-esque society' and beat people over the head with it,"" Blomkamp said. ""I rather wanted to say this is the city I grew up in, this is what it felt like.""

"(CNN) -- ""Unbelievable"" and an ""explosion"" is how Floyd Mayweather is selling his tangle with Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez in Las Vegas. Whether Mayweather's ambitious billing of the bout will transpire remains to be seen, but what is not in doubt is the fight will generate the biggest purse in boxing history -- $41.5 million for Mayweather, already one of the world's highest-paid athletes. The man regularly described as the best pound-for-pound fighter will earn even more cash Saturday in the sport's showbiz home by claiming a share of pay-per-view takings. ""This fight is truly unbelievable,"" Mayweather, who briefly unseated Tiger Woods as Forbes' best-paid athlete, in 2012, told CNN. ""Man, this is all excitement. Canelo is young, strong, dedicated to his craft. I'm a legend in the sport. ""Canelo wants that No. 1 spot. Myself, I want to remain at the top. So it'll be an explosion."" Alvarez, promoted by one of Mayweather's past arch-rivals, Oscar De La Hoya, is the latest challenger to attempt to end the 36-year-old's unblemished record. De La Hoya won't be at the MGM Grand supporting his charge, though, having entered rehab this week. Following Mayweather's defeat of Robert Guerrero in May -- the former's first fight after spending two months in jail in connection with an incident of domestic violence -- he improved to 44-0. De La Hoya, Ricky Hatton, Arturo Gatti and Miguel Cotto are among those who have been unable to down the technically proficient American, while a Mayweather-Manny Pacquiao blockbuster has yet to materialize. But Alvarez comes in undefeated, too, compiling a record of 42 victories and a draw. The 23-year-old has registered more knockouts than Mayweather, 30 to 26, although the Mexican's foes are generally considered inferior. ""Canelo is a good boxer,"" Mayweather said. ""He's strong, he's a good puncher. He's done things right to be undefeated at such a young age. ""But I think it's going to be very, very difficult for him come Saturday."" Alvarez isn't fazed, even if he is expected to weigh in at 152 pounds, a fraction lighter than usual. ""I don't care about his record,"" Alvarez was quoted as saying by Britain's Guardian newspaper. ""I'm not coming to make a good fight, I'm coming to win. ""When you fight Floyd you have to be ready for every aspect of the fight. You have to be able to adjust mentally as well as physically. ""I have to be very smart and ready to change my plan at any time. You'll see how I do it. You'll see how I beat him. I'm calm and I'm just ready to fight."" If things go as planned, Mayweather will keep on winning. He is a 1/3 favorite with British bookmaker William Hill. When asked what his place in boxing history was, the five-division world champion wasn't about to turn humble. ""Right now they call me 'TBE.' That's 'the best ever,'"" he said. ""The only thing I have to keep on doing is beating these young lions, keep beating the fighters they put in front of me and hopefully I'll go down as the best.""","Floyd Mayweather faces Canelo Alvarez on Saturday in a battle of undefeated fighters .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The futuristic South African sci-fi that has taken the U.S box office by storm opened in its home country this weekend. ""District 9"" director Neill Blomkamp . Parallels with the experience of apartheid in ""District 9"" are likely to resonate particularly with South African audiences. The story begins with an alien space ship breaking down over South Africa's largest metropolis, Johannesburg -- leaving the unfortunate creatures on board stranded. Their human hosts rescue them, but 20 years on they are exploited and segregated in militarized townships to keep them away them from angry locals. Made for a mere $30 million, inexpensive by Hollywood standards, ""District 9"" film is already a huge box office hit in the U.S., having brought in $73 million during its first 10 days in cinemas. In South Africa, the country where it was filmed, it is likely strike a chord with audiences all too familiar with issues of racism, xenophobia and segregation. This time the victims are insectile aliens, but their eviction and forced removal from one place to another because of their species echoes the racial segregation that plagued South Africa until 1990. In fact, it was filmed in Soweto, a township created by the apartheid state to keep black South Africans away from white Johannesburg. ""District 9"" is the work of 29-year-old first-time director Neill Blomkamp with the help of ""Lord of the Rings"" maestro Peter Jackson, who acts as producer. Blomkamp who also co-wrote the film grew up in Johannesburg before moving to Canada in his late teens. He says he didn't want his first film to be defined by politics. ""I didn't want to go, 'Here's a whole bunch of people oppressed by this apartheid-esque society' and beat people over the head with it,"" Blomkamp told CNN. ""I rather wanted to say this is the city I grew up in this is what it felt like."" The film's star and long-time friend of Blomkamp, Sharlto Copley, who plays security operative Wikus Van De Merwe says many of the film's themes are universal. ""The film deals with things that are so fundamentally human,"" Copley told CNN. ""That it's quite easy to see how you discriminate against you know this group or that group or a religious group."" Blomkamp may want the political references to take a backseat but ""District 9"" is still very much a South African production. The thick South African accents and distinctive dialogue spoken by many of the film's characters were authentic as most of the cast were, in fact, locals. ""90 percent of the community was hired ... catering, security, extras. Great fun,"" said David James who plays a mercenary. It was good money for the unemployed residents of the Soweto suburb where much of the film was shot: ""For this to be shot in my township ... we feel fortunate,"" said caterer Sylvia Khoza. ""Many people benefit from this movie."" Extras earned $38 per day -- a good wage by local standards. Lufano Tshoshouga who worked as an extra used the money to buy clothes and presents for his family he would otherwise have been unable to afford. ""So they gave us a lot of money. [It] bought my son clothes, even my own clothes. Some for Christmas. Some presents for my family. It was a good privilege,"" said Tshoshouga.","""District 9"" directed by South African-born Neill Blomkamp opens in the country .

"(CNN) -- The Obama administration asserts America is ""not alone"" in planning its proposed Syria strikes, though ally countries have yet to formally join the call for limited military action now advanced by the White House. Whether other countries will participate in an American offensive against Syria remains to be seen. Short of an official White House list of who's in, analysts and CNN correspondents size up which countries may -- or may not -- play a military or diplomatic role in a planned U.S.-led air assault on Syria. What about the British, our loyal ally in the Iraq War? Forget it. In a staggering setback to Prime Minister David Cameron, the British House of Commons said no to joining a U.S. assault against Syria. The United Kingdom is overwhelmingly against another Middle East conflict, with only 16% in favor of militarily punishing the Syrian regime. Is there a chance UK legislators might reconsider? 5 things on Syria: Obama overseas to developments at home . It's possible, experts say, because Obama's strategy to make a public case before Congress for a limited Syria attack may win favor in Europe. However, Cameron seemed to quash speculation that there might be a new Commons vote Wednesday. ""Britain cannot be and will not be part of any military action"" against Syria, he said, adding that he respects the outcome of last week's vote and ""will not be bringing back plans for British participation in military action."" The White House alleges that the Syrian regime is deploying chemical weapons that are killing innocent children and adults in a civil war that has lasted more than two years. ""It'll be interesting to watch in the coming days if the Obama administration's case on chemical weapons reverberates with the European public,"" said Andrew Tabler, senior fellow of the Washington Institute. Well, who in Europe does support us? It could be France, in something of a role reversal from 2003, when France declined to join the Iraq invasion but the British sent many troops. The French parliament is expected to debate military action against Syria this week. But there's not a lot of nationwide support for such an intervention -- only one in three people in France endorses punishing Syria. What's the evidence? But the French are more open than the Germans, who are against it by a 5-1 ratio. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is facing re-election later this month, said her country won't participate in any military action, though she called the plight of the Syrian people ""catastrophic."" Where does Israel stand on all this? Israel, the ultimate U.S. ally in the Mideast, has already intervened in the Syrian conflict but in a measured way, using isolated bombing in instances that Israel deemed Syrian aggression. 'Red line' debate: Are chemical weapons worse? ""They have been doing this tit-for-tat thing,"" said Jeff Martini, Middle East analyst for the Rand Corporation. For now, Israel is maintaining a low-profile in the international debate about whether to launch an offensive against Syria because it doesn't want to further antagonism between it and Arab neighbors. Israel's vast military force -- fighter jets, surveillance, early warning systems -- would be an important asset to American forces if an attack on Syria proceeds. ""Israel is doing its part by keeping quiet,"" Martini added. Israel is being supportive behind the scenes. What about U.S. access to Turkey's air bases? Some Turkish support will be public, and some will be under the table, said Anne-Marie Slaughter, president and CEO of the New America Foundation. The same goes for Saudi Arabia and Jordan, she said. How a no-boots-on-the-ground attack against Syria would play out hasn't been revealed by the Obama administration. Bombing would likely include missiles launched from the U.S. warships in the Mediterranean Sea. The use of other countries' soil in the region for air strikes is uncertain, experts say. Four questions for backers of Syrian mission . Secretary of State John Kerry told House Democrats that Turkey -- along with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates -- has already offered military assets for any Syrian attacks, two sources on the call told CNN this week. If so, Turkey could play a huge role: There are already two big U.S. air bases there that could be used by fighter jets, refueling tankers, AWACS surveillance planes and U2 spy aircraft. There are also U.S. defense missile systems on the Turkish border as a defense against Syria. Tell me more about oil-rich Saudi Arabia . Analysts believe that Saudi Arabia heavily influenced the recent announcement by the Arab League foreign ministers who called upon the international community to punish the Syrian regime for its alleged use of chemical weapons. Is it 'High Noon' for Obama on Syria? That statement was interpreted as the Arab League ""green-lighting"" a military strike against Syria without specifically mentioning bombing. With its vast air force and bases, Saudi Arabia would offer a lot of resources to Western militaries. But it wouldn't participate directly in any attack on Syria because that would inflame a widespread Arabian Peninsula antipathy against Western military forces intruding into Arab affairs. Still, Saudi Arabia is a diplomatic heavyweight in the Arab world, so the country's tacit support and money would ease any U.S. burden if it is forced to act alone against Syria. Syria missile strike: What would happen next? Kerry told the House Foreign Affairs Committee this week that Arab countries -- presumably including Saudi Arabia -- have offered to help bear the financial cost of the proposed military offensive against Syria. ""That's how dedicated they are to this,"" Kerry said. U.S. ally Jordan is in a bind . Like Saudi Arabia, Jordan has air bases close to Syria's border that could be useful for inserting and extracting special forces and mounting rescue missions for downed pilots. Jordan also hosts U.S. forces, and together they train rebels for combat in Syria. The Jordanians also allow weapons to flow over its border to the Syrian opposition, and their country is home to one of the biggest CIA operations on Syria in the region. But Jordan is perhaps the most vulnerable of U.S. allies because it's so close to Syria and has declared that it won't be a launching pad for Syrian attacks. Jordan is unlikely to be involved directly in a U.S. strike against Syria because Jordan could face retaliatory missiles and terror attacks from the Syrian regime. Meanwhile, Jordan is nervous about its own internal tensions arising from Arab Spring, including how the country deals with corruption allegations and a not-so-popular king. ""Jordan fears Syria will escalate horizontally and switch the geography of conflict,"" Martini said. Could Russia do anything? Russia has been supportive of the Syrian regime, but if it wanted to assist the United States, it could pull its military advisers out of Syria and stop its alleged supplying of arms to the regime. Russia could also tell Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to hand over power to an interim administration. Such Russian support is unlikely, and the most that the Obama administration could expect is Russia expressing uncertainty about whether the Assad regime is the best to govern Syria, as Russia did a year ago. So what kind of a coalition could we be talking about? When all is said and done, any U.S.-led coalition against Syria could be one that offers more moral than military support. That is still important, especially when the nations act outside the aegis of the United Nations Security Council. ""A coalition is political in nature, but the United States would do the heavy lifting militarily,"" Tabler said. CNN's Nic Robertson, Nick Paton Walsh and Marc Sauber contributed to this story.","A U.S.-led coalition to bomb Syria has yet to take shape .

"(CNN) -- Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce kept her tag of the fastest woman in the world with a performance as dominating as her Jamaican male counterpart Usain Bolt 24 hours earlier to claim the 100m title at the world championships Monday. The diminutive 1.52m tall sprinter recovered from an indifferent start to drive through the line in 10.71 seconds, the fastest time of the year. After a build-up dominated by doping scandals involving Trinidad and Tobago's Kelly-Ann Baptiste and her own teammate Veronica Campbell-Brown, who would both have been medal contenders, Fraser-Pryce reminded everyone of her formidable talent. The double Olympic champion and winner of the world title in 2009 shrugged off a minor injury problem to win from Ivorian Murielle Ahoure (10.93), with defending champion Carmelita Jeter of the United States taking the bronze (10.94). ""I had my obstacles - I was starting to feel pain under my left butt cheek,"" Fraser-Pryce revealed after her victory. ""I am surrounded by great people. I came here and did my best and actually won. It was really hurting but I knew what I worked for."" While Fraser-Pryce's win was clear cut, Britain's Christine Ohuruogu won by the slenderest of margins from Botswana's defending world champion Amantle Montsho in the women's 400m. Ohuruogu made her customary late charge for the line to overhaul Montsho, who looked a certain winner even 10m out. Her desperate dip saw her given the verdict in 49.41 seconds, a new national record, with Montsho awarded the same time. Home hope Antonina Krivoshapka claimed bronze in 49.78 seconds in front of the Moscow crowd. Ohuruogu, a former Olympic and world champion, was returning to the top of the podium after taking silver at the 2012 London Games. ""It's like a dream, it's too much"" she admitted. ""I cannot believe it. After the race, I did not want to get too excited until I knew for sure that I won, until my name got out first. In other finals on the third day of competition, New Zealand's Valerie Adams won a record fourth women's shot put title. The two-time Olympic champion hurled the implement 20.88m, with Germany's Christina Schwanitz and China's Gong Lijiao taking the silver and bronze. The United States tasted gold success in the men's 110m hurdles as 31-year-old David Oliver crossed the line first in 13 seconds dead from compatriot Ryan Wilson in silver with Russian Sergey Shubenkov back in third. German Raphael Holzdeppe was surprise winner of the men's pole vault with a 5.89m clearance, beating reigning Olympic champion Renaud Lavillenie of France on count back.

"Bayelsa, Nigeria (CNN) -- The stars of African cinema graced the red carpet at the African Movie Academy Awards (AMAA), in Nigeria, showcasing the films that could make waves on the global festival circuit. The African movie industry gathered in Yenagoa, in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria, for the fifth annual ""African Oscars."" Set up in 2005 by former lawyer Peace Anyiam-Osigwe, the awards have helped raise the profile of African movies around the world. ""African film has a hard time in getting recognition in most film festivals [outside Africa],"" Anyiam-Osigwe told CNN. ""I think one of the biggest achievements of the AMAA is that the main festivals now look upon us as a selection process, and will pick those particular films that we've looked at and carry them on to the different festival circuits. ""The first Nollywood film that the British International Film Festival showed was 'Irapada,' by Kunle Afolayan, which won Best Indigenous Film at AMAA in 2007. 'The Figurine' premiered at Rotterdam this year and has gone on to other film festivals and 'From a Whisper' traveled the festival circuit based on its win at AMAA."" ""The Figurine,"" a thriller about a sculpture with mystical powers, also by Nigerian director Kunle Afolayan, stole the show at this year's ceremony, claiming five awards in total -- including Best Picture. South African football star Steven Pienaar shares his World Cup dream . Afolayan told CNN, ""It feels great -- like we've not worked in vain. It feels like we've opened up a new page in African cinema. ""For me, a good story will cut across, not just appeal to Nigerians but will appeal to an average film lover, regardless of the language you speak, the continent you are from, or the color of your skin."" In its first years the AMAAs focused on Nigeria's booming movie industry -- known as ""Nollywood."" But since then they have become more pan-African. The 24 awards at this year's ceremony included nominations from across the continent. Nonetheless, in terms of sheer output, Nigeria dominates African cinema. Nigeria is the world's second-biggest producer of movies, behind only India. In 2006 it produced 872 movies, compared with 485 major feature films made in the U.S., according to the UNESCO Institute for Statistics. Nollywood movies are typically low-budget -- often filmed, edited and released within a month. Most don't end up on the big screen. Instead, they are distributed as VCDs costing about $1 to $2, meaning they are affordable for the mass African market. But it is Nollywood's pioneering use of relatively inexpensive digital cameras instead of costly 35mm film that Anyiam-Osigwe says has been its most important contribution to African cinema. ""There is a new wave of African cinema which is mostly the digital revolution, which has gone on from what Nollywood started in the early 90s,"" she told CNN. ""Nigeria made people believe they could make films for less [by using digital cameras]. That has spread across the continent and I think that's a good thing, otherwise Africa would not be able to have any kind of production, because it couldn't afford it. ""You see a lot of the older generation of filmmakers from Africa who have made only one short film or one feature-length film in their lifetime, because they have not been able to make up the cost of making another film."" Anyiam-Osigwe said that while some older filmmakers still believe movies should be shot only on 35mm film, directors from Malawi, Kenya, and Johannesburg's ""Joziewood"" have now made the switch to digital. She added that while every African country has its own movie-making style, the themes are often universal. ""Everyone tries to do a film that people in their own community will watch,"" she said. ""But I've found that all over the continent we have similar stories -- it's just how we tell them.""

"(CNN) -- Trinidad and Tobago's Kelly-Ann Baptiste should have been contending for a medal in Monday's women's 100m final at Moscow -- instead she has been withdrawn from the World Athletics Championships by her federation for a ""doping matter."" Baptiste, who won a bronze in the last global championships in Daegu two years ago, set a national record of 10.83 seconds for the 100m earlier this season to underline her medal potential. Only two-time Olympic champion Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce of Jamaica, who went on to claim the gold, and Nigeria's Blessing Okagbare have run faster this year. But the Trinidad and Tobago National Association of Athletic Administrations confirmed Monday that Baptiste and fellow sprinter Semoy Hackett would not be competing. ""The absence of both athletes is related to doping matters of varying degrees and complexity,"" read a statement from the organization. ""In the case of Ms Baptiste this association was notified on Thursday August 8 by the IAAF (of a failed doping control) and the results management process is currently under way and as a result, any further comment at this stage would be premature and inappropriate."" Hackett, who trains in the United States, tested positive last year at the U.S. Collegiate Championships for methylhexaneamine, a banned stimulant. She was subsequently exonerated by the Trinidad and Tobago federation, but the International Amateur Athletics Federation (IAAF) appealed the decision and re-suspended her pending an appeal before the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Switzerland. The Baptiste case is another blow to the image of track and field, still reeling from the high profile doping cases which have seen American sprinter Tyson Gay and leading Jamaicans Asafa Powell and Veronica Campbell-Brown facing lengthy bans. A batch of lesser known names from Turkey and Russia have also fallen foul of the testers ahead of the championships. The IAAF announced before the event that it will bring in four-year bans for those caught doping from 2015, against the current two-year maximum penalty for a first offense.","Leading sprinter Kelly-Ann Baptiste withdrawn from world championships .

"(CNN) -- The darling of the Russian crowd duly delivered Tuesday to regain her status as the leading women's pole vaulter in the world. Yelena Isinbayeva shrugged off five years of disappointments in global competition to return to the top of the podium, roared on by partisan home support in the Luzhniki Stadium. Not even Usain Bolt and his 100m heroics could capture the imagination as surely as Isinbayeva, the four-day old championships, marked by sparse attendances, finally springing fully to life. The noise reached a fever pitch when the 31-year-old successfully cleared 4.89m while America's 2012 Olympic champion Jennifer Suhr and Cuban Yarisley Silva both failed at that height. Suhr claimed the silver at 4.82m on count back. But all eyes were left on Isinbayeva, who made three unsuccessful attempts to break her own world record of 5.06m. It was her third world championship title in the discipline. She had dominated the event with Olympic golds in Athens 2004 and the 2008 Games in Beijing, setting 28 world records indoor and outdoor. Her golden run came to abrupt end at the 2009 World Championships and at Daegu two years ago she finished a lowly sixth. Bronze behind Suhr in the London Games last year was also a disappointment, but she has now gained redemption on home soil. ""It was the best ever support,"" said Isinbayeva, who will now to take a break from the sport to have a baby, but is hoping to return for the 2016 Olympics in Rio. ""I felt like I was at home, that everyone was behind me. I absorbed that and it resulted in a gold,"" she added. The crowd were also treated to an array of competitive finals and a big shock as Grenada's Olympic champion Kirani James slumped to 400m defeat to LaShawn Merritt of the United States. James could not match the power of Merritt and faded to seventh in the home straight as the 2008 Olympic champion crossed the line in a season's best 43.74 seconds. Teammate Tony McQuay ran a fine 44.40 seconds for silver with Luquelin Santos of the Dominican Republic in third. ""It just didn't work out for me today,"" admitted the 20-year-old James, who was defending his title won in Daegu two years ago. Olympic 800m champion David Rudisha was missing from the event he has made his own, breaking his own world record on the way to gold in London last year. In his absence, Mohammed Aman of Ethiopia charged through to claim his country's first global crown at the two-lap event. He eased past American Nicky Symmonds to win in one minute 43.31 seconds with Ayanleh Souleiman claiming bronze for Djibouti. Ukraine's Ganna Melnichenko won the women's heptathlon after holding off a determined challenge from Canada's Brianne Theisen Eaton, who is the wife of newly-crowned world decathlon champion Ashton Eaton of the United States. She needed to beat Melnichenko by a healthy margin in the closing 800m event, but could not pull ahead by the 4.69 seconds required and had to settle for silver. Isinbayeva's gold was the second of the day for the hosts after Olympic champion Elena Lashmanova crossed the line first in the women's 20km walk.","Yelena Isinbayeva wins women's pole vault at world championships .

"London, England (CNN) -- Not many people would see quadriplegia as a gift. But then, not many people are Paul Callahan. As a 21-year-old Harvard University student, Paul's life was full of possibility. An undergraduate studying business at one of the best universities in the world, there was a lot to look forward to for the young man from Massachusetts. Then a freak accident changed everything. Paul slipped on a wet floor, breaking his neck and rendering him paralyzed from the chest down. He retained the use of his arms, but not his hands. Callahan spent the next five years traveling to rehabilitation centers across the United States in search of a way to walk again. When a doctor finally suggested it was time to concentrate on living instead of walking, Paul did exactly that. Almost 30 years later, the 55-year-old father of two is now set to represent the United States in sailing at the Paralympics. ""It's an evolutionary process where you transition from one life to the other,"" Paul told CNN. ""I never gave up moving forward. You can define that as walking or being a contributing member of society. At 26 I chose the later."" Golden hopes . Next week Paul and his two team mates -- both amputees -- will take to a 24-foot boat for the three-person sailing event at the Paralympics. Skipper Paul drives the boat by wearing rollerblading gloves on his hands, attached to bicycle pedals. The pedals are in turn linked to a pulley system that steers the vessel. This will be Paul's second Paralympics, after his debut at Sydney in 2000. The U.S. team failed to win a medal, but as Paul admits he was still fresh to the sport. With a fifth place in the Disabled Sailing World Championships in Weymouth last year, this time gold is on the cards, he insists. Watch: Sailing for social change . It would be an incredible achievement in a life already marked by success. Paul returned to Harvard in 1983, becoming the first quadriplegic to graduate from the university. He then went on to work at Goldman Sachs as an asset manager for 15 years. ""Everyone is quite capable of doing much more than they think they can,"" Paul said. ""Once they realize that fact, then the world becomes their oyster."" Sail to Prevail . It was a chance sailing trip in 1995 that sparked Paul's love for the sport -- and a new venture that would help thousands of disabled children. ""I got on a sailboat and looked back at my empty wheelchair on the dock,"" Paul said. ""It was the first time in 15 years I was able to do something on my own. It was an incredible moment."" So inspiring was the experience, Callahan left his Wall Street job and took over Sail to Prevail -- a non-profit organization that teaches disabled children to sail. Watch: Sailing solo around the world . From starting with eight children a year, the charity, based in Newport, Rhode Island, now helps around 1,000 youngsters annually. Their disabilities vary from spinal cord injuries to autism, and Paul says when he races for gold next month, it'll be for them. ""When we get on the starting line against 14 other countries, I want to win a gold medal just as much as they do -- but I've got an additional motivation,"" he said. ""The better my team does, the more powerful impact it will have for Sail to Prevail."" The gift . It is perhaps a testament to Paul's mental strength that he views his disability as a special opportunity in life. ""I've been given an extraordinary gift where I can affect people's lives in ways other people can't. So I see it as a responsibility,"" he said. There have been some dark moments Paul admits. But with his wife, Alisa, 9-year-old twin sons and the Paralympics on the horizon, what's the point in dwelling on that instant he slipped on a wet floor? ""I've been very fortunate,"" he said, adding: ""You've only got a limited amount of time in life. So you may as well choose to put that towards positive effort, rather than squandering it on the negative.""","Quadriplegic Paul Callahan will represent the U.S. in sailing at Paralympics .

"(CNN) -- This time there was no denying Mo Farah in the 10,000 meters at the world championships. Two years ago in Daegu, South Korea, Farah was beaten by Ibrahim Jeilan in a dramatic finish. But he showed no ill effects on home soil at last year's Olympics in London, claiming the double in the 5,000 and 10,000 meters -- and popularizing the Mobot in the process. And on Saturday in Moscow, the Briton edged Jeilan in the 10,000 meters to add to his 5,000-meter world title. Sprint king Usain Bolt, who also shone in London, later eased through in the 100-meter heats on the opening day of the championships. Farah crossed the line in 27 minutes, 21.71 seconds in front of a less than packed Luzhniki Stadium, defeating Jeilan by nearly half a second. He ran the last lap in an impressive 54 seconds to hold off the Ethiopian, who had overtaken Farah in the final few meters in South Korea. ""I saw him coming at the bell, knew he was behind me and so I had to have something left,"" Farah told the BBC. ""It was nice to see him second this time and beat him. ""I didn't want to lose again."" His form this season suggested he would be hard to beat, with Farah setting a European record in the shorter 1,500 meters in Monaco in July and personal best in the 3,000 meters at the Anniversary Games in London a week later. He plans to focus on the marathon following the world championships. ""It was nice to come out here and win it,"" said Farah, born in Somalia. ""Training's been really hard. I've spent a lot of time away from my family and when I came home for the Anniversary Games, my little daughter didn't even recognize me. ""But it's definitely been worth it."" American Galen Rupp, Farah's training partner, missed out on the bronze as Kenya's Paul Tanui grabbed third. He took time, though, to praise Farah. ""He was the best last year and that continues this year,"" Rupp told the BBC. ""I think the great thing about him is he continues to do the same things and he knows he has to work so hard in training and that's what makes him the type of runner he is."" Bolt, meanwhile, cruised in his heat in 10.07 seconds. He is the overwhelming favorite in Sunday's final since reigning world champion and fellow Jamaican Yohan Blake skipped the event due to a hamstring injury and American Tyson Gay pulled out after testing positive for a banned substance. Gay owns the two fastest times in the world this year. The build-up to the world championships was overshadowed by positive tests to Gay, former 100-meter world-record holder Asafa Powell and two-time 200-meter Olympic gold medalist Veronica Campbell-Brown. On Saturday, the Trinidad Express reported that Trinidad and Tobago sprinter Kelly-Ann Baptiste, third in the 100 meters in Daegu, failed a drug test and left the world championships. In the first medal event of the championships, Kenya's Edna Kiplagat made history when she became the first woman to retain the marathon world title. Her time of 2:25.44 was 14 seconds quicker than Italy's Valeria Straneo. Japan's Kayoko Fukushi captured the bronze, two minutes behind Kiplagat.","Britain's Mo Farah wins 10,000-meter gold at the world championships in Moscow .

"(CNN) -- No checks? No worries. Or for some veterans, at least not as many worries, for a while. Nearly 40,000 U.S. veterans wounded on or after September 11, 2001, will each get a $500 check to help their families even if deadlocked Washington cannot not find a deal to resolve the partial government shutdown, one of the nation's largest veterans service groups promised Tuesday. Steve Nardizzi, executive director of Florida-based Wounded Warrior Project, announced on CNN's ""AC360"" the organization will spend $20 million providing wounded veterans with stipend checks should their disability benefits not be issued by the federal government, which is still deeply entrenched in a bitter partisan standoff 15 days after the shutdown began. He did not specify when the checks would be sent. 7 crazy side effects from the shutdown . Testifying before the House Veterans Affairs Committee last week, Secretary of Veterans Affairs Eric Shinseki warned that if the shutdown continues, on November 1, the agency will not be able to pay all of its 3.8 million beneficiaries, far outnumbering WWP's 40,000, who are counting on their checks. The payments would amount to $6.25 billion in compensation and pensions, survivor benefits, educational vocational rehabilitation and employment benefits, Shinseki said. ""I need the authorization, appropriations and a budget to be able to do that,"" he told committee members. ""Let us get back to work. The sooner we do it the faster I get back up to full speed."" Also at risk are some 435,000 veterans in the VA's disability claims backlog who will now have to wait longer for their applications to be handled because the agency has stopped paying overtime to processors who were trying to cut the backlog. If there's a deal, what next? WWP's announcement came as nearly 100 veterans from a coalition of the nation's leading veterans and uniformed services organizations made their angry push Tuesday at Washington's National World War II Memorial to end the shutdown. Former Army Capt. Tom Tarantino, chief policy officer for Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, pointed his frustration at what he considered a politically insolvent Congress. ""Inside the Beltway, this is a game to them -- they're scoring points, they're poll testing what they're saying. Outside of the Beltway, these are people's lives,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- Facebook and Google's privacy issues are well-known. But they're nothing compared with those surrounding Silk, Amazon's in-house Internet browser for its newly announced tablet computer, says Chester Wisniewski, a senior security adviser at British computer security firm Sophos, a British computer security firm. ""All of your web surfing habits will transit Amazon's cloud,"" he writes on Sophos' Naked Security blog. ""If you think that Google AdWords and Facebook are watching you, this service is guaranteed to have a record of everything you do on the Web."" Amazon, best known for its online marketplace and the Kindle e-reader, unveiled a touch-screen tablet computer on Wednesday called the Kindle Fire. That got lots of chatter in tech circles. What's been less discussed is the new cloud-based Web browser that's loaded onto every one of Amazon's tablets. The Amazon Silk browser appears to work unlike anything on the market today. Most Web browsers -- like Safari, Explorer and Firefox -- connect Internet users directly with websites. Silk filters everything through Amazon's own cloud-computing servers, a move the company claims will vastly speed up the mobile Web experience -- perhaps doubling the speed at which websites load. But privacy advocates say there may be other consequences. ""What this means is that Amazon will capture and control every Web transaction performed by Fire users,"" Chris Espinosa, one of the first Apple employees, wrote on his personal blog. ""Every page they see, every link they follow, every click they make, every ad they see is going to be intermediated by one of the largest server farms on the planet. People who cringe at the data-mining implications of the Facebook Timeline ought to be just floored by the magnitude of Amazon's opportunity here. ""Amazon now has what every storefront lusts for: the knowledge of what other stores your customers are shopping in and what prices they're being offered there."" Amazon says in its privacy statement that it does temporarily log Web use. ""Amazon Silk also temporarily logs Web addresses known as uniform resource locators ('URLs') for the Web pages it serves and certain identifiers, such as IP or MAC addresses, to troubleshoot and diagnose Amazon Silk technical issues. We generally do not keep this information for longer than 30 days,"" the company says in its privacy statement. ""Browsing activity is aggregated and is not linked to identity,"" an Amazon spokeswoman said in an e-mail to CNN. For now, the Silk browser is available only to people who use the Kindle Fire, which doesn't go on sale until mid-November. There are rumors, however, that the Amazon browser could make its way onto other mobile devices and possibly desktop machines. People who worry about the data Amazon Silk may be collecting can turn off the cloud-computing piece of the browser. If they don't, every move they make online will be logged by the company for at least a month, Wisniewski said. Amazon probably won't sell that data to advertisers, he said, but the fact that the company keeps a log of Internet use is scary for consumers, because that data could be hacked from Amazon's control, or it could be subject to subpoena by the U.S. government. The Web tracking applies to secure connections as well, he said, meaning Amazon could keep a log of communications made on banking sites or the secure versions of sites like Gmail, Facebook and Twitter. Amazon says Silk will bring about a much faster Web browsing experience on mobile devices. ""I'm sure you've had the experience where you're trying to load a page, and the browser is just sitting there hanging, and you're like, 'Oh, I wish I was on a better network,' "" Amazon engineer Peter Vosshall says in a promotional video. ""We're on a better network. Our back end has some of the fattest pipes to the Internet that you'll find. And we do all the heavy lifting on the back end and then serve optimized content over this dedicated channel back to your device, so you don't have to worry about it."" The underlying argument for a browser like Silk is that mobile devices don't have enough processing power to download websites as quickly as users would like. Amazon essentially is using its computer warehouses -- which are all over the country and the world -- to do this processing for its tablet computers so that websites will load faster. The name Silk is representative of this ""split architecture."" ""We decided to call our browser Amazon Silk because, really, a thread of silk is an invisible yet incredibly strong connection between two different things,"" Jon Jenkins, director of software development for Amazon Silk, says in a video. ""In our case, it's the connection between your Kindle Fire and our Amazon Compute Cloud. And it's the bringing together those two elements to create a better Web browser."" It's also a browser that's better at tracking you, Sophos' Wisniewski writes. ""While most of us roll our eyes when confronted with long privacy policies and pages of legalese, privacy risks lurk around every corner,"" he writes.""If you buy a Fire device, think carefully as to whether your privacy is worth trading for a few milliseconds faster Web surfing experience.""","Amazon unveils Web browser called Silk .

"Moscow (CNN) -- Cosmonauts walked on the surface of Mars on Monday, nearly a year into a mission to the red planet. Unfortunately, it's only a simulation, designed to test what would happen on a real flight to Mars. The project is an attempt to simulate the experience of a manned trip to Mars, with an international team of researchers locked in a windowless capsule for about a year and a half -- time required for a round trip to the next planet out in the solar system. Starting in June of last year, the all-male ""crew"" of six -- three from Russia, one from France, one from Italy and one from China -- began spending 520 days in the cramped and claustrophobic conditions of a special facility in Moscow, following a strict regimen of exercise and diet. They ""landed"" on Mars on Saturday, and on Monday, Russia's Alexander Smoleyevsky and Italy's Diego Urbina completed their first walk on the ""Martian surface."" The cosmonauts wore specially modified light-weight spacesuits for the 40-minute simulated walk. ""For centuries Europeans have been exploring the Earth, led by such people as Columbus and Magellan. Today, looking at the landscape of this red planet, I can imagine how exciting it would look with the eyes of the first person who steps his foot on Mars,"" Urbina said after he and Smoleyevsky planted flags of the four countries participating in the project into the ""Martian surface."" Two other such walks are scheduled for Friday and February 22, according to Igor Ushakov, director of the Moscow-based Institute for Biomedical Problems, the main organization coordinating the project. Organizers at the European Space Agency and Russia's Institute of Biomedical Problems hope the project will shed light on the physical and psychological effects of the long isolation that future Mars astronauts will experience. ""This study is not useful only for Mars, but also for life on Earth,"" Urbina, 27, said in a news release when the mission began last year. The researchers communicate with Mission Control via the internet, with occasional disruptions and a 20-minute delay to imitate the effects of space travel. They are performing tasks similar to astronauts at the international space station, such as maintenance and scientific experiments, but for a longer period of time. They follow a seven-day week with two days off, except when special and emergency situations are simulated. The latest isolation test is the last and longest part of the Mars500 experiment, which began in 2007. The first phase was a 14-day simulation that mainly tested the facilities and operational procedures. The second phase followed in 2009, when four Russian and two European crew members were shut into the facility for 105 days. Actual missions to Mars have thus far been unmanned. Speaking at a press conference at Mission Control on Monday before the walk, Vitaly Davydov, deputy head of the Russian Space Agency, said that the ""main task of the project is to determine the list of problems"" that real space crews flying to Mars might be encountering. He said such a manned flight to the planet could take place in two decades. ""Twenty years is a good time to prepare for such an expedition. I think it is quite realistic,"" he said, adding that no specific date for that is scheduled yet. CNN's Maxim Tkachenko and journalist Derrick Ho contributed to this report .","Mars500 is a simulated mission, designed to see how people cope with the conditions .

"(CNN) -- Great Britain & Ireland had to withstand a withering onslaught from Continental Europe before retaining the Vivendi Seve Trophy at St- Nom-La-Breteche in France Sunday. Victory looked a formality as the Continentals trailed by five points overnight heading into the final 10 singles matches, but Jean Van De Velde's side won the first five singles contests to square the match. It set up a dramatic finale with Belgian Nicolas Colsaerts taking a half off England's David Horsey, but rookie Scott Jamieson scored a crucial win for Paul McGinley's men as he beat Pablo Larrazabal. The heavyweight clash between Ian Poulter and young Italian star Matteo Manassero proved even more vital and it was the Englishman who snatched victory on the final green as he again showed his match play abilities with a three birdie run on the back nine. Mark Foster went one up against Raphael Jacquelin on the 17th to guarantee the 14 1/2 points for victory, going on to wrap up the point as the eventual margin was 15 1/2 to 12 1/2 with Ross Fisher and Peter Hanson all square in the last match out on course. ""Lucky I had the team well balanced out, and had not just experience but guys in form balanced throughout the team, so they came through in the end,"" McGinley told the official European Tour website. But his team had suffered a massive scare as Thomas Bjorn led from the front for the Continentals by beating Lee Westwood in the top match 2 and 1. Bjorn's compatriot Anders Hansen beat Simon Dyson and Francesco Molinari saw off Jamie Donaldson. Alex Noren then beat Robert Rock 4 and 3 and British Open Champion Darren Clarke lost 4 and 2 to former Ryder Cup partner Miguel Angel JimÃÂ©nez to leave the contest tied at 11 1/2-11 1/2. But up stepped Jamieson and former WGC World Match Play champion Poulter to score their wins. Van De Velde said: ""It was extremely close, even going down the stretch.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Chris Brown's legal troubles got more serious Tuesday when a Los Angeles prosecutor charged him in a minor traffic crash. Brown already faces a charge that he violated his probation in connection with his felony assault conviction in the beating of his girlfriend Rihanna. Brown, 24, allegedly was driving a car that rear-ended another car in Los Angeles in May. The Los Angeles city attorney filed charges of hit-and-run driving and driving without a license, according to spokesman Frank Mateljan. Brown's Twitter defense . While Brown's representatives did not immediately respond to CNN calls for comment, the singer used his Twitter account to protest the charges: . ""It's not a hit and run if u get out the car, exchange information (who has NO DAMAGE to either cars).This is really ridiculous"" ""I have a valid drivers license and I gave the woman the right info. She saw cameras and wanted to make a scene."" ""She contacted the cops thinking of a payday from Chris Brown when I followed the proper procedures."" ""My lawyers will be contacting you. I will not stand for this bullying and yellow journalism!"" ""My profile pic is the pic I took of the persons car after ""the hit and run"". NO damage. Just a dirty car. once again, I gotta clear my name"" ""I work my ass off to provide for my entire family. I've made mistakes in the past and have worked hard to be a better person. "" ""19-24 years of age. I don't have all the answers and you can't show me a person that age who has it figured out. We live and grow. Let me live"" Freedom on the line? While the misdemeanor charges -- which carry a maximum of a year in jail -- would not ordinarily threaten a defendant's freedom, Brown's felony probation could be revoked if a judge decides the new arrest is a violation. A spokesman for the Los Angeles County district attorney said prosecutors will review the charge once they are officially notified by the city attorney. An arraignment for the new charges has been set for the morning of July 15 at the Van Nuys courthouse. Brown is also scheduled to be in a downtown Los Angeles courtroom that afternoon for another hearing to set a date for his trial in his probation violation case. Brown punched Rihanna inside a rented Lamborghini on a Hollywood street, leaving her face bruised and bloody on the eve of the Grammy Awards in February 2009. He entered a guilty plea seven months later and was sentenced to serve five years probation and to spend more than 1,400 hours in ""labor-oriented service"" for the assault conviction. The judge allowed him to serve the sentence in Richmond, Virginia, under the direct supervision of the police chief. In a court filing in February 2013, prosecutors accused Brown of not completing the community labor. The paperwork Brown submitted to show he had completed community labor is ""at best sloppy documentation and at worst fraudulent reporting,"" District Attorney Jackie Lacey said. Brown wasn't in town on some of the dates reported, the motion said. Mark Geragos, Brown's attorney, said the prosecutor's filing was so fraudulent that he would ask the judge to punish the deputy district attorneys involved and call for a contempt of court hearing for filing false documents with the court. ""And I don't mean just false, it is fraudulent,"" Geragos said. The Los Angeles County district attorney's office has ""tortured"" Brown during his probation more than any client he's ever had, Geragos said. Despite the serious allegations outlined in the court filing, the prosecutor is not asking for Brown's probation to be revoked and the singer sent to jail. She is asking the judge to order him to restart his 1,400 hours of community service under the supervision of a Los Angeles probation officer. Nightclub incident denied . Brown's representative denied allegations Monday that the singer assaulted a woman while inside of an Anaheim, California, nightclub on Saturday. The accuser told TMZ that Brown shoved her while they were in the VIP area of Heat Ultra Lounge that night, causing her to take a hard fall and injuring her knee. The owner of the venue has called the claims false, and Brown's rep has made a similar denial. ""Reports that Chris Brown had physical contact with a female patron at the nightclub Heat are totally false and unfounded,"" Brown's rep told CNN. ""Upon speaking with witnesses, security and the owner of the club, it has been proven that said patron caused the physical harm to herself in her belligerent state."" According to the Anaheim Police Department, an assault and battery report was filed by phone on Sunday evening. The case is considered an open and ongoing investigation.

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- Yemen's air force has killed dozens of al Qaeda fighters in a series of U.S.-supported airstrikes in the country's south, Yemeni officials said Tuesday. At least 38 suspected al Qaeda militants were killed in continuous raids on jihadist hideouts in Yemen's southern provinces of Lahj and Abyan, three security officials told CNN. But the militants still control key towns linking both provinces despite 48 hours of nonstop bombardment, the officials said. Aden, the country's business capital and major port, neighbors Lahj province and has been a target for al Qaeda attacks since January. Al Qaeda websites mysteriously fall silent . ""The government does not want Lahj to turn into a launching pad for al Qaeda attacks. Aden will be in danger if the government does not react with force,"" one official in the province told CNN. The official said the United States has taken part in three of the airstrikes, but said Yemen's air force is leading the operation. He did not detail the type of support provided. ""The U.S. is involved in a number of the latest attacks, but that does not mean our air force is not in control of the raids occurring,"" the official said. A second official said that strikes against al Qaeda will continue throughout the week and that militants have evacuated a number of posts. Pakistan sentences bin Laden widows . The offensive comes after militants killed dozens of troops and seized large quantities of weapons when they raided a military zone earlier this week. Numerous other Yemeni soldiers are still being held hostage by militants since the attacks, two officials confirmed. Al Qaeda fighters have expanded their control over parts of Yemen in the past year, leading politicians to consider the option of dialogue with the militant network. Sheikh Sadeq Ahmar, head of the country's most powerful Hashed tribe, said Monday that he supports talks with the jihadists. And in March, Ali Obaid, the spokesman for the country's highest security authority, told CNN that Yemen's military committee welcomed dialogue with al Qaeda if they accept specific terms, lay down their arms and hand over territory under their control.","Yemen's air force has been pounding al Qaeda hideouts in the country's south .

"(CNN) -- When Katy Wilson was born with Down syndrome, doctors told her mother that the infant likely would never walk or talk. Katy Wilson says she wants her athletic successes to surprise people and give them hope. She sure showed them. Wilson, now 29, has won two international gold medals in the Special Olympics for her gymnastic abilities. She turns cartwheels for her floor routine and does acrobatics on the balance beam. She also goes on public speaking tours. ""Most of all, I love doing speeches because I want them [the audience] to be surprised just how good my speeches are,"" she said by phone. Wilson's story -- and countless other stereotype-bending stories like it -- is possible in part because of the dogged vision of Eunice Kennedy Shriver and the Special Olympics organization she founded more than four decades ago. Shriver, who died Tuesday, started the organization as a sports camp for special-needs kids and adults in her backyard in Maryland in 1962. The camp, in part, was inspired by the life of Shriver's sister, Rosemary Kennedy, who had an intellectual disability. The Special Olympics has grown from that small camp into a global organization that helps 3 million athletes with Down syndrome, autism and other intellectual disabilities compete for medals in an array of sports. Her legacy will live in the stories of hope and against-the-odds success she made possible through the Special Olympics.  See photos of Eunice Kennedy Shriver Â» . ""She helped forever alter how people with intellectual disabilities are viewed and treated and respected,"" said Amie Dugan, a spokeswoman for the Special Olympics. ""This is a population that 40 years ago they were beyond marginalized. They were disenfranchised from society. ""It was considered the status quo ... to put them in an institution and never think about that again. And she changed all of that. She brought them out into the light."" An estimated 200 million people in the world live with intellectual disabilities. That population was largely unseen and voiceless in 1968 when Shriver stepped to the microphone to announce the start of the first Special Olympic Games at Chicago's Soldier Field. ""In ancient Rome, the gladiators went into the arena with these words on their lips,"" she told the 1,000 athletes in the stadium. ""'Let me win, but if I cannot win, let me be brave in the attempt.'"" In 2007, the most recent Special Olympics World Summer Games were held in Shanghai, China. More than 7,000 athletes competed. The sports competitions are held in the winter and summer on four-year intervals, just like the Olympic Games; people from countries as far-flung as Tunisia, Rwanda and Sri Lanka participate in events that include skiing, volleyball and track and field. Before the program, people with intellectual disabilities were only told what they could not accomplish, said David Tolleson, executive director of the National Down Syndrome Congress. ""Special Olympics emphasizes what folks can do, and it does it in a manner that's fun and exciting and it offers a sense of community both within the family of those with developmental disabilities as well as with the greater community at large -- the volunteers who come in and have some of their misconceptions or preconceptions cast aside when they realize how much people with developmental disabilities truly are capable of,"" he said. The program continues to expand its global reach, but in many places, people with intellectual disabilities lack basic human rights, said Dugan. Thomas Webb, a Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. Foundation fellow who studies public policy and intellectual disability, said it's still a challenge in the United States to integrate people with disabilities into mainstream society. No one knows all of the solutions, but Shriver and the Special Olympics have had ""significant impact"" on peoples' lives, he said. Coming from the athletic Kennedy family, Shriver realized the wide-ranging benefits of sports, said Dugan. ""It's just a fun way to bring people with intellectual disabilities and their non-disabled peers together,"" she said, ""because everyone enjoys competition and fun and exercise and getting out there."" The fun translates into experience that helps Special Olympians build communities of friends and succeed in the workplace, advocates and athletes said. Melissa Stokes, 26, started playing sports with the Special Olympics when she was 8. She now is a volunteer Special Olympics ski coach in the Denver area and works as an assistant at the Special Olympics of Colorado office. ""We're like a little family,"" she said of her ski team. She added: ""Because we have special needs doesn't mean we can't do stuff. We can still accomplish a lot."" More than half of Special Olympians in the U.S. are employed, according to the organization, compared with an estimated 10 percent of the intellectually disabled population at large. Jeanne Wilson, the mother of the gymnast with Down syndrome , started tearing up when she recounted the moment she saw her daughter -- whose future once looked so uncertain -- standing atop an awards podium with a gold medal draped around her neck. ""It was just amazing because that really gave her confidence. And I don't think people realize how much it means to a young person who you might have thought did not have a future or might not ever have a chance to walk,"" she said. ""To see her doing a routine on balance beam or a floor routine is pretty amazing."" Katy Wilson, who lives in Gainesville, Georgia, continues to train as a gymnast. She also goes bowling with a group of Special Olympians most Fridays. They call themselves the Alley Kats, and Wilson describes the bowlers as some of her best friends. ""I love bowling because it is so much fun being out there being able to have friends,"" she said. ""It's exciting to do bowling because I get a lot of scores."" When she's not in training, Wilson works at a steakhouse as a hostess. ""I get their coffee, I get their bread, I get their drinks, I do the silverware, I sweep up, I do the hostess,"" she said. ""Oh, I love the job because everybody's so nice to me, especially the managers, they give me hope and they're so excited to have me there and I'm so happy to be there with them."" As a global ambassador for the Special Olympics, Wilson tours the country telling people about her life story. She says she hopes it reminds them that everyone can succeed with a positive attitude. She grew up watching her sister do cartwheels as a cheerleader. She modeled her life in her sister's image, but she forged a life that's all her own.","Eunice Kennedy Shriver started Special Olympics in her backyard in 1962 .

At least two U.S. drone strikes are conducted daily since mid-April in southern regions controlled by al Qaeda fighters, said a Yemeni presidential aide who asked not to be identified due to the sensitivity of the issue. ""This is part of the strategy to uproot al Qaeda from areas they control,"" the aide said. "" The Yemeni government is giving the green light for the attacks and targets are chosen carefully."" The airstrike is the latest in a series of attacks this week. Seven militants were killed in Zinjibar and Lowder districts Monday, two security officials said. Hundreds of government-supported citizen fighters arrested three al Qaeda fighters in neighboring Lahj province on Sunday. Three citizen fighters were killed when militants ambushed a checkpoint at an entrance to Lauder district, residents said. Additional forces were deployed near embassies this week amid fears that al Qaeda is planning an attack in the Yemeni capital of Sanaa, the interior ministry said . The ministry said new checkpoints were set up on major roads in Sanaa. Despite the intensified attacks, Ansar al-Sharia, an al Qaeda-affiliated group, says it controls most strategic areas in the southern province. Earlier this week, Ansar al-Sharia released 73 soldiers it was holding captive.","More air attacks are expected in the next two weeks, officials say .

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- U.S. drone strikes targeted al Qaeda hideouts in southern Yemen on Wednesday, killing 27 suspected militants, local government officials said. No senior al Qaeda leaders died in the attack in the Shabwa province town of Azzan, the officials said. The strikes' targets included a home suspected of harboring militants, three senior security officials said. The defense ministry had earlier said that 30 people died in Azzan airstrikes, but did not say whether the fatalities were caused by the drone strikes or Yemeni forces, who were also conducting airstrikes in the area. Militants headed to Azzan after they lost control of Abyan province Tuesday, sending the town's residents fleeing over fear of more strikes. Obama ramps up covert war in Yemen . ""Azzan is where we expect the militants to seek shelter after the fall of Jaar,"" said a senior security official. ""It's their last stronghold in Yemen."" The officials did not want to be named because they are not authorized to talk to the news media. Al Qaeda denied in a statement posted no jihadist websites that any militants were killed and said that 10 drone strikes were conducted in Shabwa. At least 14 U.S. drone strikes were conducted over the past two days in both southern provinces, security officials said. One of the strikes targeted the convoy of Jalal Beleidi, a top commander of the Ansar al-Sharia Islamist militant group. Beleidi, who was fleeing Jaar on his way to the coastal town of Shaqra, escaped unharmed, the officials said. Yemeni forces are patrolling major towns in the province in search for militants, witnesses said. The defense ministry said the road linking Abyan to Aden reopened after militants lost control of the province. Yemen is sending hundreds of troops to Jaar to maintain control of the town, officials said. Three-hundred al Qaeda militants fled Tuesday, said Jamal al-Aqel, the governor of Abyan, who urged the government to help rebuild the province. More than 150,000 Abyan residents were displaced last year after fleeing the war. They are living in shelters in neighboring Aden and Lahj provinces. The new government plans to search for al Qaeda sleeper cells in major Yemeni cities, said Ali Saeed Obaid, a spokesman for the military committee, the country's highest military authority.

"(Mashable)  -- The Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), with the cooperation of Dutch anti-piracy group BREIN, has quietly shuttered 12 torrent websites in the U.S. and at least 39 sites abroad by filing copyright violation complaints with the sites' hosting providers. The names of the sites themselves remain unknown; so far, however, the major players seem to be unaffected. The specific URLs are not being released because frequently the affected sites will spring up elsewhere online under a different TLD (e.g., TorrentMovies.com becomes TorrentMovies.info). Releasing the names of the sites would make it much easier for users to find their new URLs in the future. This news, while interesting and concerning, is a far cry from the 70-plus sites shut down by the Department of Homeland Security last November, the culmination of a brewing crackdown effort. Some torrent and file-sharing sites, including RapidShare, have even taken to hiring lobbyists of their own. A company spokesperson told Mashable recently, ""Given the fact that the U.S. government is currently undertaking great efforts to fight copyright infringements on the internet, our having a voice in Washington could be beneficial for us as well as for the U.S. government."" According to TorrentFreak, BREIN ""has (temporarily) disabled more than 1,000 torrent sites in The Netherlands, and they are now helping the MPAA towards doing the same in the U.S."" In a BREIN release, the organization stated that it helped the MPAA take down around 29 sites last year; and earlier this month, it shut down 39 sites in the Netherlands for the MPAA, as well. BREIN also conducts these anti-piracy ""stings"" in 11 other countries, including Germany, France, Britain and Canada. Its director, Tim Kuik, said in the statement (via Google Translate), ""There will be new sites, but we take them down fast so they cannot grow."" Â© 2013 MASHABLE.com.

"(CNN) -- A suspected tornado touched down in south-central Texas on Monday, the National Weather Service said, as a slow-moving line of storms brought high winds, heavy rains and large hail as it swept eastward. The Medina County, Texas, Sheriff's Office ""received over 300 calls indicating there is damage or injuries"" due to the storm, said a woman from the sheriff's office who identified herself only as Heather. This came after one twister landed around 8 p.m. Monday near Natalia, a town of about 1,400 residents that is in the county. ""It struck us pretty hard,"" she said from the county, which is about 30 miles west of San Antonio. ""At this point, we have unknown (amount) of injuries, but we have a lot of damage."" Charlie's Ice House, a bar in Devine, was in shambles after potent winds barreled through, ripping off its roof. ""It happened so fast and everyone was getting away from the doors ... and then it was over,"" said co-owner Marilyn Banks, adding that none of the 20 to 25 people inside suffered much more than a few scratches. Authorities, though, are ""in rescue mode"" searching for a motorcycle rider who is unaccounted for since the system came through, said Lawrence Trevino, San Antonio's emergency manager who is assisting neighboring counties in the response. He said that some injuries have been reported, but there are no known deaths after the strong winds damaged about six homes. Joanne Ortiz said she saw what appeared to be three funnel clouds from her home in Devine. While tornadoes are not new to the area, she said the fact they came in rapid succession was alarming. ""At first we were fascinated by it. But once we saw two of them, we thought, where do we go?"" said Ortiz, who lives in a one-story manufactured home on a 3-acre lot. In Bexar County, which includes San Antonio, Fire Marshall's Office spokeswoman Laura Jesse said there ""are reports of damage to one home in southwest Bexar County"" but otherwise the impact appears to be limited. ""This is a rural area, so it's not that populated,"" Jesse said. Parts of north, south and central Texas, including the Dallas-Fort Worth area, were under a tornado watch, the weather service said. The tornado is related to a weather system that's also triggered flash flood watches and warnings for sections of Arkansas, Oklahoma, Texas and Louisiana. The threat of heavy rain will continue across the area into Tuesday. Meanwhile, much of the eastern two-thirds of the country continued to have unseasonably warm temperatures, a day before spring officially starts. Parts of Arizona remained buried under snow Monday as a surprising late-winter onslaught paralyzed travel and closed schools. The weather agency issued a winter storm warning for the mountains of central and eastern Arizona through early Monday. Another winter storm warning was issued Monday afternoon for parts of southeast Arizona. The city of Flagstaff was still digging out of 10 to 14 inches of snow from the weekend, which prompted school closings in the city. The city of Prescott received 8 to 12 inches. iReport: Are you there? Send us your weather photos . Brandon Neuman of Flagstaff produced a time-lapse video of about a foot of snow falling on his backyard deck in seven hours. ""The other day it was 65 degrees, next day it is snowing, so it's been crazy,"" Neuman said. ""It killed a lot of people's travel plans because the highways are a mess."" But in eastern parts of the country, balmy conditions prevailed, with temperatures well above average from Texas and the Midwest all the way to the East Coast.

"(CNN) -- With all the talk this week of Congress's manic eleventh hour rush to raise the debt ceiling and prevent a possible U.S. default, it has been easy to forget the underlying issue: the U.S. government will not always be able to spend more money than it receives in taxes. Last year, American debt grew the size of the entire Mexican economy. We have a government that can't stop borrowing, a Federal Reserve that can't stop printing and a world that is overloaded with debt. Stock prices are being propped up, but wages are being kept down. This arrangement may work for Wall Street, but it is clearly not working for Main Street. We are supposed to be witnessing an economic recovery in the U.S., yet we are forever taking on more and more debt. We borrow money at almost double the rate of economic growth, and the Fed is facilitating this by artificially keeping interest rates at rock bottom. The market is no longer a free market -- it's being run by the government, and that means it's run by political decisions. Ultimately this addiction to debt will kill any recovery, as so much tax revenue will need to be used to pay off the interest. Currently the U.S. pays as much in interest as the total size of the economy of a medium-sized country like South Africa. Think about what will happen when rates really go up. The U.S. is perceived to be making decisions that are based solely on its own interests. And the issue is not that the U.S. cannot pay its debt. It can, by printing more dollars. The real concern is the confidence foreign investors have -- or don't have -- in the U.S. financial system, and their feeling that they are being used as a pawn for U.S. domestic political reasons. U.S. treasuries are seen as the safest financial instrument on earth. If people begin to think American bonds aren't as safe a bet as they used to be, we could see the world become a very different place. Don't forget that almost 50% of U.S. debt is held by foreigners. Japan and China are the largest holders of that debt, with about 10% each. They are financing the American dream. If they start doubting the U.S. political situation, they will demand higher interest rates. Funnily enough, the impact of this latest debt ceiling crisis on the market is not as negative as you would think -- mainly because the uncertainty has made the Fed less likely to withdraw its support, which is seen as very good thing. Perversely, U.S. treasury bonds become more attractive when there is more uncertainty, because of the flight to safety. We are in a bull market on Wall Street because interest rates are held artificially low by the Fed. And as long as interest rates are low, people do not know what to do with their money in terms of getting a good return rate. We should also not forget the impact that U.S. rates have on the global economy. If rates go up in the U.S. it is very easy to see a crisis for emerging markets as global money flows return to the U.S., where it gets a higher yield. Failing to increase the debt ceiling would probably not have been a huge event for the markets at first, but if the government ever defaults on its obligations, all bets are off. Fear could easily replace greed. Disaster seems to be averted for now, but the debt ceiling crisis is yet another unintended consequence of money printing by the Fed, which is allowing the U.S. government to take on ever increasing piles of debt at absurdly low interest rates. Without the Fed, rates would be much higher and it would be impossible to borrow as much money. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Lex van Dam.","Fight over debt ceiling ignores bigger problem of untenable U.S. debt load .
Current arrangement works for Wall Street but not for Main Street .
Federal Reserve is allowing U.S. government to take on debt at absurdly low interest rates ."
"(CNN) -- It's time to do away with vanity plates. For the most part, vanity plates have flown under the legal radar, but the time has come for the government to give up on this constitutionally corrupt policy. Like the lottery, vanity plates are another thinly veiled money grab by the government against its citizens. A Michigan case is putting vanity plates under the spotlight. That state's scheme is similar to many other states' vanity plate programs. On standard plates, the letter and number configuration is computer-generated and random. For an additional fee of about $30, Michigan allows vehicle owners to select their own unique letter and number configuration for their license plates -- with limitations. And that's where the constitutional trouble begins. Michigan's Motor Vehicle Code contains a ""content-based"" restriction: It prohibits officials from issuing a personalized license plate ""that might carry a connotation offensive to good taste and decency."" And there's the constitutional problem: ""offensiveness"" and ""good taste and decency"" are in the eye of the beholder -- the beholder here being whoever is reviewing the application. In 2012, Sgt. Michael Matwyuk decided to order a personalized license plate that would express his identity as a so-called ""infidel"" when he served in Iraq. ""Infidel"" is a term that is commonly used by both enemy forces and our own military in the current theater of war, as explained by Matwyuk. It is not a word banned by the FCC or recognized as unprotected speech. He began by visiting the vanity plate page on Michigan's website, and clicked on an Iraq War Veteran service plate, which allows six characters for personalized plates. Because the word ""infidel"" contains seven letters, Matwyuk tried the shorter ""INFIDL,"" but it was ""not available."" Matwyuk got creative and typed ""INF1DL"" into the spaces provided, replacing the letter I with a numeral 1. It was available, and Sarge selected it. Unfortunately, shortly after, a letter from the Department of State rejected Matwyuk's ""INF1DL"" plate because someone -- a person, not a website program -- determined it might carry a connotation offensive to good taste or decency. Asking for constitutional trouble . The law as written is constitutionally suspect. First, it's vague. Read the Michigan prohibition again. Once you have, ask yourself: ""Do I now clearly know which words are prohibited and which words are not?"" Put another way, if you were asked to come up with a list of offensive words, would ""infidel"" have been in the top 20 of your list? Top 50? If a law does not provide clear instructions on its face so that reasonable citizens can determine what speech is prohibited, then it's likely unconstitutional as written -- before it's even applied. An additional way a scheme is unconstitutional on its face is when the person making the decisions (like the official who wrote the rejection letter to Matwyuk) has ""unfettered discretion."" It seems pretty clear that the website first approved Sarge's INF1DL, but then a human later vetoed it, with, apparently, unfettered discretion. Being offended does not an offensive word make . As a society, we have fatally mixed up the concept of subjective versus objective when it comes to offensiveness. Because an individual is offended by a word, that word does not thereby become universally offensive. Determining whether something is offensive must use an objective standard, which means society on the whole should concur that it is taboo. Too often when a single individual is offended, we make the illogical jump to conclude that the material offending one is now offensive to all. Worse, we now deem material offensive not for its actual measured effect, but for its untested potential effect. No one was actually offended by Matwyuk's plate, likely not even the person who actually rejected it. Rather, it was banned because the official imagined some potential offensiveness. In addition to confusing subjective versus objective in defining ""offensive,"" we've placed government officials in the business of foreseeing the future, with an overly cautious eye. INFIDL versus INF1DL . INFIDL is not a word. And if INFIDL is not a word, then INF1DL is definitely not a word. It has a number in it! How offensive could it possibly be? As spoken, INF1DL actually doesn't even sound like ""infidel."" It's pronounced ""inf-number-one-del."" To interpret it as the offending ""infidel"" in fact requires a mistake by your brain, and an error in pronunciation. Either way, the official who rejected Matwyuk's INF1DL had to reason that the number 1 is functionally the same as the letter I. They're not even the same species. But fortunately for this government official, no one will ever discipline him for erring on the side of supercareful. And just like that, the First Amendment can be violated. It's not really the official's fault. Someone gave him too much power. That someone is the Michigan Legislature. If ""infidel"" is offensive, it's offensive because of its religious connotation only. It's not one of the seven deadly words you can't hear on TV, and it's not obscene by itself under any test of the Supreme Court. Therefore, Michigan wades headlong into another First Amendment quagmire: entanglement with religion. The absurd discussion follows: Is CRUSDR okay? How about ATHEST? If many different people would disagree on whether a word (or nonword) is offensive, then the statute has failed to properly instruct its citizens on what is prohibited. Worse, should our government really be volunteering for this litigation? Should your tax money be spent litigating in federal court whether IPASGAS should be stamped on a license plate? Government selling ad space . Can I pay extra to have my passport custom ""bedazzled"" with rhinestones, the way people do with their iPhones? Of course not. Sometimes our government has a greater duty than entering the market for a quick buck from its citizens. And is the $30 that Michigan extracts from its citizens really worth it? People have to be hired and extra infrastructure must be created to process those applications. Then, when they are litigated because citizens' applications are rejected, how fast do you think attorney fees burn through those state revenues? Vanity plates serve no public interest. Vanity plates represent a state selling ad space on its property, disregarding a known constitutional risk, and then losing more money defending the practice. Citizens already have the constitutional privilege to stencil virtually any word on their cars as it is (with the usual limitations of the First Amendment), without their government trying to make an extra buck on the few square inches that are state property . Matwyuk should have gotten his plate, but really no one should have them . If the Michigan scheme were constitutional to begin with, Matwyuk should have been entitled to his customized plate under any analysis of ""offensive"" that is reasonable, and not driven by neurosis. Instead, officials employed an overly risk-averse, pre-emptive analysis. Since the official has unfettered discretion, he'll never get in trouble for the plates that never saw the light of day. Those facts may be fatal to the statute and the vanity plate scheme. The real question is whether vanity plates are ultimately worth the constitutional and financial burdens they create. And the answer is: PRBYNOT. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Danny Cevallos.","A Michigan man who served in Iraq was denied a vanity plate saying ""INF1DL""
Danny Cevallos says it ran afoul of Michigan rule banning ""offensive"" plates .
He says states have no business dictating what words people can put on their plates .

"(CNN) -- The agreement reached by President Obama and Congress to reopen the government and avoid default was a punt, a punt that traveled 15 yards. It wasn't a budget agreement because nothing in it addressed any budgetary issues, nor was it a spending agreement, because spending continues at its current pace. It was a process agreement that saved the day, although the same fights that led to this crisis have been merely rescheduled. Another government shutdown is looming on January 16 and the nation will hit its debt limit on February 7. As far as government work goes, it's about the best we can expect. And that's the problem: The failure of our government to work properly, thanks to the weak leadership and ideological, re-distributionist preferences of President Obama combined with a deeply divided Republican caucus, means we're likely to go through the same saga again. It's also a reflection of how massive the nation's debt problem is and how difficult it will be to reduce it. Here's what has gone wrong. Let's start with the tea party. The tea party has been blamed more than any other group for the standoff of the past month. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and dozens of House Republicans have taken the brunt of the blame as the image of the Republican Party has hit record lows. The tea party's dedication to repealing Obamacare and shrinking the size of government, as opposed to simply slowing the rate of growth, is admirable and desirable. Those goals unite the Republican Party. But tea party objectives will not be achieved if it doesn't change tactics. Under our Constitution, massive overnight change is impossible unless you win elections. If the tea party wants results, it needs to elect candidates who can win and deliver votes in the House and Senate. In many ways, the tea party's fight is not with President Obama or with Speaker John Boehner. It's with James Madison. The tea party can't be President Obama's check and balance without realizing that under our Constitution the President also gets to be the tea party's check and balance. The fundamental error Republicans made in this fight was overreach. In trying to repeal Obamacare, Cruz and the tea party led Republicans into a fight that could not be won because they did not have the votes to win it. It's that simple. Instead, this fight unrealistically raised the hopes of the GOP base for an effort that never had a chance. Ultimately, legislation like keeping the government open or increasing the debt limit must pass, but that doesn't mean anything can be attached to it. Republicans turned a must-pass goal into a will fail effort. The tea party rebuttal? That type of practical approach is why Washington is a mess to begin with. They say they don't care about the politics, they ardently are trying to save the nation. Fair points. But the nation won't be saved if they can't muster the votes to save it. As for President Obama, if he wanted to achieve a fundamental grand bargain with Republicans, he would have done so in 2011 when an agreement with Republicans was in sight. He talks like a centrist willing to break with liberal economic ideology, but from the stimulus to Obamacare to his push for tax increases, he has no record of governing like one. Instead, he is driven to redistribute things, whether it's income, wealth or in the case of Obamacare, health insurance. He views the role of government as taking things of value from one citizen so they can be given to another. He promised that if you liked your health insurance you could keep it. Of course it's not as simple as that, as people are now realizing. For example, some companies may be dumping part or all their health coverage as Obamacare comes online, leaving employees to pay higher premiums and in some cases getting less coverage on the exchanges, according to a National Journal analysis. Obama says the debt is a ""long-term"" problem, ignoring that it has grown from $10.6 trillion to nearly $17 trillion on his watch. He refuses to make any fundamental changes to Obamacare but he insists that Republicans agree to additional tax increases. Throughout the recent impasse, he refused to negotiate. His poll numbers are around the worst levels of his presidency. The Real Clear Politics average shows more than half the country disapproves of the way he is handling his job. He is an unpopular president. The tea party gets stuck with the extremist label, but for many, it's Obama's policies that are extreme. Unless the just completed battle has exhausted both sides and they suddenly see merit in compromise and negotiation, January will be a repeat of October. In that case, the only issue left is which party do the voters kick out when they realize the only thing elected officials know how to do is punt? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ari Fleischer.","Ari Fleischer: Shutdown deal reached by Obama, Congress was a punt that went 15 yards .
He says it'll likely happen again in January. Tea party's goals admirable, tactics must change .

"Port Sudan, Sudan (CNN) -- A humanitarian land convoy heading to Gaza from South Africa reached Port Sudan, Sudan on the Red Sea Wednesday and is destined to become the first relief mission to Gaza from Africa. ""I was inspired last year by the convoys that went to Gaza from Europe, so we asked ourselves; why not from Africa?"" said Sheikh Walid al-Saadi of the South African Relief Agency (SARA). After eight months of preparation, the land convoy which consists of ten trucks, explained al-Saadi, departed Durban, South Africa on June 26 and has passed through seven countries thus far including Botswana, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Tanzania, Kenya, Ethiopia and Sudan. It is to unload its shipment of humanitarian aid in Port Sudan on ships that will head to Suez, Egypt where members of the convoy will receive their trucks after flying to Egypt from Sudan. The convoy has received the support of several South African leaders including Bishop Desmond Tutu who said in a YouTube video message: ""I want to congratulate SARA and wish them well. You are helping to do God's work; God bless you."" Gaza has been under a land, sea and air blockade by Israel since 2007. Israeli authorities say the blockade is to limit rocket attacks fired from Gaza and to prevent Hamas authorities who govern the Gaza from obtaining weapons and funds. Egyptian authorities had maintained a blockade on Gaza from 2007 to 2011. Last May, United Nations Under-Secretary General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator Valerie Amos said that the blockade of Gaza has resulted in a stifling of economic activity and a serious decline in education, health care and water and sanitation services. The Africa to Gaza Aid Convoy's mission follows recent attempts by European and American ships to reach Gaza as part of a coalition known as Freedom Flotilla II but were blocked from doing so. They include the American ship The Audacity of Hope flotilla that was prevented by Greek authorities from sailing to Gaza from Athens and the French ship Dignite-Al-Karma that was intercepted by an Israeli naval ship. Last year, Israeli commandos prevented the Gaza Freedom Flotilla from reaching Gaza from Turkey and bordered the ship Mavi Marmara. The raid on the ship led to the death of nine Turkish activists. ""We are a peaceful convoy on an aid mission,"" affirms al-Saadi. ""We can't predict what is going to happen, we know there's pressure on the Egyptian government, but you never know."" According to al-Saadi, the Egyptian government has not allowed the convoy to drive on Egyptian land and has requested they go straight via sea from Port Sudan to Al-Arish near the Egyptian-Gaza border. ""[But] the ships from Port Sudan can only go to Suez, so we are trying to solve this problem,"" he says. The trip from South Africa to Sudan has had its challenges, al-Saadi explains. ""We were delayed at some borders for no clear reasons and some of the roads were very bad,"" he says. ""We got to a place between Zambia and Tanzania that was full of pot holes; I think if one of the trucks had fallen into one you would've needed a crane to take it out."" The convoy's shipment, al-Saadi continues, is carrying aid to the people of Gaza including ""one hundred and twenty two generators, diapers for the elderly and children, cloths, stationery, and we intend to buy medicine in Egypt."" Palesa Rasekoala, 46, an architect and member of the convoy says ""after the last Gaza War, the images I saw, of legs being amputated without anesthesia, for me, that was it, I don't' know the details, but I know a wrong is being done."" Rasekoala, a granddaughter of South African ANC activists, continued: ""As a South African and after what we went through and coming out of that and having the support of the world, and as a Christian, I had to take a stand.""","Land convoy from South Africa is bound for Gaza .
The convoy has crossed seven countries so far .

"(CNN) -- Scores of child soldiers, some of them as young as eight years old, have been rescued from an armed group in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the U.N. mission in the African nation said. The 82 children, 13 of them girls, were recovered since Sunday from the Mayi Mayi Bakata Katanga armed group in the southeastern Katanga province, MONUSCO said Friday in a statement. The children, aged up to 17 years, had reportedly been recruited by the armed group within the past six months, it said. Forty of them have been reunited with their parents. The others are being cared for until they can be returned home, the statement said. ""We are extremely concerned by continued reports of active recruitment by Mayi Mayi Bakata Katanga and other armed groups in eastern DRC,"" said MONUSCO chief Martin Kobler. ""Children face unacceptable risks when they are recruited for military purposes. The recruitment of children, particularly those under 15 years of age, could constitute a war crime and those responsible must be held to account."" Child protection agencies in the province orchestrated the rescues, MONUSCO said. Since the start of the year, 163 children, including 22 girls, have been rescued from Mayi Mayi Bakata Katanga by MONUSCO and child protection workers, the statement said. The country's mineral-rich eastern part is at the epicenter of a political and ethnic conflict involving its neighbors to the east, Uganda and Rwanda, and has long been embroiled in violence. The region's humanitarian crisis involves 2.6 million internally displaced people, the United Nations says, with 6.4 million people in need of food and emergency aid. Nearly 20,000 troops are deployed in the Democratic Republic of Congo as part of the MONUSCO peacekeeping force.","82 child soldiers have been rescued from an armed group, U.N mission says .

"(CNN) -- A congressional hearing Thursday on aviation security will be missing its chief witness, who declined to testify. Transportation Security Administration chief John Pistole had been asked to appear before the Transportation and Infrastructure subcommittee on aviation on the impact of his agency's policies on passengers and the airline industry. But Pistole said he had no plans to attend, arguing the panel has no jurisdiction over TSA matters. The TSA has been regularly criticized over the years by Republicans in the House, especially, for not becoming leaner and more efficient. ""No representative from TSA will be present,"" Pistole said in a statement posted on the agency's website. It is not common but not unheard of for an agency director to decline to testify at a congressional hearing outside of a scheduling conflict or another agreed-upon reason. The full Transportation Committee is chaired by Florida Republican John Mica, who has been a tough critic of TSA -- whether led by Republican or Democratic administrations -- for its size, for long security lines at airports, and for screening policies he says have fallen short. Mica's chairmanship ends in January due to House Republican rules that limit such tenures. The committee insisted it has legislative jurisdiction when it comes to the airline industry and its passengers, who help finance TSA operations through security fees. The committee said it has a responsibility to ensure that travelers, airport operations and U.S. commerce are not disrupted by TSA policies, procedures or operations. ""TSA is missing the point,"" said Justin Harclerode, a spokesman for the full committee. ""While this committee does not have direct legislative jurisdiction over TSA, that agency, as with any other agency, has a responsibility to provide congressionally requested testimony or information."" Harclerode said, ""Unfortunately, TSA regularly chooses to not even respond to simple requests for information by this committee."" Pistole said TSA would continue to work with ""committees of jurisdiction"" on agency matters.

"(CNN) -- Bush fires blazing in Australia's New South Wales claimed their first victim Friday after a man died of a suspected heart attack defending his home against the blaze on the NSW Central Coast. Australian media reports said Walter Lindner, 63, collapsed while battling alongside his neighbor to save his heritage-listed homestead. He was rushed to hospital but was later pronounced dead. Meanwhile, more than 20 bush fires continued to burn uncontrolled across the state despite the easing weather conditions, according to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. Authorities say hundreds of homes have been lost with the worst hit areas in the Blue Mountains, a World Heritage area to the west of Sydney, sending thick plumes of smoke into the air. Firefighters were battling 98 fires across New South Wales as of late Thursday, according to the state's Rural Fire Service. Earlier Thursday, the fire service tweeted that 34 blazes were still out of control. More than 100 firefighters were battling flames in Heatherbrae, where one fire has so far destroyed 3,500 hectares (8,649 acres), the service said. New South Wales Premier Barry O'Farrell warned at a news conference Thursday that hundreds of homes could be destroyed by the time the crisis is over. He paid tribute to the efforts of the emergency responders battling the flames. ""Today's conditions, both the hot, dry conditions but also the wind conditions, have contributed to the difficulties faced by firefighters and communities on the ground,"" he said. ""This difficult, damaging and dangerous day and these conditions are not going to be over quickly,"" he said. ""Weather conditions are changing. It will take some days to see the end of these fires, and I suspect if we get through that without the loss of life, we should thank God for miracles."" Footage broadcast by CNN affiliate Seven Network showed flames consuming homes. The New South Wales Rural Fire Service has issued emergency warnings for the most risky situations. They include the State Mine Fire, a large bush fire moving from Lithgow toward Bilpin, in the Blue Mountains, which has burned more than 20,000 hectares (more than 49,000 acres) of bushland, firefighters said. Another blaze threatens homes in the Springwood area of the Blue Mountains.","NEW: 63-year-old man dies helping neighbor in New South Wales .

"(CNN) -- John Lydon is wondering whether he's looking old. He jokes that the camera should be smeared with Vaseline to give a flattering, soft-focus effect. ""Or we could use butter!"" he laughs in reference to a series of TV commercials which helped to fund his band's latest album. His band is, of course, Public image Limited -- one of the most inventive and influential groups of the post-punk era. PiL were formed by Lydon following the disintegration of his previous band, The Sex Pistols - the group that pioneered the punk era in Britain. With the release last year of the critically-acclaimed ""This is PiL,"" after a recording hiatus of 20 years, Public image Limited have released nine studio albums spanning 35 years. The Pistols produced just one album and were gone within two years but more column inches and interview minutes have been devoted to that short, sharp, shock to music history than to the story of PiL. That helps to explain why John Lydon has agreed to accept an Icon award from the music rights organization the BMI. Famously selective about awards and honors, Lydon is happy that the award recognizes his songwriting work with both bands and his ""unique and indelible influence on generations of music makers."" False accolades . ""I have earned my wings. I have done enough good work over the years that it's about time someone stood up and said 'Well done John!' We have noticed. It's been negative, negative, negative for far too long. You can have me as an icon but I'm Johnny, I see myself more as an 'I-can' -- I do what I want because I can!"" His attitude to awards is not always so embracing. ""I don't like false accolades ... for me one of the most disgusting offerings was the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. I'm sorry I've got no time for that. I don't view myself as a museum piece and I'm not gonna be craftily shafted in that way and the legacy of what is the Pistols is too good to be just squashed into a glass compartment underneath a staircase in a 'museum'."" Read more: Sex Pistol to Rock Hall: 'Kiss this!' Lydon's mind is as active as ever. He feels he could carry on as a performer until he's 100 unless arthritis intervenes. ""I'm at the stage of life now when I'm 57-years old but I think that's 57-years young. There's so much more to do and learn. I love what I do and I love the release of songwriting. You can coin in words and phrases something that's so hard to explain emotionally. ""I can't write a Pistols song any more. I haven't been able to for a real long time. All of my songwriting now goes into Public Image Limited, which is a much broader expanse and a more difficult terrain in many ways to deal with but ultimately far more rewarding."" On stage . Anyone who saw PiL perform at Glastonbury this summer, or were lucky enough to catch the Sex Pistols during their brief touring career beset by gig bans, could be excused for thinking Lydon was a notoriously shy boy who still suffers from stage fright. ""Once I'm on stage I'm absolutely alright. It's the place I now know and have known for 30 years really -- it's the place I truly belong. That's where I tell it like it is and I get the opportunity to be myself. ""But the fear of letting people down that goes on in my head beforehand is almost at times overwhelming. I can't eat before I go on stage. The trouble with that is I overeat when I get off!"" I was aged 14 when The Sex Pistols crash-landed on my record deck, consigning David Bowie, T.Rex, Elton John and Rod Stewart to the wilderness for years to come. Such music instantly created a small colony of punks growing up in The Lake District - a rural outpost of northern England. Our surroundings couldn't have been further from the urban squalor endured by the young John Lydon in one of the toughest parts of northern London. A combination of poverty and ill health helped mold the boy who became known as Johnny Rotten. ""At seven I had meningitis. I was in a coma for three to four months, spent a year in hospital, it took me something like four years to regain my memory but it left a really, really good thing in me. It was a very serious illness which came close to killing me. What it did was it allowed me to look at myself before I realized who myself was. It created a kind of duality -- a yin and yang -- a kind of Johnny Lydon and a Johnny Rotten and there I was from eight-years old looking at that and wanting to get things right."" Pistol's legacy . Another legacy of his illness was the crumbling teeth which led to the Pistols' guitarist Steve Jones providing him with the nickname ""Johnny Rotten."" Lydon's prickly relations with the other band members are well documented but he says there was always a strong bond beneath it all. ""No we loved each other very, very much it was just that it all got in the way. And now as Pistols we've agreed not to work with one another again, now we can start to be friends once more. From my point of view and I know that Paul Cook the drummer agrees with this, it's more important that we really get back to where we were with each other rather than anything else at all. ""And if you really understand the work that the Pistols did you will appreciate that and understand that that's far more relevant than us trotting up and down the floorboards of a stage and carrying on something that really had its moment -- a very important moment -- but I really don't need to re-tread that one."" Almost forty years after Lydon's controversial song ""God Save the Queen"" was released to coincide with Queen Elizabeth's silver jubilee, the singer reveals that Prince William's marriage to Kate Middleton moved him to tears. Read more: Sex Pistols re-release 'God Save the Queen' ""I don't have a problem with Britain having a royal family -- I had a problem with paying for it. And quite right an' all. There I was as a Sex Pistol and I had to pay this outrageous tax for an entire system that did not want me at all. Well that's not right. ""But at the same time though I love feudalism and all the flag-waving and the ceremony and all that, there's a great sense of thrill in it. The last royal wedding to me was great, it was fantastic. Tears in my eyes. I loved watching the Lancaster bombers and the Spitfires flying over Buckingham Place. That reminded me of family members who had fought in World War Two and things like that."" Johnny Rotten wannabes . As the BMI bestows its own act of ennoblement on Lydon, its president, Del Bryant, lists a few of the many artists influenced by the singer-songwriter: . ""You could certainly talk about The Smiths, then you could move over to the U.S. and talk about Green Day, Guns & Roses, the Red Hot Chili Peppers or Nirvana. He's had a vast influence on many, many people and I think a lot of people have borrowed a lot from his experience and his music."" Influencing people is not entirely the Lydon plan. The gospel he preaches is that people should be themselves rather than copying others. It's clear that Johnny would not have approved of the little group of Lake District punks decorating ourselves with spiky hair, safety pins and bin bags. ""I do not like to see an audience of Johnny Rotten wannabes. To me that's 22 steps backwards. I'm telling you all as a member of the human race, you have this incredible natural born gift of individuality. Why would you want to lose that to pretend to be somebody else?"" And with a chuckle, a gigantic burp, a handshake and a spot of fun-poking at Piers Morgan's expense, John Lydon leaves the room.","John Lydon was lead singer of The Sex Pistols, before forming Public image Limited .

"(EW.com) -- My relationship with the who-should-play-Christian-Grey timeline goes as follows: I wanted Matt Bomer the entire time I read the Fifty Shades of Grey trilogy ... right up until Charlie Hunnam was announced. Then I inexplicably got very excited for Hunnam's portrayal of the troubled billionaire. And now that Hunnam has dropped out of the film, I'm left feeling 50 shades of empty and confused. Do I want Matt Bomer again? Or do I want someone like Hunnam, with a lesser-known face (or one that's usually covered in hair)? Before I could make sense of any of it, I read that Oliver Stone told The Wall Street Journal that Leonardo DiCaprio was his choice for the coveted role. At first, my thoughts reflected my feelings about Ben Affleck being Batman: No, thank you. But after some soul searching and many Google Images, I can't help but think DiCaprio would make one intriguing Christian Grey. It's definitely a film I would see, and here's why it would work: . He's got those eyes. If you want to be literal about it, DiCaprio does have some gorgeous blue-gray eyes. And he almost has that copper hair E L James wrote of so fondly. I'll be the first to admit that his heartthrob phase is behind him, but at the end of the day, DiCaprio is still quite pretty. Plus, he's always stayed in good shape, and getting Christian's abs is just a matter of a good personal trainer and a few months of dieting. He's good at dark-and-twisted. Christian Grey is a tortured soul. His journey is a dark one, and his obsessions all stem from a very raw, emotional place. And if DiCaprio can do anything, it's play a character that is so layered and broken down and yet puts up this playboy front for the crowd (Gatsby, anyone?). He can be scary. Let's keep it real here: Christian Grey can be one scary dude, whether he's defending Anastasia or punishing her, and that aggressive side of a character is another element DiCaprio is darn good at Ã¢â¬â even when the veins aren't popping out of his forehead. He would give the film a certain credibility. No one can deny that seeing DiCaprio's name on the Fifty Shades of Grey poster would add an additional level of credibility to the film, both in that the standard of acting would automatically increase, and DiCaprio's acceptance would mean that the role intrigued him. And to be honest, I can see how it would. The books might be considered soft porn to some, but Christian really is a fascinating character, if you're able to look past the exterior. He would expand the film's audience. Much like I argued that Hunnam would bring in a new Sons of Anarchy audience, DiCaprio's universal appeal would reach out to many more than just those who read the books. He's a great romantic lead. Christian has many sides as a character, and one of those is extremely romantic. And if Titanic taught us something (other than to stay away from icebergs), it's that DiCaprio is very good at being the romantic leading man, even one with a twisted mind. I know he's a bit old, but this is Hollywood, people. And have you seen him in a suit? Although I by no means expect this casting to happen, it certainly expanded my views on who could play Christian. What about you?

"(CNN) -- Tom Watson will become the oldest Ryder Cup captain in golf history when he takes charge of the United States team for the 2014 contest in Scotland -- a country that has played host to some of his greatest successes. The eight-time major winner will be 65 when the event gets underway at Gleneagles. He is the last U.S. captain to have won on European soil, triumphing at The Belfry course in England in 1993. ""I was waiting for about 20 years to get the call,"" the 63-year-old said at his unveiling on Thursday. ""I loved it the first time. It's just a great honor to be able to do it again."" The United States Professional Golf Association (USPGA) turned to the five-time British Open champion in a bid to overturn recent poor form in the Ryder Cup, with Team Europe having won five of the last six matches -- including at Medinah last September. Having turned professional in 1971, Watson is a seasoned veteran of the golfing world whose experience and respect are expected to aid the struggling U.S. team in two years' time. The U.S. has picked a new captain for recent Ryder Cups, which are held every two years, but the USPGA said it wanted to try something different after losing seven of the last nine tournaments. ""The pressure of playing in the Ryder Cup is greater or as great as in any event,"" said Watson, who will replace Davis Love III. ""My job is to help them deal with that pressure. I've lived for that pressure and lived underneath that pressure all my career."" One of the most popular figures on the golfing stage, the revered Watson tried to play down the gulf in age between his players and himself at the New York press conference. The previous oldest U.S. captain was the legendary Sam Snead, who was 57 when he oversaw his nation's retention of the trophy in 1969 -- made famous by Jack Nicklaus' concession of a match-equaling putt to Tony Jacklin. ""I deflect that very simply by saying, 'We play the same game,' "" Watson said. ""I hope I can set the table for these players. I'm the stage manager. I set the stage for them to go out and do what they do. In two years, I hope they can get it done."" Watson's relationship with Tiger Woods will come under intense scrutiny, having criticized the 14-time major winner's behavior on and off the course following his fall from grace in 2009. Nonetheless, Woods was one of the first to offer both his support for Watson and availability for the tournament. ""I would like to congratulate Tom Watson on his selection as Ryder Cup captain,"" Woods said in a statement. ""I think he's a really good choice. Tom knows what it takes to win and that's our ultimate goal. I hope I have the privilege of joining him on the 2014 United States team."" Watson swiftly dampened the sparks of any potential controversy about Woods by stating that he would pick the former world number one in his squad whether or not he qualifies for one of the eight automatic places on offer. The captain also has four discretionary choices. ""I want him on my team,"" Watson said. ""Tiger is maybe the best player in history. If he's not on the team, he's going to be number one in my picks."" Watson, the first U.S. captain to return to the helm since Jack Nicklaus lost on home soil in 1987, also received the backing of Brandt Snedeker -- like Woods, a member of this year's unsuccessful side in Illinois. ""Obviously they were looking outside the box, given our recent failures,"" Snedeker told the PGA Tour website. ""They wanted to get a guy who has had success and commands respect. I think that's why they went this way: to get the U.S. to rally around him as a way to rejuvenate the American side. ""Tom is one of the best competitors of all time. He's going to bring that fire and unwillingness to lose and mental strength that has defined his career."" At the 2009 British Open, Watson missed a par putt on the 72nd hole at Turnberry that would have made him the oldest major champion in the history of the sport. The American has a warm relationship with Scotland, the country where he won his first major title at Carnoustie in 1975 and where he would eventually win half his major crowns. His appointment was announced by the USPGA on nationwide television, with predecessor Love having relinquished his post after what was dubbed the ""Meltdown in Medinah"" in the U.S. but the ""Miracle of Medinah"" in Europe. ""We've got the right guy,"" rallied USPGA president Ted Bishop.","Tom Watson named as United States' Ryder Cup captain for 2014 event in Scotland .

"Mogadishu, Somalia (CNN) -- Soldiers were among the casualties in a suicide attack at a cafe in Somalia early Saturday, authorities told CNN. The incident occurred in the town of Beledweyne in the central part of the African nation and it drew sharp condemnation from the Somali prime minister. Authorities continue to sort out the casualty figures. Police officers said the death toll is as high as 20, but the country's prime minister's office reported at least 13 dead. A few dozen injuries were reported. ""I condemn the attack in the strongest terms and send my condolences to the families of all the innocent civilians who were killed and wounded,"" Prime Minister Abdi Farah Shirdon said. ""The motive of these attacks are to frighten Somali people, these acts of terrorism will not derail the progress made across Somalia."" Mohamed Ibrahim Ali, a Hirran deputy governor, said seven government soldiers died and top Somali military commanders were injured and hospitalized. He said at least 33 people were injured . Al-Shabaab, the militant Islamist group, issued a claim of responsibility on its website and said it killed Somali and Ethiopian troops, who have been fighting Al-Shabaab. A terror group with ties to al Qaeda, Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for last month's four-day siege at the Westgate Mall in Nairobi, Kenya, where at least 67 people died. Beledweyne is the capital of Hirran province, and the attack took place near the administrative office of the region. The city, more than 200 miles north of Mogadishu and near the Ethiopian border, is a commercial hub linking southern and northern Somalia. ""A process of establishing a regional administration in the area has been under way in the past couple of days,"" the prime minister's office said. In June 2009, a suicide bomber detonated an explosives-laden vehicle at the front gate of the Medina Hotel in Beledweyne. Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for that assault, which killed 35 people, including several Somalia diplomats.","The incident took place in the Somali city of Beledweyne .

"(CNN) -- The first full day of the new Bundesliga season kicked-off Saturday with some promising wins for teams that struggled in last year's campaign. Stuttgart opened their account with a 3-0 win over Schalke at the Mercedes Benz Arena on Saturday. Brazilian striker Cacau opened the scoring with a header in the 37th minute, before Austrian striker Martin Harnik doubled the lead 11 minutes into the second half. Japanese striker Shinji Okazaki netted with a superb strike moments from the end to send last season's Champions League semi-finalists to a crushing opening-day defeat. Hanover 96 also got off on the right foot beating Hoffenheim 2-1. A free-kick from former German international Jan Schlaudraff gave last year's fourth-placed side the lead after 15 minutes. But their advantage was short-lived as Hoffenheim hit back three minutes later when Bosnia and Herzegovina midfielder Sejad Salihovic converted from the penalty spot. Hanover were awarded a penalty of their own 12 minutes later when Schlauddraff was brought down. Norwegian striker Mohammed Abdellaoue stepped up to score what proved to be the winner. Champions Dortmund open Bundesliga season with win . A second-half brace from Swedish striker Markus Rosenberg sealed a 2-0 win for Werder Bremen over Kaiserslautern, while 2009 champions, Wolfsburg -- who finished last term in 15th place -- also bagged three points with victory at Cologne. Two goals from former German striker Patrick Helmes and one from Marcel Schaefer (recently stripped of the captaincy by coach Felix Magath) sealed a comfortable 3-0 victory. Newly-promoted Augsburg earned a 2-2 draw at home to Freiburg thanks to two second-half goals from striker Sascha Molders. But last year's second division champions Hertha Berlin went down to a 1-0 defeat at home to Nuremberg in the late kick-off -- 22-year-old Czech striker Tomas Pekhart scoring the decisive goal ten minutes from time.

"New York (CNN) -- With the election just days away, most Americans disapprove of both Democrats and Republicans in Congress, while 58 percent of our fellow citizens say it's time for a third party. So let's break out of the two-party mold and take a look at some of the independent candidates across the country who are surging or struggling as Election Day approaches. More Americans now identify themselves as independent than Democrat or Republican -- and independent candidacies are on the rise. ""Ninety-two percent of the voters this election will find a minor party or independent candidate on their ballot, either for statewide office or for U.S. House,"" said Richard Winger of the Ballot Access News. ""That's higher than in a normal midterm year."" The United States had four independent governors in the 1990s -- Jesse Ventura of Minnesota, Lowell Weicker of Connecticut, Wally Hickel of Alaska, and Angus King of Maine -- but none in the last decade. We've had three independents in the Senate since 2000 -- Vermont's Jim Jeffords and Bernie Sanders as well as Connecticut's Joe Lieberman. And independent Mayor Michael Bloomberg of New York City is mentioned as a possible candidate for president in 2012, following in Ross Perot's self-funded footsteps. This year, we have high-profile candidates running for governor's mansions and for the U.S. Senate as independents. Lincoln Chafee is leading in polls to become the first independent governor of Rhode Island -- one of 10 states where registered independents outnumber Democrats or Republicans. President Obama recently decided not to endorse the Democrat in this race out of deference to Chafee, who had been a rare Republican friend in the Senate and supported Obama in '08. There is ""fatigue with the two parties right now,"" Chafee told me a few months ago. ""People are so weary of the gridlock and partisanship. It's counterproductive to moving the country forward in our very, very challenging times."" In Maine, independent Eliot Cutler is trending upward and collecting major newspaper endorsements for his bid to be governor, though he still trails in the polls. But in a state where two-term Gov. Angus King set the model for independent executives, you can't count out a man whose plans are praised by local newspapers as ""thoughtful, logical and, most important, doable"" -- especially when his GOP opponent is becoming best known for promising to tell the president to ""get the hell out"" of his state. Two serious independent Senate runs are being conducted this year, both by centrist Republicans who found themselves being pushed out by conservative Tea Party activists in closed partisan primaries. In Alaska, polls show incumbent Sen. Lisa Murkowski running neck and neck with GOP nominee Joe Miller, who enjoys the support of former Gov. Sarah Palin. Murkowski is running as an independent in a write-in candidacy. The last successful write-in Senate candidate was Strom Thurmond in 1954. But the Murkowski name is almost as influential in Alaska, and Joe Miller's erratic behavior, including allowing his private security staff to handcuff a local reporter, is provoking a backlash even among conservatives like Ben Stein, who recently called him a ""clown."" In Florida, Gov. Charlie Crist has been campaigning as an independent for the U.S. Senate. He was leading in polls over the summer, but GOP nominee Marco Rubio has been surging by staying competitive among Florida's 2.5 million independent voters, while keeping his Republican base happy. It might surprise you to know that there are 140 independent or third-party candidates running for the House of Representatives this year -- and while most are admittedly long shots, their campaigns retain an aura of idealism and independence. For example, in Mississippi, independent candidate Les Green, a local math teacher, explains the logic of his campaign in a radio ad which proclaims, ""They say the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result. But that's what we've been doing electing the same career politicians of the same political parties year after year -- 13 trillion in debt, open borders, and 8 million lost jobs is what we got. ... I'm no politician, but I know when things don't add up. If we want to change Washington, we have to change who we send there."" One of the most interesting stories of independence this year comes from the Modern Whig Party, a surprising reinvention of the political party to which Henry Clay and Abraham Lincoln once belonged. ""We are in the grass-roots stage, but over time, when people think Whig, we want them to think of non-fringe, pragmatic centrist solutions,"" said Andrew Evans, one of the founders and leaders of the party. ""We wanted that connection to history,"" he said, ""but we have modern principles -- our members tend to be socially liberal but fiscally conservative."" The Modern Whig Party claims 50,000 members in all 50 states, and it is running a handful of candidates for both Congress and statewide office this year. Jeff Vanke is the party's candidate in Virginia's 6th District, running a competitive campaign against Republican incumbent Bob Goodlatte. (There is no Democrat in the race.) Vanke -- a 40-year-old former Eagle Scout with a Ph.D. in history -- has a detailed balanced budget proposal as the centerpiece of his campaign and pledges to keep at least 50 percent of his net worth in federal bonds ""in order to get more of American debt out of Chinese, Middle Eastern, and other foreign hands and back into our own country."" More and more Americans are declaring their independence, because the two major parties seem to be controlled by special interests or the parties' most extreme elements, leading directly to government dysfunction. The parties are not mentioned in the Constitution, but they act as if they are the purpose of our politics. They are not. And until they become more representative and responsive to the majority of Americans who feel politically homeless, we will see more declarations of independents. The courage of their example could drive a renewal of our democracy. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John P. Avlon.","John Avlon: Most people are unhappy with the two major parties and want an alternative .

"Washington (CNN) -- As many as 2,000 additional troops -- including a number of U.S. forces -- may be headed to Afghanistan in the coming weeks under a plan backed by Gen. David Petraeus, CNN has learned. Petraeus has not commented publicly on the need for more troops, but a U.S. defense official and a senior NATO official directly familiar with his thinking and the entire matter have confirmed details to CNN. The proposal for more troops has been briefed to NATO officials behind closed doors. According to the NATO source, it calls for an additional 2,000 troops including at least 750 personnel to serve as trainers for Afghan forces. The trainers specifically would work to teach Afghan units how to support their operations in the field. The balance of the forces would work largely to counter the still significant threat posed by improvised explosive devices (IEDs). Another NATO official tells CNN ""it's highly likely"" many of the additional forces will be U.S. troops. Some NATO member countries are politically ambivalent about the war, he noted. And practically, it is only U.S. forces that have the most advanced equipment to counter roadside bombs . In May, Defense Secretary Robert Gates sent 850 U.S. military trainers on a temporary deployment when European countries could not pledge enough of their own forces. This latest need for 2,000 forces goes beyond that to include counter-IED forces, although some small number of the at least 750 additional trainers could replace those already there. No final decisions have been made on any additional U.S. troops. NATO military authorities are scheduled to meet in the coming days to try to get specific troop commitments from member nations. The goal is to get the matter resolved before a November NATO summit in which U.S. and NATO military commanders are expected to discuss progress in the war. It is not clear whether the new effort will bring the troop levels above the 30,000 additional U.S. forces authorized by President Barack Obama earlier this year, as it will depend on how many troops the NATO countries contribute and the potential re-assignment of existing forces. The president also authorized the Pentagon at the time to deploy 3,000 forces, but more than half of those 3,000 have already been earmarked. NATO sources emphasize they believe the bulk of the additional 2,000 will likely have to come from the US. The potential for yet another troop increase, even a relatively small one, is already being defended by NATO. The senior official told CNN ""this relatively small uplift -- less than 2 percent of the 150,000 in theatre from the coalition -- reflects the direction of the campaign: training the Afghan security forces to prepare for transition, as well as protecting our forces."" A U.S. military official also confirms that in recent weeks the discussion of the ""withdrawal"" of forces from certain areas of Afghanistan beginning in July 2011 has taken a bit of a twist. The official said the withdrawal in some areas will signify that those areas may be turned over to Afghan control, but that may not mean troops will come home. The latest options call for taking those troops not needed and sending them to other areas where security is still poor.","Sources say new troops would include more trainers for Afghan forces .

"(REAL SIMPLE) -- It was mid-December of 2005. I don't know why he said it. Author Anne Roiphe's latest book, ""Epilogue: A Memoir,"" will be released in paperback this fall. I don't know if a shadow had fallen across him, something appalling he saw out of the corner of his eye. I don't know if it was just coincidence or intuition that prompted him, but about a week before my seemingly healthy 82-year-old husband suddenly died, he emerged from the kitchen ready to go to his office, his face clean-shaven, his eyes shining, smiling shyly, holding the copy of the Anthony Trollope book he was rereading, and said to me, ""You have made me very happy.

"(CNN) -- UEFA has opened disciplinary proceedings against Lazio over allegations a section of their supporters chanted racial abuse at Tottenham players in the Europa League on Thursday. Aaron Lennon, Jermain Defoe and Andros Townsend appeared to be subjected to racist abuse -- including monkey chants -- during the goalless draw at White Hart Lane, a game that was watched by UEFA president Michel Platini. Members of Football Against Racism in Football (FARE) who were at White Hart Lane plan to file reports to UEFA to assist with their investigation. Romanian referee Ovidiu Alin Hategan and match delegate Adonis Procopiu have already submitted their reports of the match's events. Tottenham held by Lazio in Europa League . ""UEFA has opened disciplinary proceedings against S.S. Lazio for the improper conduct of the club's supporters (racist behavior) during the UEFA Europa League group stage match on Thursday 20 September between Tottenham Hotspur FC and the Italian side,"" read a UEFA statement. ""The UEFA Control and Disciplinary Body will deal with the case on 18 October 2012."" Lazio could be hit with a fine of $26,000 if their fans are found guilty of racial abuse, while UEFA could also force the club to play their next game behind closed doors. Racism remains ""significant"" problem in English football . Earlier this week Chelsea midfielder John Obi Mikel had to close his Twitter account after receiving racist abuse online. Chelsea issued a statement condemning those responsible and has informed the police following the matter. The statement read: ""We've been made aware of racist tweets targeted at Mikel which are totally unacceptable, disgusting and abhorrent. ""We've informed the police and support taking the strongest possible action."" This season UEFA has fined Bulgarian side Levski Sofia $39,000 for racist behaviour by their fans during the club's Europa League second qualifying round match. Levski fans unveiled a racist banner during their game against Bosnia & Herzegovina's Sarajevo on July 19. ""Fans should realise that the club is responsible for all of their extreme or irrational actions,"" Levski said in a statement. Meanwhile on Thursday, two AIK Solna supporters suffered stab wounds while in Naples for their side's Europa League game against Napoli. A 41-year-old and a 23-year-old were both wounded in the leg, but the club do not believe the attack was football related.","UEFA has opened disciplinary action against Lazio .

"(CNN) -- At the Group of 20 summit in Mexico, President Barack Obama and Vladimir Putin had their first face-to-face meeting since Putin resumed the Russian presidency in May. The joint statement they issued afterward indicated several issues (including Iran and Syria) that the two sides would seek to cooperate on, but it did not announce any significant agreements to do so. More telling were the visual images when the two presidents were together; Obama appeared to be doing his best to project an image of warmth and friendliness, while Putin was stiff and reserved, as he usually is with other world leaders. It appeared that Obama was earnestly seeking to befriend Putin, but Putin was not reciprocating. Why would Putin behave this way? It may be because, unlike Obama, he may not be looking for opportunities to cooperate, nor be embarrassed about forgoing them. He appears to have a much more transactional approach to foreign policy, running something like this: Washington wants Moscow to adopt the American approach to Iran and Syria and several other issues. But it is unwilling to make concessions to Moscow to get it. Two such concessions would be abandoning ballistic-missile defense plans that Moscow finds threatening and repealing the Cold War-era Jackson-Vanik Amendment that continues to limit Russian-American trade. But much to Moscow's frustration, Washington is either unwilling or unable to accommodate Russia. So why should Russia accommodate America? News: Obama and Putin discuss Syria, other topics during two-hour talk . The Obama administration would undoubtedly respond that surely Putin does not want Iran to acquire nuclear weapons, and thus should fully cooperate with the international effort to prevent this. And as Benjamin Rhodes, Obama's director for strategic communications at the National Security Council, was quoted as saying Monday about Syria, ""We've been working to get the Russians to come in line with, frankly, the broad international community. This is not just an issue between the United States and Russia."" Surely Russia would not want to defy the ""broad international community"" on Syria. Especially when it comes to Syria though, Putin and the Russian foreign policy establishment believe that America and the ""broad international community"" have missed the point. As bad as Bashar al-Assad's regime may be, Russia believes its downfall will be far worse for everyone, and not just Russia. The Russians believe the most likely consequence would be the rise of a radical Sunni regime or a drawn-out civil war. Either way, far more people will be killed. Nor does Moscow see increasing sanctions -- much less the use of force -- as being effective in resolving the Iranian nuclear crisis. Moscow doesn't see itself as willfully and wrongly defying ""the broad international community."" It genuinely believes that America and its Western allies are pursuing misguided policies toward Syria and Iran. For Obama to think he can get Moscow to adopt the American approach without compensation is simply an insult to Putin. The Obama administration needs to understand that America cannot have its borscht and eat it, too. If it wants Russia's cooperation on Syria and Iran, it is going to have to make significant concessions to Moscow on other issues. Washington must now decide whether the cooperation it wants from Russia is really worth that. Syria exposes cool spots in U.S.-Russia ties .

"London (CNN) -- A previously unseen portrait of the teenage education activist Malala Yousafzai goes on show Wednesday in a new display of work by Jonathan Yeo opening at the National Portrait Gallery in London. Yeo says the portrait, measuring just less than a meter in height, is larger than life-size and shows the young campaigner, now 16 years old, doing her homework. Malala at U.N.: Taliban failed to silence us . The schoolgirl became the focus of global attention after she was shot in the head by Taliban gunmen last year. Malala was 15 when gunmen jumped onto her school bus and shouted her name, scaring other girls into identifying her, in the attack in Pakistan's Swat Valley. The Taliban's actions sparked massive protests in Pakistan and condemnation worldwide. Since recovering from brain surgery in Britain, Malala has continued her high-profile efforts to improve access to education for everyone. She celebrated her 16th birthday at the United Nations in New York, where she delivered an emotional plea for all children to have the right to go to school. Yeo first met Malala and her family in April 2013, when she had just started school in England and was still recovering from her life-threatening injuries, the gallery said in a news release. Gordon Brown: How Malala forced terrorists onto defensive . ""It was a great privilege to spend some time with Malala and her family at such a pivotal moment in her life,"" said Yeo, who has donated the work to the Malala Fund, which was set up to help girls go to school. ""Given how much she has already been through and all that she represents to the world, it took a while to adjust to the fact that she is still a very fragile teenager.

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Andre Rives no longer mows his own lawn and it's not because he's too busy. The thought of cutting his grass brings back some bad memories. ""Man, did this just happen to me?"" Andre Rives asked himself after losing three toes in a mowing accident. Rives, a 28-year-old cable technician from Ellenwood, Georgia, accidentally cut off three toes on his right foot two years ago while trying out his new riding mower. ""I was going too fast and my shorts got caught on the gear shift,"" Rives recalled. ""I came too close to the curb and I couldn't stop. I ended up sliding off and my foot went under."" Rives is one of 100,000 people in the United States in 2006 who suffered an injury in a lawn mower accident. The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, which tracked the statistics, said the problem is more common than people think. The group reported most injuries occur among adults age 25 to 64, followed by children under the age of 5. More than 22 percent of injuries involved the wrist, hand or finger; nearly 14 percent involved the foot, ankle or toes. ""Most of the time it's a pure accident,"" said Dr. Marvin Royster with the Peachtree Orthopaedic Clinic in Atlanta, Georgia. ""They slipped on the lawn mower, the grass was wet or the lawn mower overturned."" Royster described some injuries, such as burns from touching the muffler, as mild. But other risks are greater; a mower can eject a piece of metal, rock or wood up to 100 mph, he said.  Health Minute: More on lawn mower risks Â» . In Rives' case, the accident resulted in the amputation of three toes. Royster repaired some of the damage in the operating room but was unable to re-attach the digits. He met with Rives recently for a follow up visit. ""Andre is doing very well,"" the doctor said. ""He has a little trouble with running and getting up on the ball of his foot, but other activities, he's able to do quite well."" The Association of Orthopaedic Surgeons noted that most lawn mower injuries are preventable if some basic safety guidelines are followed. ""The main thing is you need to wear protective clothing,"" Royster cautioned. Wear protective goggles, gloves, boots and long pants. Never mow barefoot or in sandals. ""Mowing the grass with flip-flops on or sandals on, you're just asking for trouble,"" Royster said. Have your lawn mower serviced before the start of the season to ensure it's working properly. Do not remove any safety devices on the machine. Be sure to add fuel before starting the engine, not when it's running or hot. The liquid could overflow or flame up. Finally, keep hands and feet away from the lawn mower blade even if the machine is turned off. Once cleared of an obstruction, a blade can swing around and cause injury. Rives realized immediately after his accident that he made a number of common sense mistakes. ""Even in the hospital, I'd say 'Man, did this just happen to me?' "" He said he's learned his lesson. His wife made him sell his riding mower after the accident. He pays professionals to mow his lawn twice a month. Rives said that in spite of having just two toes remaining on his right foot ""I am not having a pity party for myself. I have to keep going on.""","100,000 people in U.S. suffered  lawn mower accident injury in 2006 .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent, has withdrawn his name from consideration as surgeon general of the United States, he said Thursday. Dr. Sanjay Gupta will continue his work as a surgeon and for CNN. ""This is more about my family and my surgical career,"" Gupta told CNN's ""Larry King Live."" The neurosurgeon said he would likely have had to give up practicing had he taken the job as the nation's top doctor. In addition, the 39-year-old and his wife are expecting their third daughter any time, and the government job would have meant long periods away from his family, he said. ""I think, for me, it really came down to a sense of timing more than anything else,"" he said. ""I just didn't feel I should do that now.""  Watch Gupta explain his reasoning Â» . Gupta said he had not been formally nominated for the job, though he had spoken with senior members of the Obama administration, who made it clear he was their choice, he said. ""I think there was a real melding there,"" he said, adding that he felt flattered to have been considered. Earlier Thursday, an administration official said Gupta ""was under serious consideration for the job of surgeon general. He has removed himself from consideration to focus more on his medical career and his family. We know he will continue to serve and educate the public through his work with media and in the medical arena."" Sources said in January that Gupta had met then-President-elect Obama in Chicago, Illinois, in November to discuss the post. At the time, Gupta declined to comment. The transition team was impressed with the combination of Gupta's government experience, as a White House fellow in 1997 and a special adviser to then-first lady Hillary Clinton, along with his medical career as a neurosurgeon and his communication skills, the transition sources said. Gupta is a member of the staff and faculty of the Department of Neurosurgery at Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta, Georgia. He regularly performs surgery at Emory University Hospital and at Grady Memorial Hospital, where he serves as associate chief of neurosurgery. Gupta joined CNN in 2001. As chief medical correspondent for the health and medical unit, he is a lead reporter on breaking medical news, provides regular health and medical updates for ""American Morning,"" anchors the half-hour weekend medical affairs program ""House Call with Dr. Sanjay Gupta"" and reports for CNN documentaries. Based in Atlanta, Gupta also contributes health stories to CNN.com, co-hosts ""Accent Health"" for Turner Private Networks, provides medical segments for the syndicated version of ""ER"" on TNT and writes a column for Time magazine. He also anchors the global health program ""Vital Signs"" for CNN International and is featured in a weekly podcast on health issues called ""Paging Dr. Gupta."" Just after joining CNN, Gupta became part of the team covering the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on New York and Washington. Later that year, he led breaking news reporting on a series of anthrax attacks. In 2003, Gupta reported from Iraq and Kuwait as an embedded correspondent with the U.S. Navy's medical unit -- and worked alongside them, performing brain surgery five times. In addition, Gupta reported from Sri Lanka in the aftermath of the tsunami that swept the region in December 2004. He also helped cover the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina from New Orleans, Louisiana, in 2005. He received his undergraduate degree from the University of Michigan and his medical degree from the University of Michigan Medical Center.","""This is more about my family and my surgical career,"" Gupta says .

"Valley Springs, California (CNN) -- Sheriff's deputies on foot and in patrol cars made their presence known at a northern California school on Monday. Amid the stepped up security, classmates at Jenny Lind Elementary School carried flowers for Leila Fowler. Their parents held onto fear. ""I'm scared for my kids, for the family,"" mother Wendy Converse said. ""It's horrible."" Fowler, an 8-year-old third-grader at the school, was stabbed to death at her home over the weekend. As police search for suspects, word of the killing has left many shaken in the community, which is about an hour outside of Sacramento. ""Leila was bubbly, she was vivacious, a great student. ... I don't think I ever saw Leila without a smile on her face,"" Amy Hasselwander, the school's principal, told CNN affiliate KCRA. ""Just a bright girl, just kind, compassionate, sincere to everyone."" Converse said her son, Elijah, was friends with Leila. ""They sit together at school. It's very sad,"" she said. ""Things like that don't happen here."" The girl died of shock and hemorrhages caused by multiple stab wounds, the Calaveras County Coroner's Office said on Monday. Her mother said the family was still coming to grips with their loss. ""We are devastated,"" Crystal Walters, Leila's mother, told CNN via Facebook correspondence early Monday. ""She didn't deserve this. ... She was so full of life."" No suspect named . Police say Leila and her brother were home alone on Saturday when he saw an intruder leaving the house. He then found his sister stabbed and severely wounded. She died minutes after arriving at the hospital, authorities said. Since then, police have been running down leads but say they have no specific suspect. ""We're searching extensively into attics and storage sheds. It is a difficult area to search -- it is rural, remote and the grass is tall right now,"" Calaveras County Sheriff's Capt. Jim Macedo said. Authorities have combed the home and the neighborhood for evidence. ""We did collect fingerprints during that search,"" Macedo said, ""and we did collect what we believe to be DNA. Those prints and DNA will hopefully be processed within the next week."" A neighborhood on edge . Word of the killing rattled many residents in the neighborhood. Michael Range, who lives near the Fowlers, said he heard about Leila's deadly stabbing from a boy who lives nearby. ""I took my kids instantly and locked the doors,"" he said. ""It was scary. We've been inside all weekend."" Ryan Wydner, who lives across the street from the Fowlers, said the girl's death left him feeling anxious. ""Anything's really possible at this point,"" he said. ""What's the difference between that guy going left and right and coming into my house? I don't know."" While authorities said they had ""no specific suspect,"" they are looking for a white or Hispanic male with a muscular build, about 6 feet tall, wearing a black long-sleeved shirt and blue pants. He is considered to be armed and dangerous, the Sheriff's Office said. Macedo said the boy who found his sister ""is not a suspect at this time, but we are continuing to talk to him, which would be normal because he was the last person with the child."" Detectives continue to track down dozens of leads phoned into a tip line created Saturday, including some leading to other counties, he said.

"(CNN) -- On the day that marks the birth of Elvis Presley perhaps it is fitting that lightning should strike twice. Bradford City, currently in the fourth tier of English football, stunned Premier League Aston Villa with a 3-1 win in the first leg of their semifinal in the League Cup just weeks after toppling the mighty Arsenal. The club are now just 90 minutes away from their first major final since they lifted the FA Cup back in 1911, if they can successfully negotiate the second leg at Villa Park on January 22. Goals from Nehki Wells and Rory McArdle stunned the visitors before Andreas Weimann pulled a goal back for Villa but a late header from Carl McHugh restored City's two-goal cushion. Bradford are now on the verge of matching the achievement Rochdale, who were the last fourth division side to reach the League Cup final in 1962. The League Cup, first contested in 1960, is regarded as the third competition in English football behind the Premier League and the FA Cup. Villa are owned by Randy Lerner, the American businessman who recently sold the Cleveland Browns NFL franchise. Even if Bradford don't make it to Wembley they will have two cup shocks to remember fondly after they disposed of a full-strength Arsenal team on penalties in the last eight. Their manager Phil Parkinson told Sky Sports: ""To beat Aston Villa 3-1 is outstanding achievement, we played so well. ""Villa came with an attacking line up but left space and I thought we passed the ball well. The lads were magnificent in all departments. ""We've got be respectful and do it all again so we don't get carried away but what a victory for us. We've got to go there and enjoy it in front of 40,000 fans, and 6,000 of ours, because the pressure will be on Villa. ""We want to go and put in a strong performance. If we do that we'll have a great chance of going to Wembley. This is a dream to be in the semifinals with the likes of Chelsea, Villa, Swansea and we've got take it. They'll have to really earn it if they get to the final."" A despondent Paul Lambert said his young Villa side weren't good enough to match their supposedly inferior opponents on the night. ""We knew what was coming, the set pieces, and we never defended them well at all,"" he said. ""It wasn't good enough. We had a lot of the game but you've got to be able to defend set pieces. Its happened year after year that so-called lesser teams beat bigger teams but we've got a chance to redeem this. ""I'm pretty sure we'll start as favorites but it's a big game for us now.""

"(CNN) -- You wouldn't think that gay rights would be on a collision course with immigration reform. After all, what does one of these things have to do with another? Not all that much. Yet, the fact is, these two worthwhile causes are about to collide, running right into one another at high speed. All for the sake of politics. Here's why: The Gang of Eight's bipartisan immigration reform compromise bill -- ""The Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Modernization Act of 2013""-- combines border security and temporary guest workers with a pathway to green cards and U.S. citizenship for the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants in the United States. You've probably heard about how there are many on the right who want to kill the bill to please anti-Latino nativists. The weapon of choice seems to be the amendment process; more than 300 changes were proposed. For example, one person gunning for the legislation is Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, who has proposed an amendment that dismantles the pathway to U.S. citizenship. Cruz would welcome more legal immigrants by expanding the high-skilled temporary worker program. But the senator opposes giving illegal immigrants U.S. citizenship. The Cruz amendment says that ""no person who has previously been willfully present in the United States while not in lawful status shall be eligible for United States citizenship."" That amounts to a lifetime ban. What a terrible idea. The pathway should be long and difficult, but there has to be a pathway. It can't just be scrapped. These people broke the law, but it's a civil infraction, not capital murder. But you might not have heard the other half of the story -- that there also are those on the left who would like to see the bill defeated, even if they have to be more clever and discreet about their efforts to kill it. The group that they want to please is organized labor, where despite the public pronouncements of labor union leaders that they support immigration reform, the rank-and-file may not be so easily convinced. Many of today's union members -- especially in rust belt states like Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, etc -- still see foreign workers the same way that previous generations of union members saw them: as competition and a barrier to higher wages. Senate panel tackles border security in immigration bill . In 1986, the last time that Congress passed meaningful immigration reform, the AFL-CIO fought the effort tooth and nail. Not much has changed since then. Oh, the leaders are singing a different tune. But, at the grassroots level, there is still resistance. Over the years, I've done radio interviews and given speeches where I've been confronted by self-described union members -- electricians, plumbers, carpenters, construction workers -- who complain about illegal immigrants taking jobs and allowing employers to pay lower wages. In 2007, John Sweeney, who was then president of AFL-CIO, helped kill a bipartisan immigration reform bill by coming out against guest workers and firing off a letter to Senate Democrats telling them not to support any bill that included that provision. Sen. Byron Dorgan of North Dakota successfully proposed an amendment to weaken the guest workers provision. Republicans yanked their support, and the bill died. Six years later, business and labor have agreed to a plan for a guest worker program. But union members are still threatened by immigrant labor. Are union opponents of immigration reform still pulling the strings of some Democrats? Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy has filed an amendment to the Gang of Eight bill that would allow gay Americans with foreign-born partners to sponsor them for green cards just like heterosexual couples can. Leahy can follow through by introducing the amendment, either in committee or on the Senate floor. To be impacted, gay couples don't even have to be married; the proposed amendment -- known as the Uniting American Families Act -- is designed to help ""permanent partners"" of U.S. citizens or legal residents apply for a green card and defines ""permanent partner"" merely as someone older than 18 and involved in a financially interdependent, committed relationship. Still, according to a group called Immigration Equality, only about 35,000-40,000 gay couples would be affected. Senate watchers say if the gay partners measure is introduced in the Judiciary Committee, it is likely to pass along Democratic Party lines and become part of the Senate bill. That could be the end. According to National Public Radio, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops opposes the Leahy amendment, and it could withdraw its support for the entire bill. The same goes for evangelical Christian groups, and most Republican lawmakers. The votes will vanish. And so, for the sake of the estimated 40,000 same-sex couples that would be affected by such an obscure change, an estimated 11 million people will be out of luck. Adios, immigration reform. For his part, Leahy has said that he doesn't think his amendment will kill the bill. Then he must be the only person in Washington who thinks that. Politico called the Leahy amendment ""the most serious threat to bipartisan immigration reform."" Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, de facto leader of the Gang of Eight, was more blunt. He told Politico that reform is ""difficult enough as it is"" and that the gay partners amendment ""will virtually guarantee that (the bill) won't pass"" and that ""the coalition that helped put it together will fall apart."" That's the whole idea. Don't be fooled. The latest shenanigan by Democrats isn't about gay rights. It's about game playing. And when the games are done, what was the best hope for immigration reform in a quarter century may go down the tubes, and all that will be left to do is mop it up. Democrats will have to find new ways to convince furious Latino voters that it was Republicans who killed the bill, and Republicans will be forced to run for cover. The legislation isn't perfect. But it would improve the lives of millions of illegal immigrants who, at least, would be given some sort of protective status so they wouldn't have to worry about being unceremoniously scooped up and shipped out of the country by the Obama deportation machine while they pick up milk for their kids' cereal. Not everyone who might support the gay partner amendment is simply doing the bidding of labor unions. I'm sure that many gay rights advocates are pushing for the change with the best of intentions and for legitimate reasons. They think this battle is worth fighting, even if maybe this isn't the best time and place to fight it. Still, this is beyond sneaky. It's sinister. Democrats thought of everything, even having the task of amending the bill fall to a senator from Vermont, a state where, according to the Census Bureau, Latinos account for just 1.6% of the population -- just in case there is a backlash from Latino voters. By the way, President Obama has said that he supports Leahy's amendment. The president also claims to support immigration reform. It's something that we hear Obama and other Democrats say all the time, and which -- with stunts like this -- becomes less and less believable every time we hear it. This time they have gone too far. If this amendment is proposed, and support for the bill fades, and immigration reform dies on the vine, Latinos need to stop paying deference to the Democratic Party and instead make it pay a price.

"(CNN) -- Every athlete competing at the London 2012 Paralympic Games has an incredible story to tell, of how they overcame tragedy or a disability they had been born with to be considered the best in the world in their chosen discipline. But for some the final, bureaucratic hurdle can prove a step too far. On Thursday it was revealed that the American swimming team's great hope of a gold medal in the pool -- 17-year-old Victoria Arlen -- had been denied a classification to compete. Arlen had dreamed of making the London 2012 able-bodied swimming team until a neurological disease put her in a coma for two years. When she woke up she was paralyzed in both legs. Yet Arlen continued to swim and this year broke two world records. But after the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) reviewed her case, Arlen was told she could not compete. It had been decided that Arlen's disability wasn't severe enough. It appeared that she had lost out because of the complex system of disability classification, an essential tool for the Paralympic movement. Follow CNN's live Paralympics blog . And she's not the only one to suffer. Fellow U.S. swimmer Mallory Weggemann, who lost the use of her legs after a routine epidural injection went wrong, declared she had ""lost faith"" in the system when her classification was changed just before the start of London 2012. ""I have trained the past four and a half years for these Games and within less then 24 hours before my first race was supposed to start it all changed, everything I had prepared myself for these past four years changed right there and then,"" said the 23-year-old, who had been hoping to compete for nine golds but can now only go for seven. Complex . Such is the myriad of different disabilities, and severity of disabilities, each athlete has to be evaluated and placed into a category to compete alongside others of the same potential. Athletes are placed in one of six main disability groups: those with spinal injuries, cerebral palsy, amputees, the blind or visually impaired, intellectual disabilities and those whose disabilities fall outside of those categories, like those born with dwarfism or multiple sclerosis. Each of the Paralympics' 20 sports are divided between the different classifications and given a number that denotes the severity of the disability -- 1 being the most severe, 10 the least. Join the conversation on Twitter #cnnparalympics . ""Classification exists in the Olympics as well,"" explains Dr. David Howe, a former Canadian Paralympic middle-distance runner and academic at Loughborough University. ""Men and women don't compete together, and in boxing and judo it's based on weight, but in the Paralympics it gets broken down much more finely. ""So take people with visual impairments. You have the B3 class where someone has 10% vision, B2 class with 5% vision and B1 no usable vision at all. ""It has a huge impact on how you can train. If you have no usable vision you need someone to train with you. If you have 10% they can, and they do, move around on their own. They can train. That gives them a huge advantage."" Talent, not disability . In recent years the IPC has complicated things further by trying to slim down the number of medals and disciplines and look beyond the disability as the defining factor in classification. Instead, it says, look to the potential of the athlete. ""During classification ... athletes are assessed for their ability to perform in a particular event,"" the IPC explains. ""'Ability' in this case refers to an athlete's functional potential and is not an assessment of their disability: this is a complete reversal of the old systems that were clinical and medical in origin and often intrusive."" This is why Oscar Pistorius, the South African double amputee ""Blade Runner"" who made history by becoming the first track and field Paralympian to compete in the able-bodied Olympics -- can line up against runners with only one prosthetic leg. In the pool on Thursday, China's Zheng Tao won gold in the 100 meters backstroke, destroying the field despite not having any arms. According to Howe, back when he was competing, the procedure to determine classification was very different and also highly intrusive. ""When you compete for the first time they make sure you are not fiddling the system,"" he says. ""You have a medical doctor -- I have mild cerebral palsy -- physio and a technical expert. Now they have the ability to examine classification after competition. They used to run them before major competitions and force athletes through them. I refused until after the contest because it can be quite exhausting."" The move towards streamlining the classifications and having less medals to give out also has it drawbacks. ""Swimming is a bit of fiddle,"" says Howe when asked about the Arlen case. ""I was there to see the British lad Jonathan Fox win gold, the roar was amazing. ""But the thing is when they came out (of the pool) he looked the most able. He was the only one not using a stick or wheelchair. ""There's a water-based test and a land-based test, and an element that you are on a performance curve -- and that discourages training. You want to be on the right side of the thin line from the next category. Otherwise you'll struggle."" The politics of classification . But, of course, competitive sport is competitive sport -- and rival teams regularly refer athletes for reclassification if they feel they have an unfair advantage. The Paralympic movement has also been stung by several high-profile scandals. The Spanish Paralympic basketball team was stripped of their gold medals at the 2000 Sydney Games after it emerged that some of the players weren't properly tested and were not intellectually disabled. The controversy saw the entire category of intellectually disabled sport withdrawn from the next two Olympics. It is only now, in London, making a comeback. ""There's a huge amount of politics in classification,"" agrees Howe. ""I was never asked as an athlete, 'Do you think the contest was fair?' For the athletes (like Arlen) it can be hell. When this does happen the athletes come together 'Band of Brothers' style."" Arlen returns . In the end that is exactly what happened to Victoria Arlen. After an outcry the IPC reviewed the evidence again and cleared her to compete in this weekend's 400 meters heats, one of the most anticipated events at the Games. But it is unlikely to be the last time the issue of classification hits the headlines. ""I've been involved since 1986 and it's always been an issue,"" says Howe. ""It's getting much better. But I worry that by bringing in less categories they (the IPC) are trying to be more media friendly. If it is fair, fine, but I am against that if that stops different impaired bodies being involved. ""We must not forget that, first and foremost, the Paralympics is about celebrating difference. It's not about ability versus disability.""","The issue of disability classification at the Paralympics has caused controversy .

"(CNN) -- ""It's been a magical adventure, and this is a fantastic conclusion."" Not many people get second chances in life, but Alex Zanardi is making the most of his. In 2001 the ex-Formula One driver was at death's door, lucky to survive a horrific accident that left him with only 30% of his blood supply. He lost both his legs -- amputated at the knee -- after being pulled from the wreckage of his car at a race in Germany. Fast forward more than a decade, to another race track, and the Italian is on top of the world. While he was never able to reach the heights of success in F1 -- Zanardi never made the podium in 44 races -- he is a champion Paralympian. ""I'm somebody very lucky who had a great life,"" the the 45-year-old Zanardi said after winning gold in his adopted sport of hand cycling at Britain's Brands Hatch circuit on Wednesday. ""I haven't wasted many opportunities that fate gave me. I've certainly had many more opportunities than I deserved, but luckily enough I ended up making the right choices."" From disaster to triumph: A week in the life of Mallory Weggemann . In the buildup to the London Games, Zanardi joked, with a dose of black humor, that his accident ""was how I won my ticket to the 2012 Paralympics."" Having failed to make a career in F1 after four difficult seasons, he turned to the U.S. CART series where he twice won the drivers' title for Chip Ganassi's team. That earned him a return to the elite division of motorsport in 1999 with the Williams team, but again he struggled. Drifting back to open-wheel cars, fate came calling at the EuroSpeedway Lausitz on September 15, 2001. He had worked his way up from the rear of the field to lead the race with 13 laps to go before that life-changing crash. Given the severity of his injuries, the doctors at the scene of the accident said Zanardi should never have survived. Remarkably just two months later, he was walking again using prosthetic legs of his own design. Another two years on, he finished the race that nearly took his life, completing the remaining 13 laps at Lausitz in a specially modified touring car. By 2004 he was racing touring cars fulltime with the help of hand-operated brake and accelerator paddles. Zanardi even drove a modified BMW Formula One car in 2006. Rwandan amputees bring message of hope: 'We are superstars' But while most motorsport stars find it difficult to give up their high-octane thrills, Zanardi did just that. ""Three years ago I decided to stop motor racing, not because I had to but because I wanted to,"" he said. ""It looked stupid, because at the age of 42 to dump everything to try to pursue an objective to qualify for the Games seemed to be against all odds for a man of my age. ""It felt very crazy but it's not the first crazy thing that I do in my life, so I guess it will not be the last."" Zanardi replaced one adrenaline buzz with another. He discovered hand cycling -- a sport where the bikes are powered by the riders' arms -- at the 2007 New York marathon. Invited to speak as a guest, Zanardi decided if he was going to fly all the way from Italy to the U.S. he might as well compete. Compete he did, finishing fourth after only a few weeks' training. He had found his new passion, competing in the 2009 world championships and then setting about qualifying for the 2012 Paralympics. ""This was the horizon,"" he said, smiling as a burst of brilliant, afternoon sunshine lit up his face following his victory in the H4 classification road time trial. ""I'm very, very happy. It's never been a sacrifice. I've enjoyed every day of training as much as this moment now."" Paralympic sailing: A tale of triumph and technology . Immediately after his win, the F1 family -- including former world champions Mario Andretti and Jenson Button -- took to social media sites to congratulate Zanardi. Although he was only briefly in their ranks, he is still remembered as one of the sport's ""nice guys"" and most charismatic competitors. The golden ending to his journey came at Brands Hatch, a circuit 20 miles from London where Zanardi had previously raced in a touring car. ""With an engine pushing me I didn't realize it was that hilly,"" he said. ""It's very, very hard but if I had to design the course for the Games this is what I would have done. It's absolutely beautiful, it's very hard -- I guess it really suits my characteristics as an old man."" So how does the thrill of winning a cycling race compare to the highs of motor racing? ""When you are in your twenties you just think the races are what matter the most,"" Zanardi said. ""When you are in your forties you really appreciate what you do every day. Of course today is very important but I really appreciate what I did in the past. ""Day by day, it's been magical, a magical adventure and this is a fantastic conclusion."" It seems unlikely that a man who could not be bowed by losing both of his legs will retire from sport anytime soon. He has already mooted a possible return at the 2016 Rio Games, but Zanardi also joked that his next plan was to add another wheel and engine to his cycle and come back to Brands Hatch. The circuit also hosts Superbike racing and, judging by the glint in his eye, perhaps Zanardi is already weighing up a new challenge of trying out a faster form of wheeled sport.","Ex-Formula One driver Alex Zanardi claims gold medal in hand cycling at the London 2012 Paralympics .

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- Federal agents arrested 45 people in Georgia believed to be members of a top Mexican drug cartel and confiscated nearly $2.4 million in cash, authorities said Thursday. The arrests were made by members of the federal Drug Enforcement Administration, the Clayton County District Attorney's Office and other law enforcement agencies, the DEA said. The investigation, called Operation Choke Hold, started in May 2009. The suspects are believed to be connected with La Familia Michoacana, which ""was responsible for the importation of bulk quantities of cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, and marijuana into the metro Atlanta area,"" the DEA said. In addition to distributing narcotics in metro Atlanta, the drug-trafficking organization also shipped large quantities to Florida, Alabama, Indiana, Illinois and North Carolina, the DEA said. During the arrests, the DEA said in a release, authorities seized 46 pounds of methamphetamine, a clandestine methamphetamine laboratory, nearly 95 pounds (43 kilograms) of cocaine, 4,120 pounds of marijuana, 20 firearms and $2.349 million.

"LAS VEGAS, Nevada (CNN)  -- Lawyers for O.J. Simpson have filed a motion for a new trial, saying he was denied a fair hearing when two African-Americans were dismissed from the potential jury pool. O.J. Simpson, convicted of robbery and kidnapping last week, could be sentenced to life in prison on December 5. An all white jury found Simpson guilty on October 3 on 12 counts related to a September 13, 2007, robbery involving sports memorabilia at a Las Vegas hotel. The 61-year-old former football star could get life in prison. Sentencing is scheduled for December 5 in Las Vegas. Jury members said at the time of his conviction on robbery and other charges that they relied mostly on audio and video evidence and very little on testimony from witnesses. ""We honestly felt we could not rely on that witness testimony,"" said Michelle R. Lyons, one of seven jurors who spoke to reporters in Las Vegas after the verdict. ""There was not one decision we made that was based only on witness testimony."" Jury foreman Paul Connelly said some of the prosecution's witnesses didn't seem trustworthy. At least three former Simpson co-defendants who cut deals to testify in the case had criminal records. Asked whether the jury trusted the witnesses, Connelly answered: ""Not entirely, no.""  Watch jurors explain their verdict Â» . Prosecutors produced an audiotape of a confrontation in which authorities said Simpson and five men burst into a Las Vegas hotel room. The men allegedly made off with pillowcases containing Simpson sports memorabilia. Several jurors said audiotapes of the incident and conversations between Simpson and others that were recorded surreptitiously before, during and after the heist proved the prosecution's case. ""It would have been a weak case"" without the tapes, juror Dora Pettit said. The jury of nine women and three men found Simpson and co-defendant Clarence ""C.J."" Stewart guilty of 12 charges, including conspiracy to commit a crime, robbery, assault and kidnapping with a deadly weapon. Simpson's lawyer had indicated he planned to appeal the conviction, partly because some of the jurors had indicated during jury selection that they disagreed with a 1995 verdict in which Simpson was acquitted of killing his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ronald Goldman.  Watch Fred Goldman hail the verdict Â» . Teresa Owens, one of the jurors in the Simpson robbery case, said any suggestion that the jury found Simpson guilty because of the verdict 13 years ago is ""terrible."" ""There's reports right now that we've had some kind of vendetta against Mr. Simpson for ... 13 years ago,"" she said. ""That in no way had anything to do with this case whatsoever."" Connelly said the murder trial ""never came up."" ""I don't think it was on anybody's minds. For that, I can say I'm proud of the jury,"" he said. Before the robbery and kidnapping trial, the jurors promised they could disregard Simpson's past and solely consider the evidence against him and Stewart, 54. Owens also said it would be ""preposterous"" for anyone to suggest that the makeup of the jury -- 11 jurors were white, and one said she was Hispanic, while Simpson is black -- hurt the defense's chances. ""They chose us. Five hundred people ... filled out these questionnaires,"" Owens said. ""They had the [opportunity] to pass us."" Pettit said the jury has been painted by some ""as an all-white jury that hates O.J."" ""That's just not true,"" she said. ""It couldn't be further from the truth."" Asked whether they felt the crime was bad enough to warrant life sentences, Connelly said that was for the court to decide. Pettit said that ""if he walked out tomorrow, I'd be fine with that."" However, she said Simpson had to be found guilty and that his argument about just wanting to recover his own things didn't work. ""Under Nevada law ... even if you're recovering your own stuff, you can't do it in the manner that they all went in and did it,"" Pettit said.","Motion: Simpson didn't get a fair trial because black jurors were dismissed .

"(CNN) -- What's worse: racist monkey chants or being one minute late? The answer appears to be 60 seconds of tardiness, if the fines dished out by UEFA this week are anything to go by. European football's governing body caused outrage by fining Manchester City â¬30,000 ($40,000) for running onto the pitch ""less than 60 seconds late"" -- which was â¬10,000 ($13,000) more than Porto's punishment for fans' racist abuse during a match against the English club. Now, with just weeks until the European Championships in Poland and Ukraine -- countries with a reputation for neo-Nazi groups in the stands -- pressure is mounting on UEFA to prove it is serious about tackling racism. The world will be watching the best teams in Europe go head-to-head, but they'll also be closely monitoring the one million fans expected to fill stadiums across the countries. ""This fine does nothing to help UEFA's reputation in relation to how it tackles discrimination in football,"" says Herman Ouseley, head of anti-racism group Kick It Out. ""We've seen significant punishments meted out in the past but, as an organization, the line it takes on such matters has lacked consistency. ""With the European Championships looming, and the potential flashpoints which may occur during the tournament with right-wing groups in eastern Europe, this seems to conflict with the strong anti-racism message UEFA should be promoting."" UEFA has been accused of double-standards after fining Manchester City 50% more than Porto for returning to the field late after the halftime break in a Europa League match against Sporting Lisbon last month. The Portuguese club, in comparison, was charged â¬20,000 after its fans made monkey chants towards black City players Mario Balotelli and Yaya Toure during the previous round at Estadio do Dragao. The decision raises serious questions over UEFA's commitment to tackling racism in a part of the world still struggling against extremism. The ugly cloud of racism hanging over football in Poland and Ukraine was highlighted earlier this year in an investigation by campaign group Never Again. Its report, called ""Hateful,"" detailed 195 individual incidents of racist and discriminatory behavior in an 18-month period from September 2009 to March 2011, a figure that underlines the amount of work that still needs to be done. ""Unfortunately it seems racism is deeply rooted in the culture of soccer, especially in Eastern Europe,"" Rafal Pankowski, head of the Poland-based organization, told CNN last year. ""Of course it's a broader problem, affecting countries such as Spain and Italy, but it is a real issue in Eastern Europe. ""There is goodwill at the top of UEFA to deal with the issue, but their genuine commitment does not translate to national football federation level and this is where more awareness raising needs to be done,"" Pankowski said. Keeping an eye on the crowd in Poland and Ukraine will be members from Football Against Racism in Europe (FARE), who'll be reporting discriminatory behavior back to UEFA. FARE has called for greater charges for racist fans. But executive director Piara Powar was also quick to point out the strict rationale behind UEFA's fines this week -- and the need to better communicate this to the public. ""UEFA has a very clear system of sanctions. I think the reason for the disparity in fines is this is the fourth time in two seasons that Man City have been late to play,"" he said. ""Whereas Porto haven't been in front of UEFA in three or four years. It's an important point that hasn't come across in the media."" CNN contacted UEFA to ask for clarification of the fines, but did not receive an official response. The ruling body, however, does have a strong stance against racism, and has worked closely with FARE since 2001. Powar said extremist fans -- known as ""ultras"" -- are still a major issue in eastern Europe and his team will be looking for neo-Nazi paraphernalia throughout the tournament, which runs from June 8 to July 1. However, Powar admitted that Poland's inclusion in the European Union in 2004 had significantly helped it reduce extremism. ""This is new territory for a major competition to go to a place like Poland or Ukraine. It's fantastic it's going to a new place, but it also means there are bigger challenges we face,"" he said. ""Our ongoing challenge is to get the message out to countries where African players, who aren't common, are being abused.""","UEFA under fire for fining Man City more for being late, than Porto for fans' racist chants .

"(CNN) -- There are few places in the world which can claim to be more romantic than Paris. A glance across the River Seine, a walk though the Jardin des Tuileries hand in hand with a loved one, 37 bridges to pause and take a breath at the beauty of an enchanting city. Artists sitting at every corner beckoning you for a portrait, the music which fills the air, the sheer smell of history which touches every sinew. There are the book markets which entice you with that precious thought of sipping a coffee at a trendy cafe, while you sit engrossed in a work of literary art. Tourists flock from around the world to see the Eiffel Tower, to take in the Haussman renovation and to bend down on one knee and ask that question. There's the Pont Alexandre III bridge, linking Les Invalides where Napoleon is buried, right through to Le Grand Palais and the shopping heaven of the Champs-Elysees. Don't forget the Pont Des Arts, allowing you to walk between Louvre and the 6th Arrondissement without the constant noise of traffic. Why not stay a while? Enjoy a fine bottle of wine, a picnic perhaps? Or maybe you'd rather save yourself for a jaunt across the Pont Neuf and steal a kiss? This is Paris, the romantic capital of France and perhaps the world. But on Sunday January 6 2013, Paris surrendered its crown, or at least for a few hours temporarily. Away from the boutiques, the patisseries, the artists of Montmartre, Paris had been eclipsed by a group of men, who have taken the whole notion of romance to a new level. Step forward the brave and hardy souls of Epinal. In a small and sleepy town in the north-east of the country, around 311 kilometers from the capital, something has stirred. There are no candle lit dinners or boutique bistros, instead it is a place known for three things -- the cold, the Epinal print and now, at last, its football team. It was here that the romance of the French domestic Cup was realized, not through poetry, painting or drama. This grew out of passion. Epinal, a third-tier side, which sits 19th out of 20 teams in its division, had dreamed of this day for many a year although that dream was tempered with more than a hint of apprehension. The arrival of cup holder Lyon and its millionaire football players would have left even the most rose tinted of Epinal supporters reaching for a nice bottle of rouge. Lyon, the seven-time league champion, a team playing at the pinnacle of European football in the Champions League, arrived at Stade de la ColombiÃÂ¨re second in the top division. After holding a training camp in the luxurious surrounding of Monaco and all the glitz and glamor that goes with it, this game was supposed to ease the team back into the routine following the winter break. While Lyon's players have been busy wiping the sweat from their brow and basking in the exotic temperatures of the Principality, Epinal's players were trying to fit the rigors of training into everyday life. Epinal is an amateur team, its players work in all sections of society and train when their jobs allow. It is not the life their opponent endures. For once, work took a back seat as the romance of the cup swept across the town and those who live there. As the two teams took to the field, the millionaire international footballers of Lyon and the dreamers of Epinal, what chance would the home side have afforded themselves? French football has seen fairy tales in the past. Only last season, Quevilly of the third tier reached the final where it was beaten narrowly by Lyon. In 2009, Guingamp of the second division, defeated Stade Rennais, while other teams outside the top flight such as Chateauroux, Amiens, Calais and Sedan have all reached the final in recent time. ""There is always a story every year,"" French football expert Philipe Auclair told CNN. ""We had Quevilly last year which was a wonderful story and then in previous years we've had Calais and others. ""There are a lot more upsets in the French Cup, but this one is absolutely huge."" Huge indeed. It took the amateurs of Epinal just 13 minutes to move into a two-goal lead thanks to Tristan Boubaya. His double strike allowed not just a town, but an entire country to dream. This was the day when Epinal allowed France to fall in love with another minnow. Like any romance, there are rocky moments. Two of those came within the next seven minutes as Lyon drew level. The dream looked like it had died when Lisandro Lopez converted a penalty to leave Epinal's hopes in tatters with just 28 minutes remaining. Not since the 18th century had so many printing presses been ready to illustrate the efforts of Epinal. Famed for its printing cards of saints, wars and fairy tales, the town was about to receive a new legend to add to the list. Step forward Valentin Focki. It was he who scored a precious equalizer with 13 minutes remaining to take the tie into extra-time and eventually came penalties. And so it came down to the dreaded spot kicks. Many a man has crumbled under the pressure of trying to beat a goalkeeper from 12-yards. Far greater players than those of Epinel have lost their nerve and fallen into the abyss. But in Olivier Robin, Epinal had its hero. The goalkeeper ensured his face will be forever remembered on a picture card, saving a penalty to help bring down the might of Lyon. Who said romance was dead? ""It's a really big shock,"" Damien Comolli, former Director of Football at AS Monaco, Arsenal, Liverpool and Tottenham told CNN. ""Lyon has been playing very well this season and it's the first really big negative result they've had all season. ""The league title is almost guaranteed to Paris Saint-Germain and there are only a couple of other trophies for other teams to win. ""Lyon wanted to win this cup and for them to lose is a huge blow, it's a massive shock. ""Epinal are part-time and have jobs which allow them to train, they're a small team. Now, the focus on the club will be huge."" While Epinal's players bask in the limelight of its victory, it's unlikely that the town will rival Paris for romance in the long term. The romance of the Coupe de France has been rekindled in a quiet town in the east of the country. For now, let Epinal have its day.","Epinal of the third tier of French football defeated cup holder Lyon .

"(CNN) -- The George Zimmerman trial has made one thing crystal clear. When racial issues arise, we tend to unquestionably cheer for our own race like it's a sporting match. There's little regard for the arguments or feelings of those from another race. Is the racial empathy gap in America growing? It seems so. At least judging by the chatter of comments surrounding the trial. I heard repeatedly the statement from some Zimmerman supporters -- including a radio show host on Monday morning who is far from being a racist -- that ""94% of black murder victims were killed by other blacks."" So instead of being empathetic to the Martin family -- whose son Trayvon was killed by Zimmerman -- the words discounted the killing by essentially saying that black people kill each other so much so why should we care about this one black kid? It doesn't end there. There were speculations that there will be riots by the black community should Zimmerman be found not guilty. As CNN's Don Lemon rightly pointed out Friday, these warnings basically label blacks as ""barbarians"" who ""can't contain themselves."" On the other side, some people of color despicably threatened to harm or even kill Zimmerman after he was acquitted. No matter what race you belong to, you have to admit this lack of concern for other races need to be addressed. Sure, there were people protesting the Zimmerman verdict other than blacks, but overall they were few and in between. (Keep in mind that 75% of America's population is white.) And when I say we lack racial empathy, I'm not talking about feeling sorry for a race because of their ""plight."" I mean true empathy -- ""the ability to understand and share the feelings of another."" Racial empathy means being able to honestly contemplate what it would be like to be a member of a different race. Psychologists have noted that this type of empathy fosters conflict resolution. Opening yourself to understanding why the other side believes what it does can help you find common ground. Of course, this is not easy. It requires you to, at least temporarily, stop self-righteously dismissing competing arguments. You don't have to agree with the opposing views, but you should listen and try to understand them. But when was the last time you heard leaders of community groups -- regardless of race -- say: ""Let's look at from the other side?"" I haven't. A recent important study on racial empathy offers insights on the tangible consequences of our failure to identify with other races. Researchers found that participants believed that black people felt less physical pain when subjected to the same injury as white people because blacks ""have faced more hardship."" In other words, the study shows that people are quicker to dismiss the suffering of blacks than of whites because black people have historically suffered more challenges like ""higher rates of diseases, disability and premature death."" The alarming conclusion is that this leads ""to racial bias and potentially disastrous outcomes (e.g., condoning policy brutality against blacks, underestimating and undertreating black patients' pain)."" There's no simple fortune cookie piece of advice out there on how we can become more open and honest. But we can start simple. How can we increase our racial sympathy? Let's look at issues from the vantage point of another race: Why are they angry? Why are they afraid? What would you feel like if you lived in a community where the crime you see is committed almost exclusively by one race? Conversely, how would you feel if you were repeatedly profiled by the police and society simply because of your skin color? If we don't get past the knee jerking defensiveness when discussing race, we will likely be burying more Trayvon Martins. Let's try to stop the tragedies before they happen. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dean Obeidallah.","Dean Obeidallah: Zimmerman trial shows that people see issues along racial lines .

"(CNN) -- When the two most successful teams in English football meet, the stakes are high. Not only is there the bragging rights fought for between the bitterly opposed tribes of Manchester United and Liverpool, but the result can bear more resonance than just the effect it has on the Premier League title race. ""Winning against Liverpool is important. It doesn't matter where you are in the league,"" United manager Alex Ferguson said after his team's 2-1 victory at Old Trafford on Sunday. ""Manchester United-Liverpool games are fantastic challenges. They are the two most successful teams in the country. Today, hopefully, those three points will be very important."" Sunday's win gave United a 74-62 advantage in the 187 clashes between the two teams, and a season double after winning by the same score at Anfield in September. Just as importantly, it meant that United ended the weekend seven points clear of second-placed defending champions Manchester City, who beat 10-man Arsenal 2-0 in Sunday's other match. It leaves the club in pole position for a record-extending 20th English title -- two more than Liverpool, whose last came in 1990, before the start of the Premier League era. ""I would have taken that score before the game,"" Ferguson told reporters. ""The first-half performance, and until we scored the second goal, was absolutely brilliant. ""It was as good a performance as we have had for a long time and we should have been three or four up, but when they got their goal they got inspired by it. Their supporters got going and it was hard work after that. I am just glad we won."" United took the lead in the 19th minute through Robin van Persie, who netted his 21st goal this season and a leading 17th in the EPL from Patrice Evra's low cross. The second goal came after Evra evaded his marker Glen Johnson and headed Van Persie's 54th-minute free-kick into the net via a deflection off fellow defender Nemanja Vidic, who was credited with the score. Evra was a focal figure last time the teams met at Old Trafford in February 2012, when Liverpool striker Luis Suarez refused to shake his hand before the match in their first encounter following the Uruguayan's eight-match ban for racially abusing the France left-back. The anticipated duel this time was not between these two, but Suarez and Van Persie -- the EPL's leading marksmen. Suarez has almost singlehandedly carried Liverpool's attack this season, scoring 15 league goals, but it was his new forward partner Daniel Sturridge who reduced the deficit on his Premier League debut for the club. The former Chelsea striker scored in the FA Cup win against Mansfield, and again impressed after coming on at halftime to replace Brazil midfielder Lucas Leiva. The 23-year-old England international was fastest to react after captain Steven Gerrard forced a parried save from United keeper David de Gea just three minutes after Vidic's goal. However, despite all the late pressure Liverpool could not force an equalizer and ended the match 24 points behind United in eighth place. ""We're 24 points behind United -- but we're not 24 points behind in quality,"" said defiant Liverpool manager Brendan Rogers. ""The points difference is due to the squad -- the depth in the squads is the difference for us. ""Once we close the gap in the squad over these coming windows, I've got great faith we'll be able to challenge. I've seen enough hope in these opening months to suggest we will do that -- and today was another example of it."" Last season Manchester City overhauled an eight-point deficit to win the club's first league title in 44 years on a dramatic final day of the season, and a similar effort will again be required this time. Roberto Mancini's team ensured Arsenal's focus will be a top-four finish, ending any remaining hopes of title contention with a victory that left the sixth-placed London side 21 points adrift of United. The match turned early when Arsenal defender Laurent Koscielny was sent off for manhandling City striker Edin Dzeko in the penalty area. The Bosnian's 11th-minute spotkick was saved by a combination of the legs of goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny and the woodwork, but it was only another 10 minutes before James Milner put City ahead after being set up by Carlos Tevez. The Argentina striker has never scored against Arsenal, but he was also involved in the second goal as Dzeko doubled the lead just after half an hour for his 10th in the league this season. The only blot on City's day came when captain Vincent Kompany was sent off for a sliding two-footed tackle on Jack Wilshere, though the Belgium defender appeared to win the ball. Mancini said he planned to appeal the decision, even though an unsuccessful petition to the Football Association could mean Kompany is banned for four games instead of three. ""This is not a red card, absolutely not,"" the Italian said after City's first win at Arsenal in nearly 38 years. ""He has one foot in and takes the ball. I think the referee made a mistake.""","Manchester United seven points clear in England after beating Liverpool 2-1 at home .

"(CNN) -- An aircraft crashed Saturday afternoon during a demonstration at a West Virginia air show, killing the pilot, the West Virginia Air National Guard said. No one on the ground was injured. It was not immediately clear what caused the accident at the 2011 Thunder Over the Blue Ridge Open House & Air Show in Martinsburg, West Virginia. The pilot was flying a T-28 aircraft. CNN iReporter Jennifer Clark took pictures of the 2:30 p.m. ET crash, showing flames and black plumes of smoke rising from the ground. ""We saw a flash of light ... and heard the explosion sound,"" she told CNN's Don Lemon. ""It was scary."" ""You just heard the whole crowd gasp simultaneously and everybody just kind of went silent and was just watching what was going on,"" she said. The West Virginia crash came one day after another deadly air crash. A pilot lost control of his vintage plane during an air race in Reno, Nevada, on Friday, plummeting toward thousands of spectators before narrowly missing a grandstand and slamming into box seats. Nine people, including the pilot, died in that accident, according to local police.","No one on the ground was injured .

"Saylorsburg, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- Bernie Kozen thought he heard fireworks. Then, he saw a wall exploding as bullets slammed into it. Terrified people at the rural Pennsylvania township board meeting Monday night ran for cover as a shooter opened fire and yelled, ""They stole my land! They stole my land!"" For a brief, crucial moment, the shooting stopped. Police say the gunman left the meeting to get another weapon. Kozen huddled in a corner. As the shooter returned and approached with a handgun, Kozen sprang into action. ""I jumped him from behind,"" Kozen told CNN in an exclusive interview Tuesday. Three killed in town hall shooting . Now, police are hailing the local parks director and another man as heroes. The gunman killed three people at the board meeting in Monroe County. But if Kozen and another man hadn't tackled the shooter, police say, there would have been even more casualties at the meeting in a small town about 70 miles north of Philadelphia. ""It's certainly courageous what they did, and they absolutely would have saved lives,"" state police Lt. Robert Bartal told reporters Tuesday. The two men tackled the shooter even as rounds were fired, authorities said. ""It happened so quickly, I wouldn't say I was scared,"" Kozen told CNN. ""The opportunity was there and the guy upstairs was looking out for me, and we did what we had to do."" A chaotic scene . As he and the other man subdued the shooter, a chaotic scene surrounded them. Some people took off their shirts to apply compresses to wounds, Kozen said. Others performed CPR or wrapped bandages for injured victims. The other man who helped tackle the gunman, who did not wish to be identified, told CNN he saw Kozen grab the shooter, then he jumped in to help the parks director. ""Bernie held the bottom half of his body, then I stood on the shooter's neck,"" the man told CNN, adding that he ""punched, kicked, pulled the handgun from the shooter's hand"" and helped pull the shooter to the ground. He and Kozen tied the shooter's arms up with a jacket, he said. On Tuesday, Kozen said he was still rattled by the shooting. The gunman killed one of his close friends -- a man whose kids played Little League baseball with his. ""I am saddened for the loss of life,"" he said. ""Senseless. It makes no sense at all."" The shooting, he said, was the kind of thing he'd only seen before on TV. ""You see all the shootings, the Aurora and Newtown, and you say it can't happen in small-town America like this, but it can,"" he said. ""It can happen anywhere."" Police: Suspect was angry over condemned property . Police said the suspect in the shooting, Rockne Newell, was angry with local officials. The 59-year-old's home had recently been condemned and purchased by the township, police said. ""We do believe he was angry about the condemnation of the property,"" Bartal told reporters Tuesday. When he burst into the meeting room, the shooter appeared to fire at random. ""His beef seemed to be with the township and the township supervisors,"" Bartal said. ""Unfortunately, some of the people attending the meeting happened to be in harm's way."" Three people were killed -- James V. LaGuardia, 64, David Fleetwood, 62, and Gerard J. Kozic, 53. Several others were wounded. Newell was one of three people taken to a hospital after the shooting and later released into police custody, Geoffrey Roche, spokesman for the Pocono Medical Center, told CNN Tuesday. Newell was arraigned Tuesday morning on charges of criminal homicide, Pennsylvania State Police Sgt. Brian Vadell said. Newell was in Monroe County jail during the video arraignment, Vadell said. No plea was entered. The shooting suspect was limping, shirtless and handcuffed as authorities escorted him into state police barracks Monday night. When a reporter from CNN affiliate WFMZ asked whether he had anything to say about what had happened, it didn't take him long to answer. ""They tormented me for 23 years,"" Newell said. ""I couldn't take it."" Court documents reveal dramatic details . The terror began Monday night even before the gunman entered the building, police said. Ross Township's monthly supervisors meeting had just started when the shooter marched toward the municipal building in Saylorsburg with a long gun and fired through the windows. Court documents obtained by CNN paint a dramatic picture of the shooting and its aftermath. The shooter used a semi-automatic rifle to open fire on the meeting, according to a probable cause affidavit filed by police. When police arrived in the meeting room, one victim lay dead on the floor. Newell was also pinned to the ground on his stomach, with a gunshot wound in his leg, the affidavit says. As authorities took Newell to the hospital, Pennsylvania State Police Trooper Nicolas de Iglesia said he heard Newell say, ""I wish I killed more of them."" At the hospital, the affidavit says, Newell told police he'd planned to kill the township's solicitor and supervisors, and thought he would get killed while doing it. Inside the gunman's vehicle, police said, investigators found 90 rounds of ammunition. Witness: 'It was a nightmare' Pocono Record reporter Chris Reber watched as plaster flew off the walls, he said in a first-hand account that appeared in the newspaper. He was covering his first board meeting. He heard more than 10 shots. Read Reber's account . ""The thing that got my attention: plaster flying out, blowing out through the walls. Witnesses would later tell me they saw pictures exploding away from the walls,"" according to the newspaper account. Another witness, Cleoria Campodonico, sobbed as she told CNN that the shooting was ""the worst thing I have seen in my whole life."" ""I am scared for the rest of my life for those images,"" she said, vowing to never go back in the building again. She said that she, too, called 911 when the shooting happened and then phoned her husband to tell him that she loved him. She thought she would never see him again, she said. She then called her daughter to tell her the same thing. A man protected her, she told CNN, and he was shot in the stomach twice. She does not know if he survived. ""I owe that man my life for protecting me,"" she said. ""Oh my God, it was a nightmare."" Complaints about Newell . The Pocono Record newspaper reported in a story on June 10 that Newell, after an 18-year battle, had been ordered last year to vacate his property, which was called an eyesore by the board of supervisors, the elected body that sets policies and laws for the community of 5,400. The township wanted to take over the property and clean it up, the newspaper reported. ""If I lose this property, I have nowhere else to go,"" he told the paper. ""What they're doing to me, what they've been doing to me for so long, it's wrong."" According to the Pocono Record, Newell got a building permit from the township to have a storage structure on his property, but then built a residence without getting a proper permit. The newspaper said neighbors filed complaints about the property, including one of human fecal matter in buckets, the Record said. The township ruled he was improperly disposing of sewage with no septic system, according to the newspaper. Newell said he couldn't afford septic hookup fees, it said. The court last year ordered Newell to leave the property, which was set for a sheriff's sale this summer. Monday night, the topic of Newell's property wasn't on the meeting's agenda. CNN's Poppy Harlow reported from Saylorsburg; Ashley Fantz and Catherine E. Shoichet reported and wrote in Atlanta; CNN's Holly Yan, Ronni Berke, Joe Sutton, Kevin Conlon and Rick Martin contributed to this report.","NEW: Suspect to CNN affiliate: ""They tormented me for 23 years.

"(CNN) -- Authorities confirmed the remains found in an upstate New York river were of a baby boy reported missing from Utica in June, police said Saturday. Extensive DNA testing, performed at the Onondaga County medical examiner's office in Syracuse, verified the baby was Levon Wameling, who was 10 months old when his father reported the child was taken while unattended from the house porch, authorities said. The medical examiner, however, hasn't provided a cause of death, said Sgt. Steve Hauck, spokesman for Utica police. After receiving information, state police divers found the child in a container in the Mohawk River on September 6, authorities said. ""The Utica Police continue to investigate this case, with the hope that the truth will be learned and the person(s) responsible are held accountable,"" Hauck said in a statement. Earlier this month, the boy's father, Jevon Wameling, was arrested by New York State Police and accused of breaking into a home in a suburb of Utica to steal jewelry and money. Hauck said then he wouldn't say whether the father had anything to do with the tip leading police to the remains, citing the ongoing investigation, but the circumstances of Levon's disappearance raised questions about the boy's father from the start. Wameling took two weeks to go to an attorney's office and then call police to report Levon's disappearance, authorities said back in June. ""Based on the information that he's given us, we have a lot of concern,"" Utica Police Chief Mark Williams said at the time. ""We have a problem with what he says,"" Williams said. ""There's no question about it."" The father told investigators he took the child out for a late-night walk and locked himself out of his home, so he put the boy down on the small front porch and went around back to find a way in. When he opened the front door, the baby was gone, the father told police. Levon would have turned a year old on August 31, police said. CNN's Chris Boyette contributed to this report.","Police confirm baby is the same infant missing from Utica, New York .

"(CNN) -- Rumors that Apple is preparing major design changes with iOS 7 continue to heat up, with new reports suggesting a more muted and flat design aesthetic. Last October, Jonathan Ive became responsible not only for the look and feel of Apple hardware, but also its software. By most accounts, Ive is not a fan of the skeuomorphic heavy design cues that currently dominate iOS. While we previously heard rumors that Ive was planning a broad UI (user interface) overhaul with iOS 7, we didn't have many specific details. Now, 9to5 Mac is reporting that Ive's look for iOS 7 will be ""black, white and flat all over."" According to 9to5 Mac's sources, many of the textures currently present in iOS Ã¢â¬â linen on the notifications panel and leather in the calendar app Ã¢â¬â will be replaced with flat black and white colors. As for the home screen, apps will no longer have gloss, shadows and shine applied to the icons, but their corners will remain rounded. 9to5 Mac also suggests that apps such as Mail, Calendar and Maps will gain a more unified look. The report suggests that all apps will share a similar white base each with its own unique color scheme. The green felt from Game Center and the wooden shelves from Newsstand have also reportedly been removed. These moves coalesce with more general trends we've seen in the last 12 to 18 months in mobile and web design. In fact, we've seen concept videos from fans that mirror many of the rumored changes headed towards iOS. Apple is expected to unveil the new iOS 7 at WWDC 2013, its developers conference that kicks off June 10. The big challenge with an iOS overhaul, of course, will be balancing the need for something new with the familiarity the system has with hundreds of millions of users. What do you think of the rumored plans for iOS 7? Let us know in the comments. See the original story on Mashable . Â© 2013 MASHABLE.com.

"(CNN) -- In the middle of the Idaho wilderness, a man on horseback had a brief conversation with two campers. The rider's realization later that he may have been talking to California Amber Alert suspect James DiMaggio and his alleged teenage captive has now focused a nationwide manhunt for the pair on the rugged mountain area in central Idaho. The horseback rider saw the man and girl Wednesday and struck up a brief conversation with them, Andrea Dearden, spokeswoman for the Ada County Sheriff's Office, said Friday. He was not aware of the manhunt at the time, but he called the Amber Alert tip line after he saw a news account that night and realized the pair matched the description of DiMaggio and 16-year-old Hannah Anderson, she said. The rider's impression of the pair was ""it seemed odd but nothing as alarming,"" Dearden said. ""They did speak and exchange pleasantries. I don't think there was a lot of information exchanged,"" she said. ""He left the conversation believing they were camping in the area."" The rider said the man and girl were on foot, hiking with camping gear, Dearden said. Dearden appeared to be correcting authorities' earlier reports that the suspect and girl were spotted by more than one horseback rider. Investigators set up checkpoints where DiMaggio and Hannah were believed to be traveling in the River of No Return Wilderness area, about 15 miles outside Cascade, Dearden said. Authorities haven't yet evacuated any homes or businesses, she said, adding, ""We have those access points secured."" The horseback rider's tip moved the national manhunt for DiMaggio and Hannah, who was last seen Saturday afternoon at her cheerleading practice, to the Idaho mountains. Authorities in Southern California began looking for Hannah after their mother was found dead inside DiMaggio's burned-out house in the San Diego area Sunday. Late Friday, authorities said lab tests confirmed that a second body found in the house was that of Hannah's 8-year-old brother, Ethan. DiMaggio was a close friend of the Anderson family, and father Brett Anderson has appealed to DiMaggio to let his daughter go. Friday morning, investigators found DiMaggio's car hidden by brush, its license plates removed, about six to eight miles from where the rider spotted the girl, authorities said. They confirmed the car's ownership by its vehicle identification number, he said. The vehicle will be examined by bomb and arson technicians to ensure it's not rigged with explosives, Gore added. His office has said evidence found at the burned house indicates that explosives may be in the car. The horseback rider said the man and girl appeared to be in good health, Gore said. Suspect 'capable of anything' Authorities deem DiMaggio a dangerous suspect because he is accused of killing Hannah's mother, Christina Anderson, and possibly Ethan as well. The second body is so badly burned that carrying out a DNA test is proving difficult, authorities said. The sheriff's office is treating Ethan as a missing person until they can identify the body. A search of DiMaggio's burned-down house led law enforcement to this conclusion: ""We don't hold anything past this person,"" as one official put it. ""We think that he's capable of anything at this point,"" said Capt. Duncan Fraser of the San Diego Sheriff's Office. Based on what the sheriff's investigators have seen, there is evidence that the fire and kidnapping of Hannah was a ""very well-planned event,"" Fraser said. Idaho on Friday became the latest state to issue an Amber Alert for Hannah, following California, Oregon, Washington and Nevada. Why more Amber alerts will be waking you up . The San Diego Sheriff's Department already said it was possible DiMaggio was hunkered down in a rural area because he is a camper. ""We've got law enforcement agencies across the country looking for them and following up on tips that are being called in,"" San Diego County Sheriff's Department Lt. Glenn Giannantonio told CNN on Thursday. ""We've received numerous tips, I'd say probably well over 100, possibly hundreds of tips from across the country. Every tip that can be followed up on has been followed up on or is currently being followed up on."" Suspect is family friend . DiMaggio was described as being so close to the Andersons that he was considered part of the family, Brett Anderson told CNN's Chris Cuomo on Thursday. He came into their lives before Hannah was born. DiMaggio was such good friends with the family that Anderson said he can't reconcile the man he knows with the crimes he is suspected of. ""I have been through every scenario in my brain,"" Anderson said. ""There was nothing ever to show any indication of this."" DiMaggio joined the family on campouts and was always friendly toward them, he said. ""I can't fathom what happened in Jim's head. He obviously just lost it,"" Anderson said. ""You've taken everything,"" the father pleaded to DiMaggio in the interview. ""The damage is done. Just let my daughter go, Let her go home safe, let her be with me and try to mend things from there."" Some witnesses have told investigators that DiMaggio had a crush on Hannah, but Brett Anderson has said the family had no knowledge of that. Fraser said that they are looking into whether the suspect possibly had an ""undue infatuation"" with the teen. CNN's Paul Vercammen, Miguel Marquez and HLN's Katherine Cavazini contributed to this report.","A horseback rider reports sighting the pair in the central Idaho wilderness .

"(Southern Living) -- On a bright Big Bend afternoon in far-west Texas, I steer myself along a high-desert, two-lane highway, tufts of dried-up tumbleweed thistle packed like snow against barbed-wire fences. The sky above opens up its cobalt tent; the space beneath stretches as far as an ocean. Rugged landscapes and wide-open spaces inspire artists and visitors in West Texas. U.S. 90 leads me through the Davis Mountains and ocotillo-and-cactus flats to Marfa, Alpine and Marathon, a string of three Big Bend towns just 60 miles apart. Here they live as siblings in a remote, starkly beautiful landscape as mysterious to me as Mars. ""Driving from Dallas, we often joke, 'Who would put a town out here? And who would live in it?'"" says Marfa wood artist Camp Bosworth. ""And we realize, well, us."" Far-off inspiration . It's hard to believe inspiration can come in so far-off and austere a place, but it's all around you. Marfa, Alpine and Marathon sit along U.S. 90 like hitching posts. On first glance, the three are all Mayberrys of another era. Marfa's one blinking red light; the Alpine Dairy Queen and Big Bend Saddlery; Marathon's three blocks of storefronts facing the railroad. But I visit in search of the defining quality that draws people 400 miles west of San Antonio to live and to visit. I'm looking for the real towns, what makes them so alluring and freeing, to ""slow down and see,"" as Bosworth describes. As one New York transplant to Marfa tells me, ""Good things come with space."" Vintage and vogue . Bosworth introduces himself on my first night in Marfa at the opening of a gas-station-turned-folk-art-gallery called Yard Dog. The two rooms of Yard Dog glow in the pitch-black stillness of the nearly 2,000-person town. Inside, the scene teems with locals, some who look like Willie Nelson, some like Brooklyn hipsters, all toasting yet another gallery Ã©migrÃ©. Bosworth, who moved to the Big Bend eight years ago, wears a canvas Carhartt jacket and black designer eyeglasses, a stylish mix of rancher and Warhol seen all over Marfa. We step outside. ""Out here you can just breathe,"" he says, referring to the whole Big Bend, where Texas leans toward the Rio Grande and Mexico reaches back. ""That constant push to do is gone. And instantly at night, there are a million stars. In the openness you suddenly feel creative."" SouthernLiving.com: Marfa Travel Planner . True cowboys ride bikes . In Marfa, vintage bicycles replace horses. Bosworth himself owns more than 10 throwback Schwinns and Flyers. After a night's sleep at the Thunderbird Hotel, a motor court revamped with minimalist looks (and record players), I rise early and pedal through town on a hotel bike. I pass the high school, the silver water tower, and the pinkish 1886 Presidio County courthouse -- all signs of Big Bend normalcy. Large cherry red letters mark one gorgeous white building -- JUDD -- near Maiya's, a sleek Italian cafe, and down from the hacienda-like Hotel Paisano. I stop near the single flashing signal by Marfa Book Company and Marfa Public Radio, where NPR programs mix with station manager Tom Michael's local news and interviews. Food Shark . Late morning, the Food Shark, an aluminum-body gourmet lunch truck, rolls into town and parks near the tracks, where honey-colored benches and tables sit under the farmers market pavilion. Jack the dog roams around while folks buy Mediterranean dishes from the Food Shark, manned by a friendly couple, Adam and Krista. Savoring open space . From my chickpea Marfalafel basket, it's off to the Chinati Foundation, a former army base filled with art installations by Donald Judd and his contemporaries. Judd, whose work has had tremendous influence on modern sculpture, began buying land south of Marfa and buildings in town in the 1970s for preservation purposes as well as his own use. He savored Marfa's open space. High desert inspiration . Of the highway town trio, Alpine is the busy one, where outliers visit for dry cleaning, a pharmacy, an Amtrak pickup station or the largest grocery. Alpine's thriving liberal arts university Sul Ross State looks down on the town, which, like its neighbor communities, lives at nearly mile-high elevation. Sweet aromas in the mountain-fresh air pull locals to Judy's Bread and Breakfast, where folks pass the paper over homemade cinnamon rolls. Even as a passerby, I get warm looks that say pull up a chair. SouthernLiving.com: Alpine Travel Planner . Makin' it rattle . A block down Holland Avenue at Kiowa Gallery, the spirited Keri Artzt greets me at the door, as colorfully dressed as the walls in her place. ""You don't come to Alpine for a mall fix,"" Peggy Martin, a nine-year employee, says. ""But we can make it rattle if we need to."" In a town of painted murals -- I see several driving from Kiowa to the Big Bend Saddlery -- Alpineers draw from the same creative wellspring as do its sister towns. Listen to the music . As the sun curves to its peak, Alpine steals a few hours from winter, and guitar-maker Michael Stevens wipes a bead of sweat off his brow. Living on 10 acres just south of town, his workshop window faces uninterrupted miles of native grasses and wispy clouds. His completed instruments, shiny and perfect, hang inside. You'd swear laser-guided machines made the guitars. The craft is astounding. Jackrabbits can talk . Back in town, comic strip artist Chris Ruggia opens his small studio with pleasure. ""Jack,"" his cartoon ode to the ecology of the vast Big Bend wilderness, stars kangaroo rats, jackrabbits and coyotes. ""It's such an emphatic region,"" the quiet man says. ""As an artist, you really respond to it."" Guided by biologists from The Nature Conservancy and Sul Ross, interpreters from Big Bend National Park and his own wandering eye, Ruggia's more than 40 ""Jack"" online episodes bring art and the landscape side-by-side. Long way home . In the couple of days I've spent traveling around these three towns, I've found the rolling drive between places to be quite calming. Peggy Martin at Kiowa Gallery said I would. ""This is a healing place,"" she says, ""because people have time."" From Alpine, I tune into KRTS-FM:93.5, the region's community station, letting the midday classical hour play sound track to the passing miles of sage brush, desert willow and limestone rises. Welcome to Marathon . Thirty miles flash by as a cello player finishes a piece that sounds like strings singing through the radio. Marathon (population 455) is by far the smallest of the three. For days, people in Marfa and Alpine have mentioned two mainstays in Marathon over and over: the Gage Hotel and photographer James Evans. SouthernLiving.com: Marathon Travel Planner . Worth a thousand words . ""The landscape is like a relative now,"" Evans tells me, lounging on a leather chair in his highway photo gallery. Window-size, silver gelatin prints of his ""800,000-acre backyard,"" as he calls Big Bend, hang in the serene, wood-planked room. Evans lights up when I ask about the vistas surrounding us, where the onetime Gage Hotel cook has spent 20 years documenting the region. ""When I first go back, I usually start on old River Road,"" he says about his journeys from Marathon into the rough country. He describes a flashing creek photographed by moonlight on a 30-minute exposure, much the way Ansel Adams shot Yosemite; floating through the Santa Elena Canyon; and how he hikes to spots by dusk so he can wake up there. ""I could shoot this area forever."" Whispering memories . This brief moment with Evans is telling. The photographer's eyes drift off. His voice softens. And he's gone away somewhere miles from this room. His 60,000 photos of the Big Bend must carry countless memories, unspoken things that act as muse and healer both. I find myself remembering this as night falls over Marathon. A fire crackles in my Gage Hotel room, while the fountain in the courtyard slowly begins succumbing to a sinking chill. Outside, I stand in the cold, looking up over the adobe walls at a sky full of stars, believing these places have whispered to me as well.

"NEW DELHI, India (CNN) -- India blasted into the international space race Wednesday with the successful launch of an ambitious two-year mission to study the moon's landscape. The spacecraft carrying India's first lunar probe, Chandrayaan-1, lifts off in Sriharikota on Wednesday. The unmanned lunar orbiter Chandrayaan-1, or ""moon craft"" in ancient Sanskrit, launched at 6:20 a.m. (8:50 p.m. ET) from the Sriharikota space center in southern India. The mission seeks high-resolution imaging of the moon's surface, especially the permanently shadowed polar regions, according to the Indian Space Research Organization. It will also search for evidence of water or ice and attempt to identify the chemical breakdown of certain lunar rocks, the group said. Despite the numerous missions to the moon over the past 50 years, ""we really don't have a good map,"" said Miles O'Brien, CNN chief technology and environment correspondent. ""The goal is to come up with a very intricate, three-dimensional map of the moon."" The Chandrayaan-1 is carrying payloads from the United States, European Union countries Germany, Britain, Sweden and Bulgaria, and India plans to share the data from the mission with other programs, including NASA.  Watch the launch of India's first lunar mission Â» . ISRO said on its Web site that the mission would lay the groundwork for future lunar missions and ""probe the physical characteristics of the lunar surface in greater depth than previous missions by other nations."" ""It will also give us a deeper understanding about the planet Earth itself or its origins,"" a statement on the Web site said. ""Earlier missions did not come out with a full understanding of the moon and that is the reason scientists are still interested. This will lay the foundation for bigger missions and also open up new possibilities of international networking and support for planetary programs."" Until now, India's space launches have been more practical, with weather warning satellites and communiations systems, The Associated Press cited former NASA associated administrator Scott Pace as saying. To date, only the U.S. Russia, the European Space Agency, Japan and China have sent missions to the moon, according to AP. Critics of the mission have questioned its $80 million price tag, saying the money should have been spent by the government to improve education and fight poverty. But, ""there are scientists that would argue that there are plenty of things we don't know about the moon ... and India might have the know-how"" to find answers, said CNN's Sara Sidner in New Delhi. The United States and the Soviet Union dominated the field of lunar exploration from the late 1950s. The United States is preparing for its own mission slated for next spring -- the first U.S. lunar mission in more than a decade, according to NASA. Soviet spacecraft were the first to fly by, land on and orbit the moon. Luna 1, launched on January 2, 1959, and sped by the moon two days later. Luna 2 was launched on an impact mission on September 12, 1959, striking the surface two days later. Luna 9 launched on January 31, 1966, becoming the first craft to successfully land on the moon and send back data, touching down on the surface on January 31, 1966, and transmitting until February 3, 1967, when its batteries ran out. Luna 10 was launched March 31, 1966, entered lunar orbit on April 3, and operated for 56 days. But the United States' Apollo missions were the first manned missions to reach the moon, culminating with six missions that set down on the surface. The first, Apollo 11, left earth on July 16, 1969, and landed astronauts Neil Armstrong and Edwin Aldrin on the lunar surface on July 20 while command module pilot Michael Collins orbited above. The astronauts returned safely to earth on July 24. Most recently India's fellow Asian nations, China and Japan, put lunar orbiters in place. Japan launched the Kaguya orbiter in October 2007, followed by China's launch of the Chang'e mission a few weeks later.  Watch what is shaping up to be a new space race Â» .

"Philadelphia (CNN) -- The inspector of a downtown building that collapsed last week has killed himself, city officials said Thursday. Ronald Wagenhoffer, 52, who worked with the Department of Licenses and Inspections, was found shortly after 9 p.m. Wednesday, Everett Gillison, deputy mayor for public safety for the city of Philadelphia, told reporters. Although the probe into the collapse, which killed six people, is now a criminal investigation, Wagenhoffer was not a target, Gillison said. ""This man did nothing wrong,"" he said. ""The department did what it was supposed to do under the code at the time."" Wagenhoffer was found inside a pickup truck in a wooded area along Shawmont Avenue in the Roxborough section of Philadelphia. According to sources with knowledge of the investigation, Wagenhoffer's wife, Michelle, alerted police after he sent her a text message. He also is survived by a son. Wagenhoffer, who spent 16 years with the Department of Licenses and Inspections, last inspected the site of fatal building collapse on May 14 after the department received citizen complaints. He inspected the site alone, Gillison said. Carlton Williams, commissioner for licenses and inspections, described Wagenhoffer as ""dedicated"" and a man who ""loved his job."" ""He worked extremely hard before the tragedy and after the tragedy,"" Williams said. ""We were all shocked. He was an outstanding employee."" City officials say there were no obvious signs Wagenhoffer was distraught, adding that he worked Wednesday, leaving shortly after 3 p.m. Authorities charged crane operator Sean Benschop, 42, with involuntary manslaughter and other related charges after a four-story wall of the vacant building collapsed onto an adjacent Salvation Army thrift store on June 5, killing six people and injuring 13. Police have said toxicology results showed he was under the influence of a controlled substance. Benschop, maintains his innocence. Over the weekend, his attorney, Daine Grey, said his client was ""being made the scapegoat in this situation."" A grand jury will investigate the collapse to determine if anyone else should be charged, prosecutors have said. Six complaints naming the building owner, his demolition contractor and subcontractor, and the equipment operator have been filed.","Ronald Wagenhoffer, 52, killed himself, city official say .

"Des Moines, Iowa (CNN) -- Representatives for leading social conservative groups in Iowa held a secret meeting Monday as part of an effort with one main goal: find and support a Republican presidential candidate who can stop Mitt Romney in Iowa. The idea: avoid splintering the conservative vote in the state by rallying around one GOP rival who could win Iowa's Jan. 3 caucus and then challenge Romney in New Hampshire and the other early voting states. Many social conservatives and other religious leaders in the state have openly labeled the former Massachusetts governor as a ""flip-flopper,"" a criticism the campaign frequently beats back, while others have seen Romney's Mormon faith as an issue. And many of them have openly hoped for someone to emerge as a viable alternative to the former Massachusetts governor. CNN reached out to the Romney campaign for reaction to the secret meeting and the overall anti-Romney effort. ""Gov. Romney is running a 50-state campaign. He's going to be competitive in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and all the other early states,"" said Romney campaign spokesman Ryan Williams. ""He's reaching out to each and every voter."" One attendee at the meeting earlier this week told CNN they wanted ""to see if they could come to a consensus of who they might endorse."" But the source was skeptical about the impact of Iowa social conservatives rallying behind one candidate. ""If you want to stop Romney you're probably going to have to have some organization [and] some money,"" the source said. ""Somebody who's at 5% or 6% in the polls, and they endorse, I don't think that does any good."" Multiple sources have described to CNN details of the meeting and the general effort. The meeting, the group's first, took place in a private office building in Des Moines on Monday. In attendance were representatives from the Iowa Faith and Freedom Coalition, The Family Leader, the group Iowa Right to Life, and a representative for the Iowa chapter of Concerned Women for America. Some pastors from prominent Iowa churches also attended the meeting. The effort seems limited to Iowa, with no apparent outreach to similar groups in other states. While the concerns have been voiced before, what appears to be new is the meeting itself and organizers' hope for like-minded groups to come together against Romney, at least in Iowa. Sources say there were about 20 to 25 people present at the meeting and that another meeting is planned for Monday of next week. The effort is said to still be in the discussion phase. Participants were said to have narrowed their focus down to four candidates: Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann, Texas Gov. Rick Perry, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum. Iowa social conservatives want to find alternative . CNN spoke with Chuck Hurley, vice-president of The Family Leader, regarding the meeting. Initially, he was reluctant to discuss the gathering. ""There was a statement made in the meeting not to divulge the contents of the meeting,"" Hurley said. Hurley said he had invited some attendees and confirmed the meeting's purpose was, in fact, to seek a consensus pick to topple Romney, who has been at or near the top of recent polls in the state. He added that the group is not trying to take on any authority role. ""They're very unofficial,"" Hurley said. Hurley also helped to clarify why Georgia businessman Herman Cain and Texas Rep. Ron Paul were not part of the conversation. ""My best recollection is that there were some issues about states' rights, as they pertained to the sanctity of human life and marriage,"" Hurley said, although he could not recall specific arguments against the two candidates. ""I think that was more Ron Paul."" Hurley also stressed many attendees praised Herman Cain. But there were concerns about ""a lack of clarity with Mr. Cain... lack of consistency on issues of sanctity of life and marriage."" ""I think with Mr. Cain there was some concern he's maybe not quite experienced enough in civics... And maybe not quite ready for that number one job,"" Hurley added. The Cain and Paul campaigns challenged similar, yet separate, criticisms on Tuesday when one of the groups took both men out of consideration for its presidential endorsement. Regarding the sexual harassment claims lobbed against Cain -- claims the candidate strongly denies -- Hurley said: ""That was not mentioned, that I can recall."" Jenifer Bowen, the executive director of Iowa Right to Life, also attended the Monday meeting. ""I was invited by the leader of The Family Leader,"" Bowen said, referring to Hurley. ""My understanding was, I'm assuming he was the one who really spearheaded the meeting."" Bowen explained that she listened to the appeals from attendees. However, Bowen said neither she nor board members of her group will endorse a candidate ahead of the caucuses. For those reasons, Bowen said she did not participate in the conversation and will not attend the upcoming meeting or others. Several groups rise up against Romney . Bob Vander Plaats, president and CEO of The Family Leader, who was not at the Monday meeting and spoke to CNN only broadly about the conservative opposition to Romney. ""It's no secret that there's many conservatives throughout Iowa who are looking for the alternative to Romney, who can win Iowa, and then who can go the distance in New Hampshire and beyond and become our nominee that can beat Obama,"" Vander Plaats said. ""Our concern is that if the conservatives stay as fragmented as they are, that Romney could win the Iowa caucuses. And if he wins the Iowa caucuses, he'll be the nominee,"" Vander Plaats added. ""So I think there's an urgency to say, 'Well who is the person that could best challenge [Romney] then move on after Iowa?"" Kerry Jech, senior minister of the New Hope Christian Church in Marshalltown, explained the opposition to the former Massachusetts governor among some Christian and social conservatives. ""I think there is a concern we not splinter our support amongst several candidates to the point that somebody gets in the nomination who doesn't share our values,"" Jech said. Jech added that, in his view, Romney has ""waffled"" on two issues that social conservatives care deeply about: the definition of marriage as between one man and one woman, and abortion. Yet Jech warned, ""I don't think any of us are going to find a candidate we agree with 100% on every issue."" Some also feel that Romney has repeatedly snubbed this key voting group in Iowa. ""I think he is sticking his finger in the eyes of the social conservatives by neglecting [them],"" said Steve Scheffler, president of the Iowa Faith and Freedom Coalition. Romney going after 'all caucus goers' Citing the candidate's ""pro-jobs, pro-growth message"" and 25 years in business, Romney campaign spokesman Williams said the governor ""is the strongest candidate to take on and defeat President Obama in 2012."" ""Gov. Romney is reaching out to all caucus goers, to all primary voters -- to everybody who intends to vote in the Republican nominating contests across the country,"" Williams said. As for claims that Romney is inconsistent, Williams said the former Massachusetts governor has clearly ""laid out his positions in his book, on the campaign trail and in numerous policy proposals."" Romney currently leads, or is near the top, in several polls for Iowa. A recent CNN/Time/ORC International poll from late October, as well as a Des Moines Register survey, both showed Romney essentially tied with Cain.","Social conservatives in Iowa quietly meet to find alternative to Mitt Romney .

"(CNN) -- A Libyan rebel fighter collapses to the ground during a firefight in the city of Misrata. Shrapnel rips through an artery in his leg, and he is rapidly losing blood. Medics battle to save his life in an abandoned building that doubles as an emergency operating theater. They come under fire. The man dies. Photographer Andre Liohn's images of the grim scene provide insight into the risky conditions under which medical personnel in conflict zones operate. It used to be that a red cross on a vehicle or building meant protection. But not anymore. Assaults on medical personnel and facilities have become all too common, the International Committee of the Red Cross said Wednesday in releasing a new report. ""Violence against health-care facilities and personnel must end. It's a matter of life and death,"" said Yves Daccord, the director-general of the organization. ""The human cost is staggering: civilians and fighters often die from their injuries simply because they are prevented from receiving timely medical assistance,"" Daccord said. Read the opinion of ICRC Director-General, Yves Daccord . Louis Lillywhite, former surgeon general of the British armed forces, said in World War II a British hospital on the front lines was able to function even with fighting on the premises. ""Both the Germans and the British respected the neutrality of the area that was actually reserved as the hospital,"" he said. ""And it was on the basis that they did not participate in any military activities at all."" But these days, convincing warring parties of the neutrality of medical personnel is a challenge. Michiel Hofman of Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders) said in a place like Afghanistan, for instance, medics can only operate if there is no military presence whatsoever. ""It is the old concept of the gun-free hospital,"" Hofman said. ""This concept was there for a reason. Once there (are) guns inside a hospital, the hospital is no longer a neutral zone, and it will get attacked by different military forces."" The Red Cross report said that millions of lives could be saved if the delivery of health care were more respected. ""The most shocking finding is that people die in large numbers not because they are direct victims of a roadside bomb or a shooting,"" said Robin Coupland, whose research in 16 countries formed the basis of the report. ""They die because the ambulance does not get there in time, because health-care personnel are prevented from doing their work, because hospitals are themselves targets of attacks or simply because the environment is too dangerous for effective health care to be delivered."" Medical workers are becoming war's first casualties, Daccord said. Hospitals in Sri Lanka and Somalia have been shelled, ambulances in Libya, shot at. Paramedics in Colombia were killed and the wounded in Afghanistan languished for hours in vehicles held at checkpoints. All of it presents ""one of the most urgent yet overlooked humanitarian tragedies,"" Daccord said. ""The issue has been staring us in the face for years. It must end.""

"(The Frisky) -- Although I don't plan to change my name when I get hitched this summer, I respect and appreciate every woman's right to choose what's best for her. I reject the notion some have expressed that when a woman takes her husband's last name she's giving up her identity. Rules still remain about the proper way to address invitations to women depending on their marital status. But then I had an interesting conversation with my mother recently that added a whole new layer to this name and identity dichotomy. I've been working on wedding invitations and I'm in the middle of finalizing a guest list and collecting addresses, so I shot my mom an email to make sure I had the most current addresses of our family members, and I also asked how I should formally address certain people on the envelopes. I figured that my mother and grandmother, being total old-school traditionalists, would prefer to be addressed with their husbands as Mr. and Mrs. TheirHusband'sFirstAndLastName, but I wasn't sure about everyone else. How, for example, should I address my aunt who's divorced but retained her married name? The Frisky: What's in a name? My mother's reply sort of shocked me. As I expected, she expressed her desire to be addressed as Mrs. MyDad'sFullName, but said that etiquette dictated that all married women who share their husband's last name be addressed as such, and that divorced women who retain their married names, like my aunt, should be addressed as Mrs. -- not Ms., as I assumed -- TheirFullName. The Frisky: 15 tips for a budget wedding . Most surprising to me, my mother said that even when a card is sent just to her, like a birthday card or Mother's Day card, she prefers to be addressed as Mrs. My Dad's Full Name and not, as I'd assume, Mrs. Her Full Name! ""Your grandmother prefers that as well,"" she said, ""We've talked about it."" She says that addressing a woman as Mrs. Her First and Last Name would imply that she's divorced, and a card addressed without a title at all is just plain ""impolite."" ""Google the etiquette rules if you don't believe me,"" she said. Well, I did Google the rules; I even took the bible of social rules, ""Emily Post's Etiquette (16th Edition)"" down off the shelf, and was astonished to find that my mom is pretty much correct. The book and almost every link I found said it was proper etiquette to address the envelope of a married couple as Mr. and Mrs. John S. Smith without any regard to the woman's first name at all. The Frisky: Why are weddings getting weirder . In my brief search I found just one exception, which expressed clearly: ""Either use both first names when addressing a married couple or no first names at all. Avoid the Mr. and Mrs. John Doe. (it is old fashioned and usually makes the wife feel owned by her husband)."" Using no first names on mail addressed to married couples is the tradition I've adopted as an adult, never realizing that both my mother and grandmother find it disrespectful because it's not in keeping with traditional rules of etiquette. My mother says the etiquette rule that trumps all others when it comes to names is to call a person what he or she wishes to be called, which is a rule that's surely timeless. The Frisky: Can you wear white to someone else's wedding? But what about in situations when one doesn't know how a person wishes to be addressed and it's impractical to ask (like when you have to address 100 wedding invitations, for example)? If we're to fall back on the general rules of etiquette, isn't it time that those rules reflect modern culture and not the traditions of the 1950s or earlier?

"New York (CNN) -- Two of the three suspects believed to be involved in a potential 9/11 anniversary plot against New York or Washington are of Arab descent and traveled to the United States last week, according to a U.S. government official. Authorities are operating under the assumption that two of the suspects have arrived on U.S. soil, and have been piecing together clues gleaned from flight logs and manifests, among other sources, said the official, who declined to be named. A third plotter is believed to have been traveling in Europe, though it is not clear whether that person has arrived in the United States, the official said. American spy networks had intercepted communications of an attack from an al Qaeda operative in Pakistan, derived from a source who has provided accurate information in the past, official say. No other corroborating evidence of an attack has been uncovered, but it has prompted intelligence officials to sift through communications from other al Qaeda cells. The information suggests the plan -- thought to involve a vehicle-borne explosive device -- is meant to coincide with the 10th anniversary of the September 11 attacks. The exact type of strike, however, is largley unclear and still remains unconfirmed. U.S. officials rarely speak on the record about intelligence intercepts. And in the days following the raid on Osama bin Laden's compound, officials indicated al Qaeda had gone to great lengths to avoid having its communications intercepted by the United States. While the precise nature of communication intercepts is rarely discussed, U.S. officials repeatedly have indicated their comfort with sharing the results of those intercepts. Authorities also say they have picked up ""chatter,"" or widely divergent communications, from extremists that suggest the newly tapped al Qaeda head, Ayman al-Zawahiri, is in some way involved in the current plot. Meanwhile, heightened security was visible Saturday in New York and Washington as intelligence officials worked to pin down information about the potential threat. A senior U.S. official said the plot was believed to involve three individuals. It is believed to entail a vehicle bomb, but ""we cannot rule out other means,"" the official said. U.S. Vice President Joe Biden also weighed in Friday, saying the information was at least in part gleaned from the May raid against bin Laden in Abottabad, Pakistan. ""This is the first ... credible piece of information we've gotten,"" Biden told NBC's ""Today"" show. ""All hands are on deck."" It is not clear how the bin Laden raid helped authorities connect the dots to the prospect of an anniversary attack, but Biden downplayed the threat of a widely sophisticated plot involving multiple conspirators. He said the administration's principal concern is a plot from a ""lone actor, not some extremely complicated plan like it took to take down the World Trade (Center) towers or the plane in Shanksville (Pennsylvania) or the Pentagon."" He added, ""It doesn't mean they couldn't happen, but it's much less likely. The lone actor is the more worrisome thing because there are fewer trails to follow, there are fewer leads to move on."" On Saturday morning, police officers stopped and searched box trucks as they approached the George Washington Bridge, which links New Jersey with New York, as well as the Queens-Midtown Tunnel, the Holland Tunnel and the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, connecting the boroughs of Staten Island and Brooklyn. Police also manned checkpoints in Midtown and downtown Manhattan, where they examined vehicles, particularly vans and trucks, for possible bombs. New York police also are sweeping parking garages for explosives and using digital license plate readers to check for stolen vehicles. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has directed state police and asked National Guardsmen to help secure areas during the anniversary weekend, bolstering an already heightened level of security. ""We already had a great security plan in place, and in an abundance of caution, we're deploying more resources,"" he told reporters. ""We shouldn't allow this threat to diminish the importance of the 9/11 anniversary, because that would be doing just what the terrorists want us to do."" A senior U.S. administration official said Friday that it is the ""origin"" of the intelligence information that is causing particular concern. U.S. officials believe that operatives came out of the tribal Pakistan-Afghanistan border region -- a volatile semi-lawless area that is home to extremist groups -- and that they are part of al Qaeda ""central."" The official also noted a possibility that Pakistan-based groups such as Lashkar e-Tayyiba or Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan could be involved. A senior White House official said President Barack Obama had been updated about the potential threat after his speech to a joint session of Congress on Thursday night, and White House counterterrorism adviser John Brennan briefed him again Friday. No changes have been made to the president's schedule for the weekend. New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg told reporters Thursday night that while additional police will be deployed around the city, ""There's no reason for any of the rest of us to change ... our daily routines."" A joint intelligence bulletin issued by the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security on Thursday indicated other methods than a truck or car bomb could be used, including attacks with small arms, homemade explosives and poisons. Al Qaeda probably would provide its operatives with enough autonomy to select the particular target and method of attack, the bulletin said, and an attack may involve operatives carrying U.S. documentation. Intelligence officials believe al Qaeda ""likely maintained an interest since at least February 2010 in conducting large attacks in the Homeland timed to coincide with symbolic dates, to include the 10-year anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks,"" according to the intelligence bulletin. Bin Laden's death and the ""removal"" of senior al Qaeda figures since then could add to the organization's desire to stage an attack on a symbolic date such as September 11, the bulletin said. In Washington, local officials said the city has a robust plan in place and has been on heightened alert since September 1. ""I want to urge all of our citizens ... to remain calm and let our law enforcement professionals do their job. At the same time, we ask people to remain vigilant,"" Mayor Vincent Gray said. ""If you see something, say something."" Unattended vehicles around key infrastructure will be towed, Washington Metropolitan Police Chief Cathy Lanier said. Federal officials said they are taking the threat seriously, while trying to temper the news by saying such threats are commonplace in connection with key dates. Rep. Peter King, R-New York, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said specific details were revealed to lawmakers about the threat. ""Many agencies are looking at this from every possible angle,"" he said. But it is not known yet if the threat is real, he said, adding, ""I would tell people now to go about their lives. There's no need to panic."" CNN's Mike M. Ahlers, Lesa Jansen, Allan Chernoff, Thomas Evans, Terry Frieden, Jessica Yellin, John King, Jim Barnett, Pam Benson, Fran Townsend and Ross Levitt contributed to this report.","NEW: Two Americans of Arab descent are believed to be involved in 9/11 plot .

"(CNN) -- Barcelona defender Eric Abidal returned to training Wednesday after seven months on the sidelines following a liver transplant. The 33-year-old was delighted to be back in action as he told the official website of the Catalan giants. ""I've been thinking about training will the ball for a long time,"" the 33-year-old said. ""Today is the first day. I'm tired, but happy. I think from now on my path to recovery will go well."" The world of football was stunned when Abidal was diagnosed with a liver tumor in May 2011, but he made a remarkable recovery to reclaim his place in the first team squad at the Camp Nou. But further complications arose in March which necessitated the transplant operation and another lengthy spell of rehabilitation. Abidal, hugely popular with the Barca fans, began his career with Monaco before moving to Lille in 2002. It was after leaving Lille to join Lyon in 2004 that he rose to prominence. Blog: Does international soccer need a shake up? Following three French First Division triumphs Abidal moved to Barcelona in June 2007. Since moving to Spain, Abidal has collected a host of honors. He was a part of the Barca squad which won three consecutive La Liga titles between 2009 and 2011. Abidal has collected a Cop del Rey winner's medal on two occasions and helped Barca clinch European Champions League glory in 2009 and 2011.

"TROY, Michigan (CNN) -- Thousands of screaming teenage girls waving ""We love Cody Simpson"" posters didn't pack a mall outside Detroit just to hear the Australian-born teen singer perform over the weekend. They also were there to support the recently launched anti-bullying campaign called Defeat the Label. Celebrities Miley Cyrus and Paula Abdul also are supporting the initiative, which is encouraging kids to speak out against bullying and put a stop to name calling, hateful Facebook and Twitter posts and actions that hurt feelings, incite depression and possibly drive some kids to end their lives. About 3,000 teens, children, parents and shoppers filled three floors of Somerset Mall for the free concert. Fans received florescent cards stamped with the words ""dork,"" ""weird,"" ""odd"" and ""nerd"" and tore them up when Simpson instructed everyone to destroy the stereotypes. Simpson, a 14-year-old often referred to as the next Justin Bieber, has become the face of Defeat the Label. With his 1.2 million Twitter followers and teen fan base, he said he believes he can help create a movement that shows bullying isn't cool. ""If enough people really stand up to it, I feel like it's something that can really be defeated,"" he said. One in five high school students have been bullied, according to the 2009 National Youth Risk Behavior Survey by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And with many teens and kids using Facebook, Twitter and other social networking sites, cyberbullying is pervasive among youth. Entertainment manager, speaker and philanthropist Ken Kragen made a special appearance at the concert to announce Defeat the Label's plan to have every student in the country stand up against bullying on May 4, 2012, at 12 p.m. ET. Kragen orchestrated the 1986 Hands Across America event, when 6.5 million people held hands from New York to California in one line to raise awareness about homelessness and poverty. A year earlier, he had helped organize the recording of the song ""We are the World,"" written by Michael Jackson and Lionel Richie and sung by the top recording artists at the time, to raise money for African famine relief. ""My philosophy is it's easier to accomplish the impossible than it is the ordinary,"" Kragen said. Kragen has turned his focus to bullying because he sees it as a growing epidemic that is affecting people everywhere. ""The attention in this country is on bullying,"" he said. ""Since I got involved in this, every time I turn on the television or I look at what movies are being made, constantly people are addressing these issues of bullying."" In the coming months, Kragen plans to get more celebrities to support the day against bulling and possibly coordinate a song similar to ""We are the World."" It's hard to get bullies to stop, but you can create an attitude that says, ""Bullying just isn't the thing to do,"" Kragen said. ""If somebody is being pushed off to the side and having to eat alone and people go and sit with them and say, 'I'm your friend. Forget what they say,' you change the whole dynamic,"" he said. Defeat the Label spokeswoman Lila Lazarus said, ""Our goal is to end bullying Ã¢â¬â to get people to wake up and stand up against the bully, not just in Detroit, not just in Michigan, but across the nation."" While some anti-bullying programs target the bully or victim, this one is aimed at the bystander. As Lazarus explained, bystanders Ã¢â¬â whether they're students, parents or teachers Ã¢â¬â don't necessarily know how to respond. ""We want the bystander to say 'no,' to stand up against the bully just as much as we want the victim to stand up against the bully,"" Lazarus said. But not everyone agrees with that strategy. A 2010 Youth Voice Research study of 11,893 students in grades five through 12 found that victims don't want their peers to call out a bully. Instead, they want their peers to talk with them, sit with them at lunch and walk to class with them. Davis, who co-wrote the report, said it's these small day-to-day actions that are needed to reduce bullying. ""Getting to know somebody who you think is a dork is way better than saying, 'I think dorks should be treated fine,' "" he said. The survey also found that students who tried to solve a bullying problem themselves didn't improve the situation. For example, 16% said telling the bully his/her feelings made the problem better. But 34% of students reported that the issue improved after seeking help from an adult. Defeatthelabel.com offers kids a weekly anti-bullying task such as sharing what they would do to defeat a stereotype or apologizing to someone they have hurt in the past. Jessica Jarrell, a rising singer who also performed at the Detroit show, said she supports Defeat the Label because she was bullied in middle school and mean things were said to her. Today, many of her fans send her messages about how they are being bullied. ""I can't believe that people can be so cruel to other people ... by being a part of this, I hope I can change people's opinions in school and other places,"" she said. Katie Long, 16, from Traverse City, Michigan, drove 4.5 hours to show her support for the cause. She said the campaign is needed to help stop bullying, which is ""getting out of hand."" ""At our school, it was crazy,"" she said. ""There were so many kids who were getting bullied, and it wasn't OK."" While the campaign is just stirring up support and getting under way, Simpson said the ultimate goal is quite simple: ""No more bullying.""","Singer Cody Simpson is urging teen fans to stand up to stop bullying .

""As part of the re-examination of the 1982 Tylenol poisonings, the FBI attempted to secure DNA from numerous individuals, including Ted Kaczynski,"" said Cynthia Yates, FBI spokeswoman. ""To date, Kaczynski has declined to voluntarily provide samples."" However, in a handwritten motion filed in federal court aimed at stopping the online auction of possessions taken from his Montana cabin in 1996, Kaczynski writes that he did agree -- with a condition -- to provide the sample. Read Kaczynski's motion . Kaczynski, 68, killed three people and wounded 23 others in a string of bombings from 1978 to 1995. The FBI dubbed him the ""Unabomber"" because of his early targets -- universities and airlines. He was arrested in 1996, pleaded guilty in 1998 and is now serving a life term in the federal ""Supermax"" prison in Florence, Colorado. Yates would not comment on whether federal authorities already have a DNA sample from Kaczynski or when the request for his DNA was made. ""It would have been standard procedure for DNA to be taken from Kaczynski as an inmate in a federal prison,"" said Traci Billingsley, a spokeswoman for the federal Bureau of Prisons. But she could not say precisely when Kaczynski's DNA was taken in the past, and had no information on the FBI's request for a new sample. ""The standards on DNA testing have changed over the years, so forensic examiners would want a fresh sample,"" said Chicago FBI spokesman Ross Rice. He said he did not know whether the original sample was kept or not. Mark Collins, a spokesman for the ""Supermax"" prison, would not comment on the DNA issue, saying it was ""not a matter of public record."" On April 27, Kaczynski writes in the motion filed May 9, prison officials told him that ""the Chicago office of the FBI wanted a sample of my DNA to compare with some partial DNA profiles connected with a 1982 event in which someone put potassium cyanide in Tylenol. The officers said the FBI was prepared to get a court order to compel me to provide the DNA sample, but wanted to know whether I would provide the sample voluntarily."" Kaczynski said he asked for time to think about it, and said he later sent a written response to prison officials saying he would provide the sample voluntarily ""if the FBI would satisfy a certain condition that is not relevant here."" Rice said he had no knowledge of what Kaczynski's condition might be. ""I have never even possessed any potassium cyanide,"" Kaczynski said. ""But even on the assumption that the FBI is entirely honest (an assumption I'm unwilling to make), partial DNA profiles can throw suspicion on persons who are entirely innocent. For example, such profiles can show that 5%, or 3%, or 1% of Americans have the same partial profile as the person who committed a certain crime. ""If it happens by chance that I fit one of the partial DNA profiles that the FBI has in relation to the 1982 cyanide incident, then it will be not only to my advantage, but to the advantage of society in general, to resolve correctly the question of any putative connection between me and the cyanide incident. For this purpose, some of the evidence seized from my cabin in 1996 may turn out to be important,"" and the auction should not go forward, he writes. A similar motion was also filed in district court, according to court documents. ""Kaczynski has not been indicted in connection with the Chicago Tylenol investigation, and no such federal prosecution is currently planned,"" federal prosecutors said in a response to the motion. ""Consequently, there is no basis for an order interfering with the sale previously approved by the district court, as directed by the court of appeals."" Absent a judge's ruling on the motion, the auction launched as planned Wednesday. Bidding for a handwritten copy of Kaczynski's 35,000-word manifesto, which ultimately led to his capture, stood at more than $12,000 as of Thursday. In 1982, seven people in the Chicago area died after taking Extra-Strength Tylenol capsules laced with potassium cyanide. The deaths prompted a national scare as several drug chains pulled Tylenol off their shelves and people in several cities were hospitalized on suspicion of cyanide poisoning. In an October 1982 article, Time magazine quoted Dr. William Robertson, then director of the Poison Control Center in Seattle, as saying, ""If it was going to be a lethal dose, you wouldn't have time to call."" Johnson & Johnson, parent company of the McNeil drug maker, was widely credited for its aggressiveness in recalling the product and its transparency in dealing with the deaths, and the product quickly bounced back in sales, remaining a popular analgesic. The incident led to changes in the way over-the-counter drugs were packaged, as tamper-proof seals were instituted. The case was never solved. In February 2009, the FBI announced it was working with Illinois state and local police to review evidence related to the killings. ""The review was prompted, in part, by the recent 25th anniversary of this crime and the resulting publicity. Further, given the many recent advances in forensic technology, it was only natural that a second look be taken at the case and recovered evidence."" Tylenol spokesman Bill Price declined comment on the Kaczynski matter Thursday. About 60 items are featured in the online auction of Kaczynski's possessions, including clothing, books, photographs and documents. Proceeds from the sale will benefit four of his victims who sought restitution and were awarded $15 million. Kaczynski vehemently opposed the auction and fought a court battle to prevent it. The auction runs through June 2 at gsaauctions.gov.

"New York (CNN) -- Given the pedigree of 740 Park Avenue's past and present residents -- John D. Rockefeller Jr., philanthropist Irene Guggenheim, designer Vera Wang and businessman David Koch, to name a few -- it's no surprise the jewelry taken in several thefts since May is primo stuff: . -- His and hers Patek Philippe watches, a Rolex watch and diamond earrings and a diamond necklace (more than $100,000 total) -- Diamond bracelet and rhinestone pin ($82,400) -- Two diamond earrings and other jewelry ($53,000) -- A $7,500 wrist watch . New York City Police are investigating grand larceny robberies at the most exclusive of Manhattan addresses. There were no signs of forced entry, according to Sgt. Carlos Nieves. The building's real estate firm, Brown Harris Stevens, also is investigating, said Amy Gotzler, senior vice president of communications. New York tower is burglar's gold mine . Police are focusing on four robberies that occurred while residents were on vacation, between May 30 and July 30. Completed in 1930, 740 Park Avenue also was home to the parents of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. Current residents include business magnate Steve Schwarzman. Some of its 31 units have sold for as much as $29.9 million, according to Michael Gross, author of ""740 Park,"" billed as the inside story of New York's richest, most prestigious cooperative apartment building. ""In the last 30 years, it has developed a reputation as one of the strictest, hardest to get into, most exclusive,"" Gross told CNN on Thursday. ""740 Park means that you're there. You're it."" Retired jewel thief Walter Shaw, author of ""A License to Steal,"" said he believes the thefts are an inside job. ""Because if they go back to the surveillance tapes and cameras, they're gonna see that they don't recognize anybody that doesn't belong there,"" said Shaw. Shaw was in the business for 30 years and is said to have netted $70 million in goods with his crew, dubbed the ""Dinner Set Crew"" because it robbed folks while they ate in a different part of the house. He served nearly 12 years and was released in 1986 and later produced movies. According to Shaw, he and his team never did ""high-rise"" jobs because there was only one way in -- and one way out. ""I would think it's somebody that knows the building pretty well and knows the shift changes and knows the comings and goings of the maid service or construction being done, and they blended in,"" said Shaw. Gross speculates that whoever robbed the apartments did so by locating each individual apartment's key box. ""Now you've got four unrelated families all during summer vacation -- when no one's around -- (and) someone managed to get in with no signs of break-in. Hello? That means keys. Where are the keys? They're in the key box."" Related: Insurer Lloyd's offers million-dollar reward for clues in Cannes jewel theft .

"(CNN) -- Where there should be excitement there is trepidation. Where there is hope, there is also fear. England expects -- but what it also anticipates is a night of high drama, tension and nails being bitten until they are no longer visible to the human eye. When Roy Hodgson's side take to the turf at the iconic Wembley Stadium, the 'Home of Football', it will attempt to secure a victory which guarantees a place at next year's World Cup. One win is all that separates England from challenging the world's best in Brazil and yet it still seems so far away. Perhaps it's not difficult to understand given the country's history and that painful night 40 years ago when England faltered in such agonizing fashion. As on Tuesday, the opponent will once again be Poland. It was Poland and their goalkeeper, Jan Tomaszewski who was infamously labeled a 'clown' by former Nottingham Forest and Derby manager Brian Clough ahead of the qualifier on October 17 1973, who proved the scourge of the Three Lions. Indeed, it was the Poles who had the last laugh -- claiming a 1-1 draw to progress to the 1974 World Cup finals and leave England desolated. Forget that Poland only had two efforts on goal to England's 36 or that the home side hit the woodwork twice and had four efforts cleared off the line. Instead, that night is remembered as one of the most depressing in the history of English football. Once again it is Poland, which will be roared on by more than 18,000 fans, which stands in England's way -- a proposition which is enough to make England manager Roy Hodgson slightly nervous. ""I'm a worrier. I think anyone who works in football is a worrier,"" Hodgson told reporters. ""It won't be my best night's sleep because at the moment all of my waking thoughts are around England versus Poland. ""On the other hand, I have great faith and trust in the players. I don't think I can be putting a stronger bunch of players, a more confident bunch of players, onto the field. ""But football is not a science. If it was a science and based on logic and science, I think we would be 99% there. ""But it's not, it's a game and things can happen in games that you don't really want to happen and that's what makes you worried. ""It's not that you are worried the team is not capable, it's just that you are worried something untoward might happen."" England has performed inconsistently during its qualifying campaign, holding Ukraine to draws on two occasions, while also finishing level away in Poland and Montenegro. Until Friday's 4-1 win over Montenegro, it had only managed to defeat minnows San Marino and Moldova -- a statistic which has left Tomaszewski unimpressed with England's current generation. ""Back then they (England) were one of the world's best teams, probably even the best,"" Tomaszewski told AFP . ""Now England is weak, weak but they're not falling below a certain level. They could have qualified already, like the Italians or The Netherlands, but they've drawn too many games . ""They (England) are still among the world's best, but for sure now they're not in as good form as 1973. ""But, objectively speaking, they're the best team in the group. ""Something just isn't right with England these days. All the players are fantastic but during a game -- I mean individually these players are nearly the world's best -- when they play together something's off with the communication, it's just not there."" England last failed to qualify for a major tournament in 2008 when it missed out on the European Championship finals following a 3-2 home defeat by Croatia. That defeat signaled the end of Steve McClaren's reign as national manager and left a deep and painful mark which resurfaced when England was humiliated 4-1 at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa by Germany. Should England fail to defeat Poland and Ukraine triumph over San Marino then Hodgson's side will face the lottery of the playoffs. But with the Poles having failed to claim a competitive victory over England in 40 years, Hodgson is in confident mood. ""History's important when it comes to not making political mistakes but I don't think it has any relevance in sport whatsoever,"" added Hodgson. ""Every game's a new game and each Poland team that's played England has been a very different team so, as far as we're concerned, we'll do our job against the Poland we will face."" Spain . It is not just England which needs to gain a result to qualify -- defending champion Spain requires a draw from its final game to book its place in Brazil. Spain faces Georgia knowing that should it slip up then France can steal top spot. But the chance of that happening is remote according to captain Hugo Lloris. ""Spain did the job on Friday (by beating Belarus 2-1) and we don't expect them to fail tomorrow,"" he told a news conference at the Stade de France ahead the game with Finland. ""Yes, we already have the playoffs next month in mind."" France could meet Portugal in the playoffs unless Cristiano Ronaldo's side pull off a huge victory over Luxembourg and Group F leaders Russia lose in Azerbaijan. ""France are the strongest we may face,"" Ronaldo told reporters after being asked about the prospect of the playoffs. ""They are the only ones I do not want to face."" Bosnia . In Group G, Bosnia can book its place at the World Cup for the very first time with victory in Lithuania. Bosnia sits top of the group alongside Greece with 22 points, but enjoys a superior goal difference. Greece faces bottom side Liechtenstein in its final game but Bosnia manager Safet Susic, a former international striker who played for Yugoslavia in the 1982 and 1990 tournaments, is confident of success. ""We are awaiting the game with impatience,"" he told reporters at Sarajevo airport. ""The most important thing is that nobody is suspended or injured and we have had a good rest after beating Liechtenstein. I am optimistic."" Iceland . Iceland is preparing itself for ""the most important game we have ever played"" according to captain Aron Gunnarsson. The nation has never competed at a World Cup but can clinch a playoff spot with victory in Norway. A draw or defeat would be good enough as long as Slovenia do not better their result when they face group winners Switzerland. ""We are young and do not scare easily,"" Cardiff City midfielder Gunnarsson told the UEFA website. ""We have already put pressure on ourselves and now we just have to handle it. We have Norway on Tuesday, which will be the most important game we have ever played. ""The Norwegians will not give us anything, like we wouldn't give them anything. They have nothing to lose so they might play well, but we just have to think about our game, stay cool and everything will be OK."" Turkey . While the Netherlands cantered to top spot in Group D, the race for second place remains wide open. Turkey is in pole position, leading Romania by four on goal difference going into the final matchday. But Turkey faces the Dutch while Romania hosts Estonia. Should Turkey fail to defeat its visitors then Romania can pounce and snatch the playoff place. But if Turkey and Romania both suffer defeats then Hungary could yet sneak in through the backdoor. South America . Chile and Ecuador can both seal their places at next year's tournament Tuesday. A draw between the two teams will be good enough for both to progress. Should there be a positive result then Uruguay could finish fourth with victory over an Argentina side which has already qualified.","England will qualify for the 2014 World Cup with victory over Poland .

"Miami (CNN) -- References to drugs, comments about hazing and pictures of semi-nude women taken from posts on a closed Facebook page have prompted the suspension of Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity on Florida International University's Miami campus. An e-mail containing 70 screen grabs of posts allegedly found on the Facebook page for active members of Pi Kappa Alpha, also known as Pike, were sent to school officials and members of the media, including CNN affiliate WSVN. ""Anyone have a connect for coke, not me, a friends wants, lol,"" says one post, while others mention ""study drugs."" There are offers to sell Adderall and Vyvanse, drugs prescribed to people with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Several postings allegedly made by members of the fraternity make reference to the ""Pike pharmacy."" One lets the group know the ""Pike Pharmacy is on campus all day today again"" and leaves a phone number to call. CNN called that number and every number contained in the posts and was told ""no comment"" by three people. One said, ""I have no idea what's going on"" before hanging up the phone. Although most of the social media chatter in the screen grabs involved talk of drugs and alcohol, there were a few that made reference to hazing, one offering this advice, ""HAZE THE F(*! OUT OF THEM....end of story."" The obscenities in the screen grabs are numerous, as are the derogatory comments, especially those in reference to their female coeds. A few semi-naked pictures of women were included. One of the pictures showed a topless female, with the comment: ""I think she was 17 at the time of the titi pics...LOL."" Florida International University declined CNN's request for an interview but said in a statement that it ""took prompt action and placed the fraternity on interim suspension pending the outcome of investigations by appropriate university departments, including the police."" The board of directors of the Pi Kappa Alpha International Fraternity suspended the FIU chapter over the ""disgraceful, offensive and indefensible"" behavior. ""The immediate decision to suspend by the Supreme Council was made to communicate clearly that this type of behavior is not tolerated,"" Executive Vice President Justin A. Buck said in a statement released Friday. ""It is clear these individuals never had any concept of what Pi Kappa Alpha stands for."" A conduct history of the Pi Kappa Alpha chapter at FIU shows the fraternity is no stranger to discipline investigations. It is currently on probation for an incident in June in which members were accused of interfering with the Office of Orientation and Parent Programs by ""inviting new students to the house and serving alcohol,"" the university said in an e-mail. Ultimately, the fraternity was found ""not responsible"" for dispensing alcohol but was found ""responsible"" on the accusations of interfering, the university said. Over the past five years, this Pi Kappa Alpha chapter was brought up on discipline charges eight times. In April 2010, the fraternity was put on probation when members were caught painting obscene words and pictures on a student's car. Most of the incidents involved alcohol, including a 2008-2009 probation for providing alcohol to minors. While on probation, the fraternity was disciplined for having a party with alcohol. For this infraction, Pi Kappa Alpha was suspended from August 2011 until April 2013, but the sanctions were modified on appeal and the suspension ended a year earlier. This time, it may not be just the fraternity that will be disciplined. Police are looking into the possibility of criminal charges if people who posted on the page are found to have committed any crimes.","NEW: Fraternity headquarters suspends chapter at Florida International University .

"Washington (CNN) -- The following is the prepared transcript of House Speaker John Boehner's speech Monday night on debt reduction talks: . Good evening. I'm John Boehner. I serve as Speaker of the whole House -- of the members of both parties that you elect. These are difficult times in the life of our nation. Millions are looking for work, have been for some time, and the spending binge going on in Washington is a big part of the reason why. Before I served in Congress, I ran a small business in Ohio. I was amazed at how different Washington DC operated than every business in America. Where most American business make the hard choices to pay their bills and live within their means, in Washington more spending and more debt is business as usual. I've got news for Washington -- those days are over. President Obama came to Congress in January and requested business as usual -- yet another routine increase in the national debt limit -- we in the House said ""not so fast."" Here was the president, asking for the largest debt increase in American history, on the heels of the largest spending binge in American history. Obama's speech: Compromise needed now . Here's what we got for that spending binge: a massive health care bill that most Americans never asked for. A ""stimulus"" bill that was more effective in producing material for late-night comedians than it was in producing jobs. And a national debt that has gotten so out of hand it has sparked a crisis without precedent in my lifetime or yours. The United States cannot default on its debt obligations. The jobs and savings of too many Americans are at stake. What we told the president in January was this: the American people will not accept an increase in the debt limit without significant spending cuts and reforms. And over the last six months, we've done our best to convince the president to partner with us to do something dramatic to change the fiscal trajectory of our country. . .something that will boost confidence in our economy, renew a measure of faith in our government, and help small businesses get back on track. Last week, the House passed such a plan, and with bipartisan support. It's called the ""Cut, Cap, and Balance"" Act. It CUTS and CAPS government spending and paves the way for a Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution, which we believe is the best way to stop Washington from spending money it doesn't have. Before we even passed the bill in the House, the president said he would veto it. I want you to know I made a sincere effort to work with the president to identify a path forward that would implement the principles of Cut, Cap, & Balance in a manner that could secure bipartisan support and be signed into law. I gave it my all. Unfortunately, the president would not take yes for an answer. Even when we thought we might be close on an agreement, the president's demands changed. The president has often said we need a ""balanced"" approach -- which in Washington means: we spend more. . .you pay more. Having run a small business, I know those tax increases will destroy jobs. The president is adamant that we cannot make fundamental changes to our entitlement programs. As the father of two daughters, I know these programs won't be there for them and their kids unless significant action is taken now. The sad truth is that the president wanted a blank check six months ago, and he wants a blank check today. That is just not going to happen. You see, there is no stalemate in Congress. The House has passed a bill to raise the debt limit with bipartisan support. And this week, while the Senate is struggling to pass a bill filled with phony accounting and Washington gimmicks, we will pass another bill -- one that was developed with the support of the bipartisan leadership of the U.S. Senate. Obviously, I expect that bill can and will pass the Senate, and be sent to the President for his signature. If the President signs it, the 'crisis' atmosphere he has created will simply disappear. The debt limit will be raised. Spending will be cut by more than one trillion dollars, and a serious, bipartisan committee of the Congress will begin the hard but necessary work of dealing with the tough challenges our nation faces. The individuals doing this work will not be outsiders, but elected representatives of the people, doing the job they were elected to do as outlined in the Constitution. Those decisions should be made based on how they will affect people who are struggling to get a job, not how they affect some politician's chances of getting re-elected. This debate isn't about President Obama and House Republicans ... it isn't about Congress and the White House ... it's about what's standing between the American people and the future we seek for ourselves and our families. You know, I've always believed, the bigger government, the smaller the people. And right now, we have a government so big and so expensive it's sapping the drive of our people and keeping our economy from running at full capacity. The solution to this crisis is not complicated: if you're spending more money than you're taking in, you need to spend less of it. There is no symptom of big government more menacing than our debt. Break its grip, and we begin to liberate our economy and our future. We are up to the task, and I hope President Obama will join us in this work. God bless you and your families, and God bless America.","Washington's days of spending and piling up debts are over, Boehner said .

House will pass a bill this week that can and will get through the Senate, Boehner said ."
"Washington (CNN) -- House Republicans have hired a prominent conservative attorney to defend the federal Defense of Marriage Act in a pending lawsuit, legal sources say, and will make an effort to divert money from the Justice Department to fund its high-profile fight. House Speaker John Boehner disclosed the legal and political strategy in a letter Monday to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. The Obama administration, which normally would defend federal laws in judicial disputes, announced last month it believed the Defense of Marriage Act, often referred to as DOMA, to be unconstitutional. The law defines marriage for federal purposes as unions only between a man and woman. Boehner said that with the Justice Department not participating, he had ""no choice"" but to act unilaterally. ""The burden of defending DOMA, and the resulting costs associated with any litigation that would have otherwise been born (sic) by DOJ (The Department of Justice), has fallen to the House,"" Boehner said. ""Obviously, DOJ's decision results in DOJ no longer needing the funds it would have otherwise expended defending the constitutionality of DOMA. It is my intent that those funds be diverted to the House for reimbursement of any costs incurred by and associated with the House, and not DOJ, defending DOMA."" Such a move would require Senate approval, an unlikely prospect since Democrats control that chamber. Boehner will probably end up finding money for the legal fight from other discretionary and non-discretionary spending sources, according to legal experts. There was no indication just how much the legal fight could eventually cost. In response to Boehner's letter, Pelosi, D-California, asked the speaker how much the legal defense of DOMA would cost taxpayers. ""I am requesting that you disclose the cost of hiring outside counsel for the 12 cases where DOMA is being challenged,"" Pelosi's letter said. She also asked for details on the reported hiring of Paul D. Clement, a former solicitor general, specifically when a contract was signed and why a copy was not provided to Democrats on the Committee on House Administration. Legal sources say the House Republican leadership hired Clement, a Washington appellate attorney, to defend the law. He filed a brief Monday in a pending case from New York, where a lesbian received an estate tax bill of more than $360,000 after her longtime partner and legal wife had died. Clement is a former solicitor general under President George W. Bush, serving from 2005 to 2008. It was his job to defend federal laws and executive actions in court, similar to what he will be doing now as a private lawyer on retainer. He was mentioned at one time as a possible Supreme Court nominee. Separately, he also is representing more than two dozens states in their lawsuit against the administration over the sweeping health care reform law passed by Congress last year. That case is pending in a federal appeals court in Atlanta. In the Defense of Marriage Act dispute, groups on both sides of the issue noted the highly charged political aspects. ""Not only are House Republican leaders defending the indefensible, they've brought in a high-priced attorney to deny federal recognition to loving, married couples,"" said Joe Solmonese, president of the Human Rights Campaign. ""Speaker Boehner appears ready to go to great lengths, and the great expense of a high-power law firm, to try to score some cheap political points on the backs of same-sex couples."" But conservative groups applauded the move. ""At last we have a legal eagle on this case who actually wants to win in court,"" said Brian Brown, president of the National Organization for Marriage. ""Thanks to Speaker Boehner's actions, President Obama's attempt to sabotage the legal defense of DOMA is not going to work."" President Barack Obama on February 23 ordered the Justice Department to stop defending the constitutionality of the law. ""The president has concluded that given a number of factors, including a documented history of discrimination, classifications based on sexual orientation should be subject to a more heightened standard of scrutiny,"" said Attorney General Eric Holder. The key provision in the law ""fails to meet that standard and is therefore unconstitutional."" Obama had previously expressed his personal opposition to the Defense of Marriage Act but had never stated an opinion relating to its constitutionality. Holder's chief spokesman said the department had no comment on Boehner's moves. Two pending lawsuits from New York and Connecticut challenge the law. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which includes both states, is the only federal circuit to have never decided the basic legal question of whether a law discriminates against gay men and lesbians. The Defense of Marriage Act was passed in 1996 by the GOP-controlled Congress and signed into law by President Bill Clinton. It bars federal recognition of same-sex marriages and says states cannot be forced to recognize such marriages allowed in other states. The New York legal fight was prompted by Edith ""Edie"" Windsor, who lived with her female partner, Thea Spyer, for more than four decades. They married out-of-state in 2007, but neither the federal government nor their home state of New York recognized the legal union. Spyer died and left her estate to Windsor, who was then forced to pay taxes on the money because she was not considered a legal spouse. In July, a federal judge in Massachusetts, in a separate case, became the first to rule part of the Defense of Marriage Act unconstitutional. District Judge Joseph Tauro said that ""irrational prejudice plainly never constitutes a legitimate government interest."" The administration's decision comes on the heels of other major developments in the struggle over gay and lesbian rights. In December, Obama signed legislation that will repeal the controversial ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy and bring an end to the ban on openly gay men and women serving in the armed forces. Courts in California are considering a legal challenge to Proposition 8, an initiative narrowly approved by that state's voters in 2008. It defines marriage as a union between a man and a woman. Either one of those cases could reach the Supreme Court in coming months, perhaps in time to become a major issue during the 2012 election year. Same-sex marriage is legal in five states -- Connecticut, Iowa, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Vermont -- and in the District of Columbia. Civil unions virtually equivalent to marriage are permitted in New Jersey, while several other states offer more limited civil unions or partnerships. The New York case is Windsor v. U.S. (1:10-cv-08435).","NEW: Pelosi asks what the legal fight will cost taxpayers .

"(CNN) -- Leave it to a scientist to spoil the fun about a cartoon fish. ""Finding Nemo"" was the Oscar-winning, box office animated smash about a clownfish who goes after his young son, who's been plucked from the sea and ends up in a fish tank in a dentist's office. Rare is the child who hasn't seen the movie. So wouldn't it be something if the film or its upcoming sequel accurately depicted the life of a clownfish, writes Patrick Cooney of The Fisheries Blog. Cooney knows his stuff. He's a fish biologist at North Carolina State University with 15 years of experience. His blog post Monday wondered if it would be so bad if Disney showed how clownfish often change sex. Yes, in real life, Nemo might become a woman. Clownfish are sequential hermaphrodites, which helps keeps the species going by keeping the number of adult females and males fairly equal. All young clownfish become male. And after they pair off, the dominant dude becomes a female. (Spoiler alert) This means that if Nemo's mom is killed (as are most of the clownfish) and Nemo hangs out with his dad after they are reunited, then one of them is going to become a woman (likely dad). Or if dad gets fished, then Nemo might become a girl when he pairs off with another male. ""Although a much different storyline, it still sounds like a crazy adventure!"" Cooney writes below the headline ""Finding Nemo lied to your kids."" Actually it sounds like he was just trying to use ""Finding Nemo"" for a little fish education. ""We are just having some fun here pointing out the crazy life cycle of clownfish while associating it with something people are familiar with...Finding Nemo,"" the blog says in the comments (which correctly point out that fish don't actually talk). Perhaps there's still time the to work the lesson into the sequel, ""Finding Dory,"" which is due in 2015.","""Finding Nemo"" is about a clownfish's quest to rescue his son .
In real life, one clownfish changes sex when they pair up .

"(CNN) -- Winning a gold medal is the pinnacle of any Olympic athlete's career, and most have to be happy for the chance to participate on sport's biggest stage. For Nicol David, however, time is running out. The Malaysian is the top-ranked women's squash player and a six-time world champion, but she has never competed at the Games. So, at the age of 28, she is trying to rectify the situation before it's too late. Squash has never been an Olympic sport, and it failed in its bid to be one of the 36 included at London 2012 -- and in Rio in four years' time, when its application was rejected while golf and rugby succeeded. However, David is fronting a campaign which aims to secure squash a place in the 2020 program and thus achieve her lifelong ambition. ""After the world championships last year I was asked how much I wanted to be part of the Games,"" she told CNN. ""I said I would trade all six of my world titles for just one Olympic gold medal. Every world title means the world to me, so that's how important the Olympics is in my heart."" But, due to the way the International Olympic Committee (IOC) decides which sports enter the Games, the dreams of an athlete in another discipline must be shattered for David's to come true. In order to maintain the Olympics' prestige, and ensure it is still feasible for one city to host all of the events, the IOC will only introduce a new sport if an existing one is removed from the program. ""You have a long list of sports trying to get onto the program because it is their one way to showcase their sport to the world,"" explains former IOC marketing director Michael Payne. ""The IOC undertakes a very detailed technical analysis to understand the popularity of the sport, the number of players, infrastructure, TV, media and then finally takes a vote to decide which new sport is welcomed onto the program."" There is one man who knows more than most what it takes to convince the IOC of a sport's Olympic worth. Mike Lee is the chairman of Verocom, an organization which has successfully overseen campaigns to bring the Games to Rio in 2016, the Winter Olympics to Pyongchang in 2018 and the FIFA World Cup to Qatar in 2022. Lee and his team also navigated a course which gained rugby sevens acceptance into the 2016 Games. In makes perfect sense, then, for Verocom to spearhead squash's Olympic bid. ""You have to look in considerable detail at, not just the sport itself, what it might offer to the Olympic Games, what it brings to the Olympic program,"" said Lee, former director of communications and public affairs for London 2012's successful bid. ""What do you offer to the Olympic experience? What is it your sport will do to enhance the Games, in a way which is also in line with the spirit and the values of the Games?"" In a manner of speaking, squash has been sexed up in a bid to make itself more attractive to the IOC, making vibrant changes to the courts and apparatus. ""The sport has worked very hard to innovate, to make it much more fan and broadcast friendly, from all-glass courts to the camera positions, to the use of a video review system and a white ball,"" he said. ""They're now experimenting with glass floors. This is a sport that has moved itself considerably over the last few years. It has been on the basis of making itself more friendly to the spectators at the event or the viewers on television."" A wide variety of sports are covered within the Games, from BMX to equestrian, catering to tastes and interests from all over the world. If squash is to enter the ""greatest show on Earth,"" it will have to fend off fierce competition. ""Softball and baseball, which came out of the Games for London, karate, roller sports, sports climbing, wakeboarding, wushu (a martial art) and the sport which comes out of the Games,"" replied World Squash CEO Andrew Shelley when asked about its rivals. ""We've bid twice before. Whilst we weren't perhaps ready, we had a lot of very good advice from the IOC and we've learned a lot from them. ""This time the process is very clear. There is one place available due to the taking out of a sport by the IOC after the Games in London. ""Our sport is scrutinized and evaluated alongside all the other candidates. If we're fortunate, we come out on top at the meeting in Buenos Aires in 2013."" Squash will hope to follow in the footsteps of rugby sevens and golf, which have been added to the program for the Games' South American debut in Rio. ""Rugby sevens was looked at as a very professional campaign,"" Lee said. ""One of the keys was how a tournament over two or three days would enhance the Olympic Games. ""It's not difficult to stage, as long as you've got stadia. It doesn't have to be a rugby stadium, it can be played in many types of stadiums. It's something which is very attractive to young people and the party atmosphere which goes with it."" So what would squash bring to the Games which is not already on offer? ""Squash is a worldwide sport,"" Shelley said. ""We have world champions from all continents and it is played in 185 countries. It is a sport we feel will add something to the Olympics, as well as being a great opportunity for our athletes. ""There was an IOC official many years ago who told me, 'You've got to wait until the train comes into the station and stops. When it does, you've got to be ready.' We're ready, we're just waiting for the train now."" Even if squash is given the green light in Buenos Aires next year, it may come too late for David to reap the rewards of her enthusiastic work. But, whatever the future has in store for her, she is determined to see squash elevated to the pantheon of Olympic sports. ""It's a dream of mine to be part of the Games,"" she said. ""I'm going to do whatever it takes to get in there. I want to do whatever I can to get there and get squash in there as well. ""Whatever happens, I'll keep working hard because I want to see squash in there someday. If it is not this time, hopefully the next time.""","Squash is one of the sports bidding to be part of the 2020 Olympic Games .

"(CNN) -- In the movie ""Into the Wild,"" a young man rejects society and disappears. Now, Johnathan Croom's father fears his teenage son has done the same thing. David Croom of Apache Junction, Arizona, hasn't seen his 18-year-old son in more than a week. And he's worried. Johnathan's green Honda CRV was found abandoned on a lonely road in the quiet country town of Riddle, Oregon, on Wednesday, two days after he was supposed to start college at Mesa Community College. He was last seen at a friend's home in Seattle, where he'd been visiting. His father assumed he was driving back to Arizona through Washington and Oregon. ""He's never been in the wild before,"" David Croom said. But he says his son has been reading Jon Krakauer's 1996 nonfiction book and watching the movie adaptation. Krakauer's account of the life of Chris McCandless has taken on an almost cult status among countless free spirits who dream of shedding the trappings of modern life and living off the land. ""There were similarities,"" Croom said of his son's disappearance. McCandless ""left all his stuff in the car and took off. The problem with that movie is, he doesn't make it. It's a fatal end to the story."" In the book, McCandless cut off communication with his parents and traveled to Alaska, where he lived in a school bus before dying of starvation. Like McCandless, Johnathan Croom is apparently traveling with very few belongings: perhaps a small backpack and his phone, his father says. Left behind in the Honda was the teen's ID card, plus a sweatshirt, blanket and jug of water -- things someone might need to survive in the wilderness. ""It's not against the law for an adult man to decide he wants to get lost or take off,"" said Dwes Hutson, public information officer for the Douglas County Sheriff's Office. ""We have nothing to suggest this is foul play, nothing to suggest he is in danger. We do have people down today doing some searches. I don't want to mislead you and suggest there is some massive search going on, because there is not."" The teen has been a main topic of conversation in Riddle, a logging and ranching community of about 1,300 with no traditional grocery store and no movie theater. People are searching their property, says one resident, a longtime rancher who asked that he not be identified. ""There's nothing that makes sense."" Riddle is dozens of miles from the nearest wilderness area, residents say. ""It's 2ÃÂ½ miles from the major interstate; it's right in town in Riddle,"" Huston said of where Croom's car was found. ""There are houses and people, and it's well-populated, so if he wanted to do an 'Into the Wild,' it wasn't the appropriate place."" If he is in the wild, living off the land might be possible. Overnight low temperatures are in the 50s, and there would be some food and water supply, residents say. ""There's berries and lots of places to get water,"" said Scott Berney, who sells fishing, camping and hunting supplies at Northwest Outdoors in nearby Roseburg. ""Yeah, you could survive."" Johnathan Croom's camping experience is limited at best, his father says, not much more than camping once or twice with his car. ""I need to hear your voice"": that was the content of a text message Croom sent to his son on last week when he ""started to feel funny"" about not hearing from Johnathan. ""We got a text back from his friend (in Seattle) saying, 'he left, and I can't get a hold of him.' "" During the past six months, Johnathan Croom's interest in the movie seems to have grown, says his father. ""He's been watching the movie a lot,"" he said. ""Maybe he said, 'I want to do it.' That's our theory, because he kept talking about the movie."" Several reports describing travelers with an apparent interest in McCandless and the abandoned ""Magic Bus"" parked near Healy, Alaska, outside Denali National Park have surfaced recently. In May, a police helicopter reportedly rescued three German men who had hiked into the wilderness looking for the bus. An Oklahoma teen inspired by the movie reportedly went missing in Oregon in March after telling his parents he wanted to ""live in the wild."" In 2010, a Swiss woman reportedly drowned in an Alaska river during her trek to visit the famous bus. Now joining searchers on foot and driving up logging roads in and around Riddle, David Croom hopes McCandless' story may hold some answers. ""One of the keys to that movie is that no one ever went looking for him. We are trying to change the story by injecting ourselves in it and going to find him. He can't be too far away at this point."" Police cautioned that nobody may know the reason Croom disappeared. ""The 'Into the Wild' came from his dad,"" Hutson said. ""I think his dad has that information, and I don't know, again, if that's what he wanted to do, he kind of picked the wrong place. ""There are plenty of wilderness areas in Douglas County, but not where he's at."" Teams looking for the teen have tried using dogs ""but couldn't get a scent,"" his father said. ""I got a phone call from a logger who said he saw a young man with the same grin as my son on one of the logging roads, so a bunch of local volunteers are going to blanket the area."" But help is scarce in the small town. David Croom has appealed to local search organizations for assistance. ""They are doing the best they can, every drop of sweat, every footstep, I just wish we can do more,"" he said. ""Time is ticking away. It's already been a week. ""My son is a kid, two states away, out in the wild with shorts and a T-shirt.""","NEW: Law enforcement official says nothing to suggest foul play or danger .

"(CNN) -- New Hampshire health officials say they're monitoring eight patients for signs of a fatal brain disease after medical equipment was found to have been contaminated by proteins that cause the ailment. The equipment had been used to operate on a patient now suspected of having Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD), the state Department of Health and Human Services announced Wednesday. The now-deceased patient had undergone neurosurgery at Catholic Medical Center in Manchester, and normal sterilization practice doesn't get rid of the proteins, known as prions, the health department said. ""Our concern is with the health and well-being of the eight patients who may have been exposed to CJD,"" Dr. Joseph Pepe, the hospital's CEO, said in a statement issued with the state agency Wednesday. ""We will work closely with these families to help them in any way possible, even though the risk of infection is extremely low."" An autopsy to confirm the illness -- which differs from variant CJD commonly known as ""mad cow disease"" -- was being conducted at the National Prion Disease Pathology Surveillance Center, the hospital said. The only way to confirm the illness is with an autopsy. ""CMC has notified all of these patients about their potential risk,"" the health department said. ""The general public and any other patients at CMC and their employees are not at any risk."" A similar incident occurred at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta in 2004, leading to 98 brain and spinal surgery patients being monitored for possible exposure to CJD. The CDC says no cases of the disease have been linked to the use of contaminated medical equipment since 1976. Most medical devices are sterilized by heat, but the World Health Organization recommends the use of a caustic chemical like sodium hydroxide to disinfect equipment that may have come in contact with tissues that could cause CJD. CJD strikes fewer than 400 people a year in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Victims show signs of memory loss and cognitive difficulty early on; the ailment is ""rapidly progressive and always fatal,"" the CDC says. Florida boy dies from brain-eating parasite .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Justice Department will not conduct a civil rights investigation in the case of a teenager found dead in a rolled-up mat at his southern Georgia high school, a spokesperson for that agency said Wednesday. Kendrick Johnson, 17, was discovered dead last January 11 headfirst in a rolled wrestling mat in the Lowndes County High School gymnasium in Valdosta, Georgia. The Justice Department's criminal division is aware of concerns about Kendrick's death, but after reviewing the investigative file, it determined there is not ""sufficient indication of a civil rights violation to authorize a civil rights investigation,"" according to the agency's spokesperson. ""We have discussed this matter with U.S. Attorney Moore, and his office is continuing to monitor and evaluate this matter, including the second autopsy report,"" the spokesperson added, referring to U.S. Attorney Michael Moore whose jurisdiction includes Valdosta. That second autopsy report, which was obtained by CNN on Tuesday, found that Kendrick died as the result of ""unexplained, apparent non-accidental, blunt force trauma."" This report directly contradicts an autopsy conducted by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation that determined that Johnson's death was the result of positional asphyxia. The Lowndes County Sheriff's Office ruled that his death was accidental. Questioning that cause of death, Kendrick's family sent copies of the second autopsy report to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, the U.S . Attorney for Georgia's Middle District and Lowndes County Coroner -- as well as the U.S. Justice Department's criminal division -- for review. ""I want to do the right thing by the people and the county and all concerned; I'm just not sure we have enough information,"" Lowndes County Coroner Bill Watson said earlier this week. ""I'm not about to refute anybody's findings because I'm not a doctor."" On May 1, a judge granted the Johnsons' request to exhume their son's body in order to conduct -- at their expense -- the independent autopsy. That autopsy, done on June 15, found Kendrick had suffered blunt force trauma to the right neck and soft tissues ""consistent with inflicted injury."" ""This is unexplained -- most very, very likely inflicted, as opposed to something he caused himself, inflicted by another -- and therefore needs to be investigated as an open homicide investigation,"" said Dr. William R. Anderson with Forensic Dimensions in Heathrow, Florida, who conducted the autopsy. He characterized authorities failure to pursue the case as ""mystifying."" The initial patient care report, written by EMTs with he South Georgia Medical Center Mobile Healthcare Service on the day Kendrick was found, pointed to ""bruising (on) the right side jaw."" Yet a January 25 report from the Valdosta-Lowndes County Regional Crime Laboratory cited ""no signs of blunt force trauma on Johnson's face or body."" The autopsy results released May 2 by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation identified ""no significant injuries."" Speaking earlier this week, Moore said his office has been working on Kendrick's case ""for some time,"" though it had not launched a formal investigation. ""There are some members of the community that question the result,"" Moore said. ""I want to make sure members of the community and the family and everyone involved has confidence in my work and my decision.""","Kendrick Johnson, 17, was found dead in a rolled-up gym mat at his Georgia high school .

"(CNN) -- Ten years ago, the adjective ""Tarantinoesque"" was an integral tool in any critic's arsenal. It seemed like every other young filmmaker was tramping the bloody, funny trail blazed by ""Reservoir Dogs"" and ""Pulp Fiction""; rueful hitmen lurked around every corner. Brendan Gleeson and Colin Farrell star as hitman waiting in picturesque Belgium in ""In Bruges."" The fad faded, and the shine has gone off the Tarantino brand name, but his influence is right back with a vengeance in playwright Martin McDonagh's first feature, ""In Bruges."" The film is more Tarantinoesque than anything Quentin Tarantino himself has made in years. The trouble is, that's not so much a compliment now. It's more of a mixed blessing. Colin Farrell plays a slow-witted, volatile Irish hitman, Ray, exiled to the medieval city of Bruges along with his partner-in-crime, Ken (Brendan Gleeson), after their latest job has gone awry. Why Bruges? That's what Ray wants to know. Belgium is not high on his list of places to see, and the charms of this ""fairy-tale"" city are lost on him, to put it mildly: ""If I'd grown up on a farm and was retarded, Bruges might impress me. But I didn't, so it doesn't,"" he explains. Ken, on the other hand, is enchanted. Older and wiser, he burrows into his guidebook and laps up the ancient churches, the canals and cobbled streets. In any case, he reasons, the boss wouldn't have sent them here just to lie low; there must be a fresh assignment in the offing. ""Shoot first. Sightsee later,"" is a neat marketing line, but it's the reverse of McDonagh's agenda. Prettily photographed by Eigil Bryld, ""In Bruges"" should do wonders for the Belgian tourist biz. For half an hour or so the movie ambles along on the strength of its quirky odd couple pairing, taking in the sites: the twitchy, stir-crazy Ray reluctantly bowing to Ken's sit-back-and-wait strategy. Farrell -- who always seems more energized when he's acting in his native Irish accent -- plays the none-too-bright Ray as a big kid, roiling between hedonism and despondency. Gleeson is more than an effective foil. His somber decency is practically beatific; all the grace notes are Ken's. McDonagh already has an Academy Award under his belt for the short ""Six Shooter,"" but he's better known for savage, provocative plays like ""A Skull in Connemara"" and ""The Lieutenant of Inishmore."" His first feature has spurts of cavalier violence and great gales of unfettered bile and profanity -- most of it played for shock and laughter. A racist monologue by an inebriated dwarf, for instance, or a couple of comically virulent anti-American diatribes seem designed purely to raise hackles and the stakes, as if the script had been written on a whim and a dare. The writer's bravado can be exhilarating, but frequently the excess is all there is to hang on to: McDonagh's self-conscious, clumsy direction doesn't smooth over some ramshackle plotting. Still, he also wants to land a few kicks where it hurts. Ray has more blood on his hands than he can bear. If Bruges is ""a hellhole,"" it's a hell of his own making -- he stares intently on Bosch's ""Last Judgment"" to hammer home the point. There's an Irish stew of Catholic guilt and expiation bubbling away in the background, and McDonagh ladles it on thick in a climax that plunges headlong into surrealism and allegory, with even the worst of the gangsters harping on an antiquated chivalric code. (The top dog is played by Ralph Fiennes, seemingly intent on out-mugging Ben Kingsley's fearsome Don Logan from ""Sexy Beast."") It has to be said, none of these men are remotely plausible professional killers, and little that they say or do would make sense in the real world. In Bruges -- well, maybe. For a spell, at least, McDonagh allows us to entertain that fancy. But for all his movie's tough talk, it's a sometimes slipshod construction. ""In Bruges"" is rated R and runs 101 minutes.

"(CNN) -- The primary cause for hundreds of recent dolphin deaths along the East Coast is likely a virus, and there's no way to stop its spread right now, federal officials say. The virus, the cetacean morbillivirus, is similar to measles in humans or canine distemper in dogs, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. After consulting with disease experts and conducting tests from five affected states, NOAA found that 32 dolphins were either ""suspect or confirmed positive for mobillivirus."" The five affected states are New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland and Virginia. North Carolina has also seen an increase in dolphin strandings, according to NOAA. As of Sunday, there have been 488 dolphin strandings from New York to North Carolina, more than 300 dolphins above the annual average. The strandings, where dolphins have gotten stuck in shallow water or have washed up on shores, are over nine times the historical average for July and August in the mid-Atlantic region. Some stranded are found alive, but most are found dead, with many in a state of advanced decomposition, according to data published on NOAA's website. In Virginia, at least 164 dead dolphins have been found this year, said Joan M. Barns, public relations manager for the Virginia Aquarium in Virginia Beach. Seventy-eight have washed ashore so far in August, she said. There is no vaccination for the mobillivirus, but additional testing on other animals is underway. Scientists at the NOAA hope that learning more about the virus will help them address factors that may facilitate its spread. While the virus is generally spread through the air or through contact with other animals, it is not infectious to humans. On August 8, NOAA issued an Unusual Mortality Event in response to the high number of deaths. The declaration brought special federal attention to the deaths as something that serves as an indicator of ocean health and may give ""insight into larger environmental issues which may also have implications for human health and welfare,"" according to NOAA's website. The UME declaration for the mid-Atlantic bottlenose dolphins is one of 60 that the agency has issued since it was established under the Marine Mammal Protection Act in 1991. Causes, including infections, biotoxins, human intervention and malnutrition, have been determined for the 29 of those cases. CNN's Brad Lendon, Brian Todd and Dugald McConnell contributed to this report.","Hundreds of dolphins have died along the East Coast .

"(CNN) -- President Obama looked uncomfortable as he stood before the nation on Saturday, announcing that he would ask for a congressional resolution of support to use limited force in Syria. Obama, who won the hearts and souls of many Americans in the 2008 election with his trenchant criticism of President George W. Bush's war in Iraq, now finds himself leading a controversial and ambiguous military operation that has little support, in Congress or abroad. Asking Congress for a resolution of support is an important step in making this decision, but what will matter much more is how the operation unfolds. In the best-case scenario, limited air strikes would achieve their intended goals and the president could bring the operation to an swift end, shifting his focus back to domestic debates. Presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton, as well as Obama with Libya in 2011, learned that in the modern era this outcome is possible. In the worst-case scenario, the situation will deteriorate and overshadow anything else. The violence in Syria could intensify, forcing the United States to increase its presence and become embroiled in a deadly and costly war. Obama is not the first president to become involved in an international conflict that forces him to make decisions that fundamentally contradict what he hoped to stand for. Syria: Who wants what after chemical weapons horror . In 1917, Woodrow Wilson sent U.S. troops into World War I after having won the admiration of progressive activists during his successful run as a peace candidate the previous year. World War I proved to be highly controversial. Wilson alienated progressives through his crackdown on anti-war movements and dismissal of civil liberties. The brutality of the war disillusioned many citizens and the rationale behind U.S. involvement always remained unclear. The president's inability to persuade the Senate to ratify the peace treaty ended his term in failure. In 1964, Lyndon Johnson wanted to be the domestic president who finished the New Deal. Johnson initially took a hawkish stand on Vietnam, with the intention of insulating himself from right-wing attacks about being weak on national security and with the hope of keeping the U.S. out of a bigger war through firm action at the outset. He always feared suffering the fate of President Harry Truman, whose political strength plummeted after China fell to communism in 1949 and the United States became bogged down in a stalemate in Korea. But Johnson's strategy didn't work. The Vietnam War continued to expand and gradually dwarfed Johnson's huge domestic accomplishments. He found himself bogged down in a quagmire, much worse than Truman. Upon his election in 1976, Jimmy Carter promised to rebuild America's faith in government after Watergate and Vietnam. Carter promised to offer new approaches to domestic policy that avoided the militaristic record of his Cold War predecessors. He promoted human rights as a centerpiece of international policy and signed the Panama Canal treaties that he hoped would rebuild the image of the United States in the region. Carter also continued to try to ease strained relations with the Soviet Union, pushing for the ratification of the SALT II arms agreements. But all of his efforts ended in November 1979 when Iranian revolutionaries took American hostages. Then the Soviets invaded Afghanistan in December 1980. Carter was forced to shift to the right by calling for increased troop presence in the Persian Gulf and higher defense spending among NATO allies. He disappointed Democratic supporters, while never winning the backing of opponents who believed that he was a failed president. Most recently, George W. Bush found himself in a similar predicament. When Bush ran for office, evidence suggests he didn't want to become involved in prolonged and costly international operations. He had criticized Bill Clinton's ""nation-building"" efforts and said that the United States had to be very restrained in using its military power. Bush was a politician who cared most about domestic policy. He wanted to re-energize the Republican Party around issues like education reform and the liberalization of immigration laws. But 9/11 changed everything, shifting the national agenda to foreign policy. Bush focused his efforts on fighting against al Qaeda, and on a war in Afghanistan to bring down the Taliban regime that harbored terrorists. Then, when he and his advisers decided to go to war in Iraq, he moved on a path that would be disastrous. The war damaged his presidential legacy and eroded the positive feelings many Americans had developed about his leadership after the horrendous attacks on 9/11. Then Sen. Barack Obama defeated Sen. John McCain in 2008, due in large part to his outspoken opinions against the war -- both its faulty rationale and the way in which the president ignored Congress and international opinion. President Obama now finds himself at a potential crossroads. The initial rollout of this plan has been highly problematic. The administration has failed to build international support for this action and has offered a shifting set of reasons for using force, a strategy that has reminded many Americans of the buildup to Iraq. Obama, who has been such a strong supporter of congressional involvement, seemed to back into announcing that he would approach the House and Senate only when he had no other choice. Even though an operation in Syria is unlikely to grow to the scale and scope of the bigger conflicts that the United States has been through, it is crucial that Obama handle this situation in the right way, learning from the mistakes of his predecessors. He needs to provide the strongest possible evidence that Syria was responsible for the chemical weapons and make it clear to the public that he does have a plan about the mission in this war. So, what exactly are Obama's options on Syria? He needs to marshal public support behind the operation without resorting to scare tactics. He needs to allow legislators to have a healthy debate on what to do, if there is no imminent threat. If he does, and the operation goes relatively well, Obama can come out of this predicament in relatively good shape and possibly complete work on issues like immigration reform. If he doesn't, Obama knows that his presidency, and his party, will be paying the consequences for many years. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer.","President Obama won support in the 2008 election with his criticism of the war in Iraq .

"(CNN) -- The eyes of the world are on the U.S. Congress this week and next. Unlike resolutions about naming a post office, honoring the 2013 World Series champion Boston Red Sox or defunding Obamacare, members of Congress also take votes that test their consciences and prompt them to examine what they believe because the right vote might not be the one that is politically expedient or representative of the current public mood. Our elected representatives will vote on whether to authorize the president to use military force in Syria, where according to U.S. and British intelligence, the regime of Bashar al-Assad defied an international norm and used sarin gas to murder roughly 1,400 of its own citizens, including more than 400 children. The American people, weary from more than a decade of war, are rightfully skeptical of any plan to get involved in a civil war that already has claimed the lives of more than 100,000. At times like this, I think about the words of my former boss, Sen. Ted Kennedy, who 11 years ago this month on the precipice of the Iraq War said, ""There is a difference between honest public dialogue and partisan appeals. There is a difference between questioning policy and questioning motives. ""There are Republicans and Democrats who support the immediate use of force -- and Republicans and Democrats who have raised doubts and dissented. In this serious time for America and many American families, no one should poison the public square by attacking the patriotism of opponents, or by assailing proponents as more interested in the cause of politics than in the merits of their cause. I reject this, as should we all."" Voting your conscience -- standing up for what you believe in -- is not only the safest way to ensure you can articulate a defense for your vote, but it's also your duty as an elected official. This crime committed by al-Assad's government, and belief that inaction could lead more countries to use chemical weapons and put our security in peril, has forced a president who said he ""was elected to end wars"" into the unlikely position of advocating for military action. By seeking the authorization of Congress, the president did his part to restore the power to the people, or, specifically, to their elected representatives. Like Kennedy, I, too, would like to reject the notion that Republicans or Democrats in Congress would seize upon this vote to tally political points or pad their campaign finances. Pacifist Democrats or libertarian Republicans may vote against the authorization because, after more than a decade of war, they don't think the United States should intervene. Others on both sides of the aisle will vote for it because they believe our country has a role to play in holding dictators accountable who use weapons of mass destruction in violation of a standard adhered to by 98% of the world's population. Both votes should be votes of conscience. Unfortunately, last week we saw a congressman accused of fundraising off his position switch, a presidential hopeful suspected of reversing his stance to please his party's base and remembrances of former presidential contenders who were tarnished by voting for a war. For those elected officials who are concerned about how his or her vote will impact their next election or their future presidential pursuits, I promise you two things: Voters will respect your decision if it is made out of duty of office, rather than personal ambition, and whatever you think the politics are today might not be the same politics a year from now, and will most certainly not be the politics three years from now. There is an eternity between now and the next presidential election, and the most important aspect you can retain between now and that first presidential primary vote is authenticity -- don't put your finger to the wind, vote out of spite for this president or overcorrect the lessons of the fateful vote in 2002 to authorize the Iraq War. Do what you think is right, and the politics will follow. On ""Crossfire,"" in Congress and in the public discourse, I am looking forward to the thoughtful discussion about the stakes in Syria, and I am proud to live in a country where peaceful disagreements are part of our fabric. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Stephanie Cutter.","Stephanie Cutter: At times, members of Congress take votes based on conscience .

"(CNN) -- War and humor make strange bedfellows, but in the absurdity of Syria's nearly three-year civil war, one town has made laughter a form of resistance. From caricatures of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad with a skunk's body and chemical weapons smoking from his bottom to posters reading ""Rebuilding houses takes some time, but humanizing ASSad can never happen"" the northern town of Kafr Nabl has gained fame for its satirical portrayal of the conflict. ""Laughter means life. We want to live and we need to live. We need to send a message to the world that we are human and we want to live,"" said Raed Fares, head of the opposition Kafr Nabl media center. In its latest comedic production, an amateur cast of activists, civilians and Free Syria Army rebels dressed like cavemen and mocked the inaction of the international community in a video called ""Kafranbel: The Syrian Revolution in Three Minutes."" ""I thought it would be good to use cavemen because of the language. I don't need to translate or say anything; everybody all over the world can understand without talking,"" said Fares, who produced and directed the video. In the first two scenes, the cavemen demonstrate against al-Assad only to be killed first by gunfire then by TNT, but when the oppressors fire chemical weapons, previously uninterested bystanders representing the international community intervene to confiscate the gas. In the final scene, the killing continues sans chemical weapons and with approving thumps from the international community. ""Something was very wrong with (President Barack) Obama's actions that he will strike Assad just to get rid of chemical weapons. It was like he was arresting the weapons and letting the criminal go free,"" Fares said. The media-savvy group received tens of thousands of views for its latest production and boasts a large audience on Facebook, where its members post pictures of the caustic placards carried in the group's weekly Friday demonstrations against the government. ""I don't trust governments all over the world anymore. I trust people, so I try to touch the people all over the world and explain our revolution. That it's not like the regime keeps trying to show it like a civil war or a war against terrorism. We are humans who need our freedom and our dignity, but he killed us,"" Fares said.","Rebels in northern Syrian town chide al-Assad with satirical posters, videos .

"(CNN) -- A Florida teenager made famous for her extensive bout with hiccups faces first-degree murder charges after meeting a man online and allegedly luring him to a vacant home, where he was robbed of between $50 and $60 and killed, police said. Jennifer Mee, 19, was arrested and charged Sunday -- as were two men, Laron Raiford and Lamont Newton -- hours after Shannon Griffin was found dead. He had been shot several times. The victim ""friended"" Mee on a social networking site last week and the two exchanged messages in subsequent days, according to St. Petersburg, Florida, police. Authorities do not believe Mee or Griffin, a Wal-Mart employee who had recently moved to Florida from the Gulf Coast, knew each other prior to their online encounter. After telling family members around 10 p.m. that he was heading out to meet a woman, Griffin rode his scooter to a vacant home where he had his first face-to-face encounter with Mee, police said. Mee led Griffin around to the back, where Raiford and Newton were armed and waiting, according to police. Griffin was shot with .38-caliber revolver while struggling in what the three murder suspects described to police as a ""robbery gone awry."" ""All three suspects admitted to their involvement and were charged with first-degree felony murder,"" St. Petersburg Police Sgt. T.A. Skinner said in a statement. Mee will face the same murder charge as the two men, even though she didn't actually shoot Griffin, police said. ""She was well aware of what was going on,"" St. Petersburg, Florida, Police Chief Chuck Harmon said. ""She was obviously the set-up person in this robbery."" In 2007, Mee's non-stop hiccups gained national attention. She earned the nickname ""Hiccup Girl"" and appeared multiple times on NBC's ""Today"" show. Her desperate search for a hiccup cure included trying ""sugar, peanut butter, breathing in a bag, having people scare me,"" she said in a photo slideshow posted on the St. Petersburg Times' website in February 2007. But after her hiccups faded, Mee continued to draw attention. In June 2007, local media reported that she ran away from home. In January 2010, St. Petersburg police once again issued a missing person report for Mee. Her mother told CNN affiliate WFTS that her daughter had stormed off after getting into a fight with her boyfriend. Mee was found after a friend called police, the affiliate said. Mee had been living with Raiford and Newton, police said. Police arrived at the scene of Saturday's shooting shortly after 11 p.m, finding a gun in some of the suspects' clothing, Harmon said. The three suspects were arrested and charged Sunday, after they were ""cooperative"" in talking with police. In an interview with WFLZ radio, the teenager's mother, Rachel Robidoux, described her daughter as a gentle, somewhat naive person who had never before gotten into trouble. Her life had taken a turn for the worse, Robidoux said, ever since her bout with the hiccups. ""It wasn't a case of the hiccups, it was a curse of the hiccups,"" she said. She called Mee's arrest ""a nightmare."" Also on WFLZ, Griffin's ex-girlfriend Rachel Hagabone said the victim was a good man. ""All he ever wanted to do was make somebody happy,"" she said. ""He's the nicest guy ever."" St. Petersburg police described Griffin, who had no criminal record, as somewhat of a ""social introvert"" who lived with a cousin and was often on the computer. Besides his online encounter, he did not appear to know any of the suspects, police said. ""This is the far end of the spectrum, as far as something that could happen"" with social networking websites, said Harmon. ""The message: Be careful who you're having a conversation with online. You never know."" CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.","NEW: In radio interview, Jennifer Mee's mother calls her daughter's hiccups a ""curse""

"(CNN) -- Residents of Australia's most populous state are enduring unpredictable wildfires fueled by strong winds, dry heat and low humidity. Authorities warned of worsening conditions and advised residents to self-evacuate in certain areas. On Tuesday, the New South Wales Rural Fire Services issued blunt warnings to residents in vulnerable areas. Uncertain of how long they would have to leave their homes and what may happen to their homes and belongings, residents posed questions to fire authorities. Firefighters tried to protect towns by conducting controlled burns -- intended to clear away brush and vegetation --- that could fuel the active, uncontrollable fire. The wildfires have already claimed more than 200 homes. Firefighters, many of whom are volunteers have left their day jobs, converged to help. They descended into deep canyons and mountains, some of which had tough, inaccessible terrains to try to get ahead of the fire before it reaches towns and homes. Tim Parsley, one of the firefighters, has felt the impact of the fires as his sister lost her house. Among the rubble, they managed to salvage her wedding ring, but ""everything else was gone,"" he said. ""The thing that I said to my sister is that you got away with your life and we're sitting here having a conversation about it and that's all that matters."" The wildfires stretching along nearly 1,000-mile line in New South Wales, began last week. On Wednesday, Ruth Dykyj, an author in Killingworth, New South Wales, noted dreadful conditions outdoors. The fire's toll was erratic in neighborhoods. Some homes were reduced to ashes and just across the street, other houses remained untouched. Christy Daschke is one of those who was affected. She and her husband, Jake examined the rubble that used to be their home. The only belonging that emerged unscathed is the line used to dry their clothes. They regret that they could not save their photos. ""The honeymoon, the wedding, me as a baby, of Jake as a baby, my whole 12 years with Jake --- we don't have a record of any photos to show my children of, you know, me growing up with their dad,"" Daschke said. As residents grappled with their loss and uncertainty of the fires, others rallied to help. Support for people affected in New South Wales came in different ways. Robyn Connell, a community worker and mother who lives in Blue Mountains observed this at her neighborhood meeting in the town of Katoomba, earlier this week. More than 70 fires remain.","Wildfires to be unpredictable in Australia's most populous state .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Pentagon has advised recruiting commands that they can accept openly gay and lesbian recruit candidates, given the recent federal court decision that bars the military from expelling openly gay service members, according to a Pentagon spokeswoman. The guidance from the Personnel and Readiness office was sent to recruiting commands on Friday, according to spokeswoman Cynthia Smith. The recruiters were told that if a candidate admits he or she is openly gay, and qualify under normal recruiting guidelines, their application can be processed. Recruiters are not allowed to ask candidates if they are gay as part of the application process. The notice also reminded recruiters that they have to ""manage expectations"" of applicants by informing them that a reversal of the court decision might occur, whereby the ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy could be reinstated, Smith said. Later Tuesday, U.S. District Court Judge Virginia Phillips in California denied the government's request for an emergency stay of her order barring the military from enforcing its ban on gay men and lesbians serving openly. The government is now expected to go to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco. Groups representing gays and lesbians have warned against coming out to the military because the policy is still being appealed in courts. One group, the Servicemembers Legal Defense Network, sent a statement out Tuesday reiterating the concern. ""During this interim period of uncertainty, service members must not come out and recruits should use caution if choosing to sign up,"" said SLDN Executive Director Aubrey Sarvis in the statement. ""The bottom line: if you come out now, it can be used against you in the future by the Pentagon."" Judge Phillips' ruling on ""don't ask, don't tell"" stemmed from a lawsuit by Log Cabin Republicans, a gay rights group, challenging the policy. Former Army Lt. Daniel Choi, an Iraq war combat veteran who challenged ""don't ask, don't tell"" and was discharged, moved to rejoin the military Tuesday afternoon. ""I'm here because I want to serve my country,"" he said. ""In the recruiting station. Apparently I'm too old for the Marines!"" he said in a tweet. ""Just filled out the Army application."" Choi said he told recruiters he was gay and that there was no reaction or delay in the enlistment process. He indicated he would complete his paperwork Wednesday and that he did not care what rank he would assume. Will Rodriguez-Kennedy, president of Log Cabin Republicans' San Diego, California, office, tried Tuesday afternoon to be reinstated by the Marines. ""Once a Marine, always a Marine,"" said Rodriguez-Kennedy, a corporal who was honorably discharged in February 2008. He served three years of a four-year term. ""It's a feeling of not having completed a full tour,"" he said. Recruiters told him Tuesday there were no current slots and they would call him in January, Rodriguez-Kennedy told CNN. One option is to join another branch of the service, but Rodriguez-Kennedy said he might now speak with Marine officers or get legal help. Reinstatement would allow him to keep the corporal rank and resume benefits. Rodriguez-Kennedy, 23, served as a provisional military police officer in Iraq in 2007. He said he was open to new responsibilities. ""I love the Marine Corps,"" he told CNN. CNN called several recruiting stations in New York and Chicago. They referred inquiries to the Pentagon.

"(CNN) -- Hair in the black community is like a religion, resplendent with ritual, devotion, mythology, metaphor, plenty of pomp and circumstance. Black hair arguably is one of the quickest indicators of ethnicity, ethos and sometimes, politics. This past week, two very different children found their very different ""ethnic"" hairstyles in the spotlight on two very different political stages. Dante de Blasio, the son of New York City mayoral candidate Bill de Blasio, is a typical nerdy, smart, shy 16-year-old Brooklyn boy. He has delighted New Yorkers, late-night satirists and America with his charm and awesome afro. When the Big Apple's primary election was held, it garnered national attention at first largely because of the high-profile and high-drama candidate Anthony Weiner. Yet, when it came to the TV campaign ads, liberal Bill de Blasio stole the show. But it's mostly not because of his anti-Bloomberg or I'm-for-the-small-man messages (although that matters). It was because of his son Dante, who starred in a brilliant 30-second straight no chaser ad. Displaying a fluffy 'fro, he became a symbol for progress, acceptance, diversity and freedom. Dante and his gravity-defying, nonconformist hairstyle helped signal to New Yorkers that his father, Bill de Blasio, understands equality, empathizes with the victims of systemic bigotry and is more than qualified to lead the most diverse metropolis in America. De Blasio finished first in the primary, though it is not clear whether he will have to face a runoff against Bill Thompson for the Democratic nomination. Going natural in corporate America . To some black voters, Dante's afro reflected that this boy and by association his father, respected the civil rights struggle, since the afro is considered an icon for black pride and progress. In other words -- you can trust de Blasio to be sensitive to issues of race that affect New York City, most notably the controversial stop-and-frisk policy. And to white voters and others, Dante's afro was just cool. But while Dante's afro is being celebrated, in a different part of America last week a little girl in Tulsa, Oklahoma, was reprimanded because her hairstyle violated the policy of her charter school. Tiana Parker, a pretty, sweet, shy 7-year-old Midwest girl with a big bow over her dreadlocks was criticized because at the Deborah Brown Community School where she is a student, ""hairstyles such as dreadlocks, afros, Mohawks and other faddish styles"" were not permitted. When the tearful Tiana hit the TV news cycle, many people were heartbroken watching her. According to news reports, she was told that her perfectly neat little locks ""didn't look presentable."" This is certainly not the first time that dreadlocks have been banned from schools but it was one of the most emotional instances. So much so that more than 20,000 people signed a petition demanding that Deborah Brown Community School publicly apologizes to Tiana Parker and her family. Parker's parents pulled her out of the charter school and placed her in a new school where hopefully she can lead a hair hassle-free childhood. (Deborah Brown Community School has since apologized and removed the language about African-American hairstyles from its dress code.) Why focus on Gabby Douglas' hair? Tiana's experience, for many, is a symbol that ignorance and bias still pervades American life. The fact that in her natural state, her hair was viewed as rebellious, signals that there is a lot of misperception that we must correct. One way to fix this is for mainstream media to champion more diverse images of black beauty. Black hair is a repository for America's painful past and promising future. The endless style possibilities of black hair represent America's creative genius, yet its ""otherness"" is a constant reminder of unresolved inequalities and subtle prejudices. Let's hope that one day, hairstyles from the black community will no longer trigger powerful emotions or suspicions. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Michaela Angela Davis.","Michaela Davis: Two very different children found their hair in the spotlight this past week .

"Steubenville, Ohio (CNN) -- One of the teens who recorded himself mocking the girl at the center of an Ohio rape case ""did a really dumb thing and regrets it"" but did not commit any crime, his lawyer said Monday. The attorney, Dennis McNamara, said there was ""no excuse or justification"" for the jokes Michael Nodianos made, ""and with some sober reflection, he is ashamed and embarrassed to hear them himself."" ""He sincerely regrets his behavior and his comments and the effect that it's had on the parties involved, including his own family,"" McNamara told reporters in Steubenville, the small Ohio town that has become the focus of national attention because of the case. ""He was not raised to act in this manner."" Two 16-year-old members of the town's powerhouse high school football team are charged with sexually assaulting a girl after a series of parties in August. They are set for trial in a juvenile court in February. McNamara said Nodianos, 18, has been interviewed by detectives ""at some length"" and is not the subject of an investigation. ""Michael is a really good kid from a really good family who did a really dumb thing and regrets it,"" he said. ""Beyond that, he has no involvement in the criminal case or in any of the underlying activity that led to the filing of the criminal charges."" Defense battles social media blizzard in Ohio rape case . The case gained national attention after The New York Times published a lengthy piece on it in December. The activist hacker group Anonymous and other critics have accused community leaders of trying to paper over rampant misconduct by football players and suggested that other students took part in the assaults or failed to do enough stop them. Anonymous helped organize a weekend protest in Steubenville that drew a crowd of hundreds to the town, a community of about 18,000 on the Ohio River across the river from West Virginia. Then last week, Anonymous posted the 12-minute video that featured Nodianos, a video the attorney said had been taken offline in the days following the incident. In it, he makes joke after joke about the girl's condition, saying she must have died because she didn't move during one assault. Opinion: Teach young men to treat women with respect . McNamara said the video had been recorded in the pre-dawn hours following the parties. Nodianos was drunk, ""but that's not a justification or excuse,"" his lawyer said. McNamara said Nodianos wasn't at the house where the alleged rape took place, nor did he witness anything himself: The details he recounted ""came from the reports of a couple of other young people that had been present or had seen these things, or at least claimed to."" McNamara said his client graduated from Steubenville High in 2012. He had perfect attendance, played on the school's baseball team and won an academic scholarship to Ohio State University. Online outrage prompts city website . Nodianos was enrolled at OSU in the fall but has left college for the time being, McNamara said. Meanwhile, he said, hackers have gotten into Nodianos's e-mail, his parents e-mail accounts and reactivated his closed-down Twitter account. They are posting new tweets, ""but he has nothing to do with that,"" McNamara said. The defendants in the rape case, Trent Mays and Ma'lik Richmond, are both 16. Their attorneys have said both teens are not guilty, and say they will seek to get the trial moved because of the excessive publicity the case has received. Both are charged with rape, while Mays faces an additional charge of illegal use of a minor in nudity-oriented material. At an October hearing, witnesses say they saw the girl stumbling, vomiting and eventually unconscious, having to be carried by the hands and feet. One of the witnesses said she didn't respond when Richmond performed a sexual act on her in the basement of another student's home. CNN is not identifying the girl, a juvenile, in accordance with its policy not to release the names of alleged rape victims. Although the suspects also are juveniles, CNN is identifying them because they have been publicly named by a juvenile court judge, by defense attorneys and in media accounts.

"(CNN) -- As a society, we do too much short-term thinking. In Washington, that has meant passing bills that paper over fiscal problems in the short term while ignoring long-term consequences for future generations. The result is a fiscal gap that places unknown financial burdens on today's young people. We may have different prescriptions for how to address our budget challenges, but from a personal standpoint, we both worry about how a lack of information about long-term budget realities will affect our children's generations and those that follow. We want Congress to do more long-term planning, like families and businesses across this country do every day. Instead of kicking the can down the road, Congress and the administration need to understand how policy decisions made today in Washington will affect future generations of Americans. On Wednesday, we are introducing a bill to bring more transparency to the budget process and ensure that members of Congress and the administration are honest with themselves and the American people about current and future budget realities. Right now, Congress only looks at the effect of legislation over the next 10 years. Rarely is information presented that reflects the longer-term impact. Our bill -- the Intergenerational Financial Obligations Reform Act, or INFORM -- would ensure that Congress, the administration and the American people have the information necessary to understand the effect that taxes, spending policies and future economic advancements will have on the fiscal health of the country and on individual Americans 20, 50 or even 75 years down the road. The INFORM Act would require the president to provide a detailed accounting of how the administration's budget and policy recommendations, and its predictions of economic health, would affect young people down the line. It would also require the Government Accountability Office to provide an annual analysis of the impact of future budget realities on generations to come and account for any fiscal gaps (the difference between spending and tax revenue). This approach -- known as a generational accounting and fiscal gap analysis -- would examine the full scope of the government's obligations, present and future, and then look at the effect those obligations will have on current and future generations. Presidents Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush each used this tool in submitting executive budgets. Young Americans in their 20s and 30s deserve to know what the decisions of today's lawmakers mean for their future. And lawmakers should use every tool at our disposal to make better decisions. We believe this approach will help us improve the fiscal health of the country. Washington has spent enough time kicking the can down the road. It's time to start being honest about the long-term challenges facing future generations.

"New York (CNN) -- After turning a traditional Senegalese drink into a hit American product, Magatte Wade is now trying re-brand Africa itself. Senegalese entrepreneur Magatte Wade is the creator of multi-million dollar U.S. company Adina World Beat Beverages, which makes drinks based on traditional recipes from around the world. She came up with the idea in 2004, after she returned home to Senegal and found soda drinks were replacing the country's traditional hibiscus drink, known as bissap. She arrived back in the United States determined to share healthy traditional recipes with the rest of the world. Adina's products now include organic coffees and exotic fruit drinks and are sold all over the United States. ""My biggest pride was to know that it was possible, that the vision I had was possible and my vision was that the world is hungry for well-executed African brands,"" Wade said. ""We saw it at the investor level and we saw it at the buyer's level and we saw it at the consumer's level. Everyone wanted to be part of that adventure and it was just amazing."" Scramble for 'dot africa' internet domain name . Now Magatte Wade is now building a new company, Tiossano, in New York. It's a high-end skin care line based on traditional Senegalese recipes, using natural ingredients indigenous to Africa. ""What we are doing now is a concept phase where we make sure a product is right, the packaging is right, the branding is right, the marketing is right,"" she said. ""We are in the process of making sure that people will buy into it. In our first three weeks of existence we landed a pretty cool account already, so we're getting there."" Her goal is to inspire others, so that in the next 10 years there is an African company among the top 100 global brands. Wade says that when it comes to marketing an African product it's not just about selling units, it's about selling a different image of Africa to consumers. She argues that most people see Africa in terms clichÃÂ©s, such as safaris, tribal designs or people needing charity. Her goal is to change the perception that both Africans and non-Africans have of her home continent. ""I think a lot of Africans, unfortunately, the overwhelming majority, does still not yet feel comfortable about themselves. There is this complex of inferiority that is pervasive in the culture. ""A lot of it has to do with history ... yes we have Obama in office today but it doesn't change a lot. And I'm not even talking about racism, that's not what I'm talking about. What I am talking about is just groups of people not feeling good enough about themselves; if you don't have the right type of self esteem you go nowhere in this world. ""But self-esteem will also come if enough of us today that are in the age of working, if enough of us can really get together and try and build a different brand for Africa, a brand that all of a sudden means 'contributors to the world,' rather than a subset of a population that's always sucking energy out of others."" Africa can teach the world to innovate . While her products are currently made in the United States, the plan is to move production to Senegal once Tiossano has generated enough profit. Wade says the company plans to donate 10% of profits to a foundation supporting the next generation of Senegalese leaders. ""If I have to share with people my deepest dream, that's the level at which I want to play -- not just do well for myself and even for my employees but I really want to make sure that the next generation is well prepared,"" she said. ""Or at least we have a cluster of people that are going to go and really accomplish things that we can all be proud of.""","Senegalese entrepreneur Magatte Wade is co-creator of U.S. drink company Adina .

"London (CNN) -- A painting dismissed for years as the work of an unknown artist has been identified as a piece by Vincent Van Gogh, after x-rays revealed an image of two wrestlers fighting underneath the floral still life. ""Still Life with Meadow Flowers and Roses"" has hung in the Kroeller-Mueller Museum in the town of Otterlo, in the eastern Netherlands, since 1974, but doubts over its authorship have dogged the painting for decades. Experts argued that the large format, the location of the signature, and the huge number of flowers in the composition all suggested the painting was the creation of an unidentified artist, rather than the famed Dutch painter, and the work was officially ""dismissed"" from his catalogue in 2003. ""There were so many questions around this painting,"" explained Teio Meedendorp, researcher at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam. ""There were a lot of things about it that were strange -- it couldn't quite be trusted [as a piece by Van Gogh]."" But the latest high-tech x-ray imaging has allowed scholars to re-examine an underpainting, featuring two wrestlers fighting, first glimpsed in the 1990s, and confirm that the picture is indeed by Van Gogh. Saving Van Gogh's home from dereliction . Van Gogh (1853-1890) created some of the world's best known and most loved paintings, including ""Sunflowers,"" ""Irises"" and ""The Starrry Night,"" and a number of self-portraits. He was virtually unknown as an artist during his lifetime, but his reputation soared in the years after his suicide at the age of 37 following years of mental illness, and his works now hang in major museums and galleries around the globe. During the art market boom of the late 1980s and early 1990s, three of Van Gogh's works succeeded each other as the most expensive paintings ever sold: ""Sunflowers"" for $39.9 million, ""Irises"" for $53.9 million, and ""Portrait of Dr. Gachet"" for $82.5 million. ""The painting was x-rayed before, so we knew there was something underneath, but the image was not very clear,"" he told CNN. ""This new technique gave us a much clearer image, and lots of details about the pigments and the paint layers. ""We know Vincent painted wrestlers, we know much more than we did 10 years ago about the pigments he used, and we know that at the time, when re-using a canvas, he simply painted over the top of the previous image, without an intermediate layer. ""This painting was a complete match with all the research that has been done over the past 10 years."" Van Gogh, Kahlo speak from beyond grave . Van Gogh wrote about the wrestlers picture -- which he painted as an assignment during his studies at the art academy in Antwerp -- in a letter in January 1886: ""This week I painted a large thing with two nude torsos -- two wrestlers,"" adding that he was delighted with the result. Research suggests that the still life was painted on the same canvas fewer than six months later, while in Paris. ""The top layer was applied not long afterwards,"" said Meedendorp. ""We can tell this because he used a lot of zinc white in the wrestlers picture, and it dries very, very slowly. ""The x-rays show that it had not hardened completely when the still life was added, causing some cracks in the paint of the flower picture, which suggests it was painted less than half a year later."" Meedendorp said there was always the possibility of discovering other ""unknown"" Van Gogh works in future. ""There are other paintings that haven't been x-rayed,"" he told CNN. ""There are always other opportunities.""","""Still life with meadow flowers and roses"" dismissed as work of unknown artist .

"(CNN) -- Buckle up! The political conventions in Tampa and Charlotte over the next two weeks will throw the 2012 election campaigns into high gear, and send it careering down a mean, rocky road toward one of the most important choices Americans have made in half a century. Only twice before in the lives of most voters have we seen an election offering such radically different visions about the role of government in national life. The first was 1964, when Lyndon Baines Johnson was holding up the Democratic standard, calling for government to create a Great Society with a cornucopia of new federal programs. On the other side, Barry Goldwater had seized the Republican banner from previously-dominant moderates and crusaded on the most conservative agenda in six decades, seeking to push back not only the Great Society, but much of the New Deal. ""Extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice and ... moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue!"" Goldwater declared to thunderous applause at the GOP convention. It was a bare-knuckles fight, but LBJ was campaigning in John F. Kennedy's cloak and Goldwater's proposals were seen as scary and radical. LBJ swept to a crushing victory. Score one for bigger government. The second ""choice"" election came in 1980, when, after a decade of failed leadership, a man came galloping out of the West who seemed the most improbable of figures to get the country going again. And he was carrying with him many of Goldwater's ideas. But Ronald Regan turned out to be a strong leader with a million-dollar smile; Jimmy Carter, a man better suited to be a saint than a politician, went down decisively. Score one for smaller government. This year's election is shaping up to be a rubber match with major implications for the country's future. Gov. Mitt Romney's choice of Paul Ryan as his running mate has dialed up the ideological contrast between the two tickets, while both sides have been throwing sharp elbows at each other (even by the low standards of American politics). The harshening words and diverging visions speak to an election that breaks somewhat with tradition. Time was, as Chris Cillizza at the Washington Post and others have pointed out, the playbook was simple: run to the base in the primary and pivot back to the middle in the general election, winning over as many of the voters in the middle as you can. (In economics, this effect is called Hotelling's Game and is otherwise normally used to explain why gas stations all seem to be on the same corner.) But this election features a small number of genuinely undecided voters --and high negatives for both party candidates, as Karl Rove notes in Thursday's Wall Street Journal. So, (although Rove would disagree) the dominant strategy has become playing to the base. That explains Romney's picking Paul Ryan, but it also explains why partisans of both sides rejoiced when Ryan was picked: His strong conservative beliefs fire up the Democratic base as well as the Republican one. If anything, this year's choice is starker than in 1980: Reagan had a pragmatic streak, so he was willing to compromise to get a deal done and keep moving forward (Tip O'Neill used to say that the Gipper would win more than half a loaf and come back for the rest later). Romney and Ryan, however, reinforced by the tea party, show no inclination to compromise. On the Democratic side, aides to President Obama are spreading the word that, if he wins, he has had enough of trying to accommodate the Republicans and will also be more confrontational. Whether the two sides will seize upon their conventions to set forth more complete, detailed plans for the next four years remains to be seen. So far, they have refused to go beyond vagaries and harsh, trivial attacks on each other. Most voters are yearning for more courage and less bile. But there should be no doubt that the two tickets stand behind radically different visions of the role of government and individuals. Under President Obama, federal spending is now 24% of GDP, far higher than in recent decades. While Obama talks of trimming, his most thoughtful advisers think the government is likely to grow in coming years no matter who wins (see Larry Summers's provocative column in the Financial Times this week). In contrast, Romney has vowed to get federal spending down to 20%. That difference may not sound like much, but it roughly equates to over half a trillion dollars each year. At a time when 10,000 Baby Boomers are becoming eligible for Medicare and Social Security each day, going from 24% to 20% of GDP would mean massive cuts. Presented with a stark choice between bigger government and smaller government, where are voters likely to come down? That is a question that has interested scholars for a long time. Some years ago, political scientists Lloyd Free and Hadley Cantril observed that Americans were ""philosophical conservatives"" but ""operational liberals,"" that is, they would tell pollsters they wanted to keep government small, taxes down and socialism out. But when asked if they wanted the government to spend more on programs and benefits, they were all for it. In the coming election, we may have finally reached a point of reckoning between these two conflicting impulses. And so, while conventions are generally the place for sweeping statements, the winning ticket will need to be able to speak operationally as well as philosophically. All this makes for a dramatic series of addresses, not just from Mitt Romney and President Obama, but from their parties' top messengers: people like New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro. These conventions will offer them a chance to make a firm case to the American people on which kind of government, both operationally and philosophically, they should choose. Looming over that choice is the question of whether, at the end of this campaign, the winner can actually govern. Certainly, the raucous, often vicious nature of the combat so far has not been encouraging. One of us (David) has been attending conventions for some 40 years and has witnessed a distinct change in tone; listening to the hot rhetoric in both conventions in 2004, it suddenly became comprehensible how the country could have wound up in Civil War back in 1861 after another election full of ramifications for the nation's future. And the chasms between the two parties continue to widen before us. A deeply illuminating study, released a few days ago by the Washington Post and the Kaiser Family Foundation, has shown that over the past 14 years, the percentages of Democrats and Republicans who consider themselves ""strong partisans"" has shot up by about 20 points in each case. So, in pushing voters to make a choice between sharply different visions, it is also imperative that the candidates look beyond November to the next four years, figuring out how they will bring the country together again when the brawl is over. The acceptance speeches are not just a moment to rally the base, they are also a place to begin laying the foundations of a successful presidency. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Gergen and Michael Zuckerman.","David Gergen, Michael Zuckerman: GOP convention jump-starts general election .

"(CNN) -- This is what party modernization looks like. Last Friday, Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio announced he is now a supporter of the freedom to marry. What changed his thinking after voting against gay rights in the past? Finding out that his son -- a Yale sophomore -- was gay, and realizing that sexual orientation is not a choice but an innate quality. ""I have come to believe that if two people are prepared to make a lifetime commitment to love and care for each other in good times and in bad, the government shouldn't deny them the opportunity to get married,"" he said. Portman's change of heart is significant because he is the highest-ranking elected Republican in America, who is currently in office, to endorse same-sex marriage. But he joins a growing number of Republicans who have already done just that. Indeed, Portman is just the latest addition to an increasingly common occurrence in Republican politics at the county, city and state level. To date 208 elected Republican state legislators have voted to legalize same-sex marriage in 13 states: Connecticut, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Maryland, New Hampshire, New York, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Wyoming. Only nine states and the District of Columbia allow same-sex marriage, but GOP elected officials have voted for marriage when it came up for vote in their legislative chambers in Illinois, Wyoming and Rhode Island, though the law hasn't yet passed in those states. Sutter: Gay people live in 50 Americas . The conservative argument for marriage includes a recognition of the traditional value of marriage as a stabilizing force in society. Another, economic argument holds that married individuals tend to accumulate more wealth than single individuals (putting them at lesser risk of state dependency), not to mention that marriage produces more government revenue through taxation. California's ban on same-sex marriage cost San Francisco $37.2 million per year in receipts, according to Ted Egan, chief economist in the San Francisco Controller's Office. The elected officials who support same-sex marriage are surfing a rapidly rising tide among Republican rank-and-file. A new ABC/Washington Post Poll shows that 52% of Republicans younger than 50 support same-sex marriage. There are good reasons for this. Conservative faith traditions argue rightly for strict religious protections in the law so that churches, synagogues and mosques aren't forced to perform ceremonies inconsistent with their religious teachings. But Americans' diverse religious backgrounds have the Golden Rule in common, and conservatives in favor of civil marriage argue that it is consistent with faith traditions for Republican policies to treat others, including gays and lesbians, with the same level of respect and fairness under the law that we wish for ourselves. Constitutional conservatives point to the role of the courts in protecting fundamental rights. They argue that marriage is such a right, enshrined in the constitution, and one that cannot be subject to the whims or tyranny of a majority of voters, even if they were to wish to limit the freedoms of gay and lesbians. More and more Republicans are recognizing and respecting the essential dignity of individuals who are gay and deserve the full rights of citizenship, just like their straight brothers and sisters. Opinion: Gay marriage, then group marriage? These are the messages that last November brought Republicans and independents to the voting booth in Maryland, Maine and Washington, where same-sex marriage was approved for the first time by voters, not courts or legislatures. Minnesotans, who rejected a constitutional ban on same-sex marriage in November, are now poised to legalize marriage this legislative season, with the historic distinction of bipartisan support: Republican State Sen. Branden Petersen is a co-sponsor of the bill. The timing of Portman's announcement is no accident. In less than a week, Theodore Olson, George W. Bush's solicitor general and a charter member of the conservative Federalist Society, will argue before the United States Supreme Court that same-sex couples have a constitutional right to marry. Accompanying him is an amicus brief, signed by 135 prominent Republicans, (I was also a co-signer) making the conservative case for same-sex marriage, an effort organized by former Republican National Committee Chair Ken Mehlman. It's hard to imagine that the justices aren't taking notes on our country's rapid transformation on this issue. The final safe haven within the conservative movement for anti-gay bigotry -- the American Conservative Union's CPAC convention, held last week in Maryland -- received more than a few hearty smackdowns. The editors of National Review, the conservative movement's founding publication, chided CPAC's exclusion of gay conservatives, which was followed by a convention panel hosted by the Competitive Enterprise Institute entitled, ""A Rainbow on the Right: Growing the Coalition, Bringing Tolerance Out of the Closet"" (full disclosure: I spoke on that panel). Listen: Voices from the Southern closet . Finally, the conservative intellectual pillar Charles Murray took the CPAC stage to argue that the conservative movement must accept same-sex marriage if it wishes to win elections in the future. The data are inescapable: 62% of all Republicans believe in either same-sex marriage or another form of legal recognition of same-sex relationships and 73% of Republicans support employment nondiscrimination protections for gays and lesbians. At this point, the support for same-sex marriage from former Vice President Cheney, former first lady Laura Bush and former Secretary of State Colin Powell is icing on the cake. In the words of Portman, this is less a partisan issue than a generational issue. Portman embodies the formula for GOP modernization: a conservatism that unapologetically applies the principle of individual freedom consistently to both fiscal and social policy. The senator has breathed new life into a national party grasping for traction with young Americans. To regain relevance, the beltway's Republican establishment organizations owe a debt of gratitude to leaders like Portman, Peterson and New York Rep. Richard Hanna for representing their family's and friends' right to equal freedom and opportunity. They, and others like them, are making the case for a relevant modern conservative movement. Pro-marriage-freedom Republicans are on the right side of history and in time their courage and contributions will help erase the stain of bigotry that holds the conservative movement back and stops us from connecting to a rising generation of Americans.

"(CNN) -- Schadenfreude -- joy at the misfortune of others -- is a bad thing. So I've been trying to resist temptation these past months as I watch Attorney General Eric Holder deal with public and congressional reaction to the ""Fast and Furious"" scheme, the failed attempt by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to seed and then track U.S. firearms to Mexican drug cartels. Fast and Furious was a secretive, high-risk operation seemingly intended to deal with an intractable problem abroad. On those grounds, some may be tempted to equate it to a CIA covert action. But even if some attributes are similar -- tough problem, edgy solution, inherent complexity, great secrecy, high operational and political risk -- it was definitely not a covert action since those are clearly defined in an executive order as the province of the Central Intelligence Agency . Beyond that, if it had been a true covert action, the attorney general would have had to give his opinion as to its lawfulness beforehand; the implementing agency would have had to exhaustively articulate risk; the National Security Council would have had to judge it favorably; President Barack Obama would have had to authorize it; and the Congress would have had to be briefed before its implementation. And all concerned would have had the opportunity to reject a bad idea, whatever its rationale. These routine safeguards not only protect agencies, their leaders and their officers from legal and political jeopardy, they also protect the government from serious missteps. Now Holder, without such safeguards in place, must defend himself against some very tough accusations, including one by some skeptics that the operation was intended principally to discredit, and thereby justify further regulation of, firearms dealers. This is where the schadenfreude comes in. After the congressional elections of 2006, the CIA was forced to defend edgy (often controversial and sometimes unsuccessful) actions in a tough political environment. President George W. Bush was politically weakened, the Senate and the House were under Democratic control and a presidential election was in the offing. On the Hill, the questions were aggressive, often partisan and, in my view, sometimes even deeply mean-spirited and unfair to the many intelligence professionals who were putting their lives and careers on the line in a very successful effort to protect America from further attack. The agency dealt with the committees as best a nonpolitical organization could, fully recognizing that, although congressional oversight was a necessary instrument, it could sometimes be a difficult one. But any personal instinct toward some common ""executive branch"" empathy for Holder is muted not only by the dubious character of Fast and Furious, but by some of the attorney general's other actions, as well. While out of office, for example, he famously called for a ""reckoning"" for CIA officers and other officials who authorized and conducted operations that were edgy and risky and intended to deal with difficult circumstances. Once in office, he launched a ""reckoning"" of CIA renditions, detentions and interrogations of terrorists by directing the Justice Department to reopen investigations closed years before by career prosecutors. This decision was opposed by then-CIA Director Leon Panetta and seven of his predecessors, and Holder reportedly made the decision without reading detailed memos prepared by those career prosecutors declining to pursue further proceedings. The CIA officers affected by this may be forgiven some feelings of irony when they now hear the attorney general repudiating some of the charges made against his officers by stating: ""Those who serve in the ranks of law enforcement are our nation's heroes and deserve our nation's thanks, not the disrespect that is being heaped on them by those who see political advantage."" Of course, it was also Holder who decided in 2009 to release what had been secret DOJ memos outlining the details and providing the legal justification for the Bush administration's interrogation program. The release was defended by the administration as part of a broad commitment to ""transparency."" Holder may have had even more in mind though as, according to a contemporary Newsweek account of the decision, the leadership of the Department of Justice calculated that ""if the public knew the details, ... there would be a groundswell of support for an independent probe,"" and that when the decision to release those memos had been made, the attorney general and his leadership team ""celebrated quietly, and waited for the national outrage to begin."" Later that summer, Holder also released a previously classified CIA inspector general report on the interrogation program as the administration seemed to be actively shaping this story to put its predecessor's actions in the worst possible light. As I said, schadenfreude is a bad thing. But it is sometimes hard to avoid, especially when life seems to come full circle. Attorney General Eric Holder has made it clear that he thinks he has been subjected to a heavily politicized process over Fast and Furious. If he has -- and that's still an if -- I suspect that some folks at CIA know exactly how he feels. Follow CNN Opinion on Twitter . Join the conversation on Facebook .

"(CNN) -- A Florida grand jury this week found that two deputies in Pensacola should not be criminally charged in the wounding of an unarmed man, who was shot at 15 times while he was in his own driveway. Roy Middleton, 60, was hit by two of those rounds in his legs. A metal rod had to be placed inside his left leg, which was shattered. He spoke to CNN exclusively in August. ""How do I feel about what happened? How would anybody feel getting shot?"" Middleton asked. Middleton's attorney, Lorenzo Williams, told CNN on Wednesday that his client was distraught over the grand jury decision. ""This will not preclude Mr. Middleton from moving forward with a civil action,"" he said. The officers were in fear for their own safety, the sheriff said in an interview after the incident. The story began early July 27 when Middleton was returning to his Pensacola neighborhood. Searching for a cigarette while inside his white Lincoln Town Car, he appeared to have been mistaken for a car thief by a concerned neighbor who called 911. Escambia County Sheriff's Deputy Jeremiah Meeks and Sgt. Matthew White responded to the call. ""He came out of the car with more of a lunging motion coming out of the car, and the deputies were standing behind him and he had what appeared to be a metallic object in his hand,"" said Sheriff David Morgan. ""The tragedy of this is the noncompliance to the directions of law enforcement officers,"" Morgan said in August. ""Had that occurred, we wouldn't be having this discussion. It's a tragedy all the way around. He is both a suspect and a victim."" According to the investigative report, Middleton had his keys and a small flashlight in his hand. Meeks testified that he thought a gun was being pointed at him. He fired 12 shots and White fired three times. The case was turned over to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE). It provided a report to the Escambia County State Attorney, which took the case to the grand jury. In the FDLE report, Middleton allegedly told investigators that he used crack cocaine and alcohol the day before, but only drank two beers earlier on the day of the shooting. But, the investigative report also states, ""Toxicology records reflected the presence of cocaine and amphetamines in a urine sample taken from Middleton upon being admitted to the emergency room."" Middleton's attorney says the drugs allegedly in his client's system do not matter. ""I don't think it had any effect whatsoever. How did they make an observation that he was committing a crime? How could he present harm to a law enforcement officer? He was found by his car, with blood on the seat,"" said Williams. Middleton was among those testifying before the grand jury. Last month, District Attorney Bill Eddins told CNN, ""this (case) is a little different than a typical case where a prosecutor seeks an indictment. I am remaining neutral."" ""In this community, in order for the general public to have confidence in the criminal justice system, it's more appropriate for a cross-section of our community to review the case, "" Eddins said. ""It would be more appropriate for the grand jury to decide. The grand jury recommended more intensive training for the first four years of an officer's career, and that this case be re-created for training purposes. Morgan, in a statement released Wednesday, said his office will begin an internal investigation to determine whether there were any policy violations in the shooting. ""The outcome of this internal investigation will be based on facts and law, just as the process has been to this point. The deputies involved are assigned to administrative duties pending the outcome of the internal investigation,"" he said in a press release. But Williams believes the grand jury's message to the sheriff bolsters his client's case. ""They have to improve their training programs,"" he told CNN. ""It sends a strong signal to the sheriff's department that they are negligent in the training of their officers in the use of deadly force.""

"(CNN) -- Thai prosecutors were poised to issue an arrest warrant Tuesday for the grandson of the creator of the Red Bull energy drink who failed to appear in court this week over a fatal hit-and-run case that sparked nationwide anger. Prosecutors allege Vorayuth Yoovidhaya, 28, was behind the wheel of his Ferrari on September 3, 2012, when it collided with an on-duty policeman on a motorbike in downtown Bangkok. He is charged with reckless driving causing death, speeding and failing to stop following an accident. Thai police told CNN that Yoovidhaya's lawyer had informed prosecutors his client was in Singapore receiving medical treatment for a bout of influenza he contracted while on a business trip and would not be in Thailand for his scheduled court hearing. Thai prosecutor Ruecha Krairiksh said his no-show meant that the speeding charges would lapse but the more serious charges of reckless driving and failing to stop would still apply. The reckless driving charges carry a maximum penalty of 10 years in jail under Thai law. ""We can't indict him because the suspect is not present. This means the statute of limitations for speeding will expire because the incident occurred on September 3, 2012,"" Mr Ruesha told The Nation newspaper. He said he would ask the court to withhold bail because of his failure to present himself in court and for postponing meetings with prosecutors. His case provoked outrage in Thailand last year with online forums denouncing the Thai justice system for its perceived leniency towards defendants with money and connections. An alleged attempt to cover up the crime -- which involved police arresting a suspect who pretended to be driving his Ferrari at the time of the incident -- led to the suspension of a police officer and sparked even more outrage. Yoovidhaya also allegedly paid the family of the victim Thai baht 3 million ($97,000) in a bid to stall a civil lawsuit, police said. The defendant is the grandson of the Chaleo Yoovidhya who formulated an energy drink called Krathing Daeng, or Red Bull, that first became popular with Thai workmen. He teamed up with Austrian Dietrich Mateschitz in 1987 and together they built an international drinks brand. According to Forbes magazine, the Yoovidhya empire is worth $7.8 billion, making them the fourth richest family in Thailand. Chaleo died in March 2012, leaving his heirs a vast estate based on his 49% stake in the iconic drinks brand, as well as interests in hospitals, real estate and sports teams.","Thai prosecutors poised to issue an arrest warrant for Vorayuth Yoovidhaya .

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama plans to nominate Jeh Johnson, the Pentagon's former top lawyer, to be the next Homeland Security Secretary, sources tell CNN. The nomination is expected on Friday. He must be confirmed by the Senate. Johnson would replace former Secretary Janet Napolitano, who left the Cabinet post earlier this year to head California's public university system, and would be the fourth secretary of the Department that was created in response to the 9/11 attacks. Johnson was appointed the Defense Department's General Counsel in 2009 after serving on Obama's transition team. With 10,000 military and civilian attorneys working for him, Johnson was responsible for the prior legal review and approval of every military operation approved by the President and Defense Secretary. He stepped down earlier this year and reentered private practice. If confirmed, Johnson would take over the top security job following Obama's public recalibration of the ""war on terror,"" saying May the United States should no longer see it as a ""self-defeating"" perpetual fight, but one that must at some point end, ""like all wars."" The Homeland Security Department is meant to coordinate the U.S. domestic security apparatus, encompassing everything from the FBI to the Border Patrol. It not only keeps an eye on al Qaeda and other terror threats, but also covers border security, immigration enforcement, cybersecurity, transportation security and disaster assistance. Johnson's nomination comes three months after Napolitano announced she would step down in July.

"KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN)  -- Little Banafsha wakes up in her small mud home, has a cup of tea and braces herself for the day ahead. An exhausted Banafsha takes a moment's rest from begging for bread. She is just 11 years old, but she is the breadwinner for her family. Literally. Without the bread that she begs from strangers, she, her sisters, her baby brothers and her mom would all go hungry. Her father is a drug addict, focused only on his next high; her mom cares for the little ones, and heavy responsibility falls on Banafsha's young shoulders. Every day, she heads far from her home, trekking up and down steep hills to the wealthier parts of the Afghan capital, where she can but hope richer people will take pity on her. She is not bitter, explaining: ""My two younger sisters also work. They beg for bread and sell gum. There's no choice."" When she gets to the Wazir Akbar Khan district, a hangout of diplomats and aid workers, she unwraps her folded rice sack. ""Sir, do you have some bread?""  Watch Banafsha and other Afghan kids ask for help Â» . Banafsha clutches the bag tight as she walks from building to building, eyeing who will help and who will not. ""Sir, do you have some bread?"" she asks again. This is her recitation for the next six hours, as she darts around in her worn blue plastic sandals, knowing that danger could be there at any turn, even in this more affluent neighborhood. ""A few days ago, some girls were kidnapped around here, and many people have gone missing. The girls' mother still comes around here looking for them, but they still haven't been found,"" Banafsha says. This time of the year, the sun begins to set at 4:30 p.m. in Kabul. But Banafsha continues to roam the dark streets. The 6 o'clock rush hour is her peak business time. Her eyes well with tears, but she doesn't allow them to fall, quickly wiping them away and biting her thumb like the vulnerable child she is. She prays every day: ""I say, 'God, take me out of this poverty and have my father go work so I can go to school.' "" She dreams of being a teacher, and for three hours a day, she gets to be a little girl with big dreams. On her way to beg, Banafsha stops off at a center run by an Afghan nongovernmental organization called Aschiana -- the name means ""nest"" in Dari -- for a little education, a little recreation and a glimmer of hope. The first center opened in 1995 for 100 children. By June 2008, Aschiana had eight centers catering to 7,600 children in the capital city of Kabul alone. The group thought it had secured a major source of funding in March this year, but the money never arrived. Four centers had to be closed in June, sending 4,000 children back to the streets without their three-hour reprieve. Inside, Banafsha and the other children get to laugh. In every room there is a sense of serenity, whether the children are practicing brush strokes for calligraphy, tumbling around in judo or gliding their little fingers over the harmounia, a type of piano used in music class. For now, the center is surviving on small private donations, but it is not enough. Aschiana stopped providing food for the children at three of the remaining centers because they couldn't afford it. Without that relief, even more children head back to the streets to beg for the smallest morsels to fill their empty stomachs. On a good day, Banafsha will trek back across the steep hills to the home she helped her mother build, with some bread in her bag and maybe 50 cents. At home, the work continues. As the eldest sister, she tends to her siblings. Her mother relies on her help; her father is focused only on his next high. Finally, she will sleep. But tomorrow, Banafsha will walk down into the crowded city streets again, among the estimated 60,000 other street kids in Kabul, dreaming of a better life.","11-year-old girl begs for bread every day to feed her family .

"(CNN) -- All 12 of the victims killed in Monday's shooting rampage at Washington's Navy Yard were contractors or civilians, authorities said Monday night. Officials identified seven of those killed. They are: . Michael Arnold, 59; . Sylvia Frasier, 53; . Kathy Gaarde, 62; . John Roger Johnson, 73; . Frank Kohler, 50; . Vishnu Pandit, 61; and . Kenneth Bernard Proctor, 46; . None of those killed were military personnel, authorities said. Wounded survivors of Monday's shooting are eligible for treatment at a U.S. military' hospital, just as if they were soldiers wounded in war. U.S. Navy Secretary Ray Mabus announced that Walter Reed Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, is open to them as he visited two civilian Navy workers being treated at MedStar Washington Hospital Center Monday afternoon. Twelve victims -- and the suspected shooter -- died as a result of Monday morning's rampage at the headquarters for the Naval Sea Systems Command, officials said. It could take another day until everyone is accounted for, the Navy secretary said Monday. A maintenance worker who tried to warn others was among those shot, according to U.S. Navy Cmdr. Tim Jirus. Jirus told CNN he was standing in an alley at the bottom of a fire escape supervising the evacuation of Building 197 when a worker from a nearby maintenance building approached him. ""He walked up and told me that he heard that there was a shooter in our building,"" Jirus said. ""And we were just standing there maybe three feet away having a conversation, and then we heard two more gunshots, and he went down and that's when I ran."" Jirus said he did not know the man. He was ""fairly certain he is dead, because he was shot in the head."" ""I don't feel lucky that he got hit instead of me, but I feel lucky to be here,"" Jirus said. At least one person, and possibly a second, opened fire, District of Columbia Mayor Vincent Gray said. Police said one suspected shooter was killed. Three other shooting victims who were flown to MedStar Washington Hospital Center are expected to survive, hospital Chief Medical Officer Dr. Janis Orlowski told reporters about three hours after the attack began around 8:20 a.m. Monday. Dr. Orlowski gave more details later in the day about her patients, including a Washington Metropolitan police officer who was in surgery Monday afternoon ""for gunshot wounds that ""involve bones and blood vessels of lower legs."" ""He was most concerned about being able to talk to his mother and wanted to make sure he was able to speak to her before he went into surgery,"" Orlowski said. Doctors could know after another day about the police officer's chances of walking again, she said. Witness: 'He aimed his gun at us' and fired . The two other victims at MedStar Washington Hospital Center were women, including one shot in the shoulder and the other with a head wound, Orlowski said. A helicopter plucked one of the wounded women from a roof and carried her to the hospital, she said. ""Their chances of survival are very good,"" she said. The patients were all in stable condition, she said. The woman with the shoulder wound was ""in very, very good spirits,"" Orlowski said. ""She's actually ordering the doctors and nurses around, and we told her we are in charge here."" The other woman suffered a ""significant wound"" to her hand and head, but the bullet didn't actually penetrate her skull, she said. Her father rushed to the Navy Yard when he heard about the shooting, Orlowski said. He found her as paramedics were treating her on the scene, she said. The three patients were each alert when they arrived at the hospital and they sometimes talked about the shooting, Orlowski said. The most common question was about the fate of their co-workers. ""They're very worried about their colleagues,"" she said. ""It's the only question that I've heard about the incident. We've not shared that with them."" Mabus went to the hospital to check on the two women, who are Navy employees. ""We got to meet one of the victims, a young woman and her family,"" Maybus said. ""She is, under the circumstances, doing very well. I also got to talk to the husband of the second victim, who is in surgery right now. But none of the injuries are expected to be life-threatening."" Relatives of people who worked in Building 197 gathered near the Navy yard, hoping for information about their loved ones. Jacqueline Alston said she has not heard from her husband, Ernest, who is a custodial worker there. ""Right now, I'm asking God to let me hear that voice, to let me see that man again,"" Alston said. ""All I know is, I'm supposed to be patient, which I am trying to hold on, being patient and understanding, and ask God what created this problem? What started this?"" Mabus said Monday that it could take 24 to 35 hours for Navy officials to account for everyone. He gave two telephone numbers people can call to check on family members who may have been at the Navy Yard. The numbers are: 202-433-6151 and 202-433-9713 . ""When you call we will not be able to give you a status report,"" Mabus said. ""We'll have to check and call back."" Latest developments .

"(CNN) -- Missy Franklin lives a double life. A normal teenager preparing for college, she is also a four-time Olympic gold medalist who is rewriting swimming's record books. When she's not dealing with the usual trials and tribulations of homework and school life, she's stepping out on the red carpet alongside Hollywood A-Listers. ""I describe my life as like Hannah Montana,"" the Pasadena-born, Colorado-based star told CNN. ""During the week I'm totally Missy, going to school every day and going to practice and just totally being me. ""But then at the weekend I'm flying out to the Golden Globes, going to these different events. It's crazy. It feels like I live a double life sometimes. ""But the way I describe it also is that it's not like my whole life has changed, just a part of it has changed."" While Franklin has not yet reached the profile of Hannah Montana, the schoolgirl/popstar played in the kids' TV series and movies by Miley Cyrus, she is on her way. On Sunday, aged 18, Franklin helped the U.S. women's relay team to victory in the 4 x 100 meter medley at the world championships in Barcelona, giving her a record sixth gold medal of the meeting -- an unprecedented total for a female swimmer. Only her legendary compatriot Michael Phelps has won more gold medals at one championships. The ""Baltimore Bullet"" took seven golds at the 2007 event in Melbourne. When Phelps hung up his goggles at the end of London 2012, he charged Franklin with matching his legacy and equaling his record haul of 22 Olympic medals. No pressure then, Missy. ""On the last night we were in London, he (Phelps) had finished swimming, he was done,"" recalls Franklin. ""He looked at me and said, 'I have 56 world records, you're going to try and beat it. You gotta get after me.' "" Franklin was one of a vanguard of young female swimmers who ruled the waves at last year's Games. China's Ye Shiwen took two gold medals and stunned the world with her record-smashing swim in the final of the women's 400m individual medley, while Ruta Meilutyte, an unassuming Lithuanian, breezed to gold in the 100m breaststroke at the tender age of 15. But it was Franklin who made the biggest splash, clinching four gold medals and a bronze to announce herself as swimming's coming force. ""I shocked myself!"" explains Franklin. ""I didn't have any of those expectations going in whatsoever, I was just happy to be there. Happy to be on an amazing Olympic team and to be able to call myself an Olympian was a huge achievement in itself. ""After that I just wanted to get out there and make my country proud. That was my only goal, whatever came with it came with it -- and that happened to be five medals. I couldn't have planned it any better."" With unexpected success comes new expectations -- and tough decisions. Notably she decided to postpone turning pro, temporarily spurning the possibility of earning millions of dollars in endorsements to become arguably the world's most marketable collegiate athlete. She also swapped Colorado for California, choosing to swim for the University of California's ""Golden Bears."" She plans to join the professional ranks after the 2015 NCAA Championships. Juggling swimming with academia is now her biggest concern. ""It's very difficult, it's super hard,"" says Franklin. ""I'm done with high school, which is super sad to think about because I'm going to miss it so much. ""You hear about what the Olympics can do for someone's career, but it's unbelievable how much it really does. I've been able to meet the most incredible people and I think that's been the best part. ""Going to the Golden Globes and the VMAs (MTV awards), seeing my favorite actors and actresses and singers, going to all of these events and meeting other incredible athletes. It's been life-changing. ""All the work is very hard to keep up with, but all my teachers and my friends are awesome at helping me catch up with homework. ""It's all about time management. Swimming has to happen and homework has to happen, so it's figuring out how to get those things to work together."" Another role Franklin has taken on is to encourage others to take up water-based sports. She spoke to CNN from the set of ""The Current,"" a film she is making with fellow American swimmer Mallory Weggemann -- a Paralympic gold medalist -- aimed at encouraging people with physical disabilities to take up scuba diving. ""We're making an inspirational documentary about helping people with physical disabilities find a passion for scuba diving,"" said Franklin. ""To help them realize that, even if you have a disability, it doesn't mean you can't do these things -- you might just have to do it a little bit differently. ""You can be free, you can let go of everything. That's one of my favorite things about swimming, no matter how hard my day was or how tired I am, I can just get into the pool and it doesn't matter. ""We're all equal when we get into the water, it's just us and the water. The water treats us all exactly the same."" Despite those sentiments, U.S. swim fans will be hoping ""Missy the Missile"" is without equal when she takes to the pool in future Olympic Games.","Missy Franklin becomes first woman swimmer to win six world championship golds .

"(CNN) -- An out-of-service Bay Area Rapid Transit train struck and killed two workers on a section of track northeast of San Francisco on Saturday afternoon, the transit authority said. The employees were making track inspections near the Walnut Creek station, BART said in a statement. One was an employee and the other a contractor. Their names were not immediately released. ""Our hearts and prayers go out to the families of the two workers who've just been killed on the BART tracks,"" BART General Manager Grace Crunican said. She said the accident is under investigation. Paul Oversier, BART's head of operations, told reporters that the two workers were looking into a possible slight dip in the rail when they were hit. The four-car train was on a routine maintenance run with an experienced operator at the controls, but at the time of the incident, it was being run in automatic mode under computer control, BART said. The cars were being moved back to a train yard after having been cleaned of graffiti, Oversier said. There were a number of other personnel on the train at the time, but officials have not had an opportunity to speak with them, Oversier said. All train cabs are equipped with video cameras. Victims were experienced employees, BART says . The victims had extensive experience working around moving trains, the transit authority said. The procedures involved in track maintenance require one employee to inspect the track and the other employee to act as a lookout for any oncoming traffic, it said. They were supposed to stay clear of the track and be able to clear the operating area within 15 seconds of a train reaching them, Oversier said. BART's union workers are currently on strike over a variety of issues, including wages. Oversier would not answer questions related to the strike, saying those issues were not at the forefront Saturday evening. He did say the BART employee who was killed was a member of American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, one of the striking unions, adding only that the man ""chose to come to work."" Another of the striking unions, Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1555, said it would not picket Sunday out of respect for the victims' families. ""This is a tragedy of the greatest proportions for the BART family,"" Oversier said. Saturday was the second day of the strike that has paralyzed the San Francisco area. BART workers went on strike for four days in the summer over the same issues. The BART system normally serves 26 communities, including San Francisco and Oakland. It has chartered buses during the strike, but those help only a fraction of the roughly 400,000 people who use the service each day.","NEW: Train was returning to yard after being cleaned of graffiti, BART official says .

"New York (CNN) -- We've turned the rich into caricatures. They're greedy ""fat cats"" with cigars dangling from their snarled lips. ""How dare the president call us fat! We're just big-boned,"" says a decidedly obese cat in a 2011 political cartoon by Stuart Carlson. ""It hurts my feelings deeply,"" another fat cat says. Other cartoons show them holding moneybags marked ""$."" You know, just so it's obvious. It's easy to mock the wealthy -- especially the ultra-super-rich, whose incomes have weathered the recession better than anyone else's, and who are taking home a chunk of the total economic pie that is obscene and unfair. Watch documentaries like ""Born Rich,"" by Johnson & Johnson heir Jamie Johnson, and it's impossible not to laugh, or vomit, as you see how detached many 1-percenters are from reality. One brags about her ""really fun"" family helicopter. ""I don't remember the evening all that clearly, but I've definitely spent several thousand dollars on a bar bill, probably,"" a gambling heir says, referring to a night of drinking in the Hamptons, outside New York. ""These things happen."" Things happen. Yep. This is all in good fun, but on the two-year anniversary of the Occupy Wall Street movement, which failed to achieve its goals of promoting economic policies that would shrink the rich-poor gap, it's worth asking ourselves: Is it fair to paint the super-rich as a homogenous set of villains? Or, more to the point: Is it productive? Last week, I put that question to former U.S. Labor Secretary Robert Reich, who is (and has been) one of the country's foremost advocates for narrowing the gulf that has emerged between rich and poor. His new documentary, ""Inequality for All,"" is to economic justice what Al Gore's ""An Inconvenient Truth"" was to global climate change: It's a powerful, if slightly wonky, outline of the problem, complete with charts, PowerPoint-type presentations and a spirited call to action. Other recent films on America's wealth gap, ""Park Avenue,"" for instance, hold no punches in the way their efforts paint the wealthy as detached jerks who are buying off politicians to support their needless and greedy habits. But Reich doesn't want to make villains out of the wealthy. ""I think that's wrongheaded and it doesn't lead to any constructive solutions,"" he told me in an interview with a few reporters in New York. His film aims to show how economic inequality hurts everyone. ""The rich would be better off with a smaller share of a rapidly growing economy,"" he told me, ""than they (are) now with a large share of an economy that is anemic -- that is basically not growing at all, largely because you don't have many people with much money to be able to sustain the economy and buy enough."" ""I think the rich would do better with a society that was less polarized,"" he added, ""with an economy that's less polarized and more collaborative, than they do now with a society that is very (much) at loggerheads."" The trouble is convincing them of that. Reich's film might be a start. One rich person it features is Nick Hanauer, a venture capitalist from Seattle who sold a company to Microsoft in 2007 for $6.4 billion and was ""the first nonfamily investor"" in Amazon, which, you know, is worth big bucks. But, unlike many money-mover types, Hanauer supports policies that economists say would help narrow the rich-poor gap and increase economic mobility. He says it's in his interest. In the doc, Hanauer talks about how he has tons of money to spend, and he does buy nice things, but he doesn't spend that much more than a middle-class person. ""I have the nicest Audi you can get,"" he says, ""but it's still only one Audi."" If dozens of middle-class people had his money, they'd buy dozens of cars, and dozens of everything, which would create more industry and more jobs. His businesses would have more customers. The economy overall would grow. Reich calls this the ""virtuous cycle."" Right now, we're stuck in a pattern he says is ""vicious"" -- where cash is ending up only in the hands of a few, and money is slipping through the fingers of those who would actually need it, and who actually would spend it in the economy. To reverse course, it would help to have the support of the rich -- those greedy fat cats we all love to hate. To convince them, though, maybe that means we need to stop thinking of them as villains -- and, instead, challenge them to be heroes. The wounds of the financial crisis are still fresh, five years out. But this anniversary should give us pause. We've turned both the very rich and the very poor into villains. Now the task is to think about how we can patch up and move forward. The opinions expressed in this column are solely those of John D. Sutter.","Tuesday is the two-year anniversary of Occupy Wall Street .

"ZURICH, Switzerland (Reuters) -- Nestle said it would plough profits into a $21 billion share buyback program and shun major acquisitions as pricing power helped it overcome soaring input prices to post a forecast-beating earnings rise. Nestle, producer of KitKat chocolate wafers and Perrier water, has seen an increase in net profit. The world's largest food company reported an 18.4 percent increase in net profit for the first half of 2007 to 4.916 billion Swiss francs ($4.1 billion) on Wednesday and said it was likely to beat its own results forecasts for the full year. Nestle shares jumped to the top of the European gainers list in an overall weaker market. ""The strong start to the year allows Nestle to expect above-target organic growth as well as a further sustainable improvement in margins for the full year,"" Nestle said in a statement. Chief Executive Peter Brabeck unveiled a surprise 25 billion franc share buyback and said he expected no major acquisitions in the future, just potential bolt-on buys, as the group digested recent medical and infant nutrition purchases. ""It is now time to consolidate,"" he told CNBC television in an interview following the results release. ""We do not see any major acquisition coming up."" Sales rose 8.4 percent to 51.1 billion francs as the company pushed through price increases to offset rising input prices for agricultural commodities such as coffee and cocoa. Organic sales growth in the period was 7.4 percent. ""This is a blow-out -- strong figures both in terms of revenues and particularly margins, and Nestle is clearly benefiting from its repositioning into health and wellness,"" said Jon Cox, head of food and beverages research at Kepler Equities. Nestle shares rose 5.5 percent to 476.5 Swiss francs at 0800 GMT as analysts focused on its earnings and sales growth, its improved 2007 outlook and the possibility of asset sales. Nestle and other food processing companies face rising prices for inputs such as milk and grains. But the Swiss-based conglomerate has said it has the muscle to command higher prices on the store shelves to compensate. The company has said it aims to raise prices, cull unprofitable products and speed up production rationalization to prepare for a lasting rise in commodity and energy prices. Nestle also signaled it was moving closer to a possible sale of U.S.-listed eyecare products company Alcon as pressure grows to shed some of its non-food operations, which also include top world cosmetics company L'Oreal. ""It is also clear that with our transformation to health and wellness and as that transition accelerates, Alcon becomes increasingly a financial rather than strategic holding, and we must assess it as such,"" said Chief Financial Officer Paul Polman in a conference call. Nestle owns a 77.55 percent stake in Alcon, which has a market value of $41.3 billion, according to Reuters data. The maker of KitKat chocolate wafers and bottler of Perrier water has led rivals Danone and Numico in raising shelf prices in anticipation of higher input costs. Danone and Numico have reported gains in underlying growth, though rising input prices have pressured their margins. Nestle said it would beat its long-standing earnings outlook -- to improve its EBIT (earnings before interest and tax) margin at constant currencies and reach underlying sales growth of 5 to 6 percent. Strong growth in emerging markets at 9.7 percent and in the group's pharmaceutical division, including Alcon, at 11 percent helped compensate for sluggish growth in Europe at 1.4 percent. Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast on average net profit of 4.56 billion Swiss francs ($3.8 billion) on a 7 percent rise in sales to 50.44 billion francs. Nestle shares had slightly outperformed the DJ Stoxx European food and beverage index from the start of the year to Tuesday's close, rising around 5 percent compared with around 2 percent for the index. Its shares trade at about 15.6 times forecast 2008 earnings, roughly in line with Unilever and the sector average of 16.2 times. E-mail to a friend . Copyright 2007 Reuters.

"(CNN) -- In his dreams it was probably a 30-yard screamer that ripped a hole in the roof of the net. The reality, of course, was different as Gareth Bale, the world's most expensive footballer, bundled the ball home from six yards out. It didn't matter. Bale may have made his name scoring spectacular individual goals for his previous club Tottenham Hotspur, but like all great players the 24-year-old has the knack of being in the right place at the right time. Read more: Real Madrid fork out $132 million for Bale . His 38th minute goal against Villarreal -- stabbing in Daniel Carvajal's low cross -- came at just the right time for his new team. The Spanish giants were second best for much of the first half and were trailing after Cani's 19th minute strike gave the hosts a deserved lead. Bale, who is still not fully fit after recovering from a groin injury, came out for the second half but only lasted 15 minutes -- his best effort a trademark long shot which flew narrowly over the crossbar. Read more: Real Madrid unveil Gareth Bale at Bernabeu . Shortly after scampering down the right wing, ball at feet, Bale's debut was over as Carlo Ancelotti hauled off his most expensive asset. But he had already made his mark. Cristiano Ronaldo gave Real the lead shortly after the Welshman departed -- his deflected shot finding the back of the net in the 64th minute before Giovani dos Santos equalized six minutes later. And that's how it stayed as both teams dropped their first points of the season. Blog: Will Belgium win the World Cup? The 2-2 draw leaves Real Madrid in fourth place, level on ten points with Villarreal who are third.

Chilean striker Alexis Sanchez's dramatic injury time winner saw Barcelona claim three points after looking like they had thrown away two. Dani Alves put the home side ahead with a 36th minute header and when Lionel Messi scored to make it 2-0 with 15 minutes to go all was going according to plan. But when Ivan Rakitic scored for Sevilla in the 80th minute and Coke equalized in added time, Barcelona looked to have blown it. Not for the first time, Messi showed his class when it mattered, engaging the brains and boots of several defenders before threading the ball back to Sanchez who stabbed the ball home. Barca's fourth win of the season keeps them top of the table, level on points and goal difference with Atletico Madrid who completed a more comfortable 4-2 win over Almeria. In Saturday's other La Liga fixture, Levante drew 0-0 with Real Sociedad. Meanwhile in Serie A, Inter Milan and Juventus dropped their first points of the season after drawing 1-1. The stalemate at the San Siro opened the door for Napoli to sit alone at the top of the table, at least for 24 hours, after they beat Atalanta 2-0 at the Stadio San Paolo. Fiorentina can join Rafa Benitez's side on nine points if they beat Cagliari on Sunday. AC Milan have a 2-2 draw with Torino to add to the loss and win they opened the season with.

"(CNN) -- Countries rarely default, at least not under the basic understanding of the term. If you or I can't pay our bills and creditors come calling, eventually we can declare bankruptcy and painfully move on. Most of our creditors get little or nothing back. And companies to do it all the time -- indeed, it seems a matter of course for U.S. airlines. But countries don't really go bankrupt. They choose to stop paying, one way or another. The difference? Countries get new tax payers every day. They are born or they migrate. Countries cannot become insolvent. They stop paying to save money. READ MORE: Nine things we missed during the shutdown . How do they choose to default? Politicians can flirt with financial suicide, as some members of the U.S. Congress are fond of doing. But let's be clear, the U.S. was not going to default. The showdown was just politics. ""The United States has enormous credibility and is at no risk of default,"" Anne Pettifor, of Prime Economics, told me. ""In my view there is no possibility whatsoever of the USA defaulting on its debt."" So, the USA cannot really default, thanks in part to a strong Federal Reserve and international creditors still wanting to buy its bonds, no matter how low the interest rate falls. But other countries have chosen to default, at least in theory. From Argentina to Russia to North Korea, countries have stopped paying the interest or principle on domestic or international obligations. In Russia's case, it was able to pay back creditors within a few years, thanks to the rise of energy prices. Russia did not walk away from its creditors. READ MORE: Five most surprising things in debt deal . Argentina was a much tougher case. When it stopped paying creditors in late 2001, it caused a great deal of pain for its citizens in 2002-2003. Its efforts to settle with creditors still bubble up in New York courts. No one can say Argentina has fully recovered its reputation in the international markets. Some bondholders simply refuse to take a portion of what they are owed and move on. They want their money back. Still its economy grew quickly within a few years of default. Does that mean that defaulting is not a terrible step? After all, it means a country can get a handle on its obligations. ""The debts become more manageable and therefore the country becomes more creditworthy,"" Pettifor said. Then, however, ""the creditors pile in."" READ MORE: Conservatives defiant in face of GOP troubles . Nazi Germany defaulted in 1933. The new government was not going to honor the obligations of the previous leaders. We all know how that went. It was decades before some of the German debt was paid back in a token way. No eurozone country has unilaterally refused to pay its bills. The market made it impossible for the like of Ireland and Greece to issue new bonds at a sustainable interest rate. New creditors stepped in, instead of walking away. We know them as the troika -- made up of the European Central Bank, European Union and International Monetary Fund. Greece's meltdown led to bondholders taking the ""haircut,"" yet the country is set to take another package of aid. But it can't inflate its currency (it lost that option when it joined the euro) and can't default (for the same reason). READ MORE: U.S. must shake this addiction to debt -- or kill the recovery . The latest plan is not the bailout, but the ""bail-in."" Look at Cyprus. Bond holders hold off, the depositors pay up (those forced to bail-in) and everyone holds their breath hoping the country can rebuild its economy and banking sector and eventually pay back something. After all, the troika expects to be paid back. If not, that would be a default. All this makes you wonder why the USA would even want to be mentioned in the same breath or paragraph with these countries.","People and companies default -- but countries rarely do, at least in the traditional sense .

"(CNN) -- The trial for deposed Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak, on Saturday was postponed until next month, state media reported.

"(CNN) -- It's becoming a clichÃ©: The tide is turning in the debate over cannabis. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent, publicly reversed his position and now supports medical cannabis. Republican Gov. Chris Christie just expanded New Jersey's medicinal marijuana laws.  In the past month, New Hampshire and Illinois have become the 19th and 20th states to approve medical marijuana. But the debate over medical marijuana obscures the more fundamental issue of our failed war on pot and the path to smart legalization. I had an opportunity to explore the full range of perspectives in the marijuana debate at the recent 2013 Annual Meeting of the American Psychiatric Association. What I learned can be simply stated: Nationwide cannabis legalization is coming and smart regulation is the key to its success. At the convention, held in San Francisco, I listened to and spoke with respected leaders of the opposition to cannabis legalization, who are mostly specialized in the treatment of substance use disorders. The Bay Area is a proving ground for California's liberal medical marijuana laws. Amanda Reiman, policy manager for the California branch of the pro-legalization Drug Policy Alliance, took me on a tour of local cannabis dispensaries. And Oaksterdam University invited me to speak at their makeshift headquarters -- their previous location was closed after a DEA raid last year -- where classes are offered on all things cannabis. The dispensaries are largely self-regulated, yet all facilities are immaculate, security is tight, and members of the staff are knowledgeable about the science of cannabis. Surely not all points of access are as well-run as these dispensaries, but they could be. And only with legalization and regulation can we expect that they would be. Most legalization advocates and opponents share concerns about underage pot use, an opposition to incarcerating users, and a recognition that marijuana is less harmful to adults than alcohol. Opinion: Americans agree, pot is no crime . Most agree public opinion has shifted in favor of cannabis legalization, although the two groups have strongly divergent feelings about the change. A minority of advocates call for America to ""free the weed"" with few restrictions, while opponents at the American Psychiatric Association fear that legalization would lead to ""a nation of drunken stoners"" after an anticipated rise in adolescent use of this and other drugs. The substance abuse treatment community has legitimate concerns, and recreational cannabis should not be legalized -- for minors. If national polls are correct, and wisdom prevails, then America is rapidly moving toward legal cannabis for adults. We must stop arguing about the right of consenting adults to consume a relatively safe recreational drug, and discuss how -- rather than whether -- cannabis should be properly regulated by the federal government. First, consider the four essential goals of marijuana regulation: keeping cannabis out of the hands of minors; reducing harm to adult users; preventing collateral harm to the public and getting the maximum economic benefit from legalization. Our approach to federal regulation should synthesize the perspectives of both advocates and opponents of legalization. We should look to research on laws controlling alcohol, tobacco and gambling. We can also learn from Colorado and Washington, which have developed regulations for recreational cannabis, and the 18 other states -- plus the District of Columbia -- that have legalized medical marijuana. We can achieve the essential goals of regulation if we: . â¢ Require proper labeling of cannabis products, including the quantities of key ingredients like THC and CBD. â¢ Test cannabis products for contaminants and label accuracy. â¢ Require government supervision of all facilities involved in the production, distribution and sale of cannabis. â¢ Limit advertising, sales and public consumption of cannabis products the way we do with alcohol and/or tobacco. â¢ Ban cannabis packaging and advertising that targets or attracts underage users. â¢ Require child-resistant packaging for edible cannabis products. â¢ Impose penalties on adults who enable minors to get marijuana. â¢ Allow adults to grow a small number of cannabis plants for personal use. â¢ Prosecute cannabis-impaired driving with field sobriety tests. â¢ Continue restrictions on cannabis use by professionals and laborers when scientific evidence indicates that such use risks public safety. â¢ Empower states and municipalities to restrict the cannabis trade within their borders. â¢ Fund education of adults about the use and abuse of cannabis. â¢ Fund preventive youth education about the dangers of underage cannabis use. â¢ Fund treatment of adults and minors with cannabis use disorders. â¢ Tax all aspects of the cannabis trade at the highest rate that the free market will bear, using a portion of the proceeds to fund regulation, education and treatment. Just as responsible fishermen support the conservation of marine ecosystems, even marijuana enthusiasts can offer smart ideas for the successful legalization of cannabis, the fiercest critics of pot legalization have legitimate concerns, particularly about pot's effects on developing brains of young people. Advocates and opponents need to come together for an open-minded discussion about the regulation of marijuana in the United States. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Nathan.","David Nathan: Medical marijuana debate obscures the issue of legalizing recreational use .
In legalizing pot, he says, concerns of both sides of the issue need to be considered .

"Dhaka, Bangladesh (CNN) -- The father of a 21-year-old foreign exchange student nabbed by anti-terrorism teams in New York over an alleged plot to blow up Manhattan's Federal Reserve Bank says his son is a timid man who was often scared to travel alone and that he simply doesn't believe the terror accusations. ""I don't believe my son has any link to any terror groups,"" said Quazi Mohammad Ahsanullah, a banker in Dhaka. ""I urge the government of Bangladesh to bring back my son."" He said he learned of his son's capture after a relative phoned him Thursday and told him to turn on the news on television. ""We're really stunned,"" he said. ""We couldn't believe our eyes. ... We couldn't believe our ears. It came to us out of the blue."" Terror plotting: Bravado or sincerity . Federal authorities in New York arrested Quazi Mohammad Rezwanual Ahsan Nafis on Wednesday after they say he tried to detonate what he thought was a 1,000-pound bomb, using his cell phone as a trigger. Inspired by al Qaeda, they say, Nafis now faces a slew of terror charges with evidence largely derived from an undercover agent that the Bangladeshi national allegedly contacted to help further his plot. But Ahsanullah instead described his son as a shy young man who left college in Missouri after one semester because of the expense and took a job in New York, working 10-hour days at a hotel. During his short time at the school, Southeast Missouri State University, Nafis was elected an officer of the Muslim Student Association, a school official said. ""He was elected vice president at the very end of the spring semester. But since he left our university shortly thereafter, his tenure as an officer was very short-lived,"" Ann Hayes said. Bangladesh police on Thursday started investigating whether Nafis had any terror link, police said. ""We're not officially informed by the United States about the alleged plot and the subsequent detention, but we're looking into if Nafis had any terror link before leaving Dhaka,"" Monirul Islam, chief of the detective police in Dhaka, told CNN. The detective police in Dhaka picked up the parents and some other relatives of Nafis from their Jatrabari residence and questioned them about his past activities on Thursday evening local time. ""We haven't arrested anyone... we've brought them to know some information regarding Nafis,"" Islam said adding, ""We've just started the investigation, and we're yet to find any terror link of Nafis ... but we'll continue the investigation and interrogate more people who know Nafis. It may be his friends, teachers, neighbors and others."" Nafis graduated high school in 2006 and got his higher secondary school certificate examinations in 2008 before he enrolled with the country's leading private university, North South University, in Dhaka. As the authorities in New York alleged that Nafis traveled to the United States with ""the purpose of conducting a terrorist attack"" and actively sought out al Qaeda contacts after his arrival, his father claimed that he had allowed him to go to the United States for a better future. ""I can't believe this because as a father I found him very timid... sometimes he was even scared of traveling alone,"" Ahsanullah said. CNN's Carma Hassan contributed to this report.","Quazi Mohammad Ahsanullah: ""I don't believe my son has any link to any terror groups""

"(AOL Autos) -- Which star do you most associate with car-chase movies: Steve McQueen or Michael Caine? Gene Hackman or Burt Reynolds? Honor Blackman, star of the James Bond film ""Goldfinger,"" poses on an Aston Martin DB5 car in 2002. Although most car-chase movies pack some serious A-list talent, we like to think that in many cases the real star in this particular movie genre is the car: from McQueen's super-tight Ford Mustang in ""Bullitt"" to the stripped-down Dodge Charger in Quentin Tarantino's ""Death Proof."" But which movie has the best car-chase scene in history? We take a look. 10. ""Cannonball Run"" (1981) Almost everyone knows that Hollywood's cheesy celebration of America's intercoastal car culture is one big car chase involving spectacular cars, including a Ferrari 308 GTS, an Aston Martin DB5 and a gorgeous opening sequence where a Lamborghini Countach makes short work of a Pontiac Firebird police cruiser. But perhaps less well known is the original coast-to-coast sprint run undertaken by speed racer Erwin George Baker in 1914. The 11-day drive made his name in the New York press, who forever associated him with the Chicago Express steam train christened ""The Cannon Ball."" Trivia: The ambulance driven in the movie by Burt Reynolds and sidekick Dom DeLuise was a modified Dodge Tradesman used by Car and Driver editor Brock Yates when he tried to resurrect the famous race in the 1970s, as part of a protest against the onset of 55 mph speeding limits nationwide. 9. ""Death Proof"" (2007) Quentin Tarantino continues to push the limits of speed and taste in ""Death Proof."" The film is a stock car- and violence-infused tale that features for a quarter of its run-time a fantastic chase sequence involving a stripped down bad-ass 1969 Dodge Charger and a heavily modified 1970 Dodge Challenger with a girl -- actress and former stuntwoman Zoe Bell -- splayed on its hood. Apparently, Tarantino came upon the idea for a ""death proof"" car after filming the car-crash scene in Pulp Fiction and telling a friend he wanted to buy a Volvo for safety reasons. AOL Autos: 2009 Dodge Charger . The friend informed him that a decent movie stunt team could easily ""death proof"" any car for him. Hence was born the ""Death Proof"" movie concept. And Stuntman Mike. Doesn't that name still give you chills? 8. ""The Fast and the Furious"" (2001) Car chases ostensibly over a half mile, otherwise known as street racing, received attention when ""The Fast and Furious"" lifted the lid on a high-adrenaline Tokyo Drift racing scene that burgeoned in popularity in Japan and the U.S. in the late 1990s. The movie explored the phenomenon through a fictional world of ultra-hip hijackers who used heavily modified Japanese cars to steal high-end electronic components. It's a cops and criminals yarn with a high-octane twist that features some seriously customized old-school cars including a Honda Civic, Toyota Supra and a Mazda RX7 -- though if you look closely, a retro Dodge Charger also features, too. AOL Autos: Honda Civic . Tokyo Drift racing, where drivers work in teams while skidding all four wheels around a tight circuit, now features at many events on the IRL circuit, catching a tailwind from the movie's popularity. Look out for the new ""Fast and Furious"" film soon. 7. ""Mad Max II: The Road Warrior"" (1981) You'd be hard pressed to name any of Mel Gibson's cobbled-together vehicles in his 1981 sequel to ""Mad Max"" -- which may boast the highest number of chopped and recharged V8s outside of Havana, Cuba -- but that doesn't stop ""The Road Warrior"" being considered a car-chase classic and one of the best action movies out there. Motley collections of cut-throat bandits, nomads and braggarts populate Australia's barren, dystopian landscape and blow-up any number of heavy machines, including police cars, motorbikes and a big-rig fuel tanker. It's all in their quest for that all-important and -- in a post-apocalyptic world -- rare substance: fuel. The explosive 20-minute chase scene to end the movie still exhilarates nearly 30 years after the movie's release. And don't we all want an engine intake like Max's infamous ""blower?"" 6. ""Vanishing Point"" (1971) A Dodge Challenger R/T gives you some serious leverage when you're involved in a bump-and-run two-car contest on a one-track road in the middle of the American west -- and it's the only road out of the desert heat. AOL Autos: Dodge Challenger . Stanley Kowalski, a renegade Barry Newman, used five separate first-generation Challengers, including the 375-horsepower 440 Magnum, to full effect in forcing numerous hapless drivers off the road on the hazard-ridden 15-hour sprint from Denver, Colorado, to San Francisco, California, as he's pursued by cops, racers and bandits alike. Dodge released its highly anticipated and heavily retrofitted Challenger update in 2008, with the film's cult following no doubt waiting patiently for any word on a commemorative ""Vanishing Point"" model. 5. ""Gone in 60 Seconds"" (1974) We're not talking about the remake starring Nicolas Cage and Angelina Jolie, which boasts some pretty spectacular car-chase sequences itself, but the 1974 original that features a 34-minute chase sequence over the Long Beach, California, ports complex that some consider the best ever captured on celluloid. A mediocre cast and stilted dialog may put off many, but the film that centers around a group of car thieves and their bid to steal 48 cars over a couple of days accomplishes what it set out to do: Exhilarate viewers in movie theaters and destroy as many cars as possible (in this case, 93). An amazing collection of Ford Mustangs, Rolls-Royces and Cadillac limos make up the list that car thief H.B. ""Toby"" Halicki -- who did all his own stunts -- is given to steal for a South American drug lord. Few, though, compare to the film's famous 1973 Ford Mustang Mach 1, christened ""Eleanor"" and driven by Halicki. 4. ""The French Connection"" (1971) Gene Hackman bumping and weaving his way around the intersection of Stillwell Avenue and 86th St of Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, while pursuing a bandit on a subway train offers to this day a fantastic driver's eye perspective of driving through New York at rush hour. We're just kidding. But the chase featuring a 1971 Pontiac LeMans remains a classic as a result of its impromptu crashes that weren't supposed to be part of the action but were left in the sequence after several stunt drivers mistimed their entrance into the car chase, striking Hackman's car instead of narrowly avoiding it as he chases a train-bound drug dealer. The sequence took several days to shoot even though the chase's screen time is barely two-and-a-half minutes. Director William Friedkin also put together a similarly fantastic car chase in 1985's ""To Live and Die in L.A."" 3. ""The Italian Job"" (1969) Michael Caine's famous ""You're only supposed to blow the bloody doors off,"" has become a familiar refrain among ""Italian Job"" fans who love the British actor's Cockney twang and the 1969 comic car caper that saw a collection of car thieves attempting a high-stakes bank heist in the Italian city of Turin. Indescribably hip on its release, and a personification of Cool Britannia, the famous car chase featuring three red-white-and-blue Minis motoring through tight streets -- and even indoors -- was a landmark in quirky and fun car-chase sequencing and cinematography. The 2003 remake cleverly twinned audience appeal with the film following the 2001 release of BMW's new MINI Cooper that featured in the updated film, leading some to suggest it was merely a two-hour commercial for the new model. AOL Autos: MINI Cooper . Trivia: Turin, or Torino, forms part of Italian car giant Fiat's moniker-- Fabbrica Italiana Automobili Torino. 2. ""Ronin"" (1998) Although it will never be regarded as Robert de Niro's best dramatic performance, 1998's ""Ronin"" doesn't land on our list for its dialogue. In unbelievable realism, viewers are treated to chase scenes with sport sedans such as a BMW M5, Peugeot 406 and, perhaps most famously, an Audi S8. Plenty of police cars, trucks and motorcycles meet their end and more than 300 stunt drivers were employed to give the real-time chases scene an air of metal-crunching realism amid a character-driven plot that involves CIA operatives, mercenaries and multiple double-crosses surrounding a mysteriously valuable briefcase. There are few actors that can capture the mixture of terror and exhilaration involved in a car chase quite like De Niro, while Jean Reno is the only actor who could make driving a Peugeot an exercise in steely manhood. Director John Frankenheimer pretty nearly perfected the art of filming gritty car chase sequences in 1966's ""Grand Prix."" 1. ""Bullitt"" (1968) ""Bullitt"" is perennially voted one of the best car movies of all time and we're comfortable following suit. In the 1968 classic, real-life racing enthusiast Steve McQueen barrels after bad guys on the streets of San Francisco in an epically cool 1968 Ford Mustang in a delicious ""Highland Green"" color. AOL Autos: Ford Mustang . In a cityscape that gets most drivers nervous for its ups and downs, San Francisco proves the ultimate car chase backdrop. Lieutenant Frank Bullitt is not only one of the coolest cops of all time, he proves to be one of the best wheelmen we've ever seen. This is a must-see film and hands-down the best car chase movie of all time.","In most car-chase movies, the real star is the car, author says .

"(CNN) -- On the court and on the road all year round, tennis champion Rafael Nadal knows how to enjoy the traveling life. The former world number one has been jet-setting around the globe on the professional circuit since the tender age of just 15. Along the way, the man crowned the ""King of Clay"" has learned a trick or two about performing at his peak whilst living out of a suitcase -- not to mention winning the most sought after titles in tennis. Here he shares his top tips for making a success of life on the road. On a lifetime of travel ... I started to travel like this at the age of 15 so for me, it's normal. Some days you get tired and you feel ""I want to stay at home a little bit more,"" but it's only the moment. Later when I am in different places, normally I feel very well and happy and excited. See also: What the world spends on business travel . On keeping family and friends close ... I normally have a group of good people around me and that helps a lot. Be with the people that you feel comfortable with. When you travel around the world and you visit the same place every year, then you (eventually) feel a little bit like home in most of the places. On the perfect hotel room ... It's important to have a good space in the room, especially for me because normally we have a lot of things in the room, a lot of racquets (and) I need the space for massage table. I like to feel that everything is completely clean. It's important to feel that the bed is good ... for the back, for these kind of things. On co-owning a luxury hotel in Mexico ... I am from an island, from Mallorca, so I know what things I really try to find when I visit a place. The views from the hotel to the beach, to the sea are very important to me. See also: Creating the airport of the future . All my life I lived in front of the sea and always try to find the right views ... to have the chance to watch the sea from every place. (Also), when you are in a hotel in front of the sea, you need to relax. Here (at the Secrets Aura Resort on the island of Cozumel) is great in my opinion because even if the hotel is 100% full, you don't feel it. On packing light ... It depends how long will be the travel but this time ... for almost two months, I travel with three bags. Normally I travel with around five to seven racquets, that's all. (In a) tennis bag always you put shoes, you put strings, grips, these kind of things that without we cannot play tennis. On punctuality ... I am always late. I am relaxed always and at the end, the last moment, (it's) tradition for me. On conquering nerves whilst in the air ... If the plane moves, some turbulence, I am nervous flyer.

"(CNN) -- The IndyCar Series is examining ways to make the sport safer after its four-time champion Dario Franchitti and several spectators were injured in a horror crash in Houston. The Scottish racer suffered concussion and two spinal fractures, and underwent surgery on his right ankle, following a final lap accident at the Grand Prix of Houston Sunday. An official and two spectators were also taken to hospital for evaluation following the incident. ""IndyCar is thoroughly reviewing the incident,"" said a statement on IndyCar.com . ""Reducing the risks that are associated with racing is one of our highest priorities and receives our constant and on going focus. ""Our thoughts remain with everyone affected by (the) accident."" The crash in Houston came almost two years after British driver Dan Wheldon died during a multi car wreck at the Las Vegas Indy 300. Just months before his fatal crash in 2011, two-time Indianapolis 500 winner Wheldon had tested the prototype car chassis for the 2012 season. Following his death, the chassis, designed by Italian company Dallara, was christened the DW-12 in his honor. In May of last year, Dallara made further significant safety improvements to the chassis. These steps to improve safety may have helped Franchitti avoid serious injury. However, following the latest incident, IndyCar is once again reviewing safety for its drivers and fans.","The IndyCar Series is examining ways to make the sport safer .

"(CNN) -- With cups of tea and cucumber sandwiches at the ready, the Vatican has launched itself into the international sporting arena -- with the formation of the new St. Peter's Cricket Club. Organizers hope the team will take on challengers from the Church of England and other faiths, while inspiring legions of believers and cricket fans around the world. The refreshments were the backdrop to Tuesday's announcement of the club's formation by the Pontifical Council for Culture, with a little help from Australia. John McCarthy, Australia's ambassador to the Holy See, has been a driving force behind bringing a game that he acknowledges is baffling to many to the Vatican. ""They were wondering what this 'cricket' is, as to whether it's a game, or an insect or both,"" he joked in an interview for Vatican Radio. ""But can I say that there was fairly ready recognition of the fact that there is a very prominent position by this sport in the East ... (and) in the English-speaking world, and that there are many priests and seminarians in Rome who have played cricket and want to play cricket. Many in Rome would like to see their newly fledged team play the Church of England, McCarthy said. He anticipates discussions soon aimed at arranging a match between the two sides in England -- a game that could prompt a rivalry not seen since the Church of England split from the Roman Catholic Church nearly 500 years ago. Fans will no doubt hope that game is played at Lord's Cricket Ground in London, known as the home of cricket. Members of the new club are expected to play in the yellow and white Vatican colors, with the keys of St. Peter as their emblem. And both sides may end up praying for divine intervention if the umpire doesn't call in their favor. McCarthy also sees the Vatican club as having a wider reach. ""Cricket as a sport is something that covers many, many religions and ethnic groups ... the Vatican could play the Hindus, they could play the Muslims, they could play the Sikhs,"" he told Vatican Radio. ""Internationally one would have a team that represented the Vatican, the Holy See, that was drawn from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Australia, England, New Zealand, South Africa and the West Indies -- what an international team that would be. ""And it would obviously generate a lot of interest with the faithful who are both faithful to the church and faithful to cricket in various areas of the world."" Some students have already been warming up with a series of matches in Rome, McCarthy said. But the wider program is not expected to come into play until next year, when the club hopes to have a team ready for international sporting events. And it's not just the priests who can get in on the sporting action. The organizers are also looking for nuns who may have wielded a cricket bat in the past to join a women's XI, or team. ""They are looking for Sri Lankan, Indian and Pakistani sisters who have played cricket, and if they are found, they certainly will be invited to join the cricket club,"" said McCarthy. ""There's certainly no intention not to have a women's cricket team at the Vatican."" CNN's Talia Kayali contributed to this report.","Vatican announces the formation of St Peter's Cricket Club .

"(CNN) -- One of Japan's largest banks on Friday announced a loss for the nine-month period ending December 31, hit by weak markets and a recession at home. Mitsubishi UFJ said higher credit costs and stock losses also contributed to its deficit. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group reported a net loss of Â¥42.07 billion ($467.44 million) in the April-December period, its first loss since the group was launched in 2005.

The group slashed its net profit forecast to Â¥50 billion ($546 million), from a previous projection of Â¥220 billion ($2.4 billion). The bank blamed the bleak outcome on a ""decrease of net fees and commissions"" in businesses such as investment trust, insurance securities and real estate. Higher credit costs and stock losses also contributed to the deficit, the company said. Meanwhile, Reuters.com quoted Japanese financial daily, Nikkei, as saying the ""mega bank"" -- which has already taken a Â¥100 billion valuation loss due to the stock market downturn -- may face further write-downs since stock prices have continued to fall.","Loss compares to a profit of $3.44 billion for the same period a year ago .

"(CNN) -- Australia's bushfires have such a long and destructive history there's almost no day of the week that hasn't been dubbed ""black"" or ""ash"" to mark a major conflagration. There was Black Thursday in Victoria in 1851, which destroyed five million hectares and claimed 12 lives -- the first large-scale bushfire in the history of white settlement in Australia. Since then there's been Red Tuesday in 1898 in Victoria, which consumed 2,000 buildings, Black Friday in Victoria in 1938 that killed 71 and destroyed 3,700 buildings, and Ash Wednesday in the early 1980s that left 71 dead in the state of South Australia. Most recently in 2009, Black Saturday claimed 173 lives in the state of Victoria in southern Australia -- many of the victims unable to even get the distance of their own driveways before they succumbed to the intense radiant heat generated by a bushfire. Many argue that Australia's catastrophic bushfires are simply a fact of life on a continent where its flora, heavy with combustible eucalyptus oil, constitute something of a seasonal time bomb. Others say more sinister man-made factors are at work. Changing climate . Australia has had a troubled relationship with climate change -- its confused policies on a controversial carbon tax are credited with felling the Labor Party at the last election, while the new government controversially disbanded the country's Climate Commission -- but scientists say the latest bushfire season may turn up the heat on the climate-change skeptics. While the jury is still out on whether climate change is making conditions perfect for large-scale bushfires, scientists agree that bushfire seasons -- a regular occurrence on the Australian seasonal calendar -- are getting longer and the fires more intense. According to David Bowman, professor of forest ecology at the University of Tasmania, who has studied bushfires for more than 30 years, bushfire behavior is showing signs of change. ""The problem with Australia is that the records are pretty shallow, which makes it really difficult to talk conclusively about any of the fire activity. But when you piece everything together there's some very convincing evidence. Aggressive fires . ""Even the firefighters are reporting really unusual behavior,"" said Bowman, adding that firefighters are fighting bigger and more aggressive fires. ""Normally at night -- and this is borne out by firefighters in the United States -- the fire will quell as the temperature cools. But firefighters are saying that because of the heat, bushfires are burning just as fiercely at night. It's all getting pretty worrying."" He said duration was also a factor that was changing in bushfire behavior. ""It's no big deal to have a fire in October but to have one that has burned like this for more than a week at this level of intensity is unprecedented. ""We are now looking at really catastrophic fire weather -- for October it just doesn't compute."" Anatomy of a bush fire: How Australia's explosive forest fires work . A nation built on fire . Fire has been part of the Australian landscape since the dawn of time and its people have used fire as a farming tool for more than 40,000 years. One of the earliest colonial watercolors shows an Aboriginal man gently setting fire to land that now makes up Sydney's most expensive waterside suburb of Vaucluse. Known as fire-stick farming, this mosaic of fire management systems not only flushed out game such as kangaroos and possums, it created new growth which in turn attracted more game. With indigenous people no longer part of the forest management equation, some scientists argue the fuel load that builds up from Australia's notoriously combustible vegetation is now one aspect that needs to be addressed. Pyrogeography . Meanwhile, the emerging academic discipline of pyrogeography is looking at bushfires in Australia -- not just as a one-off catastrophic event -- but as part of an interconnected whole where forest fires around the world feed climate change and make conditions ripe for the propagation of even more fires. Bowman says that deforestation fires alone -- the fires that have been used to destroy forests since the industrial revolution -- account for about one-fifth of all carbon dioxide committed to the atmosphere. ""That's a very significant component in global warming,"" he said. One thing that is being noticed by scientists is that black carbon from forest fires is landing on ice sheets and accelerating ice melt. Slippery factors . ""These are tricky and slippery factors because there are places where feedback from fires is actually causing cooling, especially in places where the loss of forest has caused the snow to lie for longer leading to regional cooling."" Vegetation and natural conditions may change dramatically between New South Wales, Sumatra and California, but one thing these fires all share in common is that they are becoming more regular because the climate is becoming warmer. Bowman said that vegetation in parts of Victoria, which normally completely regenerates over a 50-year cycle, is now being burned as often as three times in the period of one decade. The particles from forest fires, he said, actually inhibit rainfall contributing to regional drying and warming, which creates a weather cycle conducive to fires. The problem for scientists, he added, was in connecting the dots with these patterns. ""It's like trying to find needles in haystacks.""","Australia has a long history of bushfires that predates white settlement .

"(InStyle.com) -- The holiday season is also the engagement season! A gorgeous cushion-cut stunner by Daniel K. Yes, you read that right. It's been said that nearly 40 percent of all marriage proposals occur between Thanksgiving and Valentine's Day. If you're one of the lucky ladies hoping for a ring this season (or one of the nervous gentlemen contemplating popping the question), use this guide to popular diamond shapes and cuts -- and the stars who sport them -- to get acquainted with the dazzling world of engagement rings. Emerald . No shape more aptly fits the diamond nickname ""ice"" than the emerald, a rectangular cut with lean facets extending down the sides. This elegant art deco shape received its confusing name during the 1920s, when it was typically used for emeralds. Characterized by a flat top and step-shaped side facets, an emerald cut cries out for a clean setting. Star Power: Eva Longoria, Ellen Pompeo, Melania Knauss . Asscher . The Asschers of Amsterdam, gem cutters for the British royal family, designed this striking, dramatic shape in 1902. A square with diagonally cropped corners and stepped sides, it features a high crown and sheds a gentle light. Star Power: Tameka Foster, Ashlee Simpson, Christine Costner . Cushion . A square with curved sides and rounded corners, this stone shines softly instead of sparkling. Cushion-cut center stones surrounded by tiny diamonds are especially in vogue. Star Power: Jeri Ryan, Courtney Ford, Guiliana DePandi . Princess . Think of this flirty, flashy option as the ""Yeah, baby!"" stone, and not only because it was dreamt up in London during the swinging sixties. The arrangement of the gem's many (49 to 144) facets produces a hall-of-mirrors effect. Star Power: Stephanie March, Kara Janx, Sarah Michelle Gellar . Oval . Ovals have been enjoying a high profile since Tom Cruise placed a gorgeous one on Katie Holmes's finger. The cool cousin of the round, the oval shares many of that stone's features, with plenty of sparkle and versatility when it comes to settings. The long shape is especially flattering. Star Power: Bridgette Wilson, Toni Braxton, Rebecca Romijn . Pear . Made to sit with the point facing up, this lusciously feminine (and unusual) cut frequently goes solo because few wedding bands fit easily beneath the large underside of this stone. Star Power: Katherine Heigl, Lela Rochon, Tiffany Fallon . Marquise . The name for this cut comes from 18th-century Versailles, where courtiers wore ship-shaped rings as a sign of their rank. Today the marquise can be worn lengthwise or sailing sideways across the finger. Star Power: Catherine Zeta Jones, Victoria Beckham, Portia de Rossi . Round . Created by Marcel Tolkowsky in 1919, the round diamond is the most popular shape for engagement rings. It's often called the round brilliant because it has triangular facets, arranged to direct light from the bottom of the stone up through the top for maximum sparkle. Star Power: Katherine McPhee, Roselyn Sanchez, Mary J. Blige . Radiant . This rectangular stone, introduced in the seventies, lives up to its name: By combining long, lean, step-cut and triangular facets, it refracts lots of light. So if you decide on this shape, keep the setting simple. Star Power: Heidi Klum, Leslie Grossman, Anna Chlumsky . Rose-Cut . Most diamonds have a flat top with facets on the edges and bottom, but a rose-cut diamond is domed and covered with facets. Carat for carat, rose-cut diamonds, which cast a mellow, soft light, are typically less expensive than other shapes. Star Power: Melissa Akey . Get a FREE TRIAL issue of InStyle - CLICK HERE!

"London (CNN) -- The attention into the crash of Asiana Airlines Flight 214 is now shifting to two areas. One, why did the incident happen? They will be looking at things like instrument landing systems, the glide slope, the approach of the Boeing 777, the way the pilot flew the aircraft and other key aspects. Secondly, they will be looking at the onboard training to get the passengers off as fast as they can. Video from passengers after the crash landing show slides deployed and people exiting well before fire really took hold of the aircraft. Asiana have confirmed there were 291 passengers plus 16 cabin crew onboard flight OZ214. Looking at video of the burned out wreckage and of smoke and fire soon after the crash, some may be surprised the casualty figures are so low considering there were more than 300 onboard. Main story: NTSB asked to do 'go-around' 1.5 seconds before impact . This is very reminiscent of an incident in Toronto in August, 2005 when an Air France plane crashed. Although there was a large fire in that crash, all 309 passengers and crew on the Airbus A340 managed to get off. Without ignoring the casualty figures from the San Francisco incident, it shows that aircraft crashes like this are proving to be survivable incidents provided there is adequate crew training and an awareness of passengers to know what to do when there is an emergency. Watch exclusive footage of the moment of impact . And those key things: Know where your exit is, know to leave your belongings behind and exit the plane quickly and orderly because that is the way planes are designed. The B777 aircraft is built so that everybody can get off the plane within 90 seconds even if half the doors are inoperable. And they work on that basis because as you can see in the Asiana incident, one side of the aircraft is a lot more damaged than the other -- and appears to be the main area of the fire -- so you wouldn't want to open the doors on that side. Importantly, there is an onus on passengers -- know where the emergency exits are, don't try and take your belongings with you and take notice of and follow crew instructions and directions. If you look at the image to the left you can see several passengers with bags -- one passenger with a carry-on roller case. Grabbing your carry-on luggage does not assist a speedy evacuation and observations like these will form part of a thorough safety investigation. If there is one thing we all can take away from a tragic incident like this, it is not to ignore those important flight safety briefings at the start of each flight we take. When I fly, I always take note of where my nearest exit is, whether it is three or four or whatever rows away. Those briefings exist for a reason. We've seen as well in recent years several airlines, such as Air New Zealand, add an entertainment value to their safety videos, in part to try and make sure more passengers watch them. An incident like the Asiana crash should really reinforce the value of being aware of safety and emergency procedures. Most of the planes we fly today are designed so passengers can get out within 90 seconds in an emergency. That is what we have seen in the case with this incident in San Francisco. And while flight crew training is vital, so too are the actions of passengers. Expert: Flight shouldn't have been close to hitting seawall . CNN's Andrew Demaria contributed to this report.","Incident similar to Air France crash in Toronto in 2005 -- all survived .

"(CNN) -- If ever there was an appropriate prize for a hole in one, the organizers of the Portugal Masters certainly found it when fun-loving Spanish veteran Miguel Angel Jimenez struck it lucky on the eighth at the Oceanico Victoria Course on the Algarve. The Ryder Cup star's seven iron approach to the 168-yard hole proved perfect -- and his reward? -- 100 bottles of red wine to restock his cellar. The 49-year-old Jimenez is known for his trademark cigars and a love of the grape as well as his outstanding play and was immediately presented with a bottle from his considerable haul by sponsors, the cheekily named SEXY wines, after his round. Jimenez came close to extending his own record as the oldest European Tour winner when beaten in a playoff for the Dutch Open by home player Joost Luiten last month but has been off the pace in his latest event. One of the early morning starters in the final round, Jimenez eventually carded a one-under-par 70 for five under 279, some way off the pace in the $2.71 million tournament. He has made a fine recovery from breaking his leg in a skiing accident last winter and currently lies 17th in the Race to Dubai standings with nearly a million dollars in prize money to his name. Jimenez's early heroics proved the perfect backdrop for a battle royale for the honors in Portugal. Scott Jamieson, who shot a brilliant 60 in the third round, saw his chances disappear after a disappointing back nine, as did overnight leader Paul Waring. It left the way clear for England's David Lynn to claim the title after an eight-under-par 63 left him one shot clear on 18-under 266. South African Justin Walters was an emotional second just two weeks after his mother passed away, finishing with a lengthy birdie putt on the testing 18th to seal the runner-up spot.","Miguel Angel Jimenez claims hole in one at Portugal Masters .

"(CNN) -- China is proving home from home for Novak Djokovic as he demonstrated yet again by rebuffing the considerable challenge mounted by Juan Martin Del Potro to retain his Shanghai Masters title Sunday in another three set classic. Last year Djokovic also went the distance to beat Britain's Andy Murray in a riveting final rated as one of the best matches on the ATP Tour in 2012, this time around he showed all his battling qualities to see off the Argentine ace 6-1 3-6 7-6 at the Qizhong Tennis Center. Sixth seed Del Potro had stunned new World No.1 Rafael Nadal in the semifinals, but could not repeat these heroics despite forcing a third set. Neither player could gain the crucial break of service in the decider, but Djokovic opened up 2-0 and 4-2 leads in the tie-break and won the title with a backhand winner down the line after two hours 33 minutes. It was his seventh of the season and came hard on the heels of winning the China Open last week where he beat Nadal in the final. He paid tribute to Del Potro after his latest triumph. ""He's a fantastic player and a great person,"" Djokovic told the official ATP Tour website. ""All the way up to the last point, I didn't know if I was going to win the match. It was a very even match. My motivation is there always, especially when I'm playing finals of such a big event."" The 26-year-old was winning his 20th straight match on Chinese soil and he improved to 62-9 for the season. Djokovic was also claiming 15th Masters 1000 crown and will head to the ATP World Tour Finals in London next month in confident mood ahead of that title defense. Del Potro had stunned Nadal Saturday, but his confidence would have taken an early dent as the World No.2 Djokovic swept through the opener for the loss of just one game. The 25-year-old sixth seed broke through in the second game of the second set on Djokovic's service and held his lead to take the match all the way. But once again Djokovic, 26, demonstrated his will to win under pressure and held firm to land the $729,725 top prize. Former U.S. Open champion Del Potro has booked his place for London, with other confirmed qualifiers Nadal, Djokovic and Spain's David Ferrer. Murray has withdrawn after surgery on a troublesome back ended his season. But this was little consolation for Del Potro after his heroics against Nadal gave him high hopes in the final. ""The match was really close and I think Nole played unbelievable points in the tie-break,"" he told the official ATP Tour website. ""It's a really bad loss for me now. I was really close to beating him after beating Nadal."" Meanwhile on the WTA Tour, top seed Angelique Kerber of Germany beat third seed Ana Ivanovic of Serbia 6-4 7-6 to win the tournament in Linz. Kerber clinched her place in the WTA Championships earlier this week.","Novak Djokovic retains Shanghai Masters crown .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Five former Blackwater Worldwide security guards pleaded not guilty Tuesday to voluntary manslaughter charges and other crimes stemming from a shooting incident in Baghdad that left 17 Iraqis dead. Former Blackwater Worldwide security Donald Ball, center, leaves court after his arraignment Tuesday. Each of the former guards has been charged with 14 counts of manslaughter, 20 counts of attempted manslaughter and one count of using a firearm in the commission of a violent crime. The five defendants, seated in a row at a courtroom table, remained silent in court, and as they entered and departed the courthouse. A lawyer entered their plea on their behalf. Attorney David Schertler, speaking for all the defendants outside the courthouse, predicted they will be proved innocent. ""We want to make it clear to everyone these men committed no crime. They were defending themselves on a battlefield in a war zone when this occurred,"" he said. If convicted, the defendants would face a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison for each manslaughter count, seven years in prison for each count of attempted manslaughter, and a 30-year mandatory minimum sentence for the firearms charge. Judge Ricardo Urbina set a trial date for February 1, 2010. He agreed with defense attorneys that preparations for the complex case will require a full year, including the likely need for lawyers to travel to Baghdad to gather information and conduct interviews. ""The United States government had a year and a half to investigate the case, and we did not. So we need a year to catch up,"" Schertler told reporters. Lead government prosecutor Kenneth Kohl did not comment outside court. The Baghdad incident, which occurred September 16, 2007, exacerbated the feelings of many Iraqis that private American security contractors have operated since 2003 with little regard for Iraqi law or life. It also created an extremely delicate political situation for the Bush administration and the Iraqi government. The five defendants are Donald Ball, 26, of West Valley City, Utah; Dustin Heard, 27, of Knoxville, Tennessee; Evan Liberty, 26, of Rochester, New Hampshire; Nick Slatten, 25, of Sparta, Tennessee; and Paul Slough, 29, of Keller, Texas. A sixth former security guard, Jeremy P. Ridgeway, 35, of California, has pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter and attempted manslaughter. Prosecutors did not bring manslaughter charges for three of the 17 fatalities because they do not believe they have enough evidence to win a conviction in those deaths. The company of Blackwater Worldwide does not face any charges. The indictment of the five men represents the first prosecution of non-Defense Department contractors under the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act (MEJA), which was amended in 2004 to allow the Justice Department to prosecute such personnel providing services ""in support of the mission of the Department of Defense overseas."" The attorneys for the defendants contend that Blackwater's employees in Iraq are exempt from the provisions of MEJA because the company has a contract in Iraq with the State Department, not the Defense Department. Also muddying the case are assurances of immunity initially given to the guards by State Department diplomatic security agents, who were investigating the incident before the FBI tried to interview them once it took over. The State Department maintains its agents did not offer blanket immunity from criminal prosecution, but promised only that the statements the guards made on the scene could not be used against them in any prosecution. But when the investigation was turned over to the Justice Department to examine possible criminal activity, FBI agents discovered some guards believed they were immune from prosecution and therefore refused to be interviewed again, complicating the FBI probe. A recently approved U.S.-Iraq Status of Forces Agreement pointedly specifies that U.S. civilian contractors will no longer be immune from Iraqi prosecution for crimes committed in that country. CNN's Terry Frieden contributed to this report.","Five guards facing 14 counts of manslaughter, other charges .

"(CNN) -- Shandong Province High People's Court in eastern China is set to deliver the results of the appeal of convicted former Communist party senior Bo Xilai this Friday, October 25, the court announced on its website on Monday. Under Chinese law, appellate judges can decide non-capital cases behind closed doors after consulting with both sides. The Chinese high court agreed to hear the appeal on October 8 after Bo Xilai was sentenced to life in prison for bribe-taking, as well as 15 years for embezzlement and seven years for abuse of power after he was convicted in September. China's Bo Xilai: From rising star to scandal . During the politically sensitive trial, which took place over several days in August, Bo, 64, denied the charges and strongly challenged the prosecution's case against him, according to accounts published by the Jinan Intermediate People's Court. Bo's glittering career, during which he drew both admirers and detractors for his populist policies, fell apart last year. The son of a revolutionary veteran, Bo rose to power as a city mayor, provincial governor, minister of commerce and member of the Politburo, the powerful policy-making body of the Communist Party. He had been tipped to ascend farther up the party hierarchy. From Gang of Four to Bo Xilai: Reporting from China's 'show trials' A charismatic and urbane politician, Bo was credited with a spectacular, albeit brutal, crackdown on organized crime during his time as the top party official of Chongqing, a metropolis in southwestern China. But when his deputy, Wang Lijun, walked into the U.S. Consulate in the city of Chengdu in February 2012 and told American diplomats that Bo's wife, Gu Kailai, was involved in a murder case, Bo's career began to unravel. Timeline: Bo Xilai's fall from grace . Wang's move precipitated Bo's political demise. Soon after news of the events began to emerge, Bo was removed from his party posts. The trial brought to light a wealth of eye-opening details about the apparently lavish and emotionally fraught life of his family and inner circle, giving Chinese people insights into how some of the ruling elite live. CNN's Steven Jiang in Beijing contributed to this report.","Shandong Province High People's Court to deliver results of appeal in Bo Xilai case .

"(CNN) -- A U.K. businessman whose death is at the center of a huge political scandal in China was not a spy working for Britain, the foreign secretary said. Neil Heywood was found dead in a hotel in the southwestern Chinese metropolis of Chongqing in November. The cause of death was reportedly ascribed to excessive alcohol consumption initially, and his body was cremated without an autopsy. But Britain asked China in February to investigate the matter further after being informed of growing concern about Heywood's case. The Chinese authorities have since put Gu Kailai -- the wife of the former Chongqing party chief, Bo Xilai -- under investigation in relation to Heywood's death. And Bo has been ousted from his top Communist Party posts and placed under investigation in connection with ""serious discipline violations."" Speculation has been rife about the nature of Heywood's work in China and his ties to Bo's family. Heywood had lived in China for more than a decade and was married to a Chinese woman. Among the companies Heywood advised was Hakluyt and Company a consulting firm founded by former officers of the British spy agency MI6. That link fueled rumors that Heywood might have had connections to the British intelligence services. But in a letter to a British lawmaker this week, William Hague, the British foreign secretary, denied that possibility. ""Mr Heywood was not an employee of the British Government in any capacity,"" Hague said in the letter, which was seen Thursday by CNN. Hague noted that government policy is usually ""neither to confirm nor deny speculation of this sort."" But he said he was making an exception ""given the intense interest in this case."" CNN's Laura Perez Maestro contributed to this report.","Neil Heywood was found dead in a Chinese hotel in November .

"(CNN) -- Seventy-four Cleveland police officers will face disciplinary action for a 2012 pursuit in which two people were killed in a hail of 137 bullets, police Chief Michael McGrath said Friday. The news conference dealt only with the pursuit, not the use of deadly force, which is still under investigation and will be addressed at a later date. A review of the incident shows that on the night of November 29, the police force had 277 officers on duty. Of those, 104 were involved in the chase, McGrath said. ""It was really a tragic pursuit,"" the chief said. ""When those officers started their tour of duty that evening, they started it with good intentions."" The disciplinary actions for the 74 officers will range from reprimand to suspension, McGrath said. Their violations include insubordination, endangerment of pursuit, improper emergency response driving and leaving the city. The incident began when officers saw a car speeding and heard what they thought was a gunshot, according to CNN affiliate WOIO. Police pursued the vehicle, and the driver, Timothy Russell, refused to stop, police told the station. Though officers reported seeing a gun in the car, no weapon was ever found, WOIO reported. The 23-minute chase took officers to East Cleveland, where 13 of them fired 137 shots, killing Russell, 43, and his passenger, Malissa Williams, 30, CNN affiliate WJW reported. In June, 12 officers, including a captain and a lieutenant, were disciplined. Nine were suspended, two were demoted and one was fired, according to media reports. Officers may face more disciplinary action once the deadly force review is complete, McGrath said. CNN's John Branch and Eliott C. McLaughlin contributed to this report.","A driver, 43, and passenger, 30, were killed after a 23-minute chase in Cleveland .

"(CNN) -- Your city is Maxime Charveron's blank canvas, and it's no longer spray cans he is painting with. As a graffiti-obsessed tearaway teenager in the French city of Lyon, Charveron used to paint the town red, as well as blue, yellow, white and any other color he could get his hands on. Hauled in front of the French courts after one particular spree, the then 15-year-old was slapped with a $33,000 fine, one his distraught parents were unable to cover. It was a brush with the law that would thrust Charveron towards his destiny as a BMX freestyle trailblazer. ""My parents didn't have a lot of money -- I killed them with that,"" the man who describes himself on Twitter as a ""clown Pro-BMX rider from the cheesiest country in the universe"" told CNN's Human to Hero series. ""My dad was really scared, he had no money. He was not really angry against me but he said 'Dude, we are done, all the family is done' and I was like 'Phaooo.' I thought 'I just need money and I need to do something to get out of this situation.' ""I started riding really seriously because there was a BMX tour contest in France with a car to win, so my aim was to win this car, then to sell it, pay my fine. ""I did it, so then I thought I'm going to keep riding BMX and live like that."" So in the best traditions of guerrilla art forms, Charveron continues to carve his own arcs through the environment around him, grinding rails and finding flow and meaning in functional structures. A legacy of broken bones is a small price to pay for the exhilaration it brings him and the people lucky enough to watch him at work. Charveron has a string of titles to his name, and a cherished fourth place at the International Festival of Extreme Sports in Montpellier this year. His desire to push the parameters of what is possible on a bike serve as a unique blend between BMX and the principles of Parkour -- where free-runners vault, jump and glide over and around the urban landscape. ""Maybe I'm a little bit better than the others at BMX because I'm less scared and I'm determined,"" he said. ""It's about pushing the limits and finding new things to do all the time. If you've got a new spot you will find new things to do. There are no rules. ""In BMX freestyle there are different types of riding, there is the street -- you ride on the street -- there is dirt -- you ride on jumps -- you can ride in a skate park, you find everything you want in a small place, and then there is the flat land. ""It's like a dance with the bike on the floor. For me I ride street, skate park and dirt. And I just want to do my best on all of them."" Polished videos of Charveron's skills are stuffed full of tricks; one moment he might be sliding backwards down the handrail of a flight of stairs, the next leaping into the air after whizzing round the curve of a defenseless Lyon building. But some also showcase the often unseen trial and error stage, when Charveron's bike and body end in a crumpled heap on the floor. It is a painful necessity in the process of trying to perfect a new trick. ""Sometimes it takes a long time for your brain to make your body do it,"" Charveron said. ""Sometimes I just think about one trick for two months, and one day, when I feel good, I try the trick and it works like that! Just pull it. Maybe I will crash one time, two times, then I will pull it. Easy. ""I think the hardest part of BMX is to be injured all the time. As soon as you ride, as soon as you try something, you can be sure to have a small cut on your leg or to be hurt somewhere. ""I had a lot of injuries: a popped out shoulder, a twisted knee, a broken foot, surgery on my ankle. I have been knocked out maybe 10 times, I broke my nose when I was young, broke my arm when I was young. ""With BMX you need to crash, you need to fall to learn new tricks. As soon as you ride you will be hurt a little bit so you will be all the time injured."" It was at the age of nine that Charveron's interest in BMX was piqued by a magazine article. After a year spent pinching his sister's bike, he got his own and after nailing down the basics, learnt his trade on the deserted streets of Lyon under the cloak of darkness. ""When I started riding a lot at 15, I loved to hang out in the city alone during the night and ride street all the time,"" he explained. ""It was chilled, it was calm, during the night there is no-one on the street, everyone is in front of the TV with their families. ""It was weird -- it seems like you have the entire city for you, if you ride Lyon at 3am, there is no one on the street and you can do whatever you want -- I love that. ""It inspired me because there is a real atmosphere on the street. I am scared about nature, I would hate to be in the forest alone and ride but I love being on the street because of the atmosphere of the buildings. ""I think it's comfy; it's like I feel like home, it's hot, I can stay on the street, it's like my office."" As a pioneer of his chosen discipline, he is constantly protective of its integrity, and claims many of the current crop of freestylers in France are in it only for fame. ""It's about taking your bike and riding for pleasure, not to be famous, or make a video, it's just about riding BMX,"" he said. ""I think with the internet -- Instagram, Facebook, Twitter -- I think the kids (have) lost it, now when they go to the skate park they all have camera stuff to make videos. ""I do the same and I think it's normal, but in one way I think it's sad because they're in the skate park and they're not even riding, they're doing it to put their videos online and be famous.""","Maxime Charveron is a freestyle BMX biker from Lyon in France .

"(CNN) -- Bo Guagua, the son of embattled Chinese Communist cadre Bo Xilai, has issued a statement defending his actions and his academic record following allegations his college ""party boy"" image had contributed to his father's fall from grace. In a statement posted on The Harvard Crimson -- the Website for the daily newspaper at Harvard University where Bo, 24, is a graduate student -- he said he wanted to answer some of the charges leveled against him; among them that he did poorly academically, that he entered prestigious colleges because of his connections and that he drove a red Ferrari to pick up a date. But he was reluctant to comment on his father, who has been stripped of his political posts, and his mother, Gu Kailai, who is in custody as a murder suspect in the death of British businessman Neil Heywood. Insider's take on China's great drama . ""I am deeply concerned about the events surrounding my family, but I have no comments to make regarding the ongoing investigation,"" he said. The president of The Harvard Crimson Ben Samuels told CNN he was confident the statement was genuine, adding that its website was crashing because its server was overloaded. He said he presumed the server was struggling due to traffic from China and had not been hacked. In the statement, which was laid out in a series of bullet points, Bo denied rumors his connections had gained him places at some of the world's most exclusive schools.

Bo also defended his academic record, saying that he had gained straight As in his school A-level exams when he was 18 and gained a 2:1 (second class, first honors) in Politics, Philosophy and Economics at Oxford University in England. He added that he had achieved a First in the Philosophy component of the degree. Photographs of a bare-chested Bo at college balls had presented a ""party boy"" image, but he defended his attendance at the functions as a normal part of college life. ""During my time at Oxford, it is true that I participated in 'Bops,' a type of common Oxford social event, many of which are themed,"" he said. ""These events are a regular feature of social life at Oxford and most students take part in these college-wide activities."" He added that he had been involved in a not-for-profit social networking site in China aimed at assisting ""NGOs in raising awareness of their social missions"" and connecting with volunteers. ""I have never lent my name to nor participated in any for-profit business or venture, in China or abroad,"" he added. Another widely reported story alluding to a lavish lifestyle suggested Bo had once arrived at the U.S. Ambassador's residence in Beijing in a red Ferrari to pick up a daughter of Jon Huntsman, the ambassador at the time, for a dinner date. ""I have never driven a Ferrari. I have also not been to the U.S. Embassy in Beijing since 1998 (when I obtained a previous U.S. visa), nor have I ever been to the U.S. Ambassador's Residence in China,"" Bo said in the statement. ""Even my student visas were issued by the U.S. Consulate in Chengdu, which is closer to my home of five years."" Bo ended with an appeal to the media. ""I understand that at the present, the public interest in my life has not diminished. However, I wholeheartedly request that members of the press kindly refrain from intruding into the lives of my teachers, friends and classmates,"" he said. Rumors over his allegedly flamboyant college lifestyle have played poorly in China where his father, the former Chongqing kingpin, promoted a revival of Maoist-style ""red culture,"" while pursuing a widely publicized -- but brutal -- crackdown on organized crime in the city. One family associate told CNN recently there was little sympathy in China for what many regard as the typically spoiled offspring of the Communist Party elite.","Bo Guagua issues a statement in The Harvard Crimson defending his record .

"(CNN) -- A woman who tried to beat up her ex-boyfriend's son with a five-pound dumbbell and smother him with a pillow is now facing an attempted murder charge, police in Maryland said Wednesday. Helen Marie Newsome, 26, broke into a home in Landover and hid inside for 10 hours before she attacked the 8-year-old in bed Saturday morning, Prince George's Police Capt. Jimmy Simms said. ""Newsome grabbed a pillow and placed it over the child's face and then began striking him in the head with a weapon,"" police said in a statement. The boy fought back and ran away. Police hailed him as a hero on Wednesday. ""Not only does he have the know-how to get away from the danger, but he sees who it is that attacked him and tells the police,"" he said. ""This young boy (is) only 8 years old and fought back to someone who was trying to take his life. It is a very heroic thing to do."" The boy, who had multiple lacerations on his head, was treated and released from the hospital, police said. CNN affiliate WJLA reported that woman had been hiding in a closet and attacked when the boy's father left for work. The boy's father had broken off a relationship with her last week, WJLA said. ""She tried to hurt him by hurting me, 'cause he loves me more than anything, cause I'm his son,"" the boy told the CNN affiliate. Police say Newsome, who also has a 1-year-old child with the boy's father, is charged with first-degree attempted murder and is being held on $500,000 bond. ""She has admitted her involvement in the assault,"" police said in a statement. The suspect was remorseful when police arrested her Saturday, authorities said. At her house, police found bloody clothing, items she allegedly stole form the house and the dumbbell she allegedly used to hit the boy, Simms said. Newsome appeared in court for a bail hearing on Tuesday, court records show. It was not immediately clear Wednesday whether there was an attorney representing her or whether she had entered a plea.

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama on Monday will announce Thomas E. Perez, U.S. assistant attorney general heading the Justice Department's civil rights division, as his nominee for the next secretary of the Department of Labor, according to a White House official. A former federal prosecutor and an official in his home state of Maryland, Perez was sworn into his current post in October 2009. CNN's Jessica Yellin reported earlier this month that Obama would name Perez to the Cabinet position. If approved, he would take the position recently held by Hilda L. Solis, a former congresswoman who resigned in January. In a letter to colleagues announcing her departure, Solis said she'd ""taken our mission to heart."" ""As the daughter of parents who worked in factories, paid their union dues and achieved their goal of a middle class life, and as the first Latina to head a major federal agency, it has been an incredible honor to serve,"" she wrote. Perez, who is himself Hispanic, and his office have been active in several high-profile cases in recent years. They include: . -- In 2010, Perez launched a probe into the law enforcement tactics of Maricopa County, Arizona, Sheriff Joe Arpaio after the controversial sheriff's hard line anti-immigration policies led to accusations of civil rights violations. The Justice Department determined that Arpaio had engaged in ""pattern or practice of wide-ranging discrimination against Latinos and retaliatory actions against individuals who criticized"" his department's activities. Arpaio condemned the investigation as politically motivated and a ""witch hunt"" provoked by the Obama administration's disfavor of the state's controversial immigration law. -- In October 2010, Perez filed a legal brief in response to a lawsuit brought by local landowners trying to prevent the construction of a mosque in Murfreesboro, Tennessee. In the friend-of-the court brief, Perez argued that practicing Islam is a freedom protected under the First Amendment of the Constitution. -- Perez also became involved in a controversial 2008 voting rights case after it drew attention from Republican lawmakers and became the target of a Justice Department Inspector General's report that slapped the department's voting rights section for having a lack of professionalism and pervasive warring between employees who disagreed politically. The case stemmed from a complaint against members of the New Black Panther Party who stood outside a polling station in Philadelphia on Election Day dressed in boots and berets and carrying a nightstick. Though civil charges for attempted voter intimidation were filed by the Bush Administration, they were dropped against three of four defendants after President Obama came in to office. Republicans called foul -- accusing the department's political leadership of getting involved in the decision. Though Perez had not yet been confirmed when the decision was made, he said in testimony to Inspector General Michael Horowitz in May 2010 that politics played no part in the decision. Horowitz was not satisfied with Perez's account of the situation, saying in his report that Perez should have tried to get more information before testifying. Perez was not accused of any wrongdoing, but he has been criticized for not doing enough to improve what the Inspector General described as a dysfunctional department with persistent ideological polarization spanning two administrations. Before rising to the Justice Department position, Perez led Maryland's Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation. This office is charged with ""safeguarding workers, protecting consumers, providing a safety net and cultivating a thriving workforce,"" according to its website. Perez also was on the Montgomery County Council from 2002 to 2006. He had earlier spent 12 years as an attorney in the Justice Department's civil rights division, rising to become deputy assistant attorney general during the 1990s. Perez also worked for late Sen. Edward Kennedy, a Massachusetts Democrat, and spent the final two years of President Bill Clinton's administration as head of the Health and Human Services Department's civil rights office. CNN's Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","Thomas Perez will be the nominee for labor secretary .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- A suspected U.S. drone strike in Pakistan's tribal region killed six suspected militants on Wednesday, intelligence officials told CNN. Two Pakistani intelligence officials said the suspected drone fired two missiles on a militant hideout in South Waziristan, one of the seven districts of Pakistan's volatile tribal region bordering Afghanistan. The intelligence officials asked not to be named because they are not authorized to speak to the media. Wednesday's strike is the first since March 17, when a drone strike in North Waziristan killed 44 people -- most of them civilians, two Pakistani sources said. Such strikes have inflamed tensions between Pakistan and the United States. Pakistan has formally asked the United States for an apology for the March 17 strike. The United States does not officially acknowledge the Central Intelligence Agency's secret drone program that targets al Qaeda militants, but it is the only country operating in the region with the capability to carry out such strikes. A senior Pakistani intelligence official told CNN drone strikes carried out by Americans -- once widely believed to have the tacit approval and cooperation of Pakistani intelligence -- are now carried out autonomously by the CIA. ""It's unilateral action,"" he said. The official expressed dismay after Wednesday's strike. ""What is this? A message (from the Americans) that it's business as usual, irrespective of what we ask of you? If it is, it's a crude way of getting your message across,"" he said. The official added that Pakistan had asked the United States to curtail its drone strikes in remote tribal areas. ""We are not necessarily saying stop. What we are saying is irrespective of tactical games, this is not useful in the long run,"" he said. ""We need a relook and to not be too trigger happy and be selective."" The drone strike came just two days after Pakistan's intelligence chief, Lt. Gen. Ahmed Shuja Pasha, met with CIA Director Leon Panetta at CIA headquarters to voice his government's complaints about CIA activities in his country. In addition to the aerial attacks, the Pakistanis are angered by what they say is the lack of transparency about the number of CIA operatives and the extent of American intelligence activities within their country. Although the U.S.-Pakistani relationship has been on rocky ground for some time, It came to a head when CIA contractor . Raymond Davis was arrested after killing two Pakistani men in Lahore. Although the United States said Davis was a security officer assigned to protect CIA officers, the Pakistanis maintained he was actually a spy whom they had been unaware of prior to the shooting incident. Pakistani officials insisted this week that the United States give them details about other CIA contractors in the country. A U.S. official who is not authorized to speak for attribution said there is a ""desire to expand cooperation across a wide range of joint activities with the Pakistanis,"" but would not elaborate on what steps the United States is taking. The official would not talk specifically about the drone strikes, but did say Panetta made it clear in his meeting with Pasha that ""his fundamental responsibility is to protect the American people and there will not be a halt to operations that support that objective."" The official said the United States has ""an obligation"" to protect American troops fighting militants on the Afghanistan side of the border. ""If on the Pakistani side of the border there are bad people planning bad things against our troops, the U.S. would be remiss if it didn't take steps to thwart those activities,"" said the official. The official raised the questions: ""What do the Pakistani's expect? If foot soldiers are carrying bombs across the border, do they expect the U.S. to sit idly by?"" The official said if the Pakistanis don't take action against extremists operating in their territory, than the United States will. ""Pakistan needs to talk more about what they're doing and less about what they think the U.S. is doing,"" the official said. Based on a count by CNN's Islamabad bureau, Wednesday's suspected drone strike was the 19th this year, compared with 111 in all of 2010. CNN's Nick Paton Walsh contributed to this report.","NEW: ""Do they expect the U.S. to sit idly by?"" a U.S. official asks of the Pakistanis .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- A suspected U.S. drone struck and killed targets in Pakistan's tribal region Friday, the first such attack since American troops killed al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden north of Islamabad earlier this week. Two Pakistani intelligence officials told CNN that 12 suspected militants were killed in the assault in the Data Khel region of North Waziristan, one of the seven districts of Pakistan's volatile tribal region bordering Afghanistan. The drone, an unmanned aircraft, attacked a militant hideout and a vehicle carrying militants. The U.S. operation targeting bin Laden intensified discord and highlighted the mistrust between Pakistan and the United States, which did not inform the Pakistanis of the raid in the military garrison town of Abbottabad. Before that dramatic operation, many Pakistanis had been particularly displeased with the controversial practice of targeting militants with unmanned aircraft because civilians have died in the operations. Last month, 44 people were killed in a drone strike in Pakistan's tribal region and the government of Pakistan formally asked the U.S. government for an apology. After that strike, frequency of the drone strikes was reduced. CNN's Islamabad bureau has counted only four drone strikes over the last month and a half. Friday's suspected drone strike was the 21st this year compared to 111 in all of 2010. There was no immediate comment on the strike from the United States. The intelligence officials asked not be named because they were not authorized to speak to the media. Imran Khan -- head of a right-wing political party in Pakistan -- has warned that his party and followers will disrupt the flow of supplies through Pakistan to NATO troops in Afghanistan if the strikes aren't stopped. His group held a sit-in protest against the strikes in Peshawar last month. Around 8,000 to 10,000 people participated.","The operation took place in North Waziristan .

"(CNN) -- David ""Kidd"" Kraddick, whose morning radio show aired in nearly 100 cities, has died. He was 53. He died Saturday in New Orleans at a golf tournament to raise money for his Kidd's Kids Charity, his management company said. What killed Kraddick was not immediately known. ""At the appropriate time, we will release more information about the cause of death,"" said Ladd Biro with Champion Management. ""He died doing what he loved, and his final day was spent selflessly focused on those special children that meant the world to him."" Kraddick is the face behind the nationally successful ""Kidd Kraddick In The Morning"" show. He has been named America's Best Radio Personality'; Radio and Records Major Market Personality of the Year; and he won the prestigious Marconi Award for Radio Personality of the Year. Kraddick said his career as a disc jockey began in high school. ""We sponsored a big dance for the seniors but didn't have enough money to hire a DJ. So I snuck out my dad's stereo and did it myself,"" he said. The name ""Kidd"" wouldn't come for several years though. He began his career in Miami. And as is common with radio personalities, he bounced around. Stints in Salt Lake City, Los Angeles and Tampa followed. It was in Tampa that a program director gave him the name ""Kidd."" It stuck. His career really took off after he moved to Dallas when his morning drive time show went into syndication. Last week, Kraddick did a humorous segment on what he'd say to his co-hosts in his ""final moments on Earth."" ""When I die, you have permission to take a bunch of creepy pictures of my body,"" Kraddick said. ""I want to thank all of you guys for being at my deathbed today. I'm going to miss you so much.""

"Sao Paulo, Brazil (CNN) -- A consortium including Petrobras, Shell, Total and two Chinese companies was the winner and sole bidder in Brazil's auction of a giant offshore oil block, considered one of the most promising in the world. Protesters clashed with police and Army troops a couple of blocks from the hotel where the auction was carried out as oil workers and activists denounced the auction as a sale of national assets to foreign companies. Protesters attacked parked cars and metal barriers protecting the areal while security forces fired tear gas. The government deployed Army troops ahead of the auction to help cordon off the area. This was Brazil's first oil auction since new rules were implemented giving more power to the state-owned Petrobras and a percentage of the oil stays in state hands. Under the new rules, Petrobras is required to be the sole operator and hold a minimum 30% stake in every consortium. According to Brazil's National Petroleum Agency, the Libra oil field holds between 8 billion and 12 billion barrels of oil, making it one of the world's most promising fields. In the end, only 11 companies registered for the auction despite government predictions some 40 companies would turn out. And only one consortium actually put in a bid. Petrobras holds a 40% stake in the winning consortium. The other members are: . -- Shell, incorporated in the United Kingdom and headquartered in the Netherlands. It has a 20% stake. -- Total, a French multinational company. It has a 20% stake. -- China National Petroleum Corporation and China National Offshore Oil Corporation. They have a 10% stake each. The auction comes at a bad time for Petrobras, which is struggling with its debt but will provide needed cash for state coffers. The winning consortium has to cough up a $7 billion signing fee and invest about $185 billion over the 35 years of the concession.","The consortium is composed of companies from Brazil, Europe and China .

"(CNN) -- Before the story sinks beneath the waves, a few more words are in order about the recent selection process for a new chief for the Federal Reserve: It stinks. The chairmanship of the Federal Reserve Bank is probably the second most powerful job in the United States. In combating the financial crisis and the slow recovery, it has often been more important than the presidency. Indeed, many in other countries believe it has become the most important job in the world. Selecting a chairperson is thus a solemn, crucial undertaking. I have only participated once -- during the process when President Reagan decided to reappoint someone first named by his Democratic predecessor, President Carter. Reagan thought long and hard and, putting aside all partisanship, wisely asked Paul Volcker to stay on. Everyone at the White House and in Congress understood how big that decision was. We once chose our Supreme Court nominees with the same degree of deliberation and thoughtfulness on both sides of the aisle. That is, until the debacle of the Bork nomination in 1987, when the process disintegrated into a partisan brawl. Nominations of justices have been subject to undue political considerations ever since. One can only hope that the selection process for a Fed chair in recent weeks is no precedent for the future. It has been messy, ugly and degrading to the leading candidates and could ultimately diminish the authority of the Federal Reserve itself. I have had the privilege of counting Larry Summers as a colleague and then a friend for more than 30 years; I have known and respected Janet Yellen for more than a decade and during college was a friend of her husband, George Akerlof, a Nobel Prize winner in economics. Both Summers and Yellen are superbly qualified to lead the Fed. But both were also distinctly uncomfortable with the way the process played out as a political circus, so that whoever won would carry baggage into the job. These are serious people in serious times. They -- and we -- deserve better. To read what was being said about Larry Summers might lead you to believe that he is a Wall Street-loving, Main Street-hating misogynist who chews up colleagues for breakfast. That caricature is wildly unfair. Without rehashing the debate -- and because I am no economist -- let me just suggest a different way to look at him. First and foremost, the past two Democratic presidents, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, selected Larry Summers as a principal architect of U.S. economic policy and in both cases were extremely grateful for his leadership. CNN Money: Economists react as Summers drops out . For Clinton, Summers and Bob Rubin were mainstays in an administration when there was an explosion in jobs and the income of the bottom 20 percent actually rose faster than the top quintile. For Obama, Summers and Tim Geithner -- along with Ben Bernanke -- were the most important players in staving off a depression and helping the economy back on a growth path, albeit slow. In both administrations and in days since, Summers has consistently spoken in favor of closing the opportunity gaps in the country; that issue goes deep with him. Summers does believe in the power of the marketplace and he respects the U.S. financial industry as one of the nation's prize assets, a creator of growth and jobs. But he also believes in regulation. As columnist Ed Luce pointed out in the Financial Times on Monday, he wanted to be tougher on banks than many of his colleagues early in the Obama years. The liberal Democrats who have chased him with pitchforks over repeal of Glass-Steagall in 1999 conveniently forget that it passed the House by 362--57 with Democrats voting in favor by 3-1. Nor do they take any responsibility for doing anything to correct it in the eight years between passage and the economic crisis. Nor do they admit that it had precious little to do with causing the crash. Larry Summers is by no means perfect, but in the din of recent weeks, it has been hard to keep things in perspective. Yes, he was very clumsy in his comments about female scientists while at Harvard -- but he clearly did not mean to say that women are somehow inferior and he apologized repeatedly for his clumsiness. Who would have known from the past few weeks how many women like Sheryl Sandberg have worked for him and are fierce champions for him? Yes, he can be difficult in interpersonal conversations. He is tough minded and likes to joust intellectually. But is that a disqualification for strong leadership of a major organization? If so, we would never have heard of Steve Jobs or Jack Welch. One could go on but the point should be clear: This was a terrible process in which injustices have been done. The president and his White House staff obviously bear part of the blame. So do those who have rushed to the barricades, turning out press releases and petitions. The only way it could get worse is for the president, as suggested by the press, to turn away suddenly from Janet Yellen out of annoyance with liberal Democrats or because he feels he has been boxed in. This is a decision that must be made strictly on the merits. Larry Summers had the grace to make the right decision. Now the president must make the right decision in choosing Janet Yellen. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Gergen.","Larry Summers has dropped out of contention to head the Federal Reserve .

"(CNN) -- When Congress passed the last truly major immigration reform, the 1965 Immigration Act that opened the door to the modern era of mass immigration to the United States, it was supported by three-quarters of Democratic lawmakers and 85% of Republicans. That's the right way to pass big laws that can have transformative effects on a society. With the House of Representatives now tangling over immigration reform following passage of a comprehensive Senate bill last month, there seems little prospect for anything approaching that level of comity. Indeed, as Congress heads to its August break, many have declared the Senate immigration reform bill dead on arrival. But the road ahead may not be as impassable as it seems. A new poll from a pro-immigration Republican group shows that nearly three-quarters of Republican voters would support a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants if coupled with tougher border security. There is surprising bipartisan agreement on most of the Senate bill's provisions and plausible paths on the very tough issues that still divide the two parties. Here's a way to get across the finish line: . â¢ Emphasize agreement. Expanding high-skilled immigration, luring immigrant entrepreneurs, requiring employers to verify the legal status of new hires and admitting more farmworkers all enjoy overwhelming bipartisan backing. The Democrats have also agreed to eliminate the diversity visa lottery and end family visas for brothers and sisters of new U.S. citizens, responding to longstanding GOP concerns that the current system is too generous to those with weak ties to the United States. As they meet with their constituents in August, lawmakers should emphasize that these measures would be a shot in the arm for the still anemic U.S. economy and would go a long way to discouraging future illegal immigration. â¢ Cut losses. There are, to be sure, many members of the House who will not vote for any sort of comprehensive immigration legislation, and there's no point in supporters of reform wasting their time to try to win them over. Democrats have put together a list of more than 100 House Republicans who might be persuaded to support broader immigration reform. â¢ Don't trust. Even potential Republican supporters do not trust the Obama administration on enforcement, particularly on securing the Mexican border, and there is little reason to think this view will change. Fortunately, these lawmakers don't need to. This bill will set immigration rules for a generation; President Barack Obama will be gone in a few years. What is needed is a closer, ongoing relationship between Congress and the professionals responsible for border security -- the Border Patrol and Customs and Border Protection agents. The House Homeland Security Committee already passed a bill in May -- unanimously -- that would be an important start, because it requires those agencies to develop, present to Congress and carry out a clear strategy for further securing the border. For the GOP to reject the new border enforcement resources that will come with an immigration bill because they don't trust Obama is like refusing to pay for new Pentagon weapons programs as long as Democrats are in charge. Border security must be an ongoing mission of national importance that, like national defense, requires a close working relationship between the professionals in uniform and the politicians--one that transcends the party in power. â¢ And verify. Verification is particularly difficult because the administration has not provided Congress with any good measures for success on immigration enforcement at all. The Senate bill instead just spends more -- doubling yet again the number of agents and building more fencing. But as we've learned from the public schools, more money does not always equal better results. Instead, Congress should demand performance and accountability on such key measures as the apprehension rate of illegal border crossers and the number of those who overstay visas. Fortunately, these provisions are already in the House Homeland Security Committee bill. Emphasizing this fact would meet a key demand of many wavering GOP members -- to demonstrate genuine results on border security rather than just throwing more money at the problem. â¢ Many paths to citizenship, or not.  All but the staunchest opponents of immigration reform accept that most of the 11 million unauthorized immigrants here today cannot simply be deported. But the Democrats' insistence on a certain, if lengthy, path to citizenship for all is misplaced. The fact is that many of the unauthorized will never seek citizenship; of the 2.7 million who were legalized by the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act, a little more than 1 million later became citizens, fewer than four out of 10. This low number is not an argument for denying citizenship; a great strength of the United States has been to integrate immigrants as full members of society, and the bill needs to hold open that possibility. But the first priority for both parties should be to free those 11 million from the daily threat of being fired, arrested and deported. Instead of a special path to citizenship, there could be many paths -- quicker for young people,for example, but through normal work and family channels for others. As with immigrants who try to enter through legal channels, some may never qualify for citizenship. While this will be the toughest issue to resolve, leaders in both parties should be able to find a sensible compromise. Already there is significant movement; House Republicans are working on a version of the DREAM Act to allow the children of unauthorized immigrants to become citizens, a policy they had long rejected. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, who championed immigration reform despite strong criticism in his home state, has said that if Congress fails this time, it will be a generation before it dares to take up the issue again. There is no need to wait that long; the pieces for an ambitious and broadly supported bill are all in place. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Edward Alden.","Edward Alden says immigration reform can be passed with bipartisan support .
Alden: Parties must stress areas of agreement; advocates should give up wooing ""no"" voters .
Border security bill mandates enforcement accountability and should placate GOP, he says .
Alden: Priority of parties should be to remove constant threat of arrest, deportation ."
"(Mental Floss) -- Remember when your high school summer reading list included ""Atticus,"" ""Fiesta,"" and ""The Last Man in Europe?""

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Japan will begin enforcing an often-flouted evacuation order and keep people out of the 20-km zone around the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, a top official announced Wednesday. About 78,000 people have homes in the evacuation zone, and many have been going back to retrieve belongings, and check on farms and businesses in recent weeks. Animal rescue groups have gone in to get pets for owners who didn't expect to be gone for more than a month, and numerous journalists have ventured inside to document conditions. All that needs to stop ""to guarantee the health and safety of the people,"" Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano told reporters Wednesday. Edano, the government's point man for the crisis, said Tokyo will work with local officials to make plans for closing the zone soon. He would not elaborate on how the closure would be carried out, but said that families would be allowed to enter the area to get things from their homes under proper protections. Police are stationed at checkpoints leading into the area currently, but enforcement appears to vary from post to post or officer to officer. Inside, cars and trucks swept away by the March 11 tsunami that triggered the Fukushima Daiichi accident remain scattered across the untended fields. The line where the wave halted remains clearly visible, marked by the debris it left behind. Abandoned houses stand open, with cattle and chickens left behind in their pens. A CNN crew entered the area for a short time Wednesday and encountered a young farmer whose family lives just inside the 20-km (12.5-mile) boundary. He said his father was considering returning home -- but as a young, unmarried man, he was considering quitting the farm his family has worked for three generations. ""I'm concerned about the impact on my health,"" said the farmer, who declined to be named. ""I wish I could trust the government, but I can't."" Japanese authorities drew the 20-km radius around the plant in the early days of the Fukushima Daiichi disaster, now the worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl. The plant was struck by the March 11 tsunami that devastated northern Japan, knocking out its coolant systems and causing its three operating reactors to overheat. The accident resulted in the plant belching radioactive particles into the surrounding environment, leading to widespread concerns about crops, homes and livelihoods well beyond the immediate area. Four days after the tsunami, Japan advised residents in a second belt, from 10km to 20 km away from the plant, to stay indoors if they remained in the area; and on April 11, it said residents of several other towns outside the zone to be ready to evacuate soon. The Japanese government says it has no detailed readings of radiation levels inside the 20-km zone. But journalists who have entered the areas have recorded radiation levels that typically range around a few thousandths of a millisieverts per hour. By comparison, a typical resident of an industrialized country receives about 3 millisieverts per year. One reporter who came within 2 km of the power plant in early April recorded a dose of about a tenth of a millisievert per hour -- high enough to increase the long-term risk of cancer with prolonged exposure, but a tiny fraction of the dose that would induce radiation sickness. Currently, the evacuations are ""very difficult"" to enforce legally, government spokesman Noriyuki Shikata told reporters Tuesday. Edano said the government plans to designate the area an ""alert zone"" under Japanese laws governing disaster response, a move he said would give authorities the power to crack down on people going into and out of the evacuated area. Edano ventured into the closed zone last week to meet with police and troops inside, and he said Prime Minister Naoto Kan is currently making plans to visit the Fukushima area to meet with some of those affected by the disaster. Yasuka Nakabo and CNN's Steven Jiang contributed to this report.","A government official says the crackdown is needed for public safety .

"(CNN) -- Less than a year after four strangers risked their lives to save Michelle Kehoe and her sons from an icy Iowa River, the mother is accused of slashing the two boys' throats and leaving them to die. Michelle Kehoe was arrested November 15 after leaving the hospital where she had been since the attack. Kehoe's 2-year-old son was found dead the morning of October 27 outside the family's van, which was parked a short distance from the Hook-n-Liner pond in Littleton, Iowa. Her 7-year-old son was injured but still alive inside the van. He was rushed to the hospital for surgery, according to the Iowa Department of Public Safety. Scars on his neck underscore the chilling account he gave police, contained in a police affidavit filed in Buchanan County court. The boy said his mother started with him, taking him from the van before covering his eyes, ears and mouth with duct tape, according to the affidavit. Then, he told police, she cut his throat. She then moved on to his younger brother, he said. He could hear his brother's cries as she repeated the attack on him, the 7-year-old told police. Kehoe initially denied involvement in the attacks, blaming them on a stranger. Eventually, she admitted to acquiring the knife and duct tape weeks earlier but could not explain why, the affidavit says. Kehoe faces life in prison on charges of first-degree murder, attempted murder and child endangerment resulting in serious injury. She is being held on $2.5 million bail, County Attorney Allan Vander Hart said. She has not entered a plea but is scheduled for arraignment December 2. Repeated calls to Andrea Dryer, Kehoe's public defender, were not returned. CNN was unable to find any public comments by Dryer on the case. The attacks have rattled the community of Coralville, a suburb of Iowa City where Kehoe and her husband, Eugene, lived with their sons. The arrest comes just three months after Iowa Gov. Chet Culver honored four men for diving into the Iowa River to rescue Kehoe and her sons on a cold December afternoon last year. The governor's office gave the following account: Kehoe was driving the boys to the library when the car hit the curb, skidded on ice and then plunged into the river. As rushing waters filled the car, three passers-by who had watched it veer off the road plunged after it into the icy waters. Inside the car, Kehoe dislodged her older son from his booster seat and passed him through the window to Cory Rath, who brought the boy ashore. Kehoe removed her younger son, then 14 months old, from his car seat and handed him out the window to Mark Petersen. Petersen began to swim with the boy and then passed the boy to Josh Shepherd, according to the governor's office. Kehoe, meanwhile, had escaped from the car and was fighting the rough currents pulling her underwater. Bicyclist Steve McGuire noticed her struggling and dropped his bicycle to dive in after her. The dramatic rescue formed a bond between the Kehoes and their four saviors, especially Rath, who befriended the family. He did not respond to CNN's phone calls but spoke recently with a local television station. ""Your heart sinks to hear that something was happening again,"" Rath told KGAN, a television station in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. ""I mean, we just rescued these kids and mom from the river last December."" Rath told KGAN he was grateful that the older boy had survived but worried about the rough times ahead for him. ""Dying at the age of seven would have been really, really tragic,"" he told KGAN. ""I'm also saddened that there are certainly difficulties he will have in the days and years to come that are troubling to think about."" Police have said they are not re-examining last year's accident in light of the recent attacks on the boys. Prosecutor Vander Hart would not comment on whether they were related. The 2-year-old's slaying also marks the first homicide in five years in Buchanan County, the prosecutor said. ""Murder cases are pretty few and far in between here. We're a small rural community of 21,000 people,"" Vander Hart said. ""Any time you have a case with these kinds of facts, it's going to draw some kind of attention. But I was not prepared for this degree of attention."" For many, the grisly nature of the attacks is compounded by the fact the boys' own mother is charged with plotting and carrying them out. Cases of mothers who kill their children, like Susan Smith and Andrea Yates, continue to fascinate the public, even as the rates of filicide -- the act of a parent who kills his or her own child -- have remained fairly stable. ""Because these cases are so tragic, they pull at your heartstrings, but they happen all the time,"" said Laurie Levenson, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, California. In 2005, 555 children under the age of five were victims of homicide, compared with 544 in 1976. The rate peaked in 1991 at 778 and bottomed out in 1971 at 511, according to statistics from the Department of Justice. Another fairly stable statistic: In more than 50 percent of child homicides, the killer is a parent. ""The natural defense to anticipate is insanity, because why would a mother kill her own child?"" Levenson asked. ""It certainly can be insanity, but it's not always the case. Perfectly sane people can do horrible things, and they do, every day."" Mothers can be motivated to kill their children by several factors, according to criminologist James Alan Fox, Lipman Family professor of criminal justice at Northeastern University. Some act on genuine psychotic delusions, as jurors determined to be the case with Texas mother Andrea Yates, who told doctors she drowned her five children because God told her to do so. Others can be motivated by selfish reasons: Susan Smith's alleged motive for killing her children was that she perceived them to be an obstacle in her relationship with her boyfriend. ""It's a crazy thing to do, but crazy describes the behavior, not the mind,"" Fox said, adding that between 300 and 350 children have been homicide victims in 2008. ""It doesn't make sense to most of us, but that doesn't mean the state of mind of the person is mentally ill. You may know what you're doing and have very selfish motivations,"" he explained. Kehoe said she couldn't explain why she did what she did, according to the affidavit. Police said she initially told a false but chilling tale of how a normal, two-hour Sunday drive to visit relatives was interrupted by a brutal attack on her family. On that Monday morning in October, she showed up on the doorstep of a home in Littleton, claiming that a man she couldn't identify had abducted her and her children. The person who answered the door called 911, and sheriff's deputies located the van with Kehoe's help. Initially, she denied involvement in the attacks and stood by the statement that she'd been attacked by a stranger. When pressed by investigators, however, Kehoe said she had purchased a knife a month earlier and duct tape two months earlier, the affidavit states. The document also says that before she and her sons left home Sunday, she wrote a note detailing the abduction by a stranger. The note was found in the van, according to the affidavit. The document went on to say: ""She stated that it all happened within five minutes and prior to 1:30 pm. She stated she couldn't explain why she had done it. She stated that she couldn't face anyone. She stated that she wanted to die or be locked up where she couldn't hurt anyone."" After speaking with investigators, Kehoe was taken to the hospital to be treated for her own wounds and trauma, said prosecutor Vander Hart, declining to elaborate. She remained there until she was arrested and taken to jail a week ago Saturday. A plea of not guilty would open the door to a criminal trial, where Kehoe's state of mind would become a key issue, experts say. Michael Welner, a forensic psychiatrist and Chairman of The Forensic Panel, interviewed Andrea Yates and testified for the prosecution at her trial. He said the successful insanity defense in Yates' case made what was once an ""unthinkable"" strategy into a viable defense.","Michelle Kehoe allegedly first told investigators a stranger attacked her and boys .

"(CNN) -- Work to restore Egyptian artifacts damaged during anti-government protests began on Sunday, according to the nation's newly appointed minister of antiquities. The work, on artifacts from King Tutankhamun's tomb, includes restoring a statue -- broken by looters in the Egyptian Museum -- of King Tut on a panther, Zahi Hawass told CNN Sunday. A restoration team composed of 11 members began work on Sunday, Hawass said. He estimated that the work will take about three days to complete. ""It will all go back to normal in three days,"" he said. The museum will remain closed until Egyptian authorities lift overnight curfews, he said. However, he said he toured the museum with journalists from the Wall Street Journal and National Geographic. ""I showed them everything,"" he said. Despite Hawass' assurances, Egyptologists and archaeologists have expressed concern that some of the nation's priceless treasures may fall victim to looters or vandals amid unrest and uprisings fueled by what protesters see as a lack of economic opportunity, widespread poverty and pervasive corruption. Several Egyptologists told CNN in late January they were trying to stay on top of the situation as best they could and sift fact from rumor. ""With 80 million people in a country that suffers from poverty and rising food prices ... you have to expect that some people are going to be desperate and look for any means necessary to try to improve their lot,"" Kara Cooney told CNN last month. She is an assistant professor of Egyptian art and architecture at the University of California, Los Angeles, and host of the Discovery Channel's ""Out of Egypt."" But she said concerns are compounded by a lack of reliable information and the prevalence of rumors. ""Some things have turned out not to be true,"" she said. She and other Egyptologists said they were staying online as much as possible and keeping in touch with other Egyptologists to try to share information. ""This has been my life's work,"" said Jan Summers Duffy, an Egyptologist at the College of Idaho and curator at the Orma J. Smith Museum of Natural History. ""... We don't know what the future will hold. I hope at least some things can be preserved."" Hawass previously was secretary-general of Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities. On January 30, according to his website, President Hosni Mubarak appointed him to his new post. The newly created Ministry of Antiquities will absorb the Supreme Council of Antiquities, according to the website. On January 28, as the protests were under way, a group of people broke into the museum in Cairo, Hawass has said. They smashed 13 glass showcases and threw the antiquities inside on the floor in the Late Period Gallery, then went to the King Tutankhamun section, where they opened a showcase and threw the panther statue to the ground. They also stole jewelry from the museum's gift shop, Hawass said. When the suspects were apprehended, he told CNN at the time, authorities found the remains of two mummies with them, along with some small artifacts. But, Hawass wrote in a blog post on Saturday, ""The two mummies that were reported as damaged at the Egyptian Museum in Cairo were in fact unidentified skulls dating to the Late Period; these two skulls are not royal mummies."" The skulls were temporarily housed in a storage room, he said, to be used in testing a CT scanner. When they were retrieved from the looters, they were undamaged, he said. In addition, Hawass in the blog post denied claims that the open-air museum in Memphis had been looted and that tombs in Saqqara had been damaged. ""The people who are in Europe and America are concerned about Egypt, but what is (important) to remember is that rumors can be very damaging,"" Hawass wrote in a blog post Friday. He wrote Saturday of visiting the Great Pyramids of Giza, saying he was pleased to find the site protected by soldiers and tanks from the Egyptian army, but ""I was so sad to see the plateau empty of tourists though."" ""Today in Tahrir Square there are about 3,000 young people, and I hope they will go home today, so that life in Egypt can go back to normal,"" he wrote. Hawass has maintained that the Egyptian people can be counted on to help protect the nation's historical treasures because of their national pride. CNN's Christine Theodorou and Ashley Hayes contributed to this report.","The restoration work is expected to take about three days .

"(CNN) -- The man they call the ""Wizard of Ballydoyle"" has got a master apprentice. Irish champion trainer Aidan O'Brien has a reputation as a brilliant tutor of horses, but his most prized protege is now his eldest son, Joseph. The pair galloped into the history books last season as the first father and son -- in the role of trainer and jockey -- to win England's Epsom Derby, one of the world's most famous flat races, with Camelot. ""It works well,"" Joseph, who is his father's first-choice jockey, told CNN's Winning Post. ""We both discuss what way we're going to ride the horse and it doesn't always go to plan -- it usually doesn't -- but when it does it is great."" Joseph is lean, rosy-cheeked and softly-spoken -- and modest too. The 20-year-old rode his first winner, trained by his father, at Leopardstown in 2009 just days after his 16th birthday. Since then the O'Brien father-and-son combination has claimed high-profile victories in England, Ireland, the U.S. and Dubai on celebrated horses including Camelot and St Nicholas Abbey. ""I suppose Joseph has never known anything else since he was a baby,"" said O'Brien, surveying the Ballydoyle yard tucked away in the heart of the Irish countryside in County Tipperary. ""He probably knows how we think better than anybody. He knows when it goes wrong too -- he's the first to admit it."" O'Brien learnt his trade from his own father, a farmer and small-scale trainer in County Wexford, Ireland, before becoming a jockey, who dabbled in training on the side. The 44-year-old was Ireland's amateur champion jockey but it was his knack of training horses that saw him snapped up by Coolmore, Ireland's global breeding and training powerhouse, in 1995. He has been Ireland's champion trainer since 1998 and British champion trainer four times, guiding great horses such as Giant's Causeway, Galileo and High Chapparal. With such a prestigious brand to protect, not to mention family honor, does O'Brien treat his son differently? ""No, I don't think so,"" answered O'Brien in a straightforward manner. ""He's seen it all and heard it all good and bad. ""It's obviously a much closer relationship as we all live together but it's more or less the same."" Joseph agrees that he is not treated any differently by his father to the other jockeys charged with riding potential winners home. ""There's always a little bit of pressure,"" he explained. ""But I like pressure because when the pressure's on it means you'll be sensible."" Dynasty in safe hands . The pressure just might increase on Joseph at some point in the future. As well as being his father's favored jockey, O'Brien has named him as his potential successor. ""I'd be delighted,"" said O'Brien. ""He'd have to be finished riding at that stage but those things are a long way down the road. ""We'll look forward to it when it does happen."" At least Joseph does not have to worry about sustaining the O'Brien dynasty alone. The 20-year-old is the eldest of four children and O'Brien -- whose wife Anne-Marie was also a trainer -- already has them all riding out to exercise the horses. No wonder Ballydoyle has a reputation for breeding future stars of the turf -- and the training yard.","The rising star of champion trainer Aidan O'Brien's stable is his own son Joseph .

"(CNN) -- Johnny Murtagh has a simple philosophy which has served him well during his glittering career as one of the leading jockeys in the world of thoroughbred racing. ""I just want to win and make my horses go as fast as they can for as long as they can,"" he told CNN's Winning Post. The 43-year-old Irishman can mount to an ever-growing list of Group One triumphs as proof of his success in the saddle, but is now also saddling up winners in his dual career as a trainer. Murtagh was granted his license earlier this year and has a string of horses in a stables at the home of Irish racing in the Curragh, which he owns. During his short training career, Murtagh has already turned out a steady flow of winners and given his pedigree it is hardly surprising he has set his sights very high. ""My training ambitions are big,"" he said. ""I start off and look at my horses and think all of my horses are Group One horses."" Former jockey Tommy Carmody also operates out of the stables, training the horses of influential owner Andrew Tinkler, a rich businessman who has invested heavily in Irish and English racing. The stables had their first Group One success in the Irish St. Leger last year and others are predicted to challenge the likes of the Ballydoyle operation of all-conquering trainer Aidan O'Brien. Murtagh was surprisingly dropped as retained jockey to owner the Aga Khan -- he described it as a ""horrible moment"" -- amid reports that the decision centered on the jockey's close relationship with a rival stables. In a prestigious race at the Curragh last year, Carmody's Ursa Major beat the John Oxx-trained Hartani for the Aga Khan. Three days later came news of the parting of the ways. But Murtagh has continued to ride winners, finishing as leading jockey at this year's Royal Ascot, with his latest success at top level coming on French challenger Chicquita at the Irish Oaks. It was Murtagh's sixth victory in the prestigious race and underlined again his dual life is not hampering his abilities. ""It's usually when you retire you pack up your bags and start training, but I'm still riding well,"" he said. Murtagh has had three wins in the Epsom Derby with Sinndar, High Chaparral and Motivator. He doubled up with Sinndar in 2000 to take the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, Europe's most prestigious race. He believes his intimate knowledge of riding the best horses in the world give him a unique insight as a trainer. ""You can't beat sitting on them yourself to get the feel of them and to see what suits them best."" But he admits that gaining his training license has made him appreciate his horses even more. ""When I was just a jockey I always thought I liked horses, but I can now see why trainers love their horses, they are part of your family and you just want to do the best for them."" Murtagh told CNN that training was a ""real eye opener"" and clearly believes he has plenty to learn, but having worked as a jockey for masters of the craft like O'Brien and Oxx, will surely learn the ropes quickly in his new training career.","Johnny Murtagh is one of the most successful jockeys of modern era .

"On CNN's ""State of the Union,"" host and chief national correspondent John King goes outside the Beltway to report on the issues affecting communities across the country. This week, King traveled to Virginia looking at the health of the Chesapeake Bay. The crab population in the Chesapeake Bay is no longer as abundant as it once was. CAPE CHARLES, Virginia (CNN)  -- It is just after first light, and Don Pierce gently eases the Bri-Steff off the pier at Cape Charles harbor. ""You're sure you want to do this?"" he asks a visitor with a whimsical smile. It is the last time the word ""gently"" will come to mind this day. His closest crab pot is nearly five miles out into Chesapeake Bay, and the bouncing -- and rocking -- starts just seconds after passing the mouth of the protected harbor. The Bri-Steff -- named after Pierce's two children -- Brian and Steffanie -- is the only boat braving the rough waters on this morning. On a scale of 1 to 10 -- with 10 being as rough as he dare venture out in --- Pierce scores this morning ""about a 9Â½."" Pierce has been working these waters since he was a teenager. Forty-eight years now --- already eight years' experience under his belt when the world marked the first Earth Day in April 1970. This year is the 40th anniversary, and Pierce is downbeat when assessing the health of the environmental treasure he loves --- and on which he depends for his livelihood. ""Too much phosphorous, too much fertilizer, too much untreated waste,"" Pierce says. Where does it come from? ""We the people that live in the Chesapeake watershed mainly. We the people,"" he says. ""Save the Bay"" has been the region's environmental cause for decades now. Pierce is both a believer and a skeptic. ""Where is that money going? I mean, you know there is lots of money being donated to help her, but she's still going downhill. You know, if we were to get a catastrophic storm like a Katrina, she might never recover. You know, that's how bad she is."" The swells exceed 7 feet as we make our way to harvest the pots, and at times the winds and the waves combine to toss the boat like a toy. The bags of razor clams on the deck are bait this time of year --- a few scoops added to each of the pots pulled from the floor of the still-frigid bay waters. After pulling five pots, Pierce has all the evidence he needs to know the cold rains of the previous day have the crabs dormant. ""You and I wear sweatshirts and hunker down,"" he says in the ship's cabin --- messy because the waves have already dumped the pans off the small stove and sent other small equipment and supplies flying. ""When it is this cold down there, they hibernate."" Pierce lives and works most of the year in the northern Chesapeake Bay. But he is here near its southern tip because it gets warmer here a bit earlier, and the warmer the water, the more feisty --- and active --- are the blue crabs for which the bay is famous. Pierce loves his work -- and is good at it. With just one crew member this day --- in part because he knew the weather meant a relatively short day and in part to leave enough room for a CNN crew --- Pierce leaves the cabin to help harvest the crabs. He spots his buoys and uses a hook to find the rope and wrap it into the winch. Harvey Brown grabs each mesh pot as the winch pulls it out of the water, and methodically packs in more bait, shakes out the crabs into a box on deck, sorts the males from the females, tosses those too small to keep back into the bay and then drops the pot for its journey back to the bottom. Tough work in extreme elements, magnified this day by rough seas that repeatedly send water over the side and the stern onto the deck. After just a little more than a bushel, Pierce decides it is best to call it a day. We have been out in the bay for about two hours and have not seen another boat. Today, it is the combination of bad weather and the early season. But Pierce takes the longer view, remembering when he left his early work on the docks for work on the waters. ""When I started in the late '60s, there was commercial rock fishing, there was clamming, there was oystering, crabbing ,"" he says. ""Twenty years ago, you had striped bass and you had oysters, clamming."" Most of that is gone, Pierce says, and for all the commitment to ""Save the Bay"" he is of the view little progress has been made, and that development on the shoreline, population growth in the area and runoff from area farms and lawns have greatly outpaced conservation and restoration efforts. ""It is going to take a long while,"" Pierce says. ""It took 100  years to get this way; it is going to take sizable amounts of years to bring  her back."" Those who watch the bay share his assessment. The annual report by the Chesapeake Bay Foundation gave the bay a score of 28 on a scale of 100. Or, on a school grading system, a ""D"" --- the same grade as in 2007. A 70 score would mean restoration of its health and habitats; a 100 would mean a pristine bay with no water quality or fishery health issues. Tommy Leggett, a bay foundation scientist and onetime waterman, says by appearances alone, the southern portions of the bay are doing better. ""This is a pretty, relatively clean area,"" Leggett says during a waterside stroll in Norfolk. ""But overall there is still a lot of problems with the bay from runoff, from ... sewage from sewage treatment plants, agricultural runoff. The bay is slowly improving but not at a fast enough rate, especially considering that we have been working at this for several decades now, actually 30 or 40 years. So I would say that the bay is not winning."" Pierce sees the algae blooms and grasses cited in the report as he travels a 190-mile stretch over the spring, summer and fall. And he sees a way of life struggling to survive. ""There used to be 60 to 70 boats out of my little town,"" he says. ""Now there are  20. My grandsons will not be watermen. I have got a son  that is a waterman and has to work damn hard to be that waterman. So grandsons want to go, but they are not going. ""It's very hard on relationships also. You know, that's a tough thing. Are you going to pay the mortgage, or are you going to stay home and get so far in debt that you might lose everything that you have got, you know, to the bank? And the banks don't want these boats, you know, but they want to see you make it. But it is a very tough way of life now."" He breaks down the job's tough math -- grateful, mind you, that fuel is about $2 a gallon this spring --- half of what it was last year. ""If you come in with say 25 bushels of crabs, that makes you, say, $1,000. It still costs you $400 to $500 a day to untie her to go. If you got help, you have those expenditures. And if you don't have good production, and low prices, there is no profit."" And if Pierce could do one thing? ""Just give the Chesapeake Bay back her 1970 water quality, and we will have plenty of crabs, and plenty of oysters, and plenty  of rockfish, and we will have a good style of  life again, you know. If we could get our regulators to work that out ... to improve our water quality --- the Chesapeake Bay could heal herself. But she's, she's dying daily.""","Efforts are under way to save the Chesapeake Bay's economy, environment .

"(CNN) -- Six people died and at least 34 were injured -- four of them critically -- in a crash involving a Greyhound bus and two other vehicles on a highway in Fresno, California, early Thursday, the California Highway Patrol said. The accident occurred about 2:15 a.m. on northbound California Highway 99, highway patrol spokesman Officer Kirk Arnold said. The bus struck an overturned SUV that was in the highway's fast lane and then struck a second vehicle. All three vehicles traveled down an embankment, and the bus slammed into a large eucalyptus tree, Arnold said. ""We're still trying to piece everything together,"" he said. Taxi driver Mike Coupland told CNN affiliate KMPH-TV that ""at the last second,"" he saw the SUV on its side in the highway: ""no lights, no nothing."" He said the bus did not have time to stop before striking the SUV. The impact was ""like a bomb going off,"" Coupland said. ""Just pieces and parts everywhere. It was terrible."" The bus driver, he said, was ""doing nothing wrong."" Arnold said authorities are not sure whether the SUV had just overturned before the crash or whether it was previously in the road. The fatalities -- four women and two men -- included the bus driver and at least one person in the SUV, he said. Five people were pronounced dead at the scene, and one man died later. Greyhound spokesman Tim Stokes said the driver, a 32-year employee, and two passengers were killed aboard the bus. Stokes did not identify the driver but said he ""was an excellent driver with a clean driving record and was a very well respected member of the Greyhound family. "" The bus was en route from Los Angeles to Sacramento, approaching its next stop at Madera, California, with 35 people on board, Stokes said. The highway's northbound lanes were closed, Arnold said. Greyhound representatives were on scene. The cause of the crash was still under investigation. ""It's going to be a lengthy process,"" Arnold said. Six people sustained moderate injuries in the crash, and 24 had minor injuries, he said. Relief buses were sent to the scene to pick up passengers who were uninjured, Stokes said.","NEW: Bus driver, 2 passengers are among the victims .

"(CNN) -- A 12-year-old Arkansas girl who was infected with a rare brain-eating parasite will finally go home Wednesday, according to Arkansas Children's Hospital spokesman Tom Bonner. Soon after entering the hospital earlier this summer, Kali Hardig went into critical condition; she was unresponsive and unable to breathe without the assistance of a breathing tube. Now she's eating, drinking, smiling and talking. She has even been walking with assistance and swimming in the hospital's therapeutic pool. A new photo released this week shows the dramatic improvement she has made. In the photo, Kali is sitting up in her hospital bed, smiling. Kali's doctors have been in virtually uncharted territory as they treat her for the rare amoeba, called Naegleria fowleri. Of 128 known cases in the past half-century, just two patients have survived, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Kali is one of two 12-year-olds who recently contracted the amoeba. Zachary Reyna of Florida died last month of the parasite, even after receiving the same experimental drug that was given to Kali. He contracted the amoeba after kneeboarding in a water-filled ditch by his house August 3, his family told CNN affiliate WBBH. Naegleria fowleri is found in hot springs and warm fresh water, most often in the southeastern United States. Between 2001 and 2010, there were 32 reported cases in the United States, the CDC says. Most of the cases were in the Southeast. The amoeba enters the body through the nose and travels to the brain. You cannot be infected with the organism by drinking contaminated water, the CDC says. ""This infection is one of the most severe infections that we know of,"" Dr. Dirk Haselow of the Arkansas Department of Health told CNN affiliate WMC about Kali's case. ""Ninety-nine percent of people who get it die."" Why 'nightmare bacteria' on the rise . Dr. Sanjiv Pasala, one of Kali's attending physicians, said they immediately started treating her with an anti-fungal medicine, antibiotics and a new experimental anti-amoeba drug doctors got directly from the CDC. They also reduced the girl's body temperature to 93 degrees. Doctors have used that technique in some brain injury cases to preserve undamaged brain tissue. Two weeks ago, doctors checked the girl's cerebral spinal fluid and could not find any presence of the amoeba. Pasala said that while other cases have not met with such favorable results, what may have made a real difference is that Kali's mother got her to the hospital so quickly. Willow Springs Water Park in Little Rock is the most likely source of Kali's infection, according to a news release from the Arkansas Department of Health. Another case of the same infection, also called primary amoebic meningoencephalitis, was reported in 2010 and was possibly linked to Willow Springs. ""Based on the occurrence of two cases of this rare infection in association with the same body of water and the unique features of the park, the ADH has asked the owner of Willow Springs to voluntarily close the water park to ensure the health and safety of the public,"" the news release said. What's in your pool water? The first symptoms of primary amoebic meningoencephalitis appear one to seven days after infection, including headache, fever, nausea, vomiting and a stiff neck, according to the CDC. ""Later symptoms include confusion, lack of attention to people and surroundings, loss of balance, seizures and hallucinations,"" the government agency's website states. ""After the start of symptoms, the disease progresses rapidly and usually causes death within one to 12 days."" CNN's William Hudson, Jacque Wilson, Jen Christiansen, John Bonifield, Caleb Hellerman, Jennifer Bixler and Leslie Holland contributed to this story.","Kali Hardig, 12, is finally leaving Arkansas Children's Hospital .

"Johannesburg, South Africa (CNN) -- South Africa has a rich musical heritage, but Johannesburg-based indie rockers BLK JKS are creating a new sound all of their own. Described by Rolling Stone magazine as ""Africa's best new band,"" BLK JKS (pronounced Black Jacks) have just finished a six-month tour of the United States and Europe. Last year's debut album ""After Robots"" was recorded in the United States and released on an American label. It has received critical acclaim for its eclectic sound, mixing styles including prog rock and dub with traces of traditional South African rhythms. While their music has a global appeal, the band says its roots are firmly in South Africa. BLK JKS drummer and bassist grew up in the Johannesburg township of Soweto, while the band's singer and drummer grew up 30 minutes away in the neighborhood of East Rand. Drummer Tshepang Ramoba told CNN, ""It is important to know where you live, where you come from, your history, what's happening in the world."" Although their fusion of styles is a creating a stir outside South Africa, it took a while for their music to be accepted in their home country, where four black musicians playing rock music is still a rarity. Guitarist Mpumi Mcata told CNN, ""In the beginning people were like, 'oh, they are black, they play rock ...' ""South Africa is still segregated, so you have a situation where they put us in front of a white audience and the white audience is confused, and you put us in front of a black audience and the black audience is confused. So it's not an easy crossover."" But Mcata said the band's music is ultimately traditional, with their rock sound based around ""ancient rhythms."" Ramoba agreed that South African traditions are at the heart of the band's music. ""The last song on the album is called Tselane, a story we used to be told when we were young before we would go to bed,"" he said. ""Those fables connect to how we're living now,"" added Mcata. Although the band have toured all over Europe and the United States, they say their most memorable gig was in Soweto itself, where the South African dance music of Kwaito reigns supreme. ""In Soweto, if they don't like you, they don't like you. They'll throw bottles,"" said Ramoba. ""So in Soweto, the fact that they liked us is a huge thing. When we started playing everyone just stayed and danced. It was the best.""","Johannesburg band BLK JKS are creating a rock sound of their own .
