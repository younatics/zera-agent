"FIFA president Sepp Blatter promised  that the Qatar World Cup in 2022 will not ruin Christmas for football fans. Blatter, arriving in Belfast for the rules-deciding IFAB summit, insisted that the World Cup final will not be played on December 23 as a FIFA workshop floated in Qatar this week when agreeing on a November-December World Cup schedule. Instead Blatter said that FIFA would recommend that the 28-day tournament would finish no later than December 18, which would potentially allow the Premier League to resume on Boxing Day. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sepp Blatter: World Cup 2022 final no later than December 18th . FIFA president Sepp Blatter promised the Qatar World Cup in 2022 will not ruin Christmas for football fans . Blatter said: 'We have to stop on the 18th for the finish. Not through to the 23rd, definitely not. No doubt the FIFA ExCo will make the decision that we will play November-December. 'There are more than six years to prepare and there is goodwill. There will be a solution and I'm sure everybody will be fine.' The FIFA move to end the World Cup on Qatar national day will help at least quieten the upset in Europe over the domestic leagues being disrupted. The timescale allows for the Christmas and New Year football programme to take place. Blatter added: 'It's not the first time I've said it, it's now more than a year and a half since we decided we can't play in summer. 'They (the European clubs) are not furious. They may not be very happy, but there are more than six years to prepare for it. FIFA Secretary General Jerome Valcke (right) and Hassan al-Thawadi, head of the Qatar 2022 World Cup organising committee . 'There is goodwill and there will be a solution. I'm sure everyone will be fine.' Blatter also rejected any possibility of clubs being compensated for the World Cup's move. 'No I don't think they should (be compensated),' he continued. 'This is not a problem that we have discussed in depth. 'This is football and I'm sure the European clubs are not happy, but they should also be in solidarity. This is the important thing, in FIFA we need unity and solidarity.

"When travellers set up camp next to their picturesque village, the people of Hardhorn knew they were in for a long struggle. And so it proved – with taxpayers spending £200,000 on four years of legal battles and planning inquiries. Finally however, the four Irish and Scottish families – and their 60 caravans – have been given their marching orders. Evicted: Travellers have been ordered to leave this site in Hardhorn, Lancashire despite trying to use human rights laws in order to stay . Opposition: The 78 Irish travellers had refused to budge despite facing three different courts, a planning inquiry, a council, and a battle by locals who accused the group of trashing their village . Yesterday residents of the Lancashire . village, which has featured in BBC’s Gardener’s World, were celebrating . victory over their ‘neighbours from hell’. The saga began in November 2009 when a farmer sold the travellers a field on the outskirts of Hardhorn, which is near Blackpool. The group of around 30 adults and 40 children immediately began to lay down concrete and rig up lighting for their mobile homes. Site: The travellers set up camp after sneaking in overnight in what neighbours described as a 'military-style operation' after council offices had closed for the weekend . Angry villagers wrote to councillors, raising concerns about noise, road safety and a potential drop in house prices. There were also numerous complaints of poaching, trespassing, barking dogs and verbal abuse. Officials . at Fylde District Council won an injunction barring the illegal . development, only for a county court judge to rule the camp should have a . postcode to allow  the travellers to claim benefits and summon the . emergency services. Maxine Chew, parish councillor said the residents are 'relieved' their ordeal is over . Neighbours: Villagers in Hardhorn had campaigned to have the traveller's evicted after the group moved in in November 2009 . Anger: Villagers wrote to councillors, raising concerns about noise, road safety and a potential drop in house prices after the travellers moved onto the site . A series . of legal hearings followed, including a planning inquiry, until, this . week, the Supreme Court ruled against the travellers. The council is now . taking legal advice in the hope that it can now evict without further . court challenges. Yesterday . parish councillor Maxine Chew said: ‘We are all hugely relieved that . this saga is finally coming to an end but it’s such a pity so much time . and a shocking amount of public money has been spent fighting this. ‘This case shows how much the legal . system in this country needs to change. The travellers have been able to . drag things out by constantly appealing and it is costing taxpayers . enormous sums.’ Branding . them ‘neighbours from hell’, she added: ‘The amount of antisocial . behaviour like fly tipping, theft and drunkenness has escalated hugely . in the past four years since the travellers set up camp. ‘Everyone is now hoping and praying that the eviction process can take place without any more trouble or legal hiccups. ‘This . is a very small and close-knit community and I congratulate the . villagers on the way that they have conducted themselves in the past . four years. ‘They are all so . pleased that they can start to turn their small community back into the . place it was before.’ A spokesman for Fylde Council said a report was . being prepared for councillors but that ‘we believe the travellers have . now exhausted their last legal avenue’. Mark Menzies, Conservative MP for . Fylde, said: ‘I know residents have been awaiting this decision by the . Supreme Court for some time so I’m sure they are pleased things can now . begin to move forward once again.’ Last night one of the travellers insisted there was no question of them moving out. Arguing . there were no legal traveller camps in the area to move to, Sharlene . Collins said: ‘We are not going anywhere, we have no place to go, we are . homeless. Find us a place, we have nowhere to go. They are treating us . like animals. ‘They let people come in from Europe and yet they won’t find us a place. We’ve no place to go.’ And in an apparent threat, she added: ‘We are not moving – at the end of the day it will cost the council millions to move us.’","The Supreme Court has rejected pleas for the travellers to be allowed to appeal eviction ordered by the Court of Appeal .

"As the Ebola virus continues to rip through west Africa, with more than 4,000 killed, Britain is sending hospital ship HMS Argus to help combat the deadly disease. While this rescue mission is not set to arrive for several days, Captain Jim Masters, 86, has told of his experience being sent to fight the first Ebola outbreak in Africa in 1976. Cpt Masters was serving in the army when word began spreading of a then-unknown virus killing thousands of villagers living along the Ebola river in Zaire - from where the disease takes its name. Captain Jim Masters was leading expeditions across Africa in the Seventies when he was recruited to hand out medical supplies along the Ebola River in Zaire, where a then-unknown virus had killed thousands . Cpt Masters (left, without a shirt) greets fellow explorer John Blashford-Snell during an expedition along the Nile shortly before he was tasked with containing the first Ebola outbreak . The forces had no information on where the infection had come from or how it was being spread. All they knew was that it killed 90 per cent of those who became infected. Cpt Masters had previously lead an expedition down the Nile River, and was taking another mission into Zaire when he was recruited by the country's top doctor to help distribute medical supplies. Dr Bill Close, personal physician to Congolese president Mobutu Sese Seko, asked him to go into the infection zone and help set up a quarantine zone. Masters' orders were to set up the zone, then fly a specialist U.S. medical team in by helicopter. After the team were in, Cpt Masters was to keep the them supplied with whatever they needed, and help collect samples from victims to be sent back to the U.S. for analysis. He said: 'I wasn’t really scared, mainly out of ignorance. 'One day I was sent for to be told that a deadly fever was killing hundreds of people in the Equateur Province, and was concentrated near a river called Ebola. When Cpt Masters was sent to help contain the epidemic, nobody knew where the virus came from or how it was spread, they only knew it killed 90 per cent of those who became infected . 'The sick were going to a Catholic mission hospital hoping to get help. Sadly at this stage, little could be done as the fever had no history. It was killing more than 90 per cent of those who contracted it. 'Dr Close had been aware of the true nature of the threat and sent for an investigative team from the United States. 'There was plenty of information about what was happening, but none on why. Its source and carriers were unknown. 'The fear was that it could spread into other areas, even to population centres like Kinshasa, the capital, and from there to anywhere in the world.' It is believed that fruit bats were the original carriers of Ebola, but spread it to other animals such as chimpanzees, gorillas, monkeys, forest antelope and porcupines through bites or faeces. The disease is then thought to have passed into humans through contact with the blood, bodily fluids, or dead bodies of infected animals found lying in the rainforest. In humans the virus has an incubation period of between two and 21 days. Once a person begins to show symptoms they become infectious, and can spread the disease through blood or bodily fluids. After several days in Zaire, Cpt Masters managed to set up supplies sub-depot in each of the country’s nine regions the affected area was put on lock-down. He was asked to get the world’s leading experts to the centre of the epidemic - the Equateur Province - so chartered planes and army helicopters to Lisala. The team arrived at the hospital staffed by Belgian and French Catholic missionaries and government staff. He recalled: 'No air or river movements were permitted in or out of that part of Equateur and the almost impossible task of preventing overland movements was put in hand. 'Perhaps in a more developed part of the world this could not have been done successfully, but in Zaire the cordon was complete. 'My task was to get the team of researchers, including Dr Cal Johnson, one of the world’s leading experts on tropical fevers, to the site by plane and helicopter, keep them supplied with whatever they needed and to collect medical samples which would be flown to the US for further studies. Captain Masters (second left) is pictured sailing between the remote Dahlak Islands in Eritrea shortly before being sent to deal with the first Ebola outbreak . 'There also needed to be a withdrawal system should things go badly wrong for the team, and one, or more, of their number be struck down with fever. 'I went in with the first team, taking a couple of my craftsmen to set up a field laboratory at the mission hospital.' Speaking of the medics, he said: 'I was lost in admiration for them as already members of the staff had died at their posts from the effects of the fever. '[The outbreak] left me with a lifelong admiration for those who battle sickness and disease. 'I came to realise that it is not just enough to find cures for the illnesses we already know about but to be on guard against the new developments which evolve with life itself.'","Jim Masters was leading expedition in Africa when outbreak occurred in 1976 .

"David Cameron last night ordered an inquiry to establish the ‘full facts’ of a vicious spat between two of his most senior Cabinet Ministers. Simmering tensions between Michael  Gove and Theresa May over Islamist extremism exploded into open warfare late on Tuesday evening. Mr Gove was given a dressing-down by the Prime Minister for triggering the row – prompting speculation he could be moved in the upcoming Cabinet reshuffle. Feud: Mr Gove, left was given a dressing-down by the Prime Minister for triggering the row with Mrs May, right . There was particular anger that Mr Gove started the damaging spat on the eve of the Queen’s Speech, but senior officials also raised concerns about the ferocity of the attacks on the Education Secretary by allies of Mrs May, which were described as an ‘extraordinary over-reaction’ by one source. The Prime Minister now wants to know the exact role played by the warring ministers and their special advisers. In particular, the inquiry is likely to focus on why the Home Office published a letter from Mrs May, that was deeply critical of the Education Department, in the early hours of yesterday. The letter fanned the flames of the row by suggesting Mr Gove’s department had ignored warnings about the ‘Trojan horse’ infiltration of Birmingham schools by Islamist extremists. The details of the dispute date back to a meeting of the Government’s extremism task force last November. Mr Gove wanted to broaden the definition of extremism so that more hardline organisations would be covered. When Mrs May refused, saying the move risked pushing individuals into feeling persecuted and more susceptible to being radicalised, Mr Gove took his case to the Prime Minister. Earlier this week, after becoming frustrated by his failure to change the Home Office’s position, Mr Gove opted to make the dispute public via a toxic briefing to The Times newspaper. Anger: David Cameron is said to be furious over the row. Mr Gove and Mrs May later issued a joint statement on No 10's instruction . Over lunch with the paper’s editor, he is understood to have criticised Mrs May and her senior counter- terrorism adviser Charles Farr, who is the architect of anti-extremism policy. When Mrs May’s aides learned of the briefing, they made a stinging attack on Mr Gove. One said of his department: ‘Lord knows what more they have overlooked on the subject of the protection of kids in state schools. It scares me.’ In the early hours of yesterday, the Home Office made public the letter from Mrs May to Mr Gove, concerning the ongoing investigation into whether Muslim hardliners had tried to seize control of 21 schools in Birmingham. She wrote: ‘Is it true that Birmingham City Council was warned about these allegations in 2008? ‘Is it true that the Department for Education was warned in 2010? If so, why did nobody act? It is clear to me that we will need to take clear action to improve the quality of staffing and governance if we are to prevent extremism in schools.’ As the fight threatened to spiral out of control, Mr Gove was contacted by Ed Llewellyn, the Prime Minister’s chief-of-staff, and ordered to end  hostilities. He was also spoken to by Mr Cameron personally. Silent: Charles Far, pictured, has conducted his relationship discretely. As a civil servant, he is unable to answer criticisms in public . Mrs May and Mr Gove issued a joint statement, on the instruction of No 10, promising to work together in future. Sources say there is irritation in Government that Mr Gove again opted to make an internal dispute public – gifting Labour the opportunity to portray the Tories as divided. It is the second time in weeks that the Education Secretary has been forced to put on a show of unity after a public spat with a colleague. Last month the Prime Minister stepped in to defuse a spat between Mr Gove and his Liberal Democrat deputy, David Laws, over free school meals. Of the latest dispute, one Cabinet source said: ‘The Prime Minister thinks Michael is a very talented minister and when the history books are written, he’ll go down as one of the great education reformers. But this was not seen as helpful.’ If Mr Gove is shifted from Education Secretary, possibly to become Tory chairman, schools minister Elizabeth Truss is tipped as his successor. However, some senior Tories were taken aback at the aggressive nature of the Home Office’s response to Mr Gove’s criticisms. The highly unusual publication of Mrs May’s barbed letter in the early hours of yesterday morning caused particular surprise. ‘This is internal Cabinet correspondence and the Home Office decides to put it out at 2 o’clock in the morning? I’m afraid it looks like the sort of rush of blood to the head that Theresa May is normally very good at avoiding,’ said one minister. Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said: ‘For two such senior ministers to launch a vitriolic public blame game in this way is appalling and irresponsible when they should be working together to sort out such serious problems. ‘Too often both Michael Gove and Theresa May resort to public blame games rather than taking any responsibility themselves or working together with others. ‘This is bad government and David Cameron should sort it out.’ There are long-standing differences between Mrs May and Mr Gove over counter-terrorism strategy, and also simmering tensions over the future leadership of the party, with Mr Gove understood to be opposed to Mrs May taking over. He favoured first Boris Johnson then George Osborne as a so-called ‘Stop Theresa’ candidate. His blast against Mrs May coincided with polls showing she is the clear favourite to replace Mr Cameron. In the open: Nick Robinson mentioned the relationship between Charles Farr and Fiona Cunningham (pictured) on the Today programme . BBC Political Editor Nick Robinson  yesterday highlighted a relationship between two of Theresa May’s top advisers – shedding more light on the spat between the Home Office and the Department for Education. Charles Farr, 54, and Fiona Cunningham, 40, were thrust into the spotlight when Mr Robinson told Radio 4’s Today programme their relationship was a ‘complicating factor’ in the battle between Mrs May and Michael Gove. Mr Robinson appeared to suggest Miss Cunningham was responsible for anonymous quotes in The Times from a ‘Home Office source’ attacking Mr Gove, who the newspaper said had been ‘particularly critical of Charles Farr’. Mr Robinson told listeners: ‘The  complicating factor is that Charles Farr is in a relationship with Theresa May’s special adviser [Miss Cunningham] who was behind many of the quotes that are in the newspapers today. ‘So there is a personal element, but let me stress: that’s not the key to this story.’","Tensions have simmered over handling of 'Trojan Horse' extremism plot .

"Researchers are baffled as the sun has gone quiet during a time in its 11-year-cycle when it should be at its most active. Just a few weeks ago it was bursting with sunspots but now it seems to be going days without even developing a single dark spot. Solar physicist Tony Phillips has named it an 'All Quiet Event.' Sunspots attract attention because they highlight the part of the sun where solar activity, such as this solar flare, originates . 'It is weird, but it's not super weird,' he told The Los Angeles Times. 'To have a spotless day during maximum is odd, but then again, this solar maximum we are in has been very wimpy.' Phillips is an expert about such activity and writes about it on his site, SpaceWeather.com. Sunspots attract attention because they highlight the part of the sun where solar activity originates. That can mean solar flares or even coronal mass ejections, which happen when material from the son shoots into space. The phenomena occur by high;y concentrated magnetic fields which are slightly cooler than the surface of the sun. Energy builds up as the fields become tangled, and when that energy is released in an explosion it results in a solar flare. Just a few weeks ago it was bursting with sunspots but now it seems to be going days without even developing a single dark spot . Phillips noted that hit solar maximum seems to be the weakest of the past century, making spotless days to be expected. Back on Aug. 14, 2011, the sun was completely free of spots and that year still managed to have a high rate of solar activity overall. Phillips described it as a case of 'temporary intermission.' It's still unknown if this period will be similar. 'It . all underlines that solar physicists really don't know what the heck is . happening on the sun,' he said. 'We just don't know how to . predict the sun, that is the take away message of this event.' Alex Young, a a heliophysicist at Goddard Space Flight Center, echoed that sentiment. 'We've . only been observing the sun in lots of detail in the last 50 years,' Young said. 'That's not that long considering it's been around for 4.5 . billion years.'","Just a few weeks ago it was bursting with sunspots but now it seems to be going days without even developing a single dark spot .

"He is meant to be helping to save the planet. Yet Lord Prescott has clocked up more than 40,000 air miles in five months – all while travelling to and from climate change conferences. Since February the ex-Deputy Prime Minister and former Environment Secretary has attended all-expenses paid summits in Europe, North America, India and China. There he has delivered lectures on the perils of damaging the environment and discussed new legislation which could restrict the ability of others to fly or drive cars in future. Scroll down for video . What a gentleman: Lord Prescott carries the bags while Lady Prescott brings up the rear . But he has been leaving a substantial carbon footprint of his own. The circumference of the globe is about 25,000 miles, meaning the former Hull East MP has travelled around the world almost twice in less than six months. Analysis of declarations made by Lord Prescott in the House of Lords register of interests shows that between February 4 and 8 the former Environment Secretary was in Delhi to speak at a sustainable development summit. The flights – more than 4,000 miles each way – were funded by the British Embassy. Transfers and hotel accommodation were provided by the Delhi-based Energy and Resources Institute and Lord Prescott’s expenses were paid by Globe International, an organisation for parliamentarians involved in green policy making. Between February 26 and 28, Lord Prescott was about 4,000 miles away in Washington to attend and speak at Globe’s Climate Legislation Summit. His flights, hotel and subsistence were paid for by Globe International. His next trip was to Berlin on April 1 and 2, for meetings with Globe members, ministers and ‘climate negotiators’. Again, his travel and expenses were paid by Globe, while overnight accommodation for the 1,200-mile round trip was provided by the British Ambassador’s residence. Lord Prescott then visited Paris on May 19 and 20 in order to attend meetings with climate negotiators, with subsistence and travel expenses paid for by Globe. He flew to Mexico City – 5,545 miles away – between June 5 and 8 to attend meetings at the Mexican Congress with ‘climate negotiators’ organised by Globe, which paid for the peer’s hotel and travel expenses. And last month he visited Guiyang in China from July 8 to 12 to attend the Eco-Forum Global (EFG) annual summer conference, where he gave a speech at the opening ceremony. Flights totalled about 11,000 miles for the round trip and were paid for, along with his accommodation, by Beijing-registered EFG. Last November Lord Prescott flew to Cuba for a week’s holiday to write an article for The Guardian Weekend Travel Magazine. His flights for the 9,000-mile round trip were paid for by travel firm Journey Latin America. His hotel and subsistence were paid by the Cuban Tourist Board.

"Stepping in as a late replacement for Stephen Thompson, Benson Henderson makes his UFC debut in the welterweight division on Saturday night, when he faces off against devastating finisher and fellow Coloradoan Brandon Thatch. Coming into the fight off the back of two losses in the lightweight bracket, former champion Henderson will take the leap up a weight class, in what will be the five-round main event in his home town. 'We had been contemplating the move to 170lb a lot,' Henderson told Sportsmail. 'It is pretty tough to take the weight off sometimes. Not having to cut weight will definitely be a positive. Scroll down to watch videos . Benson Henderson is moving up a division to fight Brandon Thatch at welterweight . Henderson plans to return to lightweight in the future despite moving up to take on Thatch . 'I will be giving up a little strength and size, but I've sparred with plenty of top 170 guys at our gym. I will be a little bit faster, quicker, agile and more athletic than the 170 guys.' For the first time, Henderson, who usually has a size advantage over his counterparts at 155lbs, will be the smaller fighter in the Octagon when he meets Thatch at the 1st Bank Center. Nevertheless, the MMA Lab fighter insists that he will return to lightweight after the fight: . 'This is not a permanent move to 170. I'll be back at 155,' he said. 'This was just me stepping up for an opportunity. There are some other 170 match-ups that interest me, but I'm probably not staying at 170.' Thatch, standing at 6'2', is also well aware of the size advantage that he will command inside the Octagon: 'I'm a bigger, longer fighter,' he said. 'I feel like as long as I keep him on the end of my jab and stay long, I'll be successful in this fight.' Thatch (left) is looking for his third win in succession since he joined the UFC . A dynamic striker, Thatch has dispatched his first two opponents since signing with the UFC, with finishes over Paulo Thiago and Justin Edwards in the first round. In his 11 pro MMA bouts to date, Thatch has competently finished each of his opponents in the opening round. And while headlining a fight card of this scale might present an added pressure for the 29-year-old, he is confident that he can utilise this to his advantage.

"NBC's coverage of the London Olympics may have drawn record ratings, but it has been met with an often derisive reception from many parts of the internet. While most of the criticism has focussed on the controversial tape delay, several commentators have now turned on host Ryan Seacrest, who anchors much of the coverage. Many have attacked Mr Seacrest's background in showbiz rather than sport, with one journalist describing him as 'a personality marked mostly by lack of personality'. However, the star hit back at the criticism, saying: 'You can't please everyone.' Criticism: Fans and commentators have complained about Ryan Seacrest's Olympics coverage . Lightweight? Mr Seacrest trained with U.S. gymnasts and offered to put them in touch with Justin Bieber . Mr Seacrest, who is best known for presenting American Idol and producing Keeping Up With the Kardashians, has little experience broadcasting sporting events. He has appeared on NBC every day of the Olympics, interviewing U.S. medallists and joining the Today show team in a number of sporting-themed activities. The gap between his sporting inexperience and his presence on the airwaves has angered some established sports journalists as well as web users. 'Everyone in the industry is talking about what a bad move it was to include Ryan Seacrest on the NBC coverage this year,' an anonymous sportscaster told Radar Online. Excited: The presenter seemed to be in his element during the glitzy opening ceremony . Defence: Mr Seacrest admitted that 'you can't please everyone' but pointed out NBC's strong ratings . One acerbic tweeter wrote: 'Who better to cover the greatest athletes in the world than Ryan Seacrest... probably almost anybody'. And Los Angeles Times television critic Mary McNamara added to the abuse, saying his appearances showed 'not only his lack of sports knowledge but also the mystifyingly successful Seacrest brand of blandocity.' She added: 'Though inarguably one of the hardest workers in the industry, he is, on television anyway, a personality marked mostly by lack of personality, a greeter more than a host, a scrim more than a player.' According to Ms McNamara, one of Mr Seacrest's most memorable moments came when he promised to put U.S. gymnasts in touch with singer Justin Bieber. Inexperienced: The star is better known for hosting American Idol and producing the Kardashian shows . Games: NBC viewers have been denied the chance to watch stars such as swimmers Michael Phelps and Ryan Lochte live . The presenter has attempted to defend himself as well as NBC, which has repeatedly come under fire for delaying the broadcast of key events such as races involving Michael Phelps. He told the Hollywood Reporter: 'As I've learned from all my years in television, you can't please everyone. I believe the huge ratings NBC has drawn for the Olympics speak for themselves.' When asked what made sports coverage different from Hollywood, Mr Seacrest replied: 'Olympic athletes are celebrities too, so there are similarities, though athletes are typically a lot taller.' Jim Bell, executive producer of the network's Olympic coverage, also stood up for NBC, saying: 'Of course we're going to do everything we can to serve the audience.'",American Idol star defends himself saying: 'You can't please everyone'
"Two veterans of the UFC heavyweight division will meet on Sunday night in Porto Alegre, Brazil, as Antonio ‘Bigfoot’ Silva faces former heavyweight champion Frank Mir, in what is arguably a must-win fight for both men. With Mir’s last win under the UFC banner coming back in December 2011, and Silva’s dating back to February 2013, the Brazilian crowd can expect to see two giants in the Octagon throw caution to the wind as they look to underline their relevance in the division. And Silva is especially keen to return to winning ways in front of his countrymen. UFC heavyweight fighter Antonio 'Bigfoot' Silva poses at an open training session . Silva grapples with an opponent during an open training session ahead of his fight with Frank Mir . Silva says it is 'important' to him that he wins and pointed out he always won his fights held in February . 'It is really important to me to win, especially because of the opportunities the UFC has been giving me.' he told Sportsmail. 'And you know what, I have fought four times in February in my career and won all of them. 'I don’t feel any pressure. It doesn’t matter where I am fighting; I just want to win and I will give my best.' But while 'Bigfoot' was respectful of his opponent, he remains adamant that he will be looking to finish the bout as quickly as possible, once the contest gets underway: . 'Mir is a great athlete. He has many strengths but he also has his weaknesses,' he said. 'I will try to explore these flaws and finish the fight as fast as possible. People can expect a tough fight, with Bigfoot looking for the win all the time – this is what matters to me, the victory.' Mir was also quick to compliment his opponent. 'I don’t think he has any weaknesses, he is a very tough guy and I expect it to be a five round fight,' he said. Coming into the clash on the back of a four-fight losing streak, nothing but a win will be enough to guarantee the American submission specialist another outing with the promotion.

"Voicing her concerns: Camille Paglia is urging a major overhaul of sexual education classes in public schools so that the information is more focused on actual needs of students . A top academic has called for massive changes in the sex ed system so that rather than simply being told not to get pregnant, young girls should have discussions about how early their fertility rates begin to drop and when they should start trying to have children. Camille Paglia, who is best known for her 1990 book Sexual Personae, made the bold declaration because she says the current  curriculum is so focused on preventing pregnancy and 'abstinence only' education that it may hinder would-be mothers later in life. 'Sobering facts about women’s declining fertility after their 20s are being withheld from ambitious young women, who are propelled along a career track devised for men,' Ms Paglia wrote in an op-ed for Time. This is an idea she feels passionate . about, saying teachers and parents should force their daughters to think . about the larger picture of their life rather than just the present. 'I . want every 14-year-old girl...to be told: You better start thinking . what do you want in life. If you just want a career and no children you . don't have much to worry about,' she said in a December Wall Street Journal interview. 'If, . however, you are thinking you'd like to have children some day you . should start thinking about when do you want to have them. Early or . late? To have them early means you are going to make a career sacrifice, . but you're going to have more energy and less risks. Both the pros and . the cons should be presented.' She . goes on to explain that informing young girls about the rates at which . fertility rates will drop off in their late 20s should not be taken as a . seal of approval for teenage sex. Separating the sexes: Paglia argues that boys and girls need to be taught different things in the classes and it is 'absurd' to address their concerns in the same setting, citing issues like date rape and fertility . 'My . generation of baby-boom girls boldly rebelled against the cult of . virginity of the Doris Day 1950s, but we left chaos in our wake. Young . people are now bombarded prematurely with sexual images and messages,' Ms Paglia wrote in Time. She . announced that girls and boys have to be separated during sexual . education courses because it is 'absurd' to pretend that the sexes deal . with the issue in the same way. Big ideas: Paglia made her mark on the academic world with her 1990 tome that analyzed the history of gender dynamics . 'Boys . need lessons in basic ethics and moral reasoning about sex (for . example, not taking advantage of intoxicated dates), while girls must . learn to distinguish sexual compliance from popularity,' she said. Ms Paglia, 66, has described herself as a 'contrarian' whose work has focused largely on sexual gender dynamics. She writes that the morality issues that are so intrinsically linked to . sex ed by politicians needs to be taken out of schools and that the . classes need to be taught as impartially- almost clinically- as . possible. 'The liberal . response to conservatives’ demand for abstinence-only sex education has . been to condemn the imposition of “fear and shame” on young people. But . perhaps a bit more self-preserving fear and shame might be helpful in . today’s hedonistic, media-saturated environment,' Ms Paglia writes. Among the suggestions she pushes for are . the removal of condoms from schools, the inclusion of menopause in . biology class curriculum, and the ban on any perceived endorsement of . homosexual relationships by sex ed teachers. 'In . my view, antibullying campaigns, however laudable, should not stray . into political endorsement of homosexuality or gay rights causes. While . students must be free to create gay-identified groups, the schools . themselves should remain neutral and allow society to evolve on its . own,' she writes. Ms Paglia was in a relationship with a female artist for more than a decade and legally adopted her partner's son in 2002. The couple split in 2007.","Paglia, one of the leading academics in gender and sexual dynamics, has revealed that sex ed should not be focused on preventing pregnancies .
Says that young girls need to be aware of fertility rates so that they can plan whether or not they want to focus on their career or family early on .

"Booming supermarket chain Lidl is set to move into some of London's wealthiest neighbourhoods as it launches a new range of 48 premium French wines to tempt rich customers. The German discount chain currently only has a handful of shops in the capital, most of which in less privileged areas of the city, and none in the centre. However, Lidl is now making a push for wealthier shoppers by selling wines from classic regions such as Bordeaux and Châteauneuf-du-Pape for as little as £5. Scroll down for video . Booming: Supermarket chain Lidl is set to move into some of London's wealthiest neighbourhoods as it launches a new range of 48 premium French wines to tempt rich customers . The wines will go on sale in a French promotion - the chain's largest wine event - on September 5, with wines only available for a limited period. Shoppers will be able to snap up a Côtes de Gascogne Sauvignon Blanc L'Escargot 2013 for just £4.99, or can pay £25.99 for a Haut-Médoc Sociando Mallet 2008 Bordeaux. The following month a further eight wines will hit the shelves, all available for less than £7, including a £4.99 Languedoc-Roussillon, Pays d'Oc Cabernet Sauvignon Bouchard 2013, and a £6.99 Médoc Château Taffard 2011. If the promotion, thought to be worth £12million, proves to be a success, a range of what the chain calls 'super premium' wines will go on sale in selected stores at a future date. This selection includes a £49.99 2000 Premier Cru Hospices de Beaune from Burgundy, but also a Sauternes Cuvee d'Exception le Tertre du Lys D'Or 2006 Bordeaux for just £7.99. Wine buyers at Lidl have purchased more than one million bottles from all of France's classic regions. Hoping for success: The supermarket hopes the promotion will tempt shoppers away from more traditional rivals such as Tesco and Sainsbury's . The supermarket hopes the promotion will tempt shoppers away from more traditional rivals such as Tesco and Sainsbury’s. A spokesman from the chain told MailOnline that the promotion will be Lidl's 'largest wine offer' ever. 'Lidl will be launching 48 wines in a French promotion which starts on September 4th, the wines will be on the shelf until stocks last,'  she said. She added: 'The selection of wines come from across many of the classic French wine regions including Bordeaux, The Loire Valley and Châteauneuf-du-Pape. 'With wine ranging from £5 -£25 there is something for anyone with an interest in French wine.' French wine makers said they have been surprised by the scale of Lidl’s ambition – particularly as it is a name they might have steered clear of a few years ago. Paul Goldschmidt, owner of Chateau Siaurac in Lalande de Pomerol in the region of Bordeaux, is supplying a 2007 Reserve de la Baronne priced at £13.99. He said: ‘Some retailers bargain on quality – but Lidl didn’t.’ Lidl, and similar chain Aldi, have boomed in recent years, finding success among middle-classes by undercutting British supermarkets on luxury goods. And figures released earlier this month revealed that the combined sales of Lidl and Aldi are likely to top £10billion and overtake . those of Morrisons. The two chains together now hold more than eight per cent of the country's grocery market. Experts have put their rapid rise down to middle-class shoppers deserting . the likes of Sainsbury’s, Tesco and even Waitrose, for the discount . chains. Lidl now has more than 600 UK shops in the UK, and expects to generate record sales of £7 billion this year after sales up to July grew by more than 22 per cent. Recent openings have seen the chain target more affluent areas such as Maidenhead in Berkshire, and Dorking in Surrey, with central London expected to follow shortly. 'There are challenges but if we really want to be established as a leading retailer in the UK then we have to have a presence in central London,' Lidl's senior buying manager Ben Hulme told the Evening Standard. Mr Hulme said he was confident that the forthcoming wine promotion would help bring new shoppers to the store. He added: 'We want to be aiming at people who have not considered us before. The message is ""come and a give it a try. Pick up a few bottles and see if you like them"".'","German discount chain currently has just a handful of stores in London .

"A mother allegedly slashed her nine-month-old baby’s throat just months after telling a pastor she could be possessed and might hurt the girl. Bradie Simpson, 39, of Camdenton, Missouri, was found in woods 225ft from her home as she held the baby covered in blood with a neck wound.

"Porn could come to Google Glass as early as this week, with the first X- rated app set to be launched for those who have the £1,000 gadget. Porn directors last week announced plans to use Google Glass eyewear for X-rated films to explore the 'full potential' of the technology. Now the Android adult app store MiKandi has reportedly confirmed it is already making content to be viewed on the wearable computer, and it could ready within the next few days. Excited: Porn directors are looking forward to trying out Google Glasses as a new way to shoot adult films. Here Google co-founder Sergey Brin poses in a pair the highly coveted technology . It is likely to be another . embarrassing revelation for Google, which has faced somewhat of a . backlash over their latest technology. Cafe owners, cinemas and strip clubs . in the US have already announced they are banning the technology from . their premises out of respect for customer's privacy. MiKandi produces hundreds of 'not safe for work' (NSFW) and adult apps. CNET reports it is seeking to create . content with Glass as well as for Glass, and the company said users can . expect to see the first Glass app as soon as this week. MiKandi told ZDNet - CNET sister site: 'Google Glass Porn has been making its rounds, and while studios are intrigued, no one seems to be doing anything about it. Porn star Alana Evans, left, says the Google Glasses will spark a huge drive in POV movies while fellow entertainer Missy Martinez believes they lead to a slew of amateur gonzo sex tapes . 'So I wanted to let you know that we picked up our Glass and, yup, we're making content for it.' Chiefs from the adult film industry . last week said they were interested in using the wearable computers for . point-of-view shots. They said it would allow them to operate in a 'truly hands-free fashion' as opposed to having one hand on the camera. Google . Glass has caused concern because it has a camera next to the wearer's . eye which can take photos or record video without a red light or a . shutter sound to tell others that it is working . Casinos . said they could help cheaters to win unfairly and cinemas said that . they could be used to illegally record films and sell pirate copies. Parks . departments and banks across America are also waiting to see how the . new technology is used before deciding whether or not to ban them. Google's . chairman Eric Schmidt once admitted that the aim with technology like . Google Glass was to 'go right up to the creepy line and not cross it'.

McDonald's restaurant in Paris when he claims an employee tried to . physically remove a similar gadget he designed from his head. Amateur producers are also said to be especially keen . to get their hands on a pair as they shoot high quality video and make . it even easier to film home porn movie. Google Glass costs $1,500 a pair and is currently on limited release to 2,000 people. It will be more widely available later this year or in 2014. Q . Boyer, a spokesman for porn film makers Pink Visual, said last week: . 'To really know their full potential, we'll need to get a pair to play . around with, but we're already dreaming up ways to use the glasses to . get shots (sex-related and otherwise) that just aren't feasible using a . traditional camera setup. 'Obviously . a device that allows you to shoot high-quality video in a truly . hands-free fashion will make shooting point of view (POV) porn that much . easier'. Porn actress Alana Evans has already said it would spark a 'huge drive' in POV filming. And . Missy Martinez, another porn actress, has said it could lead to a slew . of 'gonzo-style' movies from amateurs with no experience. Dave .

He has placed a sign on the wall which reads: 'Respect our customers' privacy as we'd expect them to respect yours'. Cinemas have said they do not want the technology as people may be able to film new releases and distribute pirate copies.

"Two new parents' world was shattered when their baby was born 16 weeks prematurely and given just a 10 per cent chance of survival. Brooke and Shaun Simons’ son Jack was born at just 24 weeks, weighing 1lb 9oz. The distraught mother and father were told that if their son survived, it was likely he would suffer long-term health complications. Jack was given just a 10 per cent chance of survival but has beaten the odds to celebrate his first birthday . Jack was born 16 weeks early at just 1lb 9oz . Jack's tiny size be appreciated when he is pictured next to his mother's hand . It took four and half weeks for Jack to come off his ventilator: only then could his parents finally hold him . A year on, and Jack is a happy, healthy baby, but reaching his first birthday was to be the toughest struggle of all of their lives. ‘Pushing out a baby that you are not ready to have is the hardest thing I have ever had to do’ explains Mrs Simons. ‘The excruciating pain a mother experiences when they are in labour is made bearable by the excitement of finally meeting their baby for the first time. I was going through it but with a 90 per cent risk of seeing a lifeless body. ‘I did not understand how our entire lives were about to change in a way we never though possible.’ Mrs Simons had some twinges throughout her pregnancy, which she presumed quite normal. But when, at 23 and half weeks pregnant, she suffered severe back pain and felt unwell, she went to see her doctor. Any skin to skin contact is beneficial for preterm babies as it helps regulate their temperature and helps fight infection . Mr and Mrs Simons put their son's survival down to the amazing team at Luton and Dunstable hospital's NICU where he stayed for over 4 months . After examining her, he informed her she was actually two to three cm dilated. She was in labour. ‘I was rushed to Luton and Dunstable hospital where I was given two steroid injections which would help the baby have any chance of using its lungs so early. ‘The anxiety in both our bodies – my husband and I – was palpable and the fear of the unknown was too frightening to comprehend. ‘After four days of efforts to keep the baby inside, I went into full labour lasting 19 hours. No one could tell us why this was actually happening. ‘Jack was whisked away to be stabilised minutes after he was born. We managed to have a peek at him through the tears and heartbreak, but weren’t allowed to hold him. ‘Standing at Jack’s side, in his incubator, a doctor told us he was “doing satisfactorily”. My husband asked if that was good. The doctor replied with “It’s satisfactory, and that’s the best I can give you.”’ It took four and half weeks for Jack to build up the strength to come off his ventilator; only then could his parents hold him for the first time. It was at this point that Mrs Simons says she finally felt like a mother. She said: ‘It was the most perfect moment of my life. He was just 2lb, and it was like holding a small furry Guinea pig. During his four and half months on the NICU, he suffered from chronic lung disease, an open duct in his heart (PDA), hyperglycaemia and septicaemia, among other traumas. Jack under went numerous ultrasounds and X-rays, 10 blood transfusions, chemical injections into his eyes and many courses of antibiotics . ‘This cuddle wasn’t just for us, it was for him too. Skin to skin, or ""kangaroo"" care, is beneficial for preterm babies as it helps regulate their temperature and helps fight infection. ‘We learnt a lot at our time on the NICU (Neonatal Intensive Care Unit). It’s like entering a world we never knew existed. ‘The noise of a million machines beeping and buzzing, medical words and abbreviations flying out of doctors' and nurses' mouths, but hardly any noise from the actual babies. They couldn’t physically cry.' Mr and Mrs Simons put their son’s survival down to the amazing team at Luton and Dunstable hospital’s NICU. The doctors and nurses worked around the clock to make sure Jack was taken care of. During his four and half months on the NICU, Jack suffered from chronic lung disease, an open duct in his heart (PDA), hyperglycaemia and septicaemia, among other traumas. Even as he grew stronger Jack had to remain on nasal oxygen to help his undeveloped lungs . As Jack recovered, his parents were able to feed him themselves .

On the 11th February, three weeks after his due date, Jack was able to return home . He had numerous ultrasounds and X-rays, 10 blood transfusions, chemical injections into his eyes and many courses of antibiotics. ‘Those four months were full of ups and downs. If Jack was having a good day, so did we. If he had a bad day, it was even worse for us. ‘We always remained positive though. And with all our friends and family around us, praying for Jack, we managed to stay strong. ‘On the 11th February, three weeks after his due date, our baby came home with us. He was still on nasal oxygen for a further 12 weeks. ‘Today we have a very happy and healthy beautiful boy who is hitting all his milestones. ‘He is now on the move and there is no stopping him! The family say: 'We owe everything to Luton and Dunstable hospital. They without doubt saved Jack's life' Brooke says: 'He is now on the move and there is no stopping him!' Jack is a very happy and healthy beautiful boy who is hitting all his milestones . Within hours of setting up a Just Giving account in Jack's name, over £8,000 had been raised for the hospital . ‘We owe everything to Luton and Dunstable hospital. They without doubt saved Jack’s life.’ After Jack was allowed home, Mr and Mrs Simons set up a Justgiving.com charity link and within 24 hours they had raised over £8,000 for the hospital. Today, the total stands at £19,655. The money will be used to develop and grow the NICU to be able to accommodate more parents in their position. ‘We were so lucky the space was available for us. Had it not been, our story might have had a very different ending.’ ‘It is World Prematurity Day on November 17th, and we wanted to bring our story to the attention of parents that might be going through the same thing as we did. ‘You must stay positive. There are so many amazing doctors, nurses and incredible medicines to help premature babies. There IS hope,’ they say. To donate to Jack’s cause, click here.

But since then she has moved on to set up her own firm with bases in London and Winchester, with her clients wives believed to include Pamela Haworth, the fifth wife of the . Marquess of Northampton and Meshkah Tawfik, who married a Qatari Sheikh. A high profile case she is dealing with involves a former Miss Malaysia who could receive Britain's biggest ever divorce settlement of up to £500million after splitting from her multimillionaire husband.

When he heard about the advert campaign he is said to have called his own lawyers who claimed that Vardags had suggested should avoid Mr Tooth's firm and go there. They also spoke of copyright infringement, malicious falsehood and defamation. Ms Vardag, through her lawyers, said no clients had instructed Vardags as a result of the advert. The Times reported that Vardags said Mr Tooth had not 'lost . his crown' and agreed to pay £5,000 and £38,000 in costs, but would not admit it was at fault.","Raymond 'Jaws' Tooth and Ayesha Vardag have fallen out over an advert .

"Leading geneticists from around the world have joined forces to slam a new book which claims there is a biological basis for racial differences in behaviour. Nearly 150 geneticists have signed a letter condemning the book, written by science writer Nicholas Wade, called A Troublesome Inheritance: Genes, Race and Human History. The book sparked controversy after claiming recent human evolution has led to racial differences in economic and social behaviour. Nearly 150 geneticists have signed a letter condemning the book, written by science writer Nicholas Wade (left), called A Troublesome Inheritance: Genes, Race and Human History (right) But some of the scientists on whom he based parts of his work have lashed out claiming the old Etonian - a former New York Times science editor - has ‘misappropriated’  elements of research from their field. According the the book's description on the Amazon website, 'Wade argues . that what we might call middle-class social traits: thrift, docility and . nonviolence, have been slowly inculcated genetically within agrarian . societies. 'Also . controversial are his findings regarding the genetic basis of traits we . associate with intelligence, such as literacy and numeracy, in certain . ethnic populations, including the Chinese and Ashkenazi Jews.' The . description continues: 'Wade believes deeply in the fundamental . equality of all people but he is determined to investigate what new . genetic science shows about how race relates to human history and . traits, even if it courts controversy.' In a letter to the New York Times Book Review, they wrote: 'Wade juxtaposes an incomplete and inaccurate account of our research on human genetic differences with speculation that recent natural selection has led to worldwide differences in I.Q. test results, political institutions and economic development. 'We reject Wade’s implication that our findings substantiate his guesswork. They do not. 'We are in full agreement that there is no support from the field of population genetics for Wade’s conjectures.' Prominent geneticists including Evan Eichler of the University of Washington, Seattle and Michael Hammer of the University of Arizona were among those who signed the letter. According to the Independent, Mr Wade, who moved to the U.S. from Britain in 1970, writes in his book that natural selection on the main continents has prompted differences in aspects of the function of the brain.

"Comedian Stephen Colbert has been provoked a storm on Twitter with calls for his show to be cancelled after the official account for his Colbert Report show posted an offensive joke. The line was taken from a skit about the offensive nature of the name of the Washington Redskins, but was interpreted as a racist joke poking fun at Asian people when taken out of context. The 'joke' was quickly deleted after an online backlash saw the post go viral and the hashtag #CancelColbert began trending on Twitter. Scroll down for video . Under attack: Calls were made for comedianStephen Colbert's show to be cancelled after the official The Colbert Report account tweeted a joke poking fun at Asian people . Offensive: The official Twitter account for The Colbert Report posted this yesterday . The tweet was posted by The Colbert Report, an account run by Comedy Central to promote the comedian's show, on Thursday. It read: 'I am willing to show #Asian community I care by introducing the Ching-Chong Ding-Dong Foundation for Sensitivity to Orientals or Whatever.' Suey Park, a freelance writer and online activist, was quick to pick up on the post and, believing Mr Colbert himself to be behind the tweet, demanded the show be cancelled. She wrote: 'The Ching-Chong Ding-Dong Foundation for Sensitivity to Orientals has decide to call for #CancelColbert. Trend it.' Hundreds backed up Ms Park's request, accusing Colbert of being racist and oppressive. Video from Comedy Central's The Colbert Report . Defense: Stephen Colbert, pictured on his show with First Lady Michelle Obama, is not the person behind the account that posted the out of context quote . Apology: The account was forced to post an apology and a disclaimer to say the tweet had nothing to do with Stephen Colbert . However, Mr Colbert himself had nothing to do with the post, and later tweeted from his personal account: #CancelColbert - I agree! Just saw @ColbertReport tweet. I share your rage. Who is that, though? I'm @StephenAtHome' I share your rage: Stephen Colbert's official Twitter account distanced itself from the offending tweet . Shortly after #CancelColbert began trending, the tweet was deleted and the account posted a disclaimer which read: 'For the record @ColbertReport is not controlled by Stephen Colbert or his show.

"Chancellor George Osborne today backed the Archbishop of Canterbury in his bid to take on pay day loan firms like Wonga. The Most Rev Justin Welby vowed to help grow Britain's 500 financial co-operatives, who lend at nowhere near the astronomical 5,853 per cent rate offered by the controversial payday lender. The Archbishop said that it is his dream to 'compete' Wonga out of existence, and has even met its boss Errol Damelin to warn him. Battle: Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby has vowed to put Wonga out of business and even met with the payday lender's founder Errol Damelin (right) to tell him . 'I've met the head of Wonga and we had a very good conversation and I said to him quite bluntly ""we're not in the business of trying to legislate you out of existence, we're trying to compete you out of existence"",' he told Total Politics magazine. 'He's a businessman, he took that well.' Chancellor Mr Osborne signaled his support for the move, saying he was 'all in favour of credit unions and all sorts of other channels whereby families can get credit'. He told BBC News: 'What is absolutely crucial is ... whoever is lending the money is doing so responsibly, making sure the people can repay, and I want to see as many options for families as possible. 'I don’t want them to face just one or two options, I want families to be able to have their needs serviced by a whole range of different providers.' The Archbishop's intervention come after he launched a new credit union for clergy and church staff earlier this month at the General Synod in York. Mr Welby, who has served on the parliamentary Banking Standards Commission, has said he plans to expand the reach of credit unions as part of a long-term campaign to boost competition in the banking sector. There are also plans to encourage church members with relevant skills to volunteer at credit unions. Small, local lenders could also be invited to use church buildings and other community locations with the help of church members. Objections: Payday loan company Wonga charges 5,853 per cent annual interest rates on short term loans . Newcastle United sponsor Wonga was in the news last week after Muslim footballer Papiss Cisse refused to wear the club's shirt with its logo on it. The Senegalese striker, who is estimated to earn in the region of £40,000 a week, trained on his own on his return from his summer break after refusing to wear the branded training kit, as well as the match day shirt, because it is against his religious beliefs. The Government announced an investment of £38million in credit unions in April to help them offer an alternative option to payday lenders. Deadlock: Papiss Cisse has refused to wear Newcastle's new strip sponsored by loans company Wonga . The entire pay day lending industry, worth £2billion, was referred last month for a full-blown investigation by the Competition Commission after the trading watchdog uncovered 'deep-rooted' problems with the industry. The Office of Fair Trading (OFT) said it decided to make the referral because it continues to suspect that features of the market 'prevent, restrict or distort competition'. Wonga said in March that it welcomed any attempt to encourage responsible lending and that it has been 'instrumental' in helping to raise industry standards. Mr Damelin, founder of Wonga, said: 'The Archbishop is clearly an exceptional individual and someone who understands the power of innovation. 'We discussed the future of banking and financial services, as well as our emerging digital society. 'There is mutual respect, some differing opinions and a meeting of minds on many big issues. 'On the competition point, we always welcome fresh approaches that give people a fuller set of alternatives to solve their financial challenges. I'm all for better consumer choice.'","Justin Welby today vowed to help grow Britain's 500 financial co-operatives .

"As Ryan Lochte wins gold after gold at the London Olympics, finding his way into the hearts and minds of Americans, his family is wrapped in inner turmoil. MailOnline can reveal today that his younger brother, Devon, 22, a one-time strong aspiring swimmer, was busted for allegedly selling marijuana to a police informant earlier this year in Florida. Devon had once announced to the world that he hoped to compete alongside his brother on an Olympic relay team some day. But those dreams were dashed when Devon abandoned swimming a year ago, leaving his teammates and coaches wondering why someone with so much potential would leave the sport he was born into. And in another setback for the family, the brothers' father, Steve, 60, who served as their coach, was arrested for a DUI, it was revealed today. Family: Ryan Lochte's brother, Devon, was once a strong aspiring swimmer too, announcing to the world that he hoped to compete alongside his brother on an Olympic relay team. Ryan is pictured left and Devon right . Accused: The MailOnline can reveal that Devon was busted for allegedly selling marijuana to a police informant earlier this year, a felony in Florida . Gainesville police told the MailOnline that the incident was Devon's first run in with the law. He was living with his big brother Ryan at the time while attending the University of Florida. 'He . sold a confidential source two grams of cannabis for 40 bucks,' Officer . Ben Tobias, spokesman for the Gainesville Police Department told the . MailOnline. The confidential source, Officer Tobias said, could have been an undercover officer or a police informant. The sale allegedly occurred on January 10 of this year, but charges were not brought until February 14. The exchange was recorded with audio and video, the complaint against him read. Devon Lochte was accused of both marijuana possession and the intent to sell, a misdemeanor and a felony in Florida. Rather than go to trial, Devon agreed to perform 200 hours of community service, records show. He completed 75 hours by July 5 and had to get special permission from the court to watch his brother in the Olympics, documents reveal. But Devon isn't the only Lochte to have a run in with the law. Steve Lochte, the father that inspired his boys to swim, was arrested in 2010 for a DUI. Swim: Devon swam on his brother's team, the University of Florida's Gators, for two years as a champion freestyler . Ryan Lochte, left, is pictured alongside the men's relay team that took gold medals at the London 2012 Olympics . Officer Tobias said that an officer saw Mr Lochte swerving all over the road on April 11 in a white Toyota Landcruiser. The car had run up against the curb and several tires were blown, the report raid. 'An officer stopped him. Lochte was . stumbling,' Officer Tobias said. 'They conducted field sobriety . exercises and he was charged with a DUI on the scene.' 'We have a silent goal. We never really told anyone, but we want to be in the Olympics on . the same relay team.' Devon Lochte . An officer described Mr Lochte as having 'very watery bloodshot eyes and very mumbled and slurred speech,' in the official complaint, adding that he also had a 'strong odor of alcohol.' The officer then asked Mr Lochte how much he had to drink, to which Mr Lochte replied 'A couple,' according to the records. Mr Lochte consented to a breathalyzer at the scene and blew a .207 and a .217. 'That's over double the legal limit,' Officer Tobias said. In . Florida, .08 is the legal limit. A misdemeanor DUI would mean that Mr . Lochte was stripped of his license for one year, Officer Tobias said. With Ryan Lochte's family's . transgressions on full view, Officer Tobias added that the swimmer is a . true inspiration, despite his family's struggles. Together: Just about all of the Lochtes are swimmers. Parents Ileana 'Ike', center, and Steve Lochte, center left, are both swim coaches and sisters Kristin, far left, and Megan, far right, swam in college. Brandon, blurred, the youngest of the family, prefers basketball. Ryan is pictured on the right of Brandon and Devon on the left . Brothers: Devon was a freestyler, swimming both the 100 and 200 meter races - just like his older brother . Roommates: Ryan and Devon are roommates in this Gainesville home . 'I've had the chance to meet him on a couple of occasions,' Officer Tobias said. 'He is genuinely a nice guy.' He also said that Ryan has a perfect police record: a blank one. 'Ryan has no incidents, no arrests... He's been the victim of a couple of crimes,' Officer Tobias said. 'Just minor stuff, like thefts.' In an interview with ESPN, Devon Lochte told of his aspirations to follow in his brother's footsteps. 'We have a silent goal,' Devon said . in 2009. 'We never really told anyone, but we want to be in the Olympics . on the same relay team. That would be the best.' Ryan Lochte, now 27, believed in his brother's dreams. 'I think he's going to be better than me,' Ryan said in 2009. 'I've seen it.' 'I could see him definitely going to the Olympics and being on the same relay. That would mean the world to me.' Just about all of the Lochtes are swimmers. Parents Ileana 'Ike' and Steve Lochte are both swim coaches and sisters Kristin and Megan swam in college. Brandon, the youngest of the family, prefers basketball. Gold: U.S. swimmer Ryan Lochte poses on the podium with the gold medal after winning the men's 400m individual medley swimming event . Determination: Ryan Lochte competes in the men's 200m Backstroke heat during the London 2012 Olympic Games . All have cheered on Ryan's amazing successes, though they weren't always obvious. As a young boy, Ryan didn't take swimming seriously, goofing off in the pool during his father's lessons. He started to focus on his swimming at Spruce Creek High School. He went on to have a storied, All-American career. He holds the world record in the 4x200 meter freestyle relay and the world record in the 200-meter individual medley and the 400-meter individual medley. He has been named the World Swimmer of the Year once and both the American Swimmer of the Year and the FINA Swimmer of the Year award twice. With 59 medals from international competition, 39 gold, elven silver, and nine bronze, he beat out Michael Phelps this week for the gold in the 400 IM and is often referred to as 'the best swimmer in the world.' Dad: Devon isn't the only Lochte to have a run in with the law. Steve Lochte, left, also has an arrest history . Home: An officer saw Mr Lochte swerving all over the road on April 11 in a white Toyota Landcruiser . Father: Steve Lochte, the father that inspired . his boys to swim, was arrested in 2010 for a DUI, left, and for another . incident in 2006, right . He made headlines when it was . reported that he wanted to wear a custom tooth grill, bedazzled with . diamonds, to collect his first medal in London. The younger Lochte, who lives with Ryan, had hoped to make it to London in 2012 and in a way he did - on the sidelines. Martin Wylby, a University of Florida assistant coach, helped train both Ryan and Devon on the team. He coached Ryan for all four years of his college career and Devon for just two. 'He could have been a decent college swimmer,' Mr Wylby said to the MailOnline. 'He'd only scratched the surface, so you never know where the potential was going to take him.' Mr . Wylby said that despite how close the team was, Devon retired a year . ago, saying that he wanted to 'concentrate on his schoolwork.' Noting that Mr and Mrs Lochte are both swim coaches, Mr Wylby said that Devon could have been destined for Olympic greatness. 'It's hard enough to make it, but for . two siblings, it would have been very hard,' Mr Wylby said. 'It wasn't . out of the realms of possibility.' Devon was a freestyler, swimming both the 100 and 200 meter races - just like his older brother, Mr Wylby said. 'At some point, something's got to give,' he said, adding that he had not heard about Devon's arrest.","Younger brother, Devon Lochte, has been arrested for selling marijuana .

"A four-year-old girl is turning into a ‘human mannequin’ after being diagnosed with rare disorder that stiffens her joints. Tillie Mae Mawdsley is one of just a handful of youngsters in the world suffering from the rare degenerative disorder Sanfilippo. It is caused by a missing enzyme, creating a build up of sugar around the muscles, stiffening the joints. Tillie Mae Mawdsley has the rare  degenerative disorder Sanfilippo syndrome. Caused by a build-up . of sugar around the muscles, the the condition causes severe muscle stiffness that could leave her totally immobile . Within months, the condition will leave her totally immobile unless someone else moves her arms and legs into position. The condition has now rendered her unable to talk. Tillie is expected to die from the cruel illness before she is 14 unless she gets access to a new miracle drug - currently not available through the NHS. Her parents Michala, 32, and Paul, 36, say medication called Genistein could halt the youngster’s deterioration - but they have no way of getting it in Britain. Incredibly, the couple are bidding to pay for the £580,000 Department of Health clinical drug trials which could make it available to Tillie Mae themselves. Mrs Mawdsley, a part-time customer services assistant, has vowed to do everything to help stop her daughter’s deterioration. She said: 'It is almost worse that Tillie did speak as now I feel like I am losing more of her every day. She is very bright and gets frustrated when she cannot articulate how she feels or what she wants. 'Some days you totally give up and then others she seems to be better. The doctors said she will not know she is ill, which is a comfort. Diagnosed aged 2 (left), Tillie is expected to die by the age of 14 unless she gets a drug unavailable on the NHS . 'She has started to become stiff, her left foot bends in and she cannot lift her arms above her head. 'We try to stretch Tillie’s limbs, but we cannot push her as she does not have a proper understanding of pain and does not cry when she is in pain. 'She will become like a mannequin - so stiff she can only move with our help. The thought of Tillie not being around is unbearable. We just cannot think about it right now. We just have fun everyday and try to be happy.We are so desperate to get this money. The drug would mean the world to us. 'I do not care what happens as long as we have Tillie here with us.' Tillie, who lives with her mother, construction site manager father Paul and her older sister Lexie, six, in Hatfield, Hertfordshire, was diagnosed with Sanfilippo syndrome when she was two. Mrs Mawdsley added: 'People always said Tillie looked different to Lexi, but we just said Tillie looks like daddy and Lexi looks like mummy. Now we know Tillie has the coarse facial features of Sanfilippo.' The little girl had spent 10 months of the year on antibiotics for a cold before she was transferred to a specialist who spotted the syndrome. Tillie's mother Michala (left) has to move the little girl's arms and legs into position. The condition has also robbed the little girl of her ability to speak . She is now entering the second stage of the condition, which includes loss of speech, mobility and balance as the build up of chemicals attacks the brain and makes the muscles stiff. Children with the condition also cry for no reason and get frustrated and can go on to develop Autism. In the final stage of the fatal condition children have to be tube fed and are prone to colds and infections, which often kill them. The drug Genistien, which is found in soy foods, is non-toxic, can be taken by mouth and is relatively cheap, could delay the progression of the disease. Developed at Manchester Children’s Hospital, it has already been used to good effect in the U.S. But because the condition only effects a handfull of children in Britain each year funding for clinical trials to appraise the drugs viability for NHS use has not been provided. A group of families are now trying to raise £580,000 to fund the clinical trial at Manchester Children’s Hospital with the help of new charity Wicked Genes. The Society for Mucopolysaccharide Diseases has already raised £200,000 for the trial and funded early studies to test the drug on mice. Tillie's parents say medication called Genistein could halt the youngster¿s deterioration - but they have no way of getting it in Britain . The proposed trial at the University . of Manchester will determine the correct and safe dose to be prescribed . to children with the condition. Christine . Lavery, chief executive of the society for mucopolysaccharide diseases, . said the research would only take around four weeks once the funding is . in place. She said: “There . is not much money from government to fund research and the Medical . Research Council and Welcome Trust did not want to fund the Genistein . trial. 'It is down to private trusts or people who have an interest to fund it. These children are rare and we need rare money. We have to do the research now or a whole generation of children will miss out.' A . Department of Health spokesperson said: 'Government funding is . available for research into rare diseases including clinical trials. Researchers are encouraged to apply for funding through the National Institute for Health Research.'Applications are judged in open competition and awards are made on the basis of the scientific quality of the proposal.'To donate to Tillie go to www.shareagift.com/giftpagefortillie1 or wickedgenes.co.uk . Sanfilippo syndrome is metabolism disorder passed down through families. It is caused by a missing enzyme, creating a build up of sugar around the muscles stiffening the joints. Symptoms appear after the first year of life and may include a decline in learning ability between ages of two and six. Normal growth may be followed by a child being a below average height.  Other symptoms include:Stiff joints that may not extend fully; walking problems; behavioral problems; coarse facial features; diarrhoea; full lips; sleep difficulties; heavy eyebrows that meet in the middle of the face above the nose.Most children with Sanfilippo syndrome live into their teenage years. Once the condition progresses, children suffer loss of speech, mobility and balance as the build up of chemicals attacks the brain and makes the muscles stiff.

"Mischief: Diana liked to venture out in disguise . As one of the most famous women in the world, she had to go to extraordinary lengths to avoid being recognised. Princess Diana dressed up as a 'male model' so she could enjoy an anonymous night out at a gay bar with Queen singer Freddie Mercury, television entertainer Kenny Everett and his co-star Cleo Rocos, it has been claimed. The Princess of Wales was a fan of the Kenny Everett Television Show and struck up a friendship with him and Miss Rocos. It was during one of their many get-togethers that a drink at the Royal Vauxhall Tavern in London was suggested. Making the claims in her new book,  Miss Rocos sets the scene by describing how Mercury had also come round to  Everett's flat and the four of them were larking around on Everett's sofa watching The Golden Girls. Miss Rocos wrote: 'I don't think anything could be more camp than Diana, Kenny, Freddie and me sitting on Kenny's sofa, all watching The Golden Girls. 'Kenny turned the sound down on the television and we improvised the voices, but with a much naughtier storyline. 'Kenny was Blanche, Diana was Dorothy, Freddie was Sophia and I was Rose – we were uncontrollable with laughter. Diana, who was 27 at the time, was giggling from behind a cushion and asked what our plans were for that evening. Night out: Kenny Everett and Freddie Mercury took Princess Diana to a gay bar, it has been claimed . 'Freddie told her we were going to the Vauxhall Tavern. Diana said she had never heard of it and she'd like to come.' Attempts . were made to dissuade Diana but Miss Rocos said she was in 'mischief . mode' and intent on having her way, adding: 'She turned to Mercury who . declared: 'Go on, let the girl have some fun. Can you imagine?''. Partial to a bellini: Miss Rocos discloses how Princess Diana liked the cocktail made with champagne and peach juice or puree . Miss Rocos went on: 'She [Diana] wanted . the thrill of going in undetected to order one drink and would leave . right away, she promised. 'She tried on the outfit Kenny had . intended to wear: a camouflage army jacket, hair tucked up into a . leather cap and dark aviator sunglasses. 'Scrutinising her in the half light, we decided that the most famous icon  of the modern world might just – just – pass for a rather eccentrically dressed gay male model.' The foursome arrived at the bar and Princess Diana ordered a white wine and a beer. With their mission accomplished, the group then made a swift exit and dropped Diana off at Kensington Palace. The claims appear in Miss Rocos's new book, The Power of Positive Drinking. Diana's love of wearing a disguise to venture out in public unnoticed is well documented but this is the first time that her decision to dress up as a man for the 1988 bar visit has been revealed in such detail. Miss Rocos, 50, also discloses how Diana was partial to a bellini – a cocktail made with champagne and peach juice or puree. She said: 'There was always great excitement and anticipation after receiving an invitation for lunch with Princess Diana. 'She was a big fan of the Kenny Everett Television Show and we got to know each other over the years. 'She had a wicked sense of humour. We would meet and the three of us would swap all the fabulous gossip and goings-on. 'She would often refer to someone by their star sign, saying, “Oh, that randy old Taurean” or “typical Sagittarian, always dancing on the table with a bottle of vodka down his trousers”.' Plan: Freddie Mercury and Kenny Everett  were behind the ruse according to the new book of Cleo Rocos . Nightspot: The Royal Vauxhall Tavern in south London is one of the capital's most notorious gay bars . Among her other anecdotes, the actress . recounts the time she and comedian Alan Carr raided a brothel in Soho to . rescue the women working there, but were rebuffed. 'To our total shock none of them . wanted to leave. Apparently they were all very happy working there and . being well treated,' she said. Miss Rocos also describes another occasion when she and Everett were invited to a reception at No 10. They . were waiting for a waitress to top up their glasses when Everett . spotted one and tried to attract her attention. Miss Rocos recalled: . 'Waitress, waitress, he cried, before tugging at her arm. It was . Margaret Thatcher. 'He did apologise profusely. However, the lady was not for turning again and she didn't go and get us a drink.' Revealing: Cleo Rocos, who co-starred on the Kenny Everett Show, has told all about her life in a new book .

"At last night’s Democratic National Convention, there were many moments of cheering, chanting, and caterwauling. But one speech – made by former Michigan governor Jennifer Granholm – seemed wholly bizarre, and was full of fist pumps, extreme facial expressions, and screaming. In her fiery address, Mrs Granholm attacked Mitt Romney’s handling of the auto industry crisis while praising President Obama’s bailout, all while wildly gesturing. Scroll down for video of Jennifer Granholm's speech . Emotive: Former Governor of Michigan Jennifer Granholm did not hold back during her address last night . Rousing speech: Former Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm addressed the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte last night to an uproarious response from delegates . On the attack: In her speech, the charismatic Current TV host questioned Romney's response to the auto industry crisis . Yes we can: Gesturing heavily, she also praised Obama's rescue plan for American motors . Running the gamut: Her speech was filled with fist-pumping and clapping . Wearing a crisp electric blue blazer and white shirt, Mrs Granholm took the stage with visible energy, and began by telling the recent history of the auto industry in her state. She spoke of the hundreds of devastated workers who were hit hard by Ford’s decision to close one of its largest plants in Wixom, Michigan, and how many workers came up to her asking why this happened, as they were all hard-working and loyal to the company. The two-term governor said: ‘The entire auto industry, and the lives of over one million hard-working Americans, teetered on the edge of collapse; and with it, the whole manufacturing sector of this country. We looked everywhere for help. ‘Almost nobody had the guts to help us – not the banks, not the private investors and not Bain capital,’ she said, referring to Mr Romney’s op-ed appearing in the New York Times entitled ‘Let Detroit Go Bankrupt.’ The audience applauded, and the former governor continued, raising her voice and throwing her hands in the air, saying: ‘But, in 2009, the cavalry arrived: our new president, Barack Obama…he made the tough calls and he saved the American auto industry!’ The delegates in Charlotte, North . Carolina began cheering uproariously, and maintained their energy . throughout Mrs Granholm’s six-and-a-half minute speech. Standing O: At many points in her six-and-a-half minute speech, she brought the delegates to their feet . High flying adored: With a vast array of gesturing, the Canadian-born American politician and TV host brought delegates in Charlotte to their feet cheering and clapping . Broadcast: She was projected out on the DNC monitors so every delegate could see her speech . But it wasn’t just Mr Romney’s stance on the auto industry she attacked. Mrs Granholm went on to question the Republican presidential candidate’s wealth. ‘How did he make that fortune?’ she asked, ‘and at whose expense? 'America, let's rev our engines! In your . car and on your ballot, the ""D"" is for drive forward, and the ""R"" is . for reverse – and in this election, we're driving forward, not back!' ‘You know, too often he made it at the expense of middle-class Americans. Year after year it was profits before people.’ Mr . Obama, she said, saved more than one million American jobs with his . bailout for the auto industry. But the most intense moment in her speech . came when she again attacked Mr Romney, saying: . ‘Sure, Mitt Romney loves our lakes and trees. 'He loves our cars so much, they have their own elevator. But the people who design, build, and sell those cars? Well, in Romney's world, the cars get the elevator; the workers get the shaft!’ At this point in the speech, she had to pause because she was drowned out by chants and cheers of ‘USA, USA.’ Nominated: President Barack Obama, right, and First lady Michelle Obama walk across the stage with their daughter Sasha, left, after President Obama's speech . She concluded with several gestures: ‘America, let’s rev our engines! In your car and on your ballot, the “D” is for drive forward, and the “R” is for reverse – and in this election, we’re driving forward, not back! Let’s re-elect our great president, Barack Obama!’ Politico’s Dylan Byers said it was ‘by far the most energetic and well-received of any (speech) so far this evening while CNN wrote: ‘Her performance may be best summed up by a tweet: I’LL HAVE WHAT SHE’S HAVING!!!!’ Talking Points Memo critiqued: ‘Granholm’s wild gestures and energy level – which hovered between fired up and thermonuclear… - left the crowd delirious.’ However, not everyone was as wowed by the speech. Drudge Report, linking to a YouTube video of her speech, called it a ‘podium meltdown.’ The Canadian-born American politician serves as host for a prime time show on Current TV, the network created by former vice president and presidential candidate Al Gore, and is a columnist for Politico.","Two-term Michigan governor delivered energetic speech to DNC .

"In memory: A statue of Katharina Henot (figure on the right) has been placed in Cologne following her execution . A woman who was burned at the stake for sorcery more than 300 years is the subject of an extraordinary retrial which is seeking to clear her name. Katharina Henot was tried, convicted and burned at the stake in the German city of Cologne in 1627 for being a witch - one of an estimated 25,000 alleged sorcerers incinerated for practicing the dark arts in Germany in days gone by. However, her supporters are hoping to see her name cleared of any wrongdoing in a trial which could pave the way for other similar hearings to take place. Mrs Henot ran the local post office . and attended parties in the city.  Her modern-day defenders say she was . tortured and burned because a political rival wanted to get his hands on . her money. Her story is well-known in Germany - there is a statue of her in the town hall in Cologne and a book was written about her. Now Cologne council - the same body which found her guilty - is reopening her case. Hartmut . Hegeler, an evangelical priest and religious education teacher who made . the request for the trial to be reheard, said: 'Katharina held her own . reputation in high esteem, she would want to have it cleared. 'As Christians, we find it challenging when innocent people are executed, even If it was centuries ago.' Hegeler tracked down some of her living relatives, some of whom will attend the hearings. Evidence from the time will be re-examined and a panel of local politicians, clergy and lay people will decide on her guilt or innocence. One of her relatives, Martina Hirtz, . said: 'I do think she should have her name cleared. But I think of the . endless amount of people still living who are being mistreated and find . that much worse.' If the . case is successful it could lead to similar hearings across Germany, the . European country which burned more witches than any other. Following . the Würzburg Witch Trials, which lasted from 1626 to  1631, 157 men, . women and children in the city were burned alive at the stake and more . than 900 burnt altogether over the entire area. They were judged for sorcery and . witchcraft and for having made a pact with the Devil, and were a part of . the witch hysteria that precipitated a series of witch trials in South . Germany at that time, such as at Bamberg where over 300 executions took . place, Eichstätt, Mainz and Ellwangen. Witch hunt: Men, women and children were burned alive at the stake for using sorcery during the witch trials of the 1600s . Retrial: Cologne (pictured) - the same city where Katharina Henot was executed - is the scene of a retrial into her sorcery crimes . The Catholic Church was the driving force behind the persecution which was enthusiastically stoked up by nobles across the land.Julius Echter von Mespelbrunn, Prince Bishop of Würzburg, and his nephew Philipp Adolf von Ehrenberg, were responsible for burning 900 people, including 19 Catholic priests and children of seven who were said to have had intercourse with demons. People from all walks of life were arrested and charged, regardless of age, profession or sex, for reasons ranging from murder and Satanism to 'humming a song with the Devil,' or simply for being vagrants and unable to give a satisfactory explanation of why they were passing through town. Witch trials: The town of Würzburg . Katharina Henot was said to have been . an influential citizen of Cologne. She and her brother Harger Henot . inherited a post office from their father and were thought to have been . embroiled in a dispute at the Imperial Court about the creation of a . central post office. She was accused of sorcery amid a great witch trial in Cologne between 1626 and 1631. Both . she and her brother were arrested by the commission of the archbishop . in January 1627 and were accused of using magic to cause several cases . of death and sickness. She was imprisoned but - despite suffering terrible sickness and injuries from torture - never admitted to anything. In spite of this, she was found guilty of witchcraft and sentenced to be burned at the stake for sorcery. Her brother tried many times to get . her freed, but he was unsuccessful and he also tried to get her name . cleared after her execution. It was not until after her death that research revealed she could have been the victim of a conspiracy. In 1629, Harger was himself accused . of witchcraft and was arrested in 1631, along with a number of other . influential Cologne citizens. However, his witch trial was interrupted soon after by intervention. Katharina Henot's memory is commemorated in Cologne in the form of a statue.","Katharina Henot was executed for sorcery in Cologne 385 years ago .

"A Fox & Friends host today offered a message following a sickening video of ex-Baltimore Ravens player Ray Rice punching his fiancée in an elevator: 'Take the stairs.' The throwaway comment was made on Monday by host Brian Kilmeade following a brief discussion about the tape where the NFL running back was caught on surveillance camera knocking his partner unconscious. Kilmeade quipped: 'I think the message is take the stairs.' Scroll down for video . Playing for laughs: The throwaway comment was made on Monday afternoon by host Brian Kilmead . The remark led to giggles from his co-hosts Steve Doocy and Anna Kooiman before Doocy added: 'The message is when you’re in an elevator, there’s a camera' before smoothly segueing into a new report. The presenter's remarks led to outrage online. News and politics editor at Global Grind, Christina Coleman, tweeted today: 'Why am I not surprised? This is how Fox News handled #RayRice video.' Dan Murphy posted: 'If there's a more ghastly assemblage of callous mouthbreathers than Fox and Friends on TV I don't want to know.' Al Jazeera anchor Richelle Carey simply dubbed Kilmeade's remark as 'moronic'. The Baltimore Ravens terminated Rice's $40 million contract on Monday in the wake of the release of the  tape showing Rice punch his then fiancée Janay Palmer unconscious in an Atlantic City elevator in February. Minutes later, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell suspended Rice from the league indefinitely and said he would have to apply for reinstatement. 'I think the message is take the stairs': Journalist and stand-up comedian Brian Kilmeade made the remark on Monday's edition of Fox & Friends about ex-Baltimore Ravens player Ray Rice's brutal attack on his fiancée in an elevator . The announcements follow hours of intense pressure on the Ravens and the NFL to give Rice a more appropriate punishment for brutally beating his now wife. NFL officials had sparked shock and outrage in July when they handed him just a two-game suspension and a $500,000 fine. On Monday, TMZ released previously unseen footage filmed by a security camera inside an elevator at the Revel Hotel and Casino, the video showed the couple – who married a month later – engaged in a heated exchange as they enter the lift. Once inside Rice can clearly be seen to slap his girlfriend, before she hits him and the 5-foot, 8-inch, 220-pound athlete then punches her with such force that he knocks her off her feet. Janay then smashes her head on the elevator hand rail and falls unconscious to the floor. A Fox spokesperson told MailOnline today that Mr Kilmeade's remarks will be addressed on the show on Tuesday. In addition to his successful career in journalism at Fox, Kilmeade has been a stand-up comedian for ten years, according to his online bio. Ex Ravens player Ray Rice drew further criticism during a press conference with his wife in May, where she apologized, but he didn't say sorry to her for punching her in the face .","Brian Kilmeade had his co-hosts laughing following his throwaway remark about the shocking Ray Rice domestic violence tape .

"He has all the riches he could ever dream for in this life. But to avoid any risk of missing out in the afterlife, wealthy entrepreneur 'Count Scarpa' is burying his greatest treasure - his new £310,000 Bentley convertible. In a bizarre announcement on his Facebook page the 62-year-old declared that he plans to do as the Pharaohs of Egypt did and take his riches with him when he dies by burying them. So tomorrow, he will entomb his brand new Bentley Continental worth over £310,000 to make sure he has a comfortable journey into the ‘other side’. The funeral ceremony, he promises, will be at 11am. His Bentley is his prized possession, so he's burying it, inspired by the Egyptian Pharaohs, in the hope of having it in his afterlife . In a photo on his social network site Count Scarpa stands beside his black Flying Spur, the latest model on the market, with a cockatoo on his arm and writes: 'I decided to do as the Pharaohs: this week I will bury my favourite car, the Bentley here in the home garden! Bury my treasure in my palace rssss !!!' He says he’s digging the grave in the back garden of his mansion in Jardins, one of the wealthiest neighbourhoods in Sao Paulo. On Tuesday, in another photo, sporting a pink tie, with his foot on a shovel, he stands in front of a deep hole with his shining Bentley parked behind him and warns: 'For those who doubt me, yesterday I already started making the hole in the garden to bury my Bentley! By the end of the week I will bury it' The self-made businessman, who has a degree in economics and is a black belt instructor and owner of the Institute Maruyama Aikido, a Japanese martial arts academy, explains that his decision to start storing up his treasures for the life beyond came after watching a programme on Ancient Egypt on Sunday. 'I was watching a documentary about the pharaohs of Egypt, very interesting. They buried his entire fortune to have a comfortable life ""the other side""!' he says. Will he bury his parrot? After watching a documentary on Egypt on Sunday, he says he is completely serious and is going ahead with his car's funeral tomorrow. There was no mention of whether he wants his pet bird in the afterlife too . By Tuesday his decision to bury his Bentley had received over 5680 likes and more than 6000 shares. On Wednesday, a new photo appeared updating his plans and shows just how serious he is. He’s pictured operating an excavator, in a cream coloured suit and lime green tie. It looks like he’s spent quite a few hours digging the grave. In front of him is very deep hole with a huge pile of dirt beside it. On the same day he reveals that he’s appearing on a satirical talk show on Bandeirantes television,  hosted by Danilo Gentili  – photographed with him, to talk about the funeral of his beloved Bentley. In the TV interview he explains to viewers that he was travelling back from his farm after celebrating his birthday on Sunday and started thinking about how the pharaohs were buried with the most precious items in their life. “I watched the film of the pharaohs and after seeing how they were buried with their treasures I decided that I wanted to copy them and bury my most precious item, which is my car,” he says. In between his explanation, viewers tweet their comments. One says wryly: 'Chiquinho, is it true you want to bury your imported car because you don’t want to pay your taxes?' 'No,' he answers straight-faced. 'I’ve already shown all my documents to the authorities before doing the funeral.' Another asks if he wants to adopt a family from Brasilia. He says he’s currently single and doesn’t want a family.  A lot of the comments are however, very critical and accuse him of wasting money. Instead of burying his car he should donate the proceeds to help Brazilian people.  ‘Maria Lucia’ sends a message begging Scarpa to send the car to her as she needs the cash. Scarpa has had a brush with death a few times, having been in a coma with a superbug, so he's hyper-alert to preparing for what comes after life . Others are sarcastic: 'This is nothing new. Chiquinho may be burying his car but the Brazilian government has buried the Brazilian people,' says one referring to corruption and the wealth of the nation being 'buried' in the pockets of bent politicians. Scarpa says he is not one of these corrupt individuals and has paid all his taxes, never been in debt or been bankrupt. ‘Alex’ on the other hand agrees with the crazy decision and tweets: 'I think you should do what you want to do, because it shows that you cannot take anything with you from this life and you might as well enjoy the idea of doing so. However, if you would like to help me with the social project I’m running, I would be very grateful.' Scarpa is not new to the idea of facing death. In 2009 he was in a coma for over two months  after a superbug nearly killed him following a stomach reduction operation. He ‘died’ twice during the ordeal and was given the last rites on both occasions by a priest. In an interview with celebrity magazine, Caras, in January this year he said: 'When I had the surgery, I got a very strong bacteria that killed several people. Count Scarpa says he was inspired to bury his most treasured possession after watching a documentary on Sunday about the Egyptian Pharaohs . The treasures buried with King Tutankhamun, pictured left in the Valley of Kings, and right, his exhibited gold mask, were believed to travel with the dead to their next life . 'I was in a coma for 63 days; the doctor told me he had 'opened' me eight times. I came close to death twice. The priest gave me two anointings. This was all because of bacteria. I took it and got away with it. Unfortunately this was not the case with my mother. She had an operation on her femur, got the bacterium and died in February 2012. I am strong,' he adds. Scarpa lives in one of the most expensive areas in Sao Paulo in a property spanning more than 14000m2. He inherited his title from his Italian-born father Count Francisco Scarpa who was given the honour by Pope Pius XII in 1949, for his charitable contributions to society. The eccentric businessman benefitted from his father’s wealth and made his fortune from the brewery and mining industry. He now runs an investment company and has been married twice. His first wife died and he is divorced from the second. He has even met Chelsea Football Club owner, Russian businessman, Roman Abramovich who invited him to visit his yacht in Capri, Italy, for dinner two years ago. With no children to carry on the family name Scarpa says his cockatoo, which is perched on his arm in the facebook picture showing him standing beside his Bentley, is his offspring. 'This here is my ""daughter"",' he said in the interview with Caras.  'She is called Filomena Leopoldina Sofia Scarpa. She is six-months-old and is endangered,' he said. The white cockatoo – which even has her own business card - is one of the most expensive birds in the world costing around £14,000. The Pharaohs were known for burying their beloved pets with them so they could enjoy their company in the afterlife. So far Scarpa hasn’t said whether he plans to do the same with Filomena.","'Count Scarpa' loves his new convertible Bentley so much he's burying it .

"Ronda Rousey is probably the most successful sportswoman you've never heard of. You won’t find her name on Forbes’ list of highest-paid athletes, nor will you read about her in the sports pages of any newspaper. But take a look at the facts. Ronda Rousey (left) and Cat Zingano face off before their fight at UFC184 in Los Angeles on Saturday . Rousey looks ready for business as she steps on to the scales, she weighed in on the bantamweight limit . Rousey and Zingano face off at a media event in the days leading up to their fight at UFC 184 . Rousey is the UFC's only female champion and has held the bantamweight title since 2013 . Rousey talks to the media during fight week ahead of her title defence against Zingano . Since 2011, Rousey has won each of her 10 mixed martial arts fights, all but one of them in the first round. At No 7, and as the bantamweight champion, she is the only woman in the UFC’s pound-for-pound top 15 list. She also won judo bronze at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing. Away from the Octagon, Rousey starred in The Expendables 3 and has parts in Furious 7 and Entourage later this year. She was also one of just two athletes in this year's Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue, alongside Caroline Wozniacki, and her autobiography will be out in May. Naturally, her busy schedule leads to questions about whether she has too much on her plate. ‘You know, when I try and set out to do things that people say are impossible first they ask me why I do it,’ Rousey says. ‘Then after I accomplish it they ask me how I did it. And the reason why you doubt the ability that it could ever be done is the reason why you will never do anything that great.’ And when asked how this year will compare to the previous 12 months, Rousey said: 'Well this is kind of a colourful way to say it but if 2014 was my bitch than 2015 is going to look like my bitch’s bitch.'

On Saturday night, Rousey will headline UFC184 when she takes on the unbeaten Cat Zingano in Los Angeles. For the first time in the promotion’s history, the co-main event is also an all-female affair, featuring Raquel Pennington against Holly Holm. ‘I just walk out and I solve the fight as it happens,’ Rousey adds. ‘So I know that Cat brings so many weapons to the table that I will be ready to deal with every single one of them. ‘And that's what makes it such an exciting fight; there isn't one clear quick cut way to go to finish it. ‘And so I really think that's what makes it exciting, you don't know where it's going to go but I can finish her anywhere and I will find a way. ‘I think that Cat's resilience is one of the things that has really impressed me about her the most. And I think that's what's really gotten her most of her fans. It’s not just the way that she fights but the way that she endures. And it's extremely impressive and one of those things that I will definitely keep in mind for the fight. ‘She's not one of those people that can be intimidated so I won't even bother. She's not one of those people that can start losing a fight and you can count on them being a front runner and just beating themselves. She's one of those people that has to be finished all the way until the very, very end and I'm ready for that.

Rousey will also make an appearance as herself in the forthcoming Entourage movie this summer . ‘I'm ready for a five-round war if it needs to be that way. I'm still going to be the better fighter that night regardless of what happens.’ Zingano had been due to face Rousey in 2013 but suffered a knee injury which ruled her out for 18 months, returning last September with a third-round win against Amanda Nunes. And she insists has no fear ahead of her title challenge. ‘Well I'm different. I know she knows that, I know the whole promotion knows that,’ she says. ‘I have things to offer that people haven't seen before and it's just I just have to be me, I have do me, go out there with my intensity and my aggression and I'm unstoppable, I know that. ‘You know I'm going out there and I'm at the top, there's nowhere higher to go and I'm just pumped to be here. And being the underdog, man I like that, I do. ‘I think that it gives me a lot that I want to prove and a lot I want to show and it forces me to be authentic and to pull out my best stuff.

"A family has vowed to buy only British-made goods - but say they are already struggling to find enough non-foreign products. When James and Emily Bradshaw set out to avoid anything that was not produced by a British firm, they had no idea how difficult the challenge would prove. Initially motivated by a desire to boycott international companies who avoid paying tax in the UK, the couple soon decided to avoid anything that was flown into the UK. Challenge: James and Emily Bradshaw, with their two-year-old son Lucan, vowed to buy only goods made in Britain but had not realised how difficult the challenge would be . Yet their conviction has been tested to the extreme. The family have only recently moved house, and are struggling to find British furnishings and electrical equipment. The family, from Westerham, Kent, has also been amazed to discover that some of the brands they once thought of as British institutions are actually owned by foreign companies. The couple had no idea that Cadbury's is now owned by American company Kraft. Despite the challenges, the couple, as well as their two-year-old son Lucan, are still eating nothing but British food. Mr Bradshaw admitted that the family had struggled most with fully adopting the British-only 'mindset'. He said: 'We've realised there are things we just won't get because they're not in season here - like strawberries. 'It's about coming up with other solutions and trying new things, which is a really exciting part of the challenge we have set ourselves.' Hurdles: The challenge, beginning on January 1, has led to difficulties such as the unavailability of British-made batteries. They soon plan to grow their own vegetables . Mrs Bradshaw, a teacher, initially thought up the idea before her husband decided to implement the rule to all materials - from batteries to dishwasher powder. Describing the decision, which the family implemented on New year's Day, Mr Bradshaw said: 'Emily suggested avoiding some companies because of tax issues, but I wondered if it was possible to live a normal family life on only British goods.' The City worker said the family is now testing whether 'it is a viable way of living'. He added: 'Lucan is too young to appreciate fully what's going on, but he's happy and we've managed to source him warm winter clothes from Wales.' The family moved to Westerham from nearby Bromley in November and although their dining room remains half-finished due to the cost of British wallpaper, the inspired couple have been sourcing items. Moving home: City worker James and teacher Emily have also struggled as they have moved home after starting the challenge, forcing them to look for domestic furnishings and equipment . Mr Bradshaw said: 'A month ago we would have agreed that this would cost a lot of money. 'We are finding that this country produces affordable clothing, electronics and foods. But it can take a week to find a British made dishwasher tablet because of the research we have to put in to each item.' More than 40 days in, the Bradshaws are starting to fear the worst about items they cannot find in the UK, such as pepper, and plan to grow their own vegetables. Mr Bradshaw said: 'AA batteries are just not produced in the UK, our television does't turn on without the control so we don't know what we're going to do about that one.' The only company to make batteries in the UK is Hertfordshire's Shield Batteries, but they only manufacture vintage car batteries - not much use for turning on the TV. Mr Bradshaw has one last problem: 'We also haven't been able to find black pepper, so we were told that during the last war people used nasturtium seeds - it was awful.'","Bradshaws initially wanted to avoid companies that do not pay tax in UK .

"At 10 months old, Jacob Davis gave his big sister the ultimate gift - life. The baby boy donated his bone marrow to help save the life of his dying sibling Seren-Rose. The two-year-old was born with an extremely rare life-limiting disease, mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS), which delayed her development and caused her to slowly deteriorate. Her parents Elouise and Simon Davis from Colchester in Essex were told the only hope to save their daughter was a bone marrow transplant. Ten-month-old Jacob Davis, left, donated his bone marrow to help save the life of his dying big sister Seren-Rose, right . Two-year-old Seren-Rose was diagnosed with mucopolysaccharidosis, which delayed her development and caused her to slowly deteriorate . It was then they discovered their son Jacob, now one, was the perfect match for his sister. And after a sucessful transplant, the 10-month-old is back at home with his older sibling having saved her young life. Mrs Davis, 26, said: 'I am so proud of Jacob and I cannot wait for the day when Seren will understand what he has done for her. 'Jacob was so small when we first considered the bone marrow transplant but we knew he would be just fine. 'I knew it was a risk but it was definitely one worth taking. Without the transplant there was only one path that Seren was going to go down. 'Now Seren has got a better future ahead of her, it is just amazing. 'Jacob was just eight months old when we were told he was a perfect match for Seren. 'We were assured the procedure for him was fairly straightforward, and the risk minimal. 'A sibling donor would give Seren the very best chance of a successful transplant. 'I am so proud of the two of them.' When Mrs Davis found out that a bone marrow transplant was the only option at saving her daughter, she knew she had to let Jacob save her. She said: 'Jacob was just six months at the time but he had been hitting all of his milestones. 'He was very healthy and we knew he would bounce right back. Seren's parents Elouise, pictured with her children, and Simon, were warned their daughter's only chance of surviving was a bone marrow transplant . Tests revealed Jacob, who was eight months old at the time, was a perfect match. Mrs Davis, said: 'People sometimes think he has been born to save his sister but that wasn't the case at all. He just had the chance to' 'I did a lot of research into the risks for Jacob because my main concern was his safety, but the risks for him were minimal. 'People sometimes think he has been born to save his sister but that wasn’t the case at all. He just had the chance to. 'Now he is going to grow up feeling very proud of himself and I am never going to let him forget it.' Seren-Rose was diagnosed with MPS in December 2013 - a condition which means her body fails to produce a certain enzyme, affecting the development of her whole body, including her vision and brain function. 'People sometimes think he has been born to save his sister but that wasn't the case at all, He just had the chance to' - Elouise Davis . But doctors explained that a bone marrow transplant could stop the disease in its tracks. Mrs Davis said: 'Me and my husband were tested to see if we could give our bone marrow but we weren’t matches so they tested Jacob who was six months at the time. 'Jacob was a perfect match for his sister. It was a complete shock - I saw it as an absolute miracle. 'I did a lot of research into the risks for Jacob. 'Jacob would be tender for a few days but he would then be completely back to normal. 'I wasn’t concerned at all. I knew it was better for Jacob to grow up with his sister than to simply be shown photos and told what she was like. 'Seren-Rose was only going to get worse without the transplant. 'After her diagnosis I carried out a lot of research on her condition and I knew she was only going one way. Mrs Davis, said she fully researched what donating his bone marrow would mean for her son. She said: 'I wasn't concerned at all. I knew it was better for Jacob to grow up with his sister than to simply be shown photos and told what she was like' Mucopolysaccharide and related Lysomal Storage Diseases affect one in every 25,000 live births. One baby born every eight days will be diagnosed with an MPS or related disease. These multi-organ storage diseases cause progressive physical disability and, in many cases, severe degenerative mental deterioration resulting in death in childhood. They are rare, life-limiting, genetic conditions caused by the shortage of a particular enzyme. It means the body cannot break down certain molecules that are integral to connective tissues including cartilage and tendons. The condition causes progressive physical disability and in many cases, severe neurological deterioration and can result in death in childhood. Babies may show no sign of the disease but as more and more cells become damaged, symptoms begin to appear. Over time the diseases tend to affect many of the major organs, including the heart, liver, kidneys as well as the bones, eyes and skin. MPS and related diseases are inherited conditions. If both parents are carriers, a baby has a one in four chance of having MPS. Although there is no cure stem cell transplants and enzyme replacement therapy can help treat specific types of MPS. Source: The MPS Society . 'She would be okay until she was about three, but then she would stop learning and developing and just go backwards. 'She would just get progressively worse from three years old until she died. 'The transplant could not repair the damage the disease has already done to her body, but it can stop it from making her worse. 'We were told about all the risks for Seren with having a bone marrow transplant but we knew there was no debating it. 'There was an 85 per cent chance of success, five per cent chance of rejection and a 10 per cent chance of fatality. 'They weren’t the best odds but were a risk worth taking.' On May 9, the entire family travelled to Great Ormand Street for the transplant. The 26-year-old said: 'I never believed it was going to happen until the day. 'Jacob came in to the hospital in the morning and he was out from the procedure in no time. 'When he came out of theatre I was amazed to see him playing, it went so smoothly. 'We had to wait for a few hours after Jacob’s cells were taken, but when they gave his cells to Seren, we had Jacob in the room with us. She said: 'It was great that Jacob was back on his feet straight away, and Seren did amazingly well throughout the process. 'She did nearly end up in intensive . care when she had excess fluid on her lungs and struggled to breathe, . but the doctors were fantastic and managed to get her back on track. Jacob and Seren were admitted to Great Ormond Street Hospital where doctors carried out the transplant . 'She was amazing, she was in high spirits throughout the whole transplant.' Seren went from strength to strength as her body accepted Jacob’s cells. 'Six weeks after the transplant we were told we would probably be going home the next week,' Mrs Davis said. 'I didn’t want to get my hopes up so I didn’t let myself get excited. 'He is going to grow up feeling very proud of himself, and I am never going to let him forget it' 'But the next week on the Friday, they told us we were definitely going home that day. 'It took me a good couple of hours to pack but I was over the moon. 'The next day was Jacob’s first birthday so it was just perfect timing.' Mrs Davis is ecstatic to be back at home with Seren and Jacob together. 'Jacob is totally obsessed with her he is so excited to have her home he follows her around everywhere,' she said. 'I am really proud of the two of them. 'I won’t ever let him forget what he has done for her.' Seren is recovering well from the transplant and is already getting back on her feet. Her . mother, said: 'For the first few weeks Seren didn’t really want to do . anything because of the steroids she was on but it was just unbelievable . having her home. The siblings are now back at home in Colchester in Essex after the transplant was a success. Doctors have told Mr and Mrs Davis the operation will not reverse the damage already caused by the disease but it will stop the illness in its tracks . 'Now we have been home for a month she is completely off the steroids and she is back to her normal self playing a lot with her brother. 'Seren has a future now and although she still has to live with the damages already caused by the disease, she has a completely different life direction. 'I’ve always thought special needs children go to special families and I wouldn’t change Seren for the world. 'I will be really proud of anything she achieves and I will always be proud of Jacob for saving her life. 'I feel like the luckiest mother around.'","Jacob Davis donated his bone marrow to save his big sister Seren-Rose .

"Next time you're in a bad mood, don’t turn to Facebook to cheer you up. Research has revealed that the longer you spend procrastinating on the social networking site, the more miserable you will become. This is because we recognise we're wasting our time on the site, and this lowers our self-esteem. Researchers from University of Innsbruck in Austria asked 300 English and German Facebook users to take a series of tests. The first asked how much time they had spent on Facebook, and to rate their mood. The second asked some participants to spend 20 minutes on the social network . The research contradicts Facebook’s own controversial study, published last month, which revealed posts on the site can have a positive and negative effect. Australian researchers from Charles Sturt University in New South Wales, Australia studied the profiles of 608 female Facebook users. According to the researchers, ‘half (308) were categorised as “connected” and the remaining 308 users were categorised as “lonely”; based on clearly stating this feeling in their latest wall posting.’ The study then monitored the publicly available aspects of the profile to see if there was a relationship between loneliness and self-disclosure. Half of those who were categorised as lonely were more likely to include more personal information on their accounts. This ranged from their relationship status to their address and phone number. One in eight lonely users also listed their favourite book and film. For the more recent experiment, a total of 300 English and German-speaking participants were asked by researchers from the University of Innsbruck to take two tests to see how Facebook affected their mood. In the first, they were asked how much time they had spent on Facebook that day, before being asked to rate their mood. The second study asked some of the participants to spend 20 minutes on Facebook doing typical things such as checking their news feed and updating their status. A second group browsed the web, but did not use social networks, while a third was given no instructions. All three groups were asked to rate how ‘meaningful’ their overall experience had been. The findings revealed that in both experiments, people said they felt worse about themselves after using Facebook, because they did not feel it was a good use of their time. Lead researcher Christina Sagioglou of the University of Innsbruck in Austria said: ‘The meaningfulness actually accounts for the mood effects. A second group browsed the web, but not social networks, while a third was given no instructions. The findings revealed that all participants said they felt worse about themselves after using Facebook because they did not feel it was a good use of their time . ‘It’s not surprising that if you do something you don’t consider very meaningful, you’re not in a good mood afterward.’ Previous studies have found Facebook can make people feel more jealous and lonely. Australian researchers from Charles . Sturt University in New South Wales discovered that female Facebook users who are categorised as lonely are more likely to include more personal information on their accounts. This ranged from their relationship status, to their address and phone number, while one in eight lonely users also listed their favourite book and film. Facebook’s own study was heavily criticised when it emerged the company manipulated the news feeds of 700,000 people in 2012 to see what would happen - without telling them first.","Researchers asked 300 Facebook users to undertake online tests .

"Katie Mulrennan, from County Kerry, applied for a job in Seoul, but was informed by an agency that their client would not hire an Irish person because of their perception of the nation's drinking habits . An Irish teacher was told she wasn't being considered for a job in a South Korean school because of the 'alcoholic nature' of her people. Katie Mulrennan, from County Kerry, applied for a job in Seoul, but was informed by an agency that their client would not hire an Irish person because of their perception of the nation's drinking habits. The 26-year-old, who has taught English for more than three years, in Barcelona, Oxford and Abu Dhabi, said that she could not believe the email was real at first because schools usually don't bother replying, or tell her they would prefer a teacher with an American accent. Miss Mulrennan, who does not drink alcohol, told MailOnline: 'It's quite ridiculous, I was really taken aback. 'Coming from Ireland you get used to the stereotype that people have and you joke about it but to be refused a job because of it is most unfair. 'I was very frustrated by it.' The email said: 'I am sorry to inform you that my client does not hire Irish people due to the alcoholism nature of your kind.' She replied saying she does not drink, or consume animal products, but has not heard back. She added: 'I didn't send them a harsh reply. 'I contemplated doing that but you don't know what they might do with your résumé. Miss Mulrennan, who has been living in Seoul for the past year, said she had been searching for a new job after her last teaching contract in the city had come to an end. She said that many schools in Seoul prefer to hire ex-pat teachers who are American, and she has found that often they do not want a teacher with an Irish accent. 'I have had some emails from recruiters on previous occasions they would prefer Americans,' she said. 'I was told by one recruiter to speak in a Skype interview with an American accent, he said ""I advise you speak with an American accent to get this position"". 'I thought it was crazy - they know I'm not American, they are looking at my CV and they know I'm Irish.' She does not know who the recruiter was as their details were not listed on the ad, which she had seen on the Korean version of Craigslist. Miss Mulrennan said many schools in Seoul prefer to hire ex-pat teachers who are American, and she has found that often they do not want a teacher with an Irish accent. 'They don't usually give the names of the private schools, they just tell you what the job is,' she said. 'I was urgently seeking a job so I wasn't fussy and this was in central Seoul so I sent my CV and they emailed back.' English graduate Miss Mulrennan said she suspected that the recruiter who sent the email had only done so because the advert had been posted anonymously. 'I couldn't imagine them sending that email if the recruiter's id was out there because it would damage their reputation but it is frustrating that I can't report it.' She added: 'If they had met me in person and made a judgement on my character I would understand but they didn't even speak to me on the phone,' she said. 'I don't think they had any right to do that at all, it's infuriating.' A friend suggested she post the email and it went viral. Fortunately she found another teaching job at a private academy, and says she still 'loves' Seoul and South Korea. Outdated stereotype: The email said: 'I am sorry to inform you that my client does not hire Irish people due to the alcoholism nature of your kind'. File picture . She also said she had been inundated with further job offers from around the world after her rejection email went viral. Ironically, earlier this year it was reported that South Koreans drink more alcohol than Britons, Russians and Americans put together. The average person of drinking age in South Korea knocks back 13.7 shots of liquor per week - more than in any other country in the world. South Korea’s unparalleled liquor consumption is almost entirely down to the country’s love for the fermented rice spirit Soju. The South Korean liquor accounts for 97 per cent of the country’s spirits market, according to Quartz. Hard drinking has become a growing issue in South Korea forcing the government to launch a marketing campaign to reign in its citizens. Ironically, South Korea is one of the heaviest drinking nations in the world. File picture . 'Almost every night in almost every police station lockup in Seoul, drunken men - and sometimes women - can be found abusing officers verbally and even physically, as a widely tolerated way of banishing anger,' reported the New York Times in 2012. 'They usually are allowed to sleep it off and go home, their punishment no more than a small fine.' 'A problem with the way South Koreans drink is that they drink fast to get drunk fast,' an official at the Korean Alcohol Research Foundation told the paper. Many South Koreans, who work some of the longest hours in the world, believe that one of the quickest ways of building friendship and office camaraderie is to get drunk together, the Times' report added.","Katie Mulrennan was told by an agency that the school would not accept her .

"A cancer patient has been told the 'wonder drug' that doctors claim extended his life is too expensive for the NHS to fund. Kevin Hughes, of Canvey, Essex, took part in clinical trials of Abiraterone to treat his prostate cancer. But the 58-year-old has been left devastated by a decision this week by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) not to fund the drug for patients who, like him, have not undergone chemotherapy. Mr Hughes was given three years to live after being diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer last April. Scroll down for video . Kevin Hughes, pictured, has been left 'devastated' after being told the 'wonder drug' that has extended his life is too expensive for the NHS to fund . After taking part in a clinical trial for the drug Abiraterone before having chemotherapy, doctors now believe he will go on to live longer than expected. The drug is currently available on the NHS to men who have already gone through chemotherapy. But Nice has ruled that the 'wonder' medication is too expensive to give to men before they have undergone the much more gruelling cancer treatment. Mr Hughes, of Canvey, Essex, said: 'Under normal circumstances they give people Abiraterone when they are in the very advanced stages and everything else has failed. Abiraterone, pictured, is currently available on the NHS to men who have already gone through chemotherapy . 'Nice's decision is a very bad one. I can empirically show what the drug has done for me. 'It's just wonderful. Before I got on it, people were calling it the wonder drug and I have to say it's pretty special.' Mr Hughes was being treated with Zolodex hormone injections, which resulted in hot sweats and fatigue, and had radiotherapy before the start of the clinical trial. He said: 'I had no symptoms, so when I was diagnosed, let's say it wasn't my best day. 'I walked around in a fog for a week and so did my wife. But you get over it, readjust and get on with it. 'I was on the hormone therapy injections and the side effects were not great, but take it on the chin and get on with it.' Before being chosen for the trial, a blood test to measure the prostate-specific antigen found Mr Hughes' count had rocketed to 500. The normal range is between five and six. He said: 'It was coming down nicely on the Zolodex, but since being on Abiraterone, it dropped completely. One year on my count is so low it is undetectable. 'I would say my three-year prognosis has gone flying out of the window. 'My doctors are more cautious, but agree I will probably go past the dates they first thought. 'It's a no-brainer, it just works and personally I have had no side effects from it. 'It should be given to men before they even have to go through chemotherapy.' From April 2013 to March 2014, Abiraterone pre-chemotherapy was the second most requested drug on England's Cancer Drugs Fund. On Sunday, June 29, former Health Minister Paul Burstow urged the Department of Health to intervene in the Nice process and call off the proposed restriction on use of Abiraterone before chemotherapy. Abiraterone, also known as Zytiga, was used pre-chemotherapy by thousands of men last year through the Cancer Drugs Fund, which picks up the bill for patients in England. Above, prostate cancer cells . Owen Sharp, chief executive of Prostate Cancer UK, has criticised the Nice decision. He said: 'It's a fiasco. This decision is a kick in the teeth for men with advanced prostate cancer. 'For many, this presented a vital opportunity for extra time with loved ones and a chance to delay chemotherapy and the debilitating side effects which come with it.' In the case of Abiraterone, Nice said the drug was too costly to use at an earlier stage in the disease. When the drug is used after chemotherapy, different rules apply that take into account the end-of-life plight of patients which make the drug cost-effective. Although the drug is sold to the NHS at the same price at whatever stage in the disease it is used, the cost effectiveness formula becomes more expensive before chemotherapy. The official price of a month’s treatment is £3,000 but the NHS pays less through a discount scheme from the manufacturer. Nice chief executive Sir Andrew Dillon said: 'We know how important it is for patients to have the option to delay chemotherapy and its associated side effects, so we are disappointed not to be able to recommend abiraterone for use in this way. 'However, the manufacturer's own economic model demonstrated that the drug does not offer enough benefit to justify its price.'","Kevin Hughes told Aberiterone prostate drug is too costly for NHS to fund .

"Kerry Kennedy’s hit-and-run crash may have been caused by a seizure, a family source claims. Robert F. Kennedy’s daughter, ex-wife of New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, was arrested for driving under the influence of drugs when she was found slumped over the wheel of her car after a collision in Westchester County, New York. The family has since claimed she may be suffering from an undiagnosed medical condition which led her to black out at the wheel, the New York Post reported. Arrested: Kerry Kennedy has been charged with driving while impaired with drugs in New York . Heartbroken: Ms Kennedy speaking before the funeral of her best friend and sister-in-law, Mary Richardson Kennedy, in Bedford, New York in May . ‘She does not remember how she got to . the side of the road. All she remembers is feeling very woozy, and then . the cops were there,’ the source told the paper. ‘They think she may have had some sort of seizure.’ Friday's collision came just two months . after her best friend and sister-in-law Mary committed suicide after . struggling with alcoholism and drug abuse. On Saturday it was reported that . Kennedy was under the influence of the sleeping drug Ambien when she . smashed into a tractor trailer rig then fled the scene. Ms Kennedy, 52, crashed into the big rig . about 8am om Friday then drove off the highway. The collision damaged . her car and left it with a flat tire. Police arrived at the scene after a 911 call reported erratic driving on the freeway. They then discovered Ms Kennedy passed out at the wheel of the white 2008 Lexus RS 350. There were no passengers. She apparently told police that she had taken prescription sleeping pills - said to include the drug Ambien - before the accident, according to WABC. After her arrest, Ms Kennedy was charged with driving while impaired with drugs. Political marriage: Ms Kennedy is the ex-wife of New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, left . Family: Kerry with her brother, Robert F. Kennedy Jr, and his (now deceased) wife Mary at a gala event in 2006 . She is due to appear in court in North Castle on Tuesday. A spokesman for Ms Kennedy denied that she was under the influence. Ken Sunshine told the New York Times: 'Kerry Kennedy voluntarily took breathalyzer, blood and urine tests – all of which showed no drugs or alcohol whatsoever in her system. 'The charges were filed before the test results were available.' If Ms Kennedy is found to have been under the influence of Ambien, she could have a legal basis for combating the driving under the influence charge. Ambien: Ms Kennedy said she was 'confused and erratic' when she told officers she may have taken the sleeping pill Ambien, which has been known in rare cases to cause 'sleep-driving'. But on Wednesday she said her 'first instinct' appears to be right after tests showed it WAS in her system the day of the crash . The 'Ambien defense' is a relatively new strategy that has been successfully used to clear drivers who had taken the medication before being arrested for operating a vehicle while intoxicated. Doctors have recorded rare cases of the drug causing people to eat, walk and even get behind the wheel of a car while under the effects of the popular sedative. In those cases, the patients claimed to have no memory of their actions. As a result, courts have found they are not criminally liable for their actions. However, most successful uses of the defense argument have come in cases where the defendants were found during normal sleeping times and often when they were discovered wearing pajamas. Ms Kennedy, one of the most prominent members of the legendary Kennedy family, is the daughter of Robert F. Kennedy and the niece of President John F. Kennedy. Celebration: Ms Kennedy with Mr Cuomo during his first New York gubernatorial campaign in 2002 . Her father was Senator for New York then U.S. Attorney General before being assassinated during his 1968 presidential campaign. She re-entered the public eye as the wife of Mr Cuomo, a member of Bill Clinton's cabinet who was elected as Governor of New York in 2010. The couple have three children but divorced in 2005 after 13 years of marriage. Ms Kennedy was best friends with her sister-in-law Mary Richardson Kennedy, who killed herself at her New York home in May after her marriage to Robert F. Kennedy Jr disintegrated. Kerry delivered an emotional eulogy at Mary's funeral, describing her friend as an 'angel' who had been destroyed by her own 'forces of evil'.","RFK's daughter and ex-wife of New York governor seen 'driving erratically'

"Heavily armed soldiers are patrolling the streets of Paris today as three gunmen who attacked the offices of controversial magazine Charlie Hebdo remain on the loose. The French government has upped security at train stations, places of worship, newspaper offices and public spaces this afternoon after 12 people, including police officers and journalists, were shot dead earlier today. Soldiers wearing green berets, dressed in combat fatigues, and carrying Famas assault rifles have been pictured in front of the Eiffel Tower and inside Montparnasse railway station. Scroll down for video . Lockdown: The streets of Paris are being patrolled by soldiers dressed in combat fatigues and carrying Famas assault rifles this afternoon after a terror attack killed 12 people earlier in the day . Armed: Three gunmen who attacked the offices of controversial magazine Charlie Hebdo this morning remain on the run this afternoon, causing authorities to heighten security . Secure: Troops have been deployed to places of worship, public spaces and train stations (pictured, Montparnasse station in Paris) following on from the attack earlier today . French authorities have now raised the threat alert to the highest level possible, while the British Foreign Office has issued a warning to those travelling to the city. Three gunmen are believed to have forced their way into the offices of magazine Charlie Hebdo this morning and asked for senior staff by name in fluent French before executing them. The attack is believed to be in retaliation for cartoon images published by the magazine which depicted the Prophet Mohammed, which is deeply offensive to Muslims. Hebdo had its offices burned down in 2011 after publishing an issue of the magazine entitled Sharia Weekly which claimed to be guest edited by the holy figure, and featured the cover slogan '100 lashes if you don't die laughing'. On guard: The French government has raised the threat alert to the highest level possible while the British Foreign Office has issued a warning to those travelling to the city . Vanished: Nothing has been seen of the three gunmen who attacked the Hebdo offices since this morning when they were seen fleeing towards the east of the city in a stolen car . Tense: French soldiers patrol at Montparnasse railway station in Paris this afternoon after 12 people, including police officers, were killed in an terror attack . The editor and head cartoonist Stephane Charbonnier, who is believed to be among the dead, was also put on Al Qaeda's most wanted list last year after spending months under police protection. Officers were also detailed to guard the offices, according to Charbonnier's lawyer, and today French police were confirmed to be among the dead. Video footage from the scene of the killing shows two of the attackers climbing out of a black Citroen before cutting an officer down with five precise shots. They advance to where the man is laying using military-style techniques, covering each other as they run, before executing him with a single round to the head. Also among the dead are some of France's most revered cartoonists including Georges Wolinski, Bernard 'Tignous' Verlhac, Jean Cabut and Bernard Maris. President Francois Hollande described the bloodbath as a 'barbaric attack against France and against journalists' and vowed to hunt down those responsible. Hunted: Police are hunting these two gunmen and a third accomplice after the highly-trained killers raided the offices of a controversial magazine this morning over cartoons it published of the Prophet Mohammed . Controversial: Stepahne Charbonnier, also known as Charb, the editor of Charlie Hebdo, wsa among those killed after the gunmen got into their building then called the senior staff by name before killing them . The attack took place during the publication's weekly editorial meeting, meaning all the journalists would have been present. Corrine Ray, a young mother and cartoonist who survived the massacre, today told how she was forced to allow the  killers into the office. She described hiding under a desk during the shooting, saying the editors were called out by name before being executed. She added that the militants spoke perfect French and said they were from Al Qaeda.","Soldiers pictured patrolling Paris in combat fatigues with machine guns .

"When it came to finding a soulmate one woman from New York was prepared to pay big bucks to find 'the one'. So imagine the shock and despair Audrey Ruden faced when after paying a matchmaker to do Cupid's work, she only met men who wanted one-night stands, instead of something a little more permanent. Now the top Manhattan  broker who has sold more than $500 million dollars of Manhattan real estate, wants her money back and she's prepared to fight for it. Suing Cupid: Audrey Ruden is suing Richard Easton after he failed to find her soul mate . Ms Ruden, who has been married before and is now 61, filed a lawsuit in Manhattan civil court Thursday saying Richard Easton, who runs a matchmaking service, is a fraud. Mr Easton, who has appeared on Real Housewives​ of New York​, offers 'personalized, sophisticated, thoughtful matchmaking services provided by h​​ighly trained experts.' Ms Ruden, who is a top broker for Douglas Elliman, claims that Mr Easton's claims are 'a lie'. Instead, she claims, her six-figure fee saw her sent off on two dates with bachelors who only had an interest in short-term flings. Bitter: Single real estate broker Audrey Ruden filed in Manhattan civil court  saying Richard Easton  is ​a fraud​ . Promises: Easton said that 'Ms. Ruden is a lovely woman for whom we wish to make happy in love' Frustrated: Audrey Ruden says she asked for her money back but that RIchard Easton was 'unresponsive' and never returned her voicemails . One of the dates even questioned 'why she was pursuing marriage,' the suit says. The legal papers go onto claim that Ms​ Ruden realized Mr Easton 'had taken advantage of her intense desire to be in a committed relationship' and demanded her money back, but he refused, according to the New York Post. She alleges that the $100,000 fee also ​violates the state's Dating Services Law preventing 'purveyors of social referral services' from charging above $1,000 per client. Under New York state law, any dating service charging more than $25 must provide a minimum number of referrals per month. If the service does not deliver for two successive months, the client is entitled to cancel the contract with a full refund minus a cancellation fee. She even accuses the 'international playboy' of hiring men to 'create a false impression of performing the contracted-for services.' Easton told The Post, 'Ms. Ruden is a lovely woman for whom we wish to make happy in love', but he said, she has a 'strict criteria' and turned down two 'wonderful, handsome, and very successful men.' Going home alone: Ruden spent $100,000 which got her two lousy dates with bachelors who only had an interest in short-term flings . It's not the only lawsuit on Mr. Easton's plate. Earlier this month, his landlord sued him for a host of offenses, including commanding the building's employees to call him 'Prince,' ordering that a maid give him oral sex and letting his dog relieve himself on his West Village Perry Street building's rooftop deck.","Richard Easton is being sued by real estate broker Audrey Ruden .

"Benson Henderson used his championship experience to dispatch Brandon Thatch by rear naked choke in the fourth round of their main event clash in Colorado on Saturday evening.

I didn’t want to run away, but that’s a big dude. I didn’t want to stand with him. I figured I’d be more elusive and then in the second, third, fourth, fifth round I’d pick it up on him.' Thatch landed some dangerous shots throughout the first three rounds of the fight, but it was clear that Henderson was the more energetic of the two going into the fourth session, having disrupted Thatch's breathing by applying a body triangle in the third. When Henderson changed levels midway through the fourth to land a well-timed takedown and establish control of Thatch’s back for the second time in the contest, the writing was on the wall. As soon as the hometown hero opened up his neck, Henderson immediately applied his choking arm.

That’s just trial and error and I think I need a little more experience. He’s a class act.' Despite hinting that this trip to 170lbs would be a one off, Henderson was quick to change his tune on the back of the big win. With top 170 lbs prospect Rory MacDonald left without an opponent after Hector Lombard was ruled out of their April 25 meeting, Henderson revealed that he would happily take the former Bellator champion’s place. 'I hear there’s a big name, MacDonald up in Canada, that needs a fight,' he said. 'I’m game.' In the co-main event, meanwhile, Max Holloway defeated veteran Cole Miller over three rounds. It was later announced that the Hawaiian featherweight will now meet No 5 ranked Cub Swanson on April 18 in Newark, a bout which will undoubtedly have huge championship implications for Holloway.

"Juan Cuadrado has admitted his delight at signing for Chelsea and is loving being 'surrounded by so many champions.' The Colombian completed his £27million move from Fiorentina during the January transfer window and is expected to add another attacking dimension to Jose Mourinho's side. Talking to chelseafc.com, Cuadrado spoke about how pleased he is to be playing for the Premier League leaders. Juan Cuadrado (left) is delighted to sign for Chelsea and is enjoying being 'surrounded by champions' He said: ‘I am very happy to be part of this team, I’m very grateful to have been given this possibility to live what has been a childhood dream for me, which is to play for a very big club – in fact, one of the best clubs in the world. ‘To be on the same team as all these big players is amazing for me, not only from a football point of view and how I can grow as a player, but also personally, to be surrounded by so many champions.' The explosive winger also talked about the closeness of the Chelsea players and says he's fitting in well with the squad. He revealed: ‘I’m now training and I was made to feel really welcome when I arrived. The explosive winger (centre) feels he's settling in well with the 'close-knit' squad and feels very welcome . 'To me, that was very telling, because it’s clear we have a close-knit group and when that’s the case off the pitch, on the pitch that has to shine through. ‘In football you have to play for each other, and I can already see that’s what they do here. There is a real sense of togetherness and a big union within the team.’ Ahead of Saturday's game against Aston Villa, the 26-year-old is relishing playing under his new manager. ‘Jose Mourinho has won everything and I think he is going to bring a lot to my game, but also I am going to look to learn a lot from him and grow by his side,' he added. The Colombian is excited to work and learn under new boss Jose Mourinho (centre) in the future . Cuadrado could feature on Saturday when Chelsea travel to Aston Villa to face Paul Lambert's struggling side . Cuadrado admits it was daunting arriving at the club but growing up watching some of Chelsea's current squad and having the chance to play with them now is a dream. He said: ‘'I didn’t know any of the players personally before I joined, but obviously when I was younger I used to see some of them on television, players like Drogba and Terry. ‘To now be on the same team as them, and to train with them every day is such a dream come true. To think that when I was younger I really looked up to these champions, and now I’m playing with them.' Didier Drogba (left) and John Terry have been idols of Cuadrado's and he's now excited to play with them . The ex-Fiorentina man already has silverware in his sight and he hopes to play a part in achieving those goals with the club. ‘Obviously one of my biggest aims is to help the team win the Premier League, that’s my principle goal,’ he says. ‘Also, I want us to really go for it in the Champions League, and on a personal level it would be great for me if I could contribute with some big goals for the team.’","Juan Cuadrado signed from Fiorentina for £27m on deadline day .

"The discovery of dozens of birch-bark documents in Russia has revealed what life was like from the 11th to 15th Century. Each has a various message inscribed on bits of wood, preserved in mud for centuries until the present day. The finds include a shopping list of sorts sent from a father to his son asking for a shirt, towel, trousers, reins for a horse presumably and fabric. Dozens of writings from the 14th century have been found in Russia. The birch-bark documents were found in the ancient city of Novgorod. This particular birch-bark document from between 1240 and 1260 was drawn by a boy thought to be between six and seven years old . Reported by the New York Times, the documents apparently cover a number of topics also including business transactions and accusations of crime. The findings were made in the ancient city of Novgorod, an important old Russian city. Founded in 859, it boasts the country's first customs office and school, among other cultural milestones, and it is here about 1,000 birch-bark documents have been found. One, written by a father named Onus to his son Danilo in the 14th century, says: 'Send me a shirt, towel, trousers, reins, and, for my sister, send fabric.' One, written by a father named Onus to his son Danilo in the 14th century, says: 'Send me a shirt, towel, trousers, reins, and, for my sister, send fabric.' The apparent 'shopping list' ends with some humour as Onus adds: 'If I am alive, I will pay for it.' The apparent 'shopping list' seems to end with some humour as Onus adds: 'If I am alive, I will pay for it.' Another, dated from between 1280 to 1300, from a man named Mikita to a woman named Anna, rather bluntly states: 'Marry me. I want you, and you want me.' Before the advent of paper, birch bark was often used to write on. The oldest birch bark manuscripts in the world date back to the 1st Century, the Gandhāran Buddhist texts that originated in Afghanistan. These latest findings, though, provide an insight into the history of Russia. Most are written in Old Novgorod dialect, a diverse form of Slavic language that is fairly conversational in tone. The findings were made in the ancient city of Novgorod, an important old Russian city. Founded in 859, it boasts the country's first customs office and school, among other cultural milestones, and it is here about 1,000 birch-bark documents have been found . This letter dated between 1100 and 1120 was written by a person from Zhiznomira to Mikula. It discusses how they bought a slave in Pskov but the slave was stolen by the person they are writing to. They ask them to return the slave so that they may have money to get a horse or the situation could escalate . To create them they were etched with styluses made of bronze and iron in place of ink. The wooden letters were able to survive remarkably intact because the muddy soil kept them isolated from oxygen. They come from the 11th to 15th centuries and are commonly found where streets used to be, as the logs they once rested on have sunk into the ground. Many of these particular findings are thought to be from a garden and apple orchard, while the area itself is believed to have had wooden buildings. 'Novgorod for Russia is like Pompeii for Italy,'  Pyotr G. Gaidukov, the deputy director of the Russian Academy of Sciences Institute of Archaeology, told the New York Times. 'Only Novgorod is still alive.' It's likely more such remarkable findings will be made in future as excavations continue.","Dozens of writings from the 14th century have been found in Russia .

"Interpol is searching for two Austrian teenage girls who they believe were tricked into going to Syria to fight for Islamist rebels. Samra Kesinovic, 16, and Sabina Selimovic, 15, vanished from their homes in Vienna on April 10. But the first hint their parents received as to where the girls might have gone was a spate of social media posts claiming they had gone to fight a 'holy war'. Missing: Samra Kesinovic, left, and Sabinas Selimovic, right, have disappeared, leaving behind Facebook posts showing them in niqabs and wielding assault rifles . 'Never find us': Messages from the girls, which their parents doubt were really written by them, boasted that they could not be found . But the parents say that they don’t believe the messages are being written by the girls. Authorities suspect they have been tricked into leaving the country. Samra and Sabina come from Bosnian refugee families who settled in Austria after the ethnic wars of the 1990s, and were born in the country. The fighting in Syria continues to be fierce - just today a bomb was detonated in the northern city of Aleppo, destroying buildings and injuring children. War-torn: Interpol believe the girls have been taken to Syria. Pictured is a man carrying a wounded child after a bombing today in Aleppo, northern Syria . Damage: Emergency services respond to the bombing in war-torn Aleppo . Posts: Samra, left, and Sabina, right, have posted photographs of themselves in Islamic dress from unknown locations . New photos on their Facebook pages show them brandishing Kalashnikov rifles - and in some cases surrounded by armed men. However, it has since emerged that some of these pictures have been circulated online for years - casting doubt on whether they actually show the girls. In . the latest posting they announced plans to marry so that they could . become 'holy warriors' and in the messages they say: 'Death is our . goal'. Their families doubt that the messages were really written by them. Austrian officials believe that the pair, judging by the scenes around them, are in a training camp and are not only already married, but also already living in the homes of their new husbands. In Vienna the family admitted that the two had recently started going to a local mosque run by a radical Imam, Ebu Tejma. The girls' fathers are reportedly already abroad looking for their daughters, who have not contacted their parents. Armed: This image, posted on Facebook, implies that it shows Sabina holding a rifle. However, the image has been available online for years so is unlikely to really show her . 'New life': This post appears to show the two girls making a determined gesture - however doubts have been raised that it really shows them . It is thought that they have been sending online messages to their friends speaking of their new lives and boasting that 'nobody will ever find us'. Austrian media said the two teenagers had become the public face for the call to jihad in Syria, and alleged that they had been tricked into going to the country in order to publicise the call to arms. The latest case of young people getting caught up in the Syrian conflict comes after an 18-year-old British man died in Syria - only for his father to reveal he had no idea his son had gone there. Abdullah Deghayes, 18, from Brighton, East Sussex, was caught up in fighting in Syria. But his father Abubaker said today: 'At the moment we do not have details of his death. All that we know is that he was killed in Syria. The family is mourning.' Abdullah was the nephew of former Guantanamo Bay detainee Omar Deghayes.

"UFC legend and former middleweight champion Anderson Silva has tested positive for anabolic steroids during a random out-of-competition test in the lead-up to his victory over Nick Diaz. Brazilian Silva, 39, regarded by many to be the best MMA fighter in history, was found to have Drostanolone metabolites in his system after tests administered by the Nevada State Athletic Commission on January 9, the UFC confirmed. His opponent Diaz will face a hearing on February 17, the UFC stated, after testing positive for marijuana metabolites after the same fight, won by a unanimous points decision as part of UFC 183 at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas. Anderson SIlva (right) kicks out at Nick Diaz in his UFC 183 victory on January 31 . It was announced after this fight by  UFC that Silva had tested positive to Drostanolone metabolites . The UFC confirmed the initial findings of Silva's test in a statement on their website: 'On February 3, 2015, the UFC organization was notified by the Nevada State Athletic Commission that Anderson Silva tested positive for Drostanolone metabolites on his January 9 out of competition drug test. 'UFC's understanding is that further testing will be conducted by the Commission to confirm these preliminary results. 'Anderson Silva has been an amazing champion and a true ambassador of the sport of mixed martial arts and the UFC, in Brazil as well as around the world. UFC is disappointed to learn of these initial results. 'The UFC has a strict, consistent policy against the use of any illegal and/or performance enhancing drugs, stimulants or masking agents by its athletes.' It is the first time in Silva's 18-year, 34-victory career, that he has tested positive for a banned substance. Silva has previously campaigned for a lifetime ban for performance-enhancing drug users. Results of subsequent January 19 tests are pending although an in-competition test on the day of the Diaz fight is reportedly clear. Former UFC middleweight champion Silva had returned from a 13-month injury layoff before the win . Silva reflects after his win over Diaz in Las Vegas, after which the UFC confirmed he'd tested positive for performance enhancing drugs . NAC executive director Bob Bennett also told mmafighting.com that traces of androstane, also a banned substance under the World Anti-Doping Agency's rules, were found in Silva's January 9 tests. 'I think it's very unfortunate,' Bennett told Ariel Helwani of MMAFighting.com. 'The UFC have made a tremendous effort to level the playing field in their fight against PEDs.' The NSAC said the fight between Silva and Diaz was not cancelled because results of the positive tests were not made available until  Tuesday morning in the United States. The UFC also confirmed Diaz's positive test in this statement: ''The UFC has been notified by the Nevada State Athletic Commission that Nick Diaz has tested positive for marijuana metabolites following his fight with Anderson Silva at UFC 183 on January 31 in Las Vegas, Nevada. Nick Diaz (left) faces a hearing on February 17 after testing positive to marijuana metabolites . Silva beat Diaz in a unanimous points decision at the MGM Grand Arena in Las Vegas .

"General Motors CEO Mary Barra wept on Monday as she met with families of people killed in auto accidents involving GM cars that are included in a growing list of recalls . Barra met with 15 families of people killed in recalled GM vehicles at the car manufacturer's Washington D.C. office on the eve of a Congressional hearing looking into the several vehicles the company was forced to recall after it linked 31 crashes - and 13 deaths - to the vehicles' faulty ignition switches. The families reportedly showed Barra new photos of those killed in crashes linked to the recalled vehicles, a list that now includes Chevrolet Cobalts, Saturn Ions and others. Somber: GM CEO Mary Barra wept as she met with families of people killed in recalled GM vehicles . 'We went around the table, family by . family, and told stories about our loved ones who can’t speak for . themselves,' Wisconsin resident Ken Rimer - whose stepdaughter Natasha . Weigel, 18, was killed in a 2005 Cobalt - told the Detroit Free Press. The ignition switches on the recalled vehicles can inadvertently move out of position, which can disable the vehicles' airbags. 'It was helpful for us to put Natasha and . Amy’s face on it and talk to Mary about them,' Rimer said. 'They are . not just 13 victims. We are real people.' Barra agreed to meet with the families ahead of the hearing at the request of attorney Bob Hilliard, who represents the families of two of those killed in collisions involving recalled GM vehicles. According to Laura Gipe Christian, the mother of 16-year-old Amber Marie Rose, who was killed in 2005 in a crash involving a Chevy Cobalt, Barra apologized during the meeting, telling the paper that the CEO 'said, ""I'm sorry,"" an awful lot.' 'She may have been very sincere, but all of this is coming after we lost someone that nothing can replace,' Christian said. Recalled: One of several vehicles on the recall list is the 2005 Chevy Cobalt . Additionally, she says Barra did not agree with her opinion that the vehicles are dangerous and need to be taken off the road. 'I asked her about getting the cars off . the road, and she told me the cars are safe,' Christian said. GM maintains that the recalled vehicles can still be driven while they await parts. The families of those killed wanted to meet with the CEO to make sure that Barra 'could not turn away from the human side of this.' The hearings begin as one thing is becoming clear: Of those killed, the majority were young. In a way, this isn't surprising. Low-priced cars like the Chevrolet Cobalt and Saturn Ion were marketed to young, first-time buyers and parents shopping for their kids. But price may not be the only reason for the disproportionate number of youthful deaths. This combination of undated family photos shows, from left, Amber Marie Rose,  Natasha Weigel, and Amy Rademaker. All three were killed in deadly car crashes involving GM's Cobalt during 2005-2006.  The complaint tally for the top-selling small cars in the 2005-2007 model years was: Corolla, 228; Cobalt, 164; Honda Civic, 60; Ford Focus, 25; and the Mazda 3, 19.  (AP Photo) The faulty ignition switches behind the recall can shut off the engine while the car is in motion. When that happens, power-assisted steering and power brakes are lost, and the air bags won't inflate in a crash. In such a situation, inexperienced drivers are more likely to panic and be overwhelmed by the extra effort needed to control the car, safety experts say. GM has linked 13 deaths to the problem. Others have a higher total, with the majority of victims under age 25. Many also were women, who safety experts say are less likely to have the upper body strength to wrestle a stalled car safely to the side of the road. 'With an entry-level car where you have a newly licensed driver, the freak-out will win the day,' said Robert Hilliard, a Texas personal injury lawyer who is suing GM in several cases. 'All that those young drivers are going to do is respond to the panic.' GM has admitted knowing for at least a decade that the switches were defective. Yet it didn't start recalling 2.6 million Cobalts, Ions and other small cars worldwide until February. Barra has said GM's safety processes were lacking, and she has brought in an outside attorney to review them. Through media reports and contacts on a Facebook page, Christian, whose daughter was killed in a 2005 Maryland wreck in which a Cobalt air bag didn't inflate, has found crashes that claimed 29 lives. Of those, 15 were under age 25, and 18 were women. According to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, drivers ages 16 to 24 were involved in 23 percent of the 35,306 fatal crashes in the U.S. in 2012. Relatives of many who died will attend congressional hearings on the matter Tuesday and Wednesday, and many will wear T-Shirts with Amber's picture. Barra will appear as a witness and again issue a public apology, according to her prepared testimony. First: Barra was named CEO of GM in January, making her the first female CEO of a major global automaker . Unlike drivers from previous generations, young people don't know what it's like to drive without power steering, safety experts say. Even some older drivers could be startled when power steering goes away. Data suggest parents buy the small cars for their kids. For instance, 68 percent of people who now own Cobalts are 35 to 64 years old, according to the Edmunds.com automotive website. Many of those buyers were at an age when they had teenage children, said Karl Brauer, senior analyst at Kelley Blue Book. Plus, many parents had the car title put in their names to reduce insurance costs, he said. Edmunds also said most buyers had household incomes under $100,000. That made the Cobalt appealing, because in most years it sold for a little over $15,000, or $1,000 to $3,500 less than the two top-selling small cars, the Toyota Corolla and Honda Civic, according to Edmunds. Parents also complained to GM and the government about the cars on behalf of their children. In a June 2005 letter to Chevrolet customer service, later forwarded to federal safety regulators, a New Jersey mother said a 2005 Cobalt stalled three times while being driven by her daughter. She said the problem was obvious: 'The problem is the ignition turn switch is poorly installed. Even with the slightest touch, the car will shut off while in motion.' Besides being affordable, the GM cars had four- or five-star ratings in most government crash test categories. Tragic: Natasha Weigel was one of two women killed in a crash involving a 2005 Chevy Cobalt . GM's marketing of the Ion and Cobalt clearly was aimed at young people. Ion ads from the time posted on YouTube showed the car taking young passengers away from high school or childhood. A Chevy ad portrayed the Cobalt as a renegade younger brother, bumping a Corvette in the rear and provoking a reaction from its older sibling. Kelly Bard's parents helped her buy a shiny black 2004 Ion when she was 16 and growing up in Wausau, Wis. 'At the time, it really had high safety ratings,' she recalled. 'It had good gas mileage, and it was what we could afford.' The Ion soon began stalling for no reason. Each time, the car became difficult to steer and the key had slipped out of the ""run"" position. 'It went from being able to steer with two fingers to using all of my ability to pull off and keep away from the intersection and get out of oncoming traffic,' said Bard, now 26. Even after repeated trips to the dealership's service department, the Ion kept stalling. Bard had a near-miss on a freeway entrance ramp, where a driver behind her was able to steer around the Ion. He made an obscene gesture as he passed, she remembered. Another trip to the dealer. Another supposed fix. Then, as she was making a left turn a safe distance in front of an oncoming bus, the engine stalled again, she said. Sad: 16-year-old Amber Rose was killed when the airbags failed to deploy when she crashed her 2005 Cobalt . 'I thought I was going to get T-boned by the bus. I refused to drive the car again until I felt like it was safe,' she said. The dealer replaced the starter and alternator. At the same time, Bard stopped using a lanyard as her keychain. She got rid of the Ion and bought a Honda as soon as she graduated from college and got a job. GM has said the ignition can switch off if people have long, heavy keychains, sometimes if their knees brush against the keys. Bard's lanyard had two keys and the remote control for the car's doors. In 2005, GM notified dealers that the cars could stall because of the ignition switches. But GM didn't recall the cars, theorizing that even in a stall, people could still steer and brake without the power systems. Because her car stalled so much, Bard knew she could still steer it. But other young people might not be able to handle such a situation, according to safety experts. Most driver education curriculums cover a loss of power steering, said Bill Van Tassel, manager of driver education for the American Automobile Association. While some instructors have students practice in cars, many just cover it in the classroom, and it's unclear whether the young drivers retain the information, he said. Young drivers have a high crash risk because of inexperience and immaturity, said Anne McCartt, senior vice president of research for the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. 'I think emergency situations bring out both of those,' she said. 'They're kids. They're young. They may not have as much cool, or presence of mind as an adult might have.'","GM CEO Mary Barra met with the families at the company's Washington D.C. office .

Villaneuva wrote on Facebook: 'What a fouth of july got hit with . lighting now in the hospital...sucks and i hope my baby is going to . start doing better alot of electricity for a little baby (sic).' More than a year on, Kimberly still has neurological damage from the lightning strike. She can't sit up, crawl or digest food properly. Doctors also don't know when she will begin to walk and talk as the case is so unusual. It is not clear why the child's hair is still static. 'It's hard seeing she can't eat like she's supposed to and can't have food yet, just through the [feeding] tube. But other than I'm glad she lived through it all,' Villanueva told KOAT. Miracle baby: Little Kimberly is lucky to be alive after her mother Kendra Villanueva was struck by lightning while pregnant . However doctors said it was extraordinary that the little girl could survive such a shock. According to IBTimes, an emergency medical technician who . treated Villanueva and Gordon said there have only been 11 incidents on . record of a pregnant woman getting struck by lightning. Of those, only half of the newborns survived. And according to the National Lightning Safety Institute, there is a 1 in 280,000 chance of being struck by lightning. 'Somebody's definitely watching out for us,' said Gordon, who dubbed his daughter 'little Flash Gordon' after the 1930s comic book hero. He hopes his miracle baby 'will run fast, or save the universe'.

Injury: Kendra Villanueva said the thunderbolt traveled through her body and leaving through her thumb which was bloody (pictured last year after July 4 strike) There have been other sensational cases of pregnant women giving birth to healthy babies. In April 2012, Ohio's Kelly Lough was struck as she was getting into her husband's car, but doctors said the rubber soled shoes she was wearing saved her life. Doctors said her unborn child was safe. In January 2012, Jezebel reported Stephanie Alberti was 13-weeks-pregnant when she was hit at the racetrack. Six months later, she gave birth to a healthy six-and-a-half-pound baby girl named Sophia.","Kimberly Gordon was in the womb when her mother Kendra Villanueva was struck by lightning on July 4 last year .

"Stocks slid to the lowest value in two months today and technology stocks plummeted after Apple withdrew an update to its operating system. Each of the major indexes fell more than one per cent and the S&P broke below a key support level amid fears of uncertainty surrounding the global economy. And the Dow slumped 1.5 per cent - just days after closing at an all time high following the debut of Chinese e-commerce firm Alibaba on the market. Problems: Apple shares plummeted as iPhone 6 users continue to report problems such as handsets bending . Apple shares were the biggest drag on both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 indexes, as consumers continue to report problems with the iPhone 6 - pushing shares down three per cent to $98.69. The firm has faced backlash after it emerged the long-awaited handset is bendable. As a result, the biggest casualties on the stock market were seen in the tech-packed Nasdaq compsite, which ended down 1.9 per cent and the Standard & Poor's 500 index, which dropped 1.6 per cent. Each of the ten major S&P sectors was in negative territory. The Dow Jones industrial average was falling 229.76 points, or 1.34 per cent, to 16,980.3, the S&P 500 was losing 26.93 points, or 1.35 per cent, to 1,971.37 and the Nasdaq Composite was dropping 75.32 points, or 1.65 per cent, to 4,479.91. All of the major indexes were on track for their worst drop since July 31. The S&P 500 also broke through its 50-day moving average around 1,976, a key support level which the index had been able to rebound off of when recently tested. Adding to concerns for investors was the continued strength of the dollar and the possible impact on corporate earnings. 'I don't get too worried about dollar strength. Of course, the hard part is this is kind of a historic sized move here, so certainly individual companies have to worry perhaps about the impact,' said Bill Stone, chief investment strategist at PNC Wealth Management in Philadelphia. Drop: The firm was the biggest drag on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 indexes as stocks closed today . 'It's pretty easy to say you should expect that to roll through some of the earnings reports to some extent, because you don't often see those kind of moves.' Durable goods orders dropped 18.2 per cent in August, however this had little effect as it was largely in-line with expectations. Last week saw an optimistic turn as initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 12,000 to a seasonally adjusted 293,000 for the week ended September 20, which was well below the 300,000 forecast, indicating an acceleration in job growth for the month. The largest percentage gainer on the New York Stock Exchange was Cone Midstream Partners, rising 35.45 percent, while the largest percentage decliner was OMNOVA Solutions, down 15.70 percent. Declining issues were outnumbering advancing ones on the NYSE by 2,530 to 477, for a 5.30-to-1 ratio on the downside; on the Nasdaq, 2,153 issues were falling and 494 advancing for a 4.36-to-1 ratio favoring decliners.

"New EU president Jean-Claude Juncker is set to earn £1.8million in pay and perks over the next five years, following David Cameron's failure to block his appointment last week. The former Luxembourg Prime Minister will head up the powerful Commission until 2019 following his election by European leaders on Friday. Mr Juncker, 59, a veteran Brussels fixer who favours a United States of Europe, will earn £245,629.70 a year - almost double Mr Cameron's £142,000 pay packet. Millionaire former Luxembourg PM Jean-Claude Juncker will pocket almost £2million over the next five years . The salary is topped up by a 'residential allowance' of £184,222.25 over five years and can look forward to a £52,500-a-year pension for life, figures published in the Sun reveal. Details of Mr Juncker's pay packet will spark further controversy in Britain following his controversial appointment last week in the face of furious resistance by Mr Cameron. The Prime Minister was left humilated after EU leaders voted 26 to two in favour of Mr Juncker, leaving Britain closer to the exit door. Speaking after Mr Juncker's appointment, Mr Cameron admitted keeping Britain in the EU had been made 'harder' by the decision to ignore his opposition. He said the appointment had been a 'huge step backwards', but added: ‘Frankly, sometimes you have to be ready to lose a battle in order to win a war.’ Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt today backed Mr Cameron's claim that the development had left Britain closer to leaving Europe. His remarks came after polls showed British voters agreed that it was now more likely the UK will cut its ties with Brussels. According to the Survation poll for The Mail on Sunday, a total of 47 per cent want to leave the EU, with 39 in favour of staying in. Asked how they would vote in a referendum if Mr Cameron fails to get a better deal for Britain, the number who want to leave rises to 49 per cent, while those wishing to stay in falls to 31, a massive 18-point margin. However, if Mr Cameron defies the odds and persuades Mr Juncker to restore some of Britain’s sovereignty, the UK could yet stay in Europe. A total of 41 per cent would vote to stay in in such circumstances, with a hardcore of 37 resolutely in favour of leaving. He also attacked EU leaders for saying they would oppose Mr Juncker in private only to then support him publicly. Scroll down for video . Shadow chancellor Ed Balls, appearing on the Andrew Marr show this morning, accused Mr Cameron of being 'cack handed' Foreign Secretary William Hague told Andrew Marr that it remained the Government's aim to renegotiate Britain's relationship with the EU in order to stay in . David Cameron said on Friday that Mr Juncker's appointment was a 'huge step backwards' European Council President Herman Van Rompuy was forced to call a vote of European leaders on Mr Juncker's appointment following Mr Cameron's opposition . A leading member of Margaret Thatcher's Cabinet has claimed David Cameron may try to con voters by claiming to have overhauled Britain's relationship with Brussels - even if he has won 'very little'. Former Tory Chancellor Lord Lawson said Mr Cameron had thrown away his negotiating hand with the EU - but may try to convince the public he has achieved a fundamental renegotiation. He said Mr Cameron 'might do a Harold Wilson' but questioned whether the public would vote to stay in like 1975. 'What Harold Wilson did, and David Cameron is following in his footsteps, he said that he didn't agree with the terms that Ted Heath had negotiated, he was going to renegotiate the terms and then he put it to the people in a referendum. 'Through the long renegotiation, we got absolutely damn all – indeed, I doubt there's anyone alive today who can remember what he did get out of it, it was so trivial – but he presented it as a great success, and people bought it. 'I think David Cameron could try to do the same; he will get very little and he will present it as something.' Speaking to the Independent on Sunday, Lord Lawson said Mr Cameron should have threatened to campaign for Britain to leave the EU as a way of strengthening his negotiating position with fellow European leaders. Instead, the Prime Minister had 'made it quite clear that he doesn't want to exit … so he has no negotiating hand to speak of', Lord Lawson said. Asked whether the Prime Minister could threaten to withdraw in the run-up to the referendum, Lord Lawson said: 'Yes, but he hasn't. That is what's surprising, that he's made it quite clear that he doesn't want to exit, which doesn't strengthen his negotiating hand. 'If David Cameron had said, ""Well, I'm not sure how to vote. It depends on what I am able to negotiate"", that would have been a stronger hand. 'But he's actually made it clear he's going to vote for ""in"" irrespective, so he has no negotiating hand to speak of.' Mr Hunt said: 'As a result of cowardice yesterday from other leaders who weren't prepared to stand up in public and say the things they had said in private, they're going to have to work a lot harder to persuade the British people that Europe can be trusted with a proper reform agenda.' This morning the Foreign Secretary William Hague refused to say if he thought it would be a disaster if Britain left the European Union. He said the 'objective' should be to overhaul Britain's relationship with the EU in order to stay in. But Mr Hague said: 'The British people will decide if that is sustainable or not.' But Mr Cameron's failure in Europe was this morning attacked by Labour, who accused the Prime Minister of being 'cack handed'. Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said the week's events had been a 'catastrophe for Britain and the British national interest'. He told BBC One's The Andrew Marr Show: 'What is David Cameron's European policy? Does he think we should be in Europe, I do. 'I think that we will only be influential in the world if we are influential in Europe. Does he want reform? He says he does but he can't tell us what his reforms are.' 'He's weak, he's lost control, he's on the back foot, Britain is suffering. I think it's catastrophic for Britain.' Mr Balls added: 'I've never seen a negotiation so cack-handed.' Labour leader Ed Miliband went further - claiming that the PM now posed a 'real and present danger' to the British economy. The Labour leader said the 'debacle' over Mr Juncker's nomination had taken the UK closer to the 'exit door' that could put three million jobs and tens of thousands of businesses at risk. He said: 'The lesson of the Juncker debacle is that David Cameron and the Conservative Party now pose a real and present danger to our economy. 'He could not build alliances and his threats succeeded only in turning a Europe that was divided over the best candidate for commission president into a Europe united against him. 'There can be no better indicator of how a Conservative government would damage Britain's national interest and Britain's businesses if it were to win a second term next year.' He added: 'But the isolation he achieved this week is not ""splendid"". It shows he is incapable of reforming Europe and his strategy of getting change by making threats to leave to get change does not work. 'All it does is take Britain closer to an exit door through which three million British jobs and tens of thousands of businesses could disappear.' Business chief John Cridland said the country's economic success depended on it remaining a full member of the EU. The CBI director general said: 'The EU is our biggest export market and remains fundamental to our economic future. Our membership supports jobs, drives growth and boosts our international competitiveness. Alternatives to full membership of the EU simply wouldn't work.'","Former Luxembourg PM to earn £1.8million in pay and perks over five years .

"Talk about ripping the heart out of a home — or, in this case, a socking great country mansion in Norfolk. Anmer Hall, the ten-bedroom bolt-hole that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are renovating, until recently boasted one of those stunning, hand-crafted kitchens that is the stuff of over-excitable dreams. No luxury was spared: there was an £11,000 Aga, an £8,000 fridge and inset Belfast sinks. The floor space outstripped that of most entire homes, the work-tops were gleaming hardwood, even the draining board cost £275. In short, it was the kind of room most families would die for. Not the Duchess. Barely a week after we learned that she is having a second kitchen installed in her Kensington Palace apartment, we hear that most of the £50,000 kitchen at Anmer is to go, in favour of the young royals’ ‘own taste’. It is, of course, profligate madness — and as far as harmful reputations go, ‘Two Jags Prescott’ could well be outstripped by ‘Three Kitchens Kate’. Not surprisingly, the widespread reaction on Mail Online yesterday was one of disbelief  and fury. ‘To discard a new, serviceable kitchen is an utter waste and is not likely to endear them to a hard-pressed public,’ wrote a reader from Worcestershire. ‘What they’ve forgotten — or are insensitive to — is that millions of their “subjects” still struggle to survive in Britain,’ said another. Rose, from Maidstone, though, spoke for me: ‘Please, may I have the old kitchen?’ And perhaps most pertinent of all, from Jane in London: ‘The Queen would consider that extremely wasteful.’ Barely a week after we learned that Kate is having a second kitchen installed in her Kensington Palace apartment, we hear that most of the £50,000 kitchen at Anmer is to go, in favour of the young royals' 'own taste' Quite so. But the Queen is an octogenarian who holds dear the austere values of her time. Kate is both young and rich, and the truth is that we really should not be surprised that she loves to splash the cash. There is another reason: few people in the public eye are as ‘on trend’ as is Kate, and few trends have established themselves as rapidly as that which has made today’s kitchen the most fashionable of contemporary status symbols. Outstripping cars, pools, tennis courts and all the rest of the visibly extravagant paraphernalia available, the kitchen now is paramount. Nothing demonstrates the stylish qualities of one’s ‘own taste’ quite as definitively as the area of the house where dirty pots and pans are made clean again. Nobody worth their Maldon sea salt buys a new home and lives with — ugh — the ‘taste’ of the previous owner. Inevitably, no sooner has  the removal van left than the old units, fridge and manky hobs are quickly torn out and a skip arrives to carry them off. Sometimes, the daftness beggars belief. And in the case of Kate and William, their decision to replace a gorgeous £50,000 kitchen comes at a time when eyebrows have already been raised at the cost to the  taxpayer of refurbishing their apartment of 20-plus rooms at Kensington Palace which has quadrupled from its estimate to £4 million. In the case of Kate and William, their decision to replace a gorgeous £50,000 kitchen comes at a time when eyebrows have already been raised at the cost to the  taxpayer of refurbishing their apartment of 20-plus rooms at Kensington Palace which has quadrupled from its estimate to £4¿million . Even though the couple paid for most of the fixtures and fittings — as well they should, since William is a millionaire courtesy of his mother Diana’s inheritance — the bill for their son George’s nursery has been picked up by taxpayers. The fripperies that, once, Kate seemed to eschew also seem to be mounting. A nice little trip to the five-star Cheval Blanc Resort in the Maldives? A £6,500-a-night rest-break, laid on for them during their three-week tour of the Southern Hemisphere? That’ll do nicely, they have apparently decided. None, by themselves, appear too shocking. But added up? It’s not a good look. Then, of course, there’s that second kitchen at her Kensington Palace apartment. Anmer Hall, the ten-bedroom bolt-hole that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are renovating, until recently boasted the stunning, hand-crafted kitchen . This trend for swanky kitchens, like so many others, is based on a strange inverted snobbery. Among the wealthy classes, the kitchen used to be the domain of servants; rarely, if ever, would the mistress of the house descend the stairs and absolutely never the master. Yet now, even high up the social scale, people relish the chance to settle over a spag bol at the kitchen table. Famously, the so-called Chipping Norton set — ruled by David and Samantha Cameron, Top Gear’s Jeremy Clarkson and former newspaper editor Rebekah Brooks — regularly shared ‘kitchen suppers’. Our kitchen obsession would be understandable if it were accompanied by an increase in people cooking good, wholesome meals from fresh, quality ingredients and making themselves and their families healthier in the process. But it isn’t. While the British have an insatiable appetite for watching celebrity chefs offering countless recipes on TV, they then usually get out a frozen ready-meal. For her part, the usually down-to-earth Duchess of Cambridge should concentrate on cooking up a  strategy to avoid being seen as Three Kitchens Kate.","New kitchen will be installed at the couple's country mansion in Norfolk .

"The son of Cleveland kidnapper Ariel Castro today described the severe beatings he received when he was a child and expressed relief that his father will never be able to hurt anyone again. Anthony Castro appeared on the Today show this morning, a few days after his rapist father accepted a plea deal which will see him spend the rest of his life in prison for the kidnap and repeated sexual assault of three women. He said: 'I cannot express how happy I am that my father will never be able to hurt anyone again. Behind bars is where he belongs for the rest of his life. I have absolutely nothing to say to him. 'What he did still haunts me. I have the same name as him and when I look in the mirror I see the resemblance and I think about what he did and how horrible it is and I am overcome with that.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Anthony Castro said: 'I cannot express how happy I am that my father will never be able to hurt anyone again. I have absolutely nothing to say to him' Speaking out: Anthony appeared on the Today show this morning a few days after his rapist father accepted a plea deal which will see him spend the rest of his life in prison . Describing his upbringing at the hands of his father, he said: 'He was incredibly strict, he had a temper. I mean he wasn't a monster 24/7 but if you crossed him there would be consequences' Anthony said: 'He's been lying to his family for the past ten, 11 years at every possible turn. I have no trust in him. I can't see myself going to visit him and giving him the opportunity to face me and lie to me again' Describing his upbringing at the hands of his father, who on Friday blamed porn and child abuse on his sickening crimes, he said: 'He was incredibly strict, he had a temper. I mean he wasn't a monster 24/7 but if you crossed him there would be consequences - more often than not they were physical. 'I would cry myself to sleep because my legs were covered in welts from his belt and I had to watch my mom get beat up. No one should ever have to see their mom crumpled in a heap on the floor beaten.' By accepting the deal on Friday, Castro escaped the death penalty and withdrew his previous not guilty pleas in all 977 counts against him. It also means his three victims Amanda Berry, Michelle Knight and Gina DeJesus will not have to testify about their more than ten-year ordeal in front of a jury. Anthony Castro told the Today show the fact his father will never see the light of day again is justice for his mother, who would have turned 50 this week. He also said he has no plans to go and see his father in jail. 'He’s been lying to his family for the past ten, 11 years at every possible turn. I have no trust in him,' he said. 'I can’t see myself going to visit him and giving him the opportunity to face me and lie to me again.' In a MailOnline exclusive after Castro's three victims were freed, Anthony revealed his dad padlocked the doors leading to his basement, his attic and his garage and never allowed his family inside. 'The house . was always locked,' Anthony said. 'There were places we could . never go. There were locks on the basement. Locks on the attic. Locks . on the garage.' Among his infrequent contact with his father one conversation particularly stood out in his mind that occurred around mid-April, when Castro asked him whether he thought police would ever find Amanda Berry. When Anthony said he thought Berry was likely dead because she had been missing so long, Ariel responded: 'Really? You think so?' On Saturday, Amanda Berry made a surprise . appearance at the day-long concert RoverFest in Cleveland, walking on stage with her family and waving at the cheering crowd . before reemerging later again to join rapper Nelly. Wearing . sunglasses and dressed in jeans and a black T-shirt, Berry smiled . broadly while acknowledging the applause, but she didn't address the . crowd. The announcer called for 'a bigger round . of applause and cheer...than any of the acts that are here' and said . after she arrived on stage: 'I told her she had a little bit of time to . make up on the partying and you guys could help her out tonight'. Grooving: Yesterday was Amanda Berry's first public outing since her escape as she rocked it out with rapper Nelly and a friend on stage . Ariel Castro has pleaded guilty to 937 counts, including kidnapping, rape, assault and aggravated murder and is due to be sentenced on Thursday . Guilty: Under the plea deal, Castro, 53, will spend the rest of his life behind bars plus 1,000 years, without the possibility of parole . Castro said at his hearing: 'There . are some things I do not comprehend because of my sexual problems . throughout the years. But I trust my lawyers and I understand my rights . and the sentence' All three victims - Amanda Berry, Michelle Knight and Gina DeJesus - appeared in a video in early July thanking the local community for its support . On Friday, the . judge asked Castro if he understood that he would die in prison and there . would never be a possibility he would be released. He replied: 'I do understand that and I said because of the sex crimes I knew I would have the book thrown at me. 'There . are some things I do not comprehend because of my sexual problems . throughout the years. But I trust my lawyers and I understand my rights . and the sentence.' He said he read and signed the plea deal and understood it though 'my addiction to pornography and my sexual problem has taken a toll on my mind' that sometimes caused problems with comprehension. Offering some form of an explanation for his despicable crimes, he said: 'I was a victim as a child and it just kept going.' The judge cut him off and told him to save his story for his sentencing hearing. The 53-year-old spoke clearly and intelligibly, answering all the judges questions with clarity. This is in stark contrast to his previous appearances when he has kept his head down, closed his eyes and refused to interact. Plea Deal: Ariel Castro, 53, walks into the court room with his head down for a pre-trial hearing on charges including rape, kidnapping and murder in Cleveland, Ohio July 24, 2013 . Prosecutors said if evidence of additional crimes came to light, Castro could still be indicted on future charges that included the death penalty. Castro's . lawyers have said for weeks that they would consider an agreement under . which the former Cleveland school bus driver would plead guilty to some . charges in return for his life. Castro, . 53, has been charged with 977 counts including kidnapping and repeated . rape. He has also been charged with murder under a fetal homicide law . for allegedly forcing one of the women to miscarry. Gina . DeJesus, 23, Michelle Knight, 32, and Amanda Berry, 27 were freed from . Castro's home in a rundown area of Cleveland in May. The three women disappeared separately between 2002 and 2004, when they were 14, 16 and 20 years old. Each said they had accepted a ride from Castro, who remained friends with the family of one of the women and even attended vigils over the years marking her disappearance. The house will be torn down, it was revealed last week.","Anthony Castro said he has no intention of visiting his father in prison 'where he belongs'

"Members of Fee Welch's family have been trying to get rid of Sadi the doll for 40 years. But, mysteriously, every time she is about to be thrown out something happens and she ends up sticking around. Mrs Welch, from Rockhampton in Queensland, had forgotten the Chucky-like doll was in her house until three weeks ago when she was cleaning out her wardrobe with a friend. Fee Welch, from Rockhampton in Queensland, found Sadi the doll in her wardrobe three weeks ago. The doll has had a strange power over her family for 40 years and none of them could ever throw it away . As soon Mrs Welch unwrapped her out of her packing plastic, her whole family got sick. 'It’s a bit weird,' she told Daily Mail Australia. Mrs Welch, 37, was going to throw Sadi away but her husband found her in the bin and wouldn't let her throw the 'cute' doll away. 'The strange thing is my mum did exactly the same thing years ago, she found her in an old box and went to chuck her out,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'But my dad stopped her and said ""What are you throwing her out for, she's cute!"" 'It's weird, the men like her.' Mrs Welch isn't sure what it is about Sadi that provokes such an extreme reaction in people. Last week she posted a picture of the doll onto a local 'buy, swap and sell' Facebook page to see if anyone ever seen anything similar and the post got so much attention it crashed the page and had to be taken down. As soon Mrs Welch unwrapped her out of her packing plastic, her whole family got sick . 'The admin staff had to delete it because it was clogging the site up and it caused a lot of problems,' she said. 'They said there were over 400 comments. 'People were saying things like ""It looks like it belongs in the horror movie Chucky"", ""Get it out of your house"" and ""Take all the arms and legs off it and burn it"".' Sadi first came into the family when Mrs Welch's mother bought her as a gift for her sister at a small toy shop in Biloela in central Queensland about 40 years ago. At some point Mrs Welch's parents packed it up and she isn't exactly sure how it ended up in her home. ""It looks like it belongs in the horror movie Chucky"" - the doll got so many comments on a buy, swap and sell page on Facebook that it crashed the page and had to be taken down . Sadi first came into the family when Mrs Welch's mother bought her as a gift for her sister at a small toy shop in Biloela in central Queensland . Since getting unpacked Sadi has taken up a permanent position on an old chair in the lounge room. 'I'm actually starting to warm up to her, even though she looks like a little freak,' Mrs Welch said. Mrs Welch said her 13-year-old son hates it but her six-year-old daughter is curious. 'My daughter just said it's weird, but I found her the other day changing her clothes and playing with her,' she said. 'My dog doesn't like her, he barks at her.' Since getting unpacked Sadi has taken up a permanent position on an old chair in the lounge room . Mrs Welch has been told Sadi could be worth as much as $2000 but she thinks she would struggle to let her go. 'I think with all this hype and stuff I don't think I've got the heart to throw it out,' she said. Even though the doll has creepy greyish skin and spiky black hair she doesn't think it is possessed. 'I don't think she's haunted I just think she's got a bit of a soul,' she said. 'She comes across like she's spooky and a lot of people are scared by her but deep down I think she just wants to be loved.'","Sadi, an the evil-looking doll, has a strange hold on Fee Welch's family .

"The son of a man killed in the 7/7 London bombings has sued his mother after she spent his entire £50,000 compensation. Adam Gray was just 11 when his father Richard died in the suicide bomb attack near Aldgate station on July 7, 2005. The Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority gave his mother, Louise, £250,000, Adam £50,000, and £100,000 to his sister, who did not wish to be identified. Scroll down for video . Adam Gray, pictured, sued his mother, Louise, after she spent all of his 7/7 compensation payout . When Mr Gray reached 18 he was given the money, but asked his mother to look after it for him until he was older. However, less than two years later she admitted she has spent every penny. She allegedly squandered it on shopping sprees, luxury clothes, top restaurants and redecorating her home and garden in Ipswich. When his mother failed to repay the money, Mr Gray, 20, took her to court – and a judge at Northampton County Court has now awarded him £43,750. Mrs Gray is appealing the ruling. ‘I feel sick it had to happen,’ said Mr Gray. ‘Not only have I lost my beloved dad in the most tragic circumstances but I’ve lost my mother too. Finding out my dad had died was unimaginable. In that moment my life changed for ever. Louise Gray, pictured right, met the Queen at a St Paul's Cathedral memorial service for victims and survivors of the London terrorist attacks . The scene as emergency services attend Aldgate tube station in east London on July 7, 2005 . ‘My mum lost her husband, which will have a big effect on somebody, but she is a grown woman who took money her son entrusted her with.’ His father, a 41-year-old tax expert, was one of seven passengers murdered on a Circle Line train by Bradford-born bomber Shehzad Tanweer. The 7/7 suicide attacks on packed Tube trains and a bus killed 52 people and injured 700 more – the UK’s worst ever terrorist attack. Richard Gray, 41, died in the  London terrorist bombing at Aldgate station in 2005 . Mrs Gray later met the Queen at a St Paul’s Cathedral memorial service for victims and survivors. Mr Gray blames the large compensation payout on changing his mother’s personality. She quit her job as a carer and went on spending sprees that included five new cars, seven chihuahuas and a hot tub. ‘After my father died she became a lavish spender,’ he told the People. ‘Most people would be excited by a life-changing amount of money – I was scared of it. When she agreed to look after it, I thought it was in safe hands.’ It was only when he asked for some money to fund a move to London for an apprenticeship that Mrs Gray confessed she had spent it. ‘Naturally, I trusted her because she was my mother. Trying to understand how my mother could do it with such ease is difficult. And to think she spent it on materialist rubbish is very hurtful.’ Mrs Gray said she begged her son to forgive her. She said: ‘It’s true that I spent his money. I didn’t spend it on all the fancy things – that came before, when I had the compensation for my partner. ‘It’s all a mess. I’ve said sorry to my son over and over again but he won’t listen to me. He’s still my son so I want to talk to him and explain. ‘The judge says I have to pay it all back straight away but I can’t, so that’s why I’m appealing.’","Adam Gray was 11 when father Richard died in London bombings in 2005 .

The spokesman said: 'He has a tent, a mobile phone with batteries and food and water so he could spend at least five days up there. 'Knowing Martin he will want to stay up longer. It's almost a competition for him. 'It will take a lot for him to come down - probably it will take Chris Grayling to come and actually speak to him.'

"'Grooming': Sir Jimmy Savile was being investigated by Newsnight over claims he abused teenage girls in the 1970s . The BBC shelved a Newsnight investigation into allegations that Sir Jimmy Savile sexually abused teenage girls at its studios, it has been revealed. The current affairs show was looking into a woman's claim that the late TV star molested her when she was 14 or 15, in his dressing rooms at a recording of 1970s show Clunk Click. Newsnight then spoke to several other women who said Savile exploited his role as presenter on the hit programme to groom and abuse girls. They also heard claims that two other - living - celebrities abused girls at BBC Television Centre in the 1970s, according to The Oldie magazine. A Newsnight report was due to be screened in December, two months after Savile's death, but was pulled by bosses. That month, the BBC broadcast two tribute programmes celebrating Savile's career presenting popular shows including Jim'll Fix It and Top of the Pops. The Corporation has now been accused of attempting to cover up the allegations in an effort to protect its own reputation. A BBC News source told the Daily Telegraph: 'The extreme nature of the claims about Savile meant that the Newsnight report was going to seriously compromise the lavish BBC tributes scheduled to run later the same month. 'The allegations directly involved the BBC, in that the woman who gave the interview said she and others were abused by Savile on BBC premises.' Serious allegations: Savile is accused of abusing teenage girls in his dressing room at BBC Television Centre, pictured . Emerging secrets: Savile died just two months ago after a long and illustrious career as radio DJ and TV presenter . All the women making the allegations . attended Duncroft Approved School in Staines, Surrey, which Savile . visited on regular occasions. Georgina Ray is seeking a DNA test to prove she is Sir Jimmy's daughter . Two said Savile took them for drives in his car and gave them gifts of cigarettes, records, money and places in the Clunk Click audience, in exchange for 'sexual favours'. One of the women, now in her 50s, is said to have agreed to waive her anonymity to speak to Newsnight on camera. Surrey Police received a complaint five years ago from a woman who said Savile indecently assaulted her in the 1970s when she was a pupil at Duncroft. Her allegation was investigated but no further action taken. The police have not been contacted by the BBC regarding the latest claims. The BBC has denied the claims. Peter Rippon, Newsnight Editor, said: . 'It is absolutely untrue that the Newsnight investigation was dropped . for anything other than editorial reasons. 'We have been very clear from the . start that the piece was not broadcast because the story we were . pursuing could not be substantiated. 'To say otherwise is false and very . damaging to the BBC and individuals. To allege that we are withholding . evidence from the police is also damaging and false. The notion that . internal pressure was applied appears to be a malicious rumour'. A BBC spokesman said: 'Any suggestion that a story was dropped for anything other than editorial reasons is completely untrue. The BBC gathers information on hundreds of stories and not all make it to air. In this case the angle we were pursuing could not be substantiated.' BBC . director-general Mark Thompson is said to have heard that the . investigation was taking place, but to have played no role in its being . shelved. Savile - a . long-standing BBC television and radio star - died aged 84 in October, . but now his reputation looks in danger of permanent damage. Clunk . Click was his first solo series, following his campaign to get the . nation using seatbelts, entitled 'Clunk click every trip.' Family television: Savile in his heyday on Jim'll Fix It, left, and on Top of The Pops, right . Distressed friends and family of the former broadcaster last month accused Newsnight of ‘muckraking’. Savile's friend of 30 years, Stephen Purdew, helped organise the funeral for the TV legend, who also raised £40million for charity during his career. Mr Purdew said: ‘These are allegations from 40 years ago. He’s not even alive to defend himself. Sir Jim was a great man, a legend who should be remembered for all the wonderful things he did for other people.’ Niece Janet Humble said: ‘It looks like muckraking. As a family we just wish Sir Jim could be left to rest in peace. He did more good than bad in his life and how many celebrities can say that?’ Sir Jimmy started his working life as a miner before running a series of clubs and working as a wrestler and then a DJ. He died at home in Leeds on October 29 last year, two days before his 85th birthday. Popular: Savile drew tributes from important political figures in Leeds, pictured, as well as heartfelt words from royals .

"Not for a second was Saido Berahino neglecting to celebrate this one. A goal late on to win a game that had been drifting to a stale draw against a relegation rival is enough to make even the most professional of strikers smile. Tony Pulis wants to keep hold of the England Under-21 international this window and little wonder. He was man of the match by a distance here, the only player on the pitch who bore a cutting edge. Twelve minutes from the end his razor finish brought Pulis victory on his first league match in charge of West Bromwich Albion.

Referee: Neil Swarbrick . Attendance: 24,818 . Saido Berahino's 77th-minute winner for West Brom. CLICK HERE for more from Sportsmail's brilliant Match Zone. Ahmed Elmohamady needlessly passed the ball back to goalkeeper Allan McGregor, who picked up instinctively. Referee Neil Swarbrick awarded an indirect free-kick eight yards out on the angle. Substitute Victor Anichebe touched the ball and despite four onrushing Hull players and two more on the line, Berahino’s low shot found the back of the net. Four times he declined to show delight when scoring against Gateshead last weekend. Not a bit of it here. Arms out wide, flapping gleefully, he ran to the corner to share the moment with Albion fans. West Brom are up to 14th with this win, Hull down to 17th, out of the relegation zone on goal difference. Pulis had emerged in customary tracksuit garb; navy baseball cap pulled over his head, gleaming white trainers on his feet. His clothing was no shock, but some names in his team raised eyebrows. Chris Baird, Claudio Yacob and Brown Ideye all started in a 4-4-2 formation. Stephane Sessegnon (left) of West Bromwich Albion holds off James Chester of Hull City off the ball . Tony Pulis watches on in his first Premier League match in charge of West Brom on Saturday at the Hawthorns . West Bromwich Albion's Gareth McAuley (left) and Hull City's Abel Hernandez battle for the ball . Club-record signing Ideye produced another performance that made his £9million price tag beggar belief. There was the lack of pace to reach an early Chris Brunt pass, the absence of strength to hold up play. But worse came three minutes before the interval. Andre Wisdom fed Berahino, whose deft first-time touch released Ideye clean through. A glorious chance, he looked anything but confident, a rabbit in headlights, and scuffed his shot horribly wide. Pulis let out an agonised cry as he swirled away and adjusted his cap, resisting the temptation to throw it to the ground. By this point Hull’s attack had been decimated, Nikica Jelavic and Abel Hernandez forced off within minutes of each other. Hernandez held his groin after stretching for the ball, Jelavic strapped ice to his knee when on the bench. Tom Ince and Robbie Brady were sent on by Steve Bruce, who now has an injury list of eight players, including forwards Sone Aluko and Gaston Ramirez. Had either of Bruce’s first-choice attackers been on you sense Hull may have snatched this. In the 73rd minute Brady delivered an excellent cross than Ince failed to meet with any conviction. Never been one for headers it must be said. Berahino was always the likeliest to break the deadlock. In the first half he sent a close-range shot wide, tested McGregor from further out, and wriggled his way into an opening before firing low to bring another save from the Hull goalkeeper. But, as he explained after the fallout from his glum reaction to that FA Cup haul, goals are his occupation. Twelve minutes from time it was job done.

"Europe is set to suffer more severe droughts due to climate change and increased water use, scientists have warned. By the end of the century, southern Europe in particular will have 80 per cent more droughts than at present. New research by the European Commission predicts that water shortages will be made worse by population growth and increased demand. New research by the European Commission predicts that water shortages will be made worse by population growth and increased demand. It said that in the past 30 years, dry spells have cost Europe over ¿100billion (or £83billion) The researchers predicted that southern Europe will probably be worst hit. Stream and river minimum flow levels . could fall by as much as 40 per cent and periods of drought might . increase up to 80 per cent in the Iberian Peninsula, the south of France, . Italy and the Balkans. Scientists have predicted that dry . spells will be longer and more frequent and warned that the warming . projected for Europe - particularly in its southern regions - is even . stronger. Over the Iberian Peninsula, the average temperature is predicted to increase by up to 5°C by the end of this century. Drought can have a serious economic and social impact and is thought to have cost Europe over €100billion (or £83billion) in the past three decades alone. Researchers used computer models to predict which parts of Europe could be worst hit by increasing temperatures and intensive water consumption. Giovanni Forzieri, a researcher in climate risk at the European Commission's Climate Research Centre said: ‘Our research shows that many river basins, especially in southern parts of Europe, are likely to become more prone to periods of reduced water supply due to climate change. ‘An increasing demand for water, following a growing population and intensive use of water for irrigation and industry, will result in even stronger reductions in river flow levels.’ They analysed climate and hydrological models of different scenarios stretching to the year 2100. Luc Feyen, a hydrologist at the European Commission said: ‘Scenarios are narratives of possible evolutions - up to 2100 in this study - of our society that we use to quantify future greenhouse gas emissions and water consumption by different sectors. Stream and river minimum flow levels could fall by as much as 40 per cent and periods of drought might increase up to 80 per cent in the Iberian Peninsula (Granada is pictured), south of France, Italy and the Balkans . ‘Climate and water-use models then translate the greenhouse gas concentrations and water requirement into future climate and water consumption projections.’ The scientists used these projected conditions to make a hydrological model of all river basins in Europe that mimics the distribution and flow of water. They found that parts of Southern Europe will be the most affected. Stream and river minimum flow levels could fall by as much as 40 per cent and periods of drought might increase up to 80 per cent in the Iberian Peninsula, south of France, Italy and the Balkans. The research, published in the journal Hydrology and Earth System Sciences also found that average global temperatures will increase by up to 3.4°C by 2100. Scientists have predicted that dry spells will be longer and more frequent and warned that the warming projected for Europe - particularly in its southern regions - is even stronger. 'Over the Iberian Peninsula, for example, summer mean temperature is projected to increase by up to 5°C by the end of this century,' Dr Feyen added.","New research by the European Commission .

"In yet another jab to NBC's Olympics coverage, the network has been accused of manufacturing unnecessary suspense for the women's gymnastics final - which was arguably not even close. The U.S. dominated the Russian team, which includes 2011 world champion Ksenia Afanaseva, and Team USA cruised to its first gold medal since 1996 by a five-point margin. It wasn’t exactly as tight a match as TV viewers were led to believe. In fact, it was practically a runaway for the U.S. over a Russian team that struggled throughout the final.

What the network did not show was . Afanaseva's floor exercise, complete with a cringe-worthy stumble that demolished any hope of Russia taking home gold. The botched landing during Afanaseva's floor exercise sparked cries of despair among her teammates and and led the squad to walk away in tears. As Deadspin.com’s Timothy Burke explained: 'NBC also cleverly avoided showing the standings upon skipping ahead to the U.S. rotation, with [commentator] Al Trautwig asking whether the U.S. ""can deliver a knockout blow"" and casting doubt upon American chances by showing Aly Raisman missing a tumble landing during warmups.' Deadspin’s story included a BBC video that showed the Afanaseva's full performance. Tears: Afanaseva could not control her emotions as she waited to hear her score after the floor exercise . Second place: Team Russia wound up taking the silver medal after being dominated by the U.S. Russia's woes began on the  balance . beam, as Aliya Mustafina swayed and wobbled during her performance and . Viktoria Komova almost stepped on the judges on her dismount. 'We did everything we could,' Komova said. With the U.S. leading before the floor . exercise - the final event - Russia needed two things to happen: A) The . U.S. needed to make mistakes and B) Russia had to be flawless. Unfortunately for Russia, the opposite occurred. The U.S., led by team captain Raisman was at her best on the floor, graceful in her tumbles and sticking the final landing.

Jordyn Wieber, Gabrielle Douglas, Kyla Ross, and Miss Raisman. Romania took the bronze. While some teenagers might have found the pressure tough to bear on the world stage, the Americans revelled in it.

'We knew we could do it. We just had to pull out all the stops,' said Miss Raisman. Their achievement earned the 'Fab . Five' their place in history, and even President Obama congratulated the . five members of the U.S. women's gymnastics team on Wednesday on their . Olympic victory - and he had some questions about just how they managed . to pull off their gold medal performances. 'I told these young ladies as I was . congratulating them, how do you not bust your head every time you're on . that little balance beam?' Obama said. 'I couldn't walk across that . balance beam.' Obama telephoned the gymnastics team from Air Force One as he traveled from Washington to Ohio for campaign events.

Guy Adams, who writes for The Independent, lost his account after the network complained he tweeted the email address of NBC Olympics president Gary Zenkel so viewers could 'tell him what you think.' Adams' account was later reinstated. There was also outrage over NBC's decision to cut a tribute for the victims of the London 2005 terrorist bombings from its Olympics Opening Ceremony coverage on Friday. The network said it did not air the tribute because it wasn't tailored for the U.S. audience - and aired a Ryan Seacrest interview with iconic swimmer Michael Phelps instead.","NBC charged with leaving out Russian gymnast Ksenia Afanaseva's key floor exercise fall, which contributed to the team's loss to U.S.

"Britain's biggest lottery winners have answered a mother's plea for help by donating almost £30,000 to pay for her three-year-old daughter to have an operation to help her walk. Chris and Colin Weir, who scooped a record £161million Euromillions jackpot in July 2011, dipped into their huge fortune to pay for spastic diplegic cerebral palsy sufferer Skye Swinton to pay for revolutionary surgery. The pair wrote a cheque after Skye's desperate mother Ruth, 38, wrote to the couple asking for help. Scroll down for video . Skye Swinton, 3, from Cheltenham pictured with her parents John and Ruth who have raised £40k for a life changing operation to help their daughter walk with the help of record Euromillions winners Colin and Chris Weir . Little Skye, pictured, who was born 13 weeks prematurely and suffers from spastic diplegic cerebral palsy, has spent much of her life in a wheelchair . She had expected her letter to be 'politely binned' but was stunned when she received a phone call telling her that the pair, from Largs in North Ayrshire, were happy to donate £28,000. Ecstatic Ruth, a former teacher and now full-time carer to Skye, said: 'It is just unbelievable and we are so delighted. 'I sent the letter months ago and so I just thought it would have been politely binned, so to get the phone call with the news was just fantastic. Born 13 weeks early and weighing a tiny 1lb 15oz, Skye's condition has left her confined to a wheelchair for much of her life. She is unsteady on her feet and unable to go any distance without tiring and dreams of walking and running like other children. Skye's family and friends managed to raise £12,000 towards their target of £40,000 but were still £28,000 short until Ruth's heartfelt letter persuaded generous Chris and Colin to part with the remainder of the cash. Skye's mother Ruth had written a desperate letter to Colin and Chris Weir asking for their help to raise £40,000 for her daughter's surgery . It is hoped that Skye, from Cheltenham Gloucestershire, will undergo delicate surgery - which involves partially cutting the nerve roots where they join the spinal cord - next summer pending vital medical assessments. An initial assessment, scans and x-rays will cost the family £800, with the operation priced at £23,500 and subsequent physiotherapy, expected to last two years, will cost around £15,000. Without surgery now, the youngster would need major orthopaedic surgery by the time she turns 10 or 11. Ruth, who is married to Skye's father John, also 38, said: 'There are still a number of medical hurdles to overcome, but now that we have raised the money we need, we can now concentrate on helping Skye reach her full potential. 'We were absolutely blown away with the support we've had, and the generosity we have been shown.' The family will continue fundraising in aid of Skye and will use the additional money to help her during her rehabilitation with planned fundraising events still to go ahead. In a statement, Mr and Mrs Weir said: 'Skye faces many challenges in the next year and she needs her mum and dad to be focused on her. That's why we've given a donation. 'Without the additional worry and pressure of fundraising, their time can be spent on Skye.' Mr and Mrs Weir have shown enormous generosity since winning their vast fortune. They donated their former £180,000 home to their neighbours after buying their new home and sponsored 15-year-old Scottish racing driver Gregor Ramsey in the European and Italian Formula 3 events. Mr Weir, a former Scottish TV cameraman, donated £750,000 to his local football team, Largs Thistle, to pay off some of the club's debt and improve facilities. Colin and Chris Weir, pictured celebrating their Euromillions win, donated £28,000 towards Skye's £40,000 operation . The pair's £161million jackpot win in July 2012 remains the largest single lottery win in the UK . In August the couple also donated a five-figure sum to buy a prosthetic limb for cancer victim Kieran Maxwell, 13, of Heighington, near Darlington. They also pledged £900,000 towards a new £1.2million multi-use sports arena in their home town and helped talented young artist Lee Craigmile pay his fees to study in Italy. Mr and Mrs Weir payed a seven figure sum to the Scottish National Party to help fund its campaign for independence from the rest of the UK. They have also personally enjoyed their winnings, applying for planning permission to build a luxury indoor swimming pool, jacuzzi and conservatory at their home. VIDEO: Celebrating in style!

"A Nevada man says he shot and killed Bigfoot in San Antonio, Texas, causing fury among Bigfoot fans who say it’s all a hoax. Rick Dyer, who runs a website called BigfootTracker.com and makes a living tracking the mythical creature, claims he is ‘going to go down in history as the best Bigfoot tracker in the world.’ However, he has not yet revealed the ape-man’s body to the public due to a contractual agreement with a documentary crew which allows them to release their film first, he says. The real Bigfoot? Rick Dyers says he took this image of Bigfoot on his cellphone before he shot the beast . Bigfoot hunter: Rick Dyers of Las Vegas, Nevada, says he shot and killed Bigfoot in San Antonio, Texas . ‘Bigfoot is 100 per cent real. There's no question about that,’ Dyer told KSAT.com during a recent Skype interview from his home in Las Vegas, Nevada. Dyer said the body is being kept in a warehouse in an undisclosed location in Nevada and told the news outlet that he has one eye-witness. Musky Allen, possibly a fake name, told KSAT that he was invited to view Bigfoot’s corpse. ‘What I saw was a sasquatch, and there's no question in my mind it was at one point a living creature,’ Allen said. ‘(The feet) were extremely wide from the center up to the toes and it had completely hair-covered feet. So much so, it was extremely hard to find the toes. I had to actually pull back some hair to see the toes.’ Rendition: Dyer has not yet revealed Bigfoots body to the public, he says, due to a contractual agreement with a documentary crew which allows them to release their film first . Eye-witness? 'It scared the hell outta me,' said one campsite resident who claims he saw Bigfoot before the ape-man was allegedly killed . Dyer claims he lured Bigfoot into a homeless campsite in the woods near Loop 1604 and Highway 151 in San Antonio and shot him. The first time he came to the site was in 2009, he says, after a homeless woman called 911 to report a Bigfoot sighting. The woman and her husband were living in a tent in the area when they allegedly reported seeing a ‘very large, hairy animal’ enter their campsite and take off with a deer carcass. ‘This thing was 75 feet away from me,’ the unidentified woman told a 911 dispatcher. ‘It smells awful and devoured a whole deer carcass and then took off and screamed, screeched, and took off across the street. I know you guys are going to think I'm crazy but I'm dead serious.’ Dyer says he saw Bigfoot behind a Home Depot when he came to the site in 2009, but was unable to catch him. This time around he says he nailed pork ribs to the side of the tree. ‘Low and behold, he came and started eating the pork ribs off the tree,’ Dyer said. ‘I have been all over the world searching for Bigfoot. I have moved my family to seven different states. I am dedicated,’ he added. 'No question': 'Bigfoot is 100 per cent real. There's no question about that,' Dyer told KSAT.com during a recent Skype interview from his home in Las Vegas, Nevada . Eye-witness? Musky Allen, possibly a fake name, said that he was invited to view Bigfoot¿s corpse . Skeptics are calling Dyer’s allegations a hoax, similar to previous Bigfoot-related claims he was unable to back up in 2008. Dyer and friends said they had the creature’s body at the time and even held a news conference to make the announcement. But the body was never revealed. 'Everyone should know by now that Dyer's latest ""Bigfoot in a freezer"" Part 2 stunt is another hoax,' Bigfoot Evidence, the 'World's Only 24/7 Bigfoot News Blog,' recently posted. Dyer says he will be vindicated this time around when the upcoming documentary film is released later this year. ‘Once this film comes out in late March or early April, then we're going to start releasing photos and then eventually the body,’ he said. ‘(Investors) have paid for all the necessary testing to prove that this is an unknown creature and not a man in a suit or a caveman or something. This is a Bigfoot.’ Not convinced: Skeptics are calling Dyer¿s allegations a hoax, similar to previous Bigfoot-related claims he was unable to back up in 2008 (Stock photo)","Rick Dyer claims he is ‘going to go down in history as the best Bigfoot tracker in the world .

"A Virginia Beach mother is furious and her community perplexed after her daughter is suspended from middle school for taking a razor blade from a fellow student who was harming himself and throwing it away. Adrionna Harris took the tiny X-ACTO blade from a boy last week and immediately threw it away and on Friday she reported the incident to administrators. Instead of applauding her heroics, administrators suspended the sixth grader and are even threatening expulsion. Shocking: Virginia Beach 6th grader Adrionna Harris briefly handled a razor blade in school as she snatched from a fellow student she says was trying to harm himself and threw it away. Now she's been suspended for 10 days . 'I was shocked and surprised. I was very shocked that a student would get suspended for saving another child,' Adrionna's mother Rachael Harris told WAVY. 'The school system over-reached absolutely.' Harris got nowhere when she called Bayside Middle School to understand the rationale behind her daughter's suspension. All she knew was that it was Adrionna's own admission that got her suspended, which has young Adrionna more than a little confused. 'I took the razor blade, and then I threw it away immediately…I didn’t carry it around the school…I didn’t use it against anyone…I threw it away,' she said. Adrionna's mother describes that . moment as a '9-1-1 situation' and says there jsut wasn't time for her . daughter to find a teacher. 'I . felt she did the  right thing,' said Ms.Harris. 'Under the . circumstances, she thought he would bleed out, as he was cutting . himself, and there was no teacher in sight.' 'The school system over-reached absolutely': Her mother Rachael Harris believes the school went too far in enforcing its zero tolerance policy . No answers: Adrionna's mother tried calling the school for days but they refused to return her calls. A reporter holds up an example of the X-Acto style blade at question in the case. The sitatuation felt so serious to Adrionna that even in retrospect she says she would do it all over again. 'Even if I got in trouble, it didn’t matter because I was helping him…I would do it again even if I got suspended, yes,' she said. After none of Ms. Harris's calls to the school were returned, the determined mother turned to her local NBC affiliate. When reporters began making calls themselves, school officials suddenly contacted the Harris. While Adrionna was originally slated to have to wait out her 10-day suspension before her case, and possible expulsion, were reviewed, they got a call to move the meeting up to Thursday. Rachael Harris hopes it will result in a reversal of the school's decision to punish her daughter. 'It is amazing. They are listening to us now…she should be back in school tomorrow and that would be fair,' she said. Once both Ms. Harris and their local news station were making calls, the school suddenly agreed to move up a meeting about Adrionna's potential expulsion to Thursday .","Adrionna Harris of Virginia Beach says she saw a boy harming himself, so she took away the blade and threw it away last week .

"A 19-year-old teen who allegedly beat up a Philadelphia park ranger who asked him and his friends to stop skateboarding was turned into police by his own mother. Curtis Tanner, of Pottstown, Pennsylvania, was arrested Tuesday after a video of the awful attack surfaced on YouTube on Saturday, showing the ranger being tackled to the ground and repeatedly kicked and punched. Police were able to identify Tanner from the video - as well as a 17-year-old suspect - and went to his house yesterday, but he was not home. When he returned, his mother called police, who came back to the house and arrested Tanner, according to Philly.com. Scroll down for video .

He reportedly told police he was worried he would lose his job if he did fight back. He suffered minor injured but was taken to hospital and is now recovering at home. Tanner and the second suspect - who cannot be identified because of his age - are expected to be charged with aggravated assault, simple assault, reckless endangerment and terroristic threats. A 6ABC News reporter caught up with Tanner on camera, and the teen admitted to the assault. 'If I had the chance, I would apologize to that guy. I lost my cool,' he told the station. Tanner claimed the ranger grabbed the arms of one of the friends he was skateboarding with. Arrested: Curtis Tanner - who has an extensive criminal record - was taken into custody on Tuesday .

An online search showed that Tanner, whose Facebook page lists him as a 2013 graduate of Pottstown High School, has been arrested multiple times before by the Pottstown Police. In October 2013, Tanner was arrested for robbery through force, receiving stolen property and other charges related to an August 30 incident. Tanner was sentenced to five years probation, which started June 5. After that, June 21, Philadelphia court documents show he was cited for disorderly conduct.

"It may take more than a campaign to stop Chelsea this season. Jose Mourinho has been charged by the FA for insinuating that referees were being influenced by the media and therefore not giving his team the benefit of the doubt in key decisions. And he was given further ‘evidence’ for his dossier when referee Roger East failed to give them a penalty for a Fabrico Coloccini handball. But whatever the FA rule, it will prove largely irrelevant in the long run. For Chelsea look to be the team most likely to take advantage of opponents’ weaknesses and forge ahead in the title race. VIDEO Scroll down for Sportsmail's Big Match Stats: Chelsea 2-0 Newcastle United . Oscar celebrates giving Chelsea the lead in their Premier League game against Newcastle United on Saturday afternoon . The Brazilian passed the Blues ahead with the minimum of fuss at Stamford Bridge when unmarked towards the back post .

Chelsea (4-2-3-1): Cech 7; Ivanovic 6.5, Zouma 6, Terry 5, Azpilicueta 6 (Filipe Luis 37 6); Matic 6, Fabregas 6; Willian 6.5, Oscar 7.5 (Ramires 78), Hazard 6.5; Costa 6.5 (Remy 84).

Diego Costa scored Chelsea's second - click here for our Match Zone service . They were not scintillating, though Eden Hazard’s chipped pass and Oscar’s flick for Diego Costa’s goal will bear multiple replays. At times, however, Newcastle stretched them and even bettered them. Yet while Manchester City were dropping points against Everton, Chelsea were ruthlessly exploiting mistakes. Sterner tests lie ahead but this is a Newcastle team who beat them a month ago, so this victory was an important step on the way to proving their resilience. Mourinho was again not speaking publicly, his FA charge given as the reason, so it was left to his assistant Steve Holland to explain how the improvement had been obtained at half time. ‘Jose was very clear to the players what he wanted from them to improve and the players did that, they responded very well,’ he said. ‘Jose wanted the team to press further up the pitch and to be mentally more aggressive and assertive with or without the ball and to play at a quicker tempo and they did that.’ This may be John Carver’s last match in charge — a draw and two defeats hardly represents compelling credentials since Alan Pardew’s departure — with Remi Garde in discussion with the club, but at least his side went down fighting after the debacle of last Saturday’s FA Cup defeat when they were booed by their own fans. And if Garde is to be installed he will at least find a compatriot who finally appears up for the fight. Remy Cabella had made 21 appearances for Newcastle prior to this game and, for £12million, he has produced zero goals thus far. And yet, in the first half, he was unrecognisable.

Costa gestures during the first half of a game the Magpies took to the Premier League leaders . Paul Dummett tries to wriggle free of the tireless Costa, who fought back and did the dirty work for his team . John Terry suffered but so too did Cesar Azipilicueta, with two of the most consistent defenders so far this season made to look ordinary. The Spaniard was withdrawn in the 37th minute because of a groin injury but Cabella had already made it a sufficiently miserable afternoon for the left back to be grateful for small mercies. Cabella had slalomed his way past three players in the 20th minute with a burst of pace unseen so far and Terry deflected his shot wide; later he would skip past Terry and only a fine save from Petr Cech prevented him opening the scoring. ‘He has been a little bit frustrating but I think he showed his value today,’ said Carver. ‘He was outstanding in possession and every time he tried to break, someone was clipping him to stop his momentum. He added the other side of the game, which was hard work. ‘He has now set a standard and I told him in front of everybody, “It’s no good you just doing that on a one-off. If you’re not prepared to do it every week, you’ll be sitting with me and Stoney [Steve Stone] on the bench”. But if he performs like that he could get our fans on the edge of the seat —because he had me on the edge of mine today.’ Cabella even survived a strong arm in the face from Nemanja Matic in the 71st minute, which saw a yellow card for the Serbian but which might have been red. And it was not just Cabella. Cech, deputising for Thibaut Courtois, who has an injured thumb but was deemed fit enough for the bench, had to save smartly from Yoan Gouffran’s 22nd-minute free-kick, while Moussa Sissoko cut inside with Terry again exposed and hit a shot that struck the post .

Branislav Ivanovic tussles with the lively Perez as Chelsea sought to dominate the second half . Yoan Gouffran holds onto the post after he missed a glaring opportunity for Carver's side . So it was all the more galling for Carver’s team when Chelsea, having threatened very little, were presented with a chance to take the lead. Willian was the opportunist, taking a quick short corner which out-witted Coloccini and found Branislav Ivanovic. With Newcastle unprepared, it was a relatively easy task for the Bulgarian to find Oscar at the far post for a simple finish in the 43rd minute. ‘It was very frustrating — just before half-time we switched off, like we did against Leicester,’ said Carver. ‘I made a big point of it and it happened again.’ It was enough to give Chelsea the foundation they needed. They started the second half with an intent and incisiveness which had been missing in the opening 45 minutes. And for those who enjoy the conspiracy theory, there was fuel to fire Mourinho’s talk of a campaign when Costa crossed the ball 10 minutes into the restart only for Coloccini’s out-stretched hand to prevent it reaching danger. It was a penalty and Costa and Cesc Fabregas protested furiously. There was no lingering sense of injustice, however, as within four minutes Chelsea had extended their lead. Hazard had Newcastle mesmerised as he chipped a ball in for Oscar. The Brazilian executed an exquisite flick back to Costa, who cut inside to score his 15th goal of the season. ‘That was much more like the Chelsea the supporters would be used to,’ said Holland. Costa might have made it 3-0 in the 79th minute, beating each member of Newcastle’s back four before allowing his wayward shot to be deflected wide by Coloccini. Chelsea may not invincible this season, as Newcastle proved but a month ago. But give them a break and you are unlikely to recover.","Oscar gave Chelsea a lead in the 43rd minute of their Premier League game against Newcastle .

"Military-style boot camps have been set up across China in a bid to help wean increasing numbers of teenagers off their addiction to the internet. With growing numbers of young people in China developing online dependencies, parents are increasingly putting their trust in the methods used in the boot camps to tackle the issue. As many as 250 camps have been set up across the country, with many requiring teenagers, closely supervised by former soldiers, to dress in army uniforms and practice drills in locked dormitories.

Teenagers are believed to be increasingly turning to playing online games to escape the competitive pressures in their lives. In 2007, the China Communist Youth League said more than 17 per cent of its members aged 13 to 17 had an online dependency, The Telegraph reported in January this year. One teenager, who gave only his surname, Wang, told Reuters: 'My parents wanted me to study at home all day, and I was not allowed to play outside.' He said his response was to retreat to the internet, spending large amounts of time playing his favourite online shooting game. In one instance, he said, he played for three days straight, during which time he slept for less than an hour. He said: 'As I became addicted to the game, my school grades tumbled. But I gained another feeling of achievement by advancing to the next level in the game.'

Tao Ran, a psychologist who founded an 'education centre' for those addicted to the internet, told Reuters that teenagers such as Wang can lose their confidence and become vulnerable to depression and anxiety if they do not reach the aspirations their parents have for them. Wang struggled through two years before he was diagnosed with 'Internet Addiction Disorder' and sent to the Qide Education Centre in the Chinese capital, Beijing. Up to 70 per cent of the 110 teenagers being treated at the Beijing centre suffer from problems caused by overuse of the internet, mostly online games. Teachers and military instructors aim to use military instruction to instil habits of discipline.

'Their obsession with the internet has harmed their health and they end up losing their ability to participate in a normal life.' Students are required to do cleaning and washing and take turns helping to cook meals. 'Education and living in a military environment makes them more disciplined and restores their ability to live a normal life,' said Xing.

"Samantha Power, the newly appointed US ambassador to the UN, has spent her career urging international intervention in cases of genocide. The gassing of hundreds of Syrians should have been a perfect opportunity to speak out and force quick action. However, the Irish-born academic was nowhere to be seen and failed to attend an emergency UN Security Council meeting during the week. Samantha Power, the American ambassador to the United Nations, says that, if the United States decides to strike in Syria, it will not be going alone . Close ties: Before being appointed to the United Nations, she worked on the National Security Council and as a part of President Obama's re-election campaign (seen here in June) 'Ambassador Power is on a long planned personal trip,' National Security Council spokeswoman Bernadette Meehan confirmed. 'She has full communications and has been fully engaged on all national security issues.' Guest speaker: Miss Power's husband Cass Sunstein . State . Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki confirmed in her press briefing on . Thursday that earlier in the week Ms Powers attended a National Security . Council meeting that President Obama called to deal with the crisis in . Egypt. Power was born in . Ireland and lived there until she was 9-years-old when she moved with . her family to Atlanta, Georgia. Her relatives still live in Ireland. CNN has now reported that she has come home and participated in National Security Council meetings remotely. Conservative commentators for Fox News called on Ms Power to reveal her location publicly, saying: . 'Just say where she is. It looks like she's just on vacation. If she is, . who cares? Everyone is in August. They should admit it,' Daily Caller . editor and Fox commentator Tucker Carlson said. 'I hope the new Ambassador has a really good reason for her absence. Secret trip for UN business? Good reasons I understand,' Fox host Greta Van Susteren wrote on her blog. While she would not have been able to fly back to the United States in time for the emergency meeting, a deputy attended in her place and she is reportedly staying briefed. Wednesday's attack in Syria is believed to have been caused by chemical weapons but it is not certain as United Nations weapons inspectors have not been allowed in the country. Death toll: Hundreds died in the alleged chemical attacks, including many women and children . The headcount from the attack- which appears to have included many women and children- is thought to be more than 100 people and all told more than 100,000 people have been killed in Syria since the start of the country's civil war.

"Manchester City's title aspirations were dealt a blow as they were held to a draw with Everton at Goodison Park. Fernandinho opened the scoring for City on 74 minutes, but the lead was short-lived with Steven Naismith pegging one back for the Toffees just four minutes later. Here, Dan King runs through how the players performed. Everton (4-2-3-1) Joel Robles - 7 . Not a keeper who inspires confidence but, in the main, his decision making was good and couldn't be faulted for City's goal . Seamus Coleman - 7 . Has been through a difficult spell but was much better here, defended well and cracked the bar with a left foot drive . John Stones - 8.5 . Will be a mainstay of England's defence in years to come, an impeccable performance and calming presence on the back four . Everton's Ross Barkley weaves his way between Fernandinho (left) and Fernando (right) at Goodison Park . Phil Jagielka - 7.5 . Had a goal chalked off but his most important contributions came at the other end. Some crucial tackles . Leighton Baines - 7 . Quiet in some aspects and a few free-kicks lacked direction but his delivery that provided the equaliser for Naismith was magnificent . Muhammed Besic - 6.5 . Frustrations threatened to boil over at times when he kept being penalised for robust challenges. Relentless workrate . Everton keeper Joel Robles smothers the loose ball as Samir Nasri bears down on goal . Gareth Barry - 7 . No doubt he misses the presence of James McCarthy but a reunion against his old employers saw him in a better light . Aiden McGeady - 5.5 . Struggling to replicate what he does in training on the big stage. Some good moments but not enough of an influence . Ross Barkley - 6 . Restored to his more favoured central position but found it difficult to make an impact; no shots on target . Steven Naismith - 7.5 . The most improved player in Everton's squad again illustrated his importance with prodigious work and well taken goal . Playmarker David Silva pulls the strings from midfield at Goodison Park . Romelu Lukaku -7.5 . Took confidence from his equaliser against West Ham, played well. Denied a goal by terrific save from Hart . SUBSTITUTES . Kevin Mirallas-  6.5 . Manchester City  (4-2-3-1) Joe Hart - 6 . One fine stop to deny Lukaku but questions must be asked over his role in letting Naismith beat him to the punch for the equaliser . Pablo Zabaleta - 7.5 . Brilliant tackle on Lukaku set the wheels in motion on the attack that led to City's goal. Ultra-reliable as ever . Everton's Seamus Coleman surges forward and has a crack at goal, but sees his effort go over the bar . Martin Demichelis - 7.5 . Once a figure of derision, now showing his class. Need to be at his best with his partner finding things so tough . Eliaquim Mangala - 5 . All over the place at times, bullied by Lukaku and finding the frenzy difficult to deal. Been a tough season for him . Gael Clichy - 5.5 . No standout contribution. Got forward at times but with little impact; defend reasonably well . Steven Jovetic is tugged back by Everton's John Stones as he makes a break down the middle of the park . Fernandinho - 6.5 . A key cog in the title winning side and had another telling influence. Didn't give Barkley any space to cause trouble . Fernando - 5.5 . Won't have been involved in too many games like this and found it all happening too quickly. No major impact . Jesús Navas -  6 . Fluffed a great chance when fed by his compatriot and led break for Fernandinho's goal but, again, not enough . Fernandinho opens the scoring with his second goal of the season on 74 minutes . David Silva - 8 . A joy to watch, had Everton in a panic every time he got possession. Played a different game to the others in laser blue . Samir Nasri- 6 . Has played well this season but this was not one of his most effective games; that said, he was involved in build-up to City's goal . Manchester City's lead is short-lived as Steven Naismith equalises minutes later with a header of his own . Stevan Jovetic - 5 .

"The Internal Revenue Service managed a wide-ranging program that singled out tea party groups for special scrutiny from its headquarters in Washington, D.C., according to bombshell documents released Wednesday by a watchdog organization. Judicial Watch, a center-right group that specializes in Freedom Of Information Act document requests and lawsuits, said it received a cache of papers from the IRS showing the depth of the Obama administration's involvement in what officials have previously called the work of a few 'rogue agents' in Cincinnati, Ohio. And letters from U.S. Sen. Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat, show his involvement in pressing the IRS to target mostly conservative organizations with cumbersome questionnaires seemingly calculated to slow down their applications for tax-exempt status in the middle of an election year. In one July 2010 email among IRS managers, a lawyer with the Exempt Organizations Technical unit in Washington wrote that his office was 'working the Tea party applications in coordination with Cincy.' Former IRS official Lois Lerner has been found in contempt of Congress for refusing to testify about the tea party targeting scheme, and her fingerprints are on some of the newly released emails . Tea party-linked conservative groups have turned their unfair treatment by the IRS into a national rallying cry, forcing the Obama White House and congressional Democrats to address the deepening scandal . 'We are developing a few applications here in DC and providing copies of our development letters with the agent to use as examples in the development of their cases,' wrote government attorney Steven Grodnitzky. He acknowledged that the flood of tax-exemption applications from tea party groups were considered part of a 'Sensitive Case Report' project, meaning that the IRS 'cannot resolve any of the cases without coordinating with Rob [Choi]' – who was then in charge of IRS 'rulings and agreements' in the agency's Washington, D.C. headquarters. Tax-exempt status allows social welfare groups to raise money without paying federal income taxes. The privilege is a highly sought-after perk among nonprofit campaign groups, including many that advocate political positions without endorsing candidates directly. Such 'electioneering' is strictly prohibited. Beginning in early 2010, less than a year before the midterm congressional elections that would see the tea party flex its biggest political muscles, the IRS slow-walked hundreds of the groups' applications for as many as three years, hampering their ability to communicate publicly and advocate positions on issues. Most liberal groups applying for the same status were swiftly approved, including one application from President Obama's half-brother, whose application was back-dated so he could claim tax advantages retroactively for a foundation he had set up in the name of their common father. Lois Lerner, who led the IRS's Exempt Organizations division while the scheme was in place, retired in late 2013 – but not before assuring her own agency that no one in her division had developed the criteria that determined which conservative groups were targeted for special scrutiny. On April 2, 2013, she emailed IRS investigators about a 'Be On the Lookout' (BOLO) list that was circulated agency-wide. That list, she claimed, 'only contained a brief reference to ""Organizations involved with the Tea Party movement"".' She also suggested that government employees in her Cincinnati subagency were not actively looking for ways to 'label cases as ""tea party” cases,' but had rules to follow. 'Do the applications specify/state ""tea party""?' she said one manager inquired about the proper yardstick to use. 'If not, how do we know [the] applicant is involved with the tea party movement?' Employees of one 'screening group manager' in Cincinnati, she said, reported that groups with 'Tea Party,' 'Patriots' or ’9/12 Project’ in their names qualified, along with groups that advocated against 'government spending, government debt and taxes,' those that would '[e]ducate the public through advocacy/legislative activities to make America a better place to live,' and those whose case files included statements 'that are critical of the how the country is being run.' That, however, runs counter to Grodnitzky's claim that managers in Washington, D.C. – not those in Cincinnati – were using test-cases to 'develop' the lengthy set of questions that tea party groups would later characterize as a deluge of harassment. The IRS is facing new levels of scrutiny and conservative outrage with the revelation of new emails showing that a program targeting tea party groups for special scrutiny was managed in Washington, D.C. Some items on multi-page questionnaires demanded the names of volunteers, membership lists, exhaustive archives from Twitter and Facebook, and even the identities of underage recipients of mentoring. Other emails show that she later asked the U.S. Department of Justice about the possibility of criminally prosecuting tax-exempt groups, notably those on the political right. Judicial Watch obtained the latest treasure trove of paperwork in an October 2013 lawsuit after the agency refused to turn over the documents four times earlier that year. 'These new . documents show that officials in the IRS headquarters were responsible . for the illegal delays of Tea Party applications,' Judicial Watch . president Tom Fitton said Wednesday in a statement. 'It . is disturbing to see Lois Lerner mislead the IRS’ internal . investigators about her office’s Tea Party targeting. These documents . also confirm the unprecedented pressure from congressional Democrats to . go after President Obama’s political opponents.' 'The IRS scandal has now ensnared Congress,' he said. Michigan Democratic Senator Carl Levin wrote to the IRS repeatedly in the months preceding the 2012 presidential election, trying to muscle the agency into tightening its leash on conservative nonprofit advocacy groups . That claim is a reference to a series of letters from Sen. Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat who wrote to the IRS in June 2012 to complain about 12 nonprofit groups he wanted investigated for 'political activity.' Ten of those organizations are conservative; two are liberal. The right-leaning groups included the Club for Growth, Americans for Tax Reform, the retiree-focused 60 Plus Association, and the anti-abortion Susan B. Anthony List. Levin intensified his written complaints as the presidential election approached, sometimes objecting to how the IRS handled 'social welfare' groups and claiming that IRS routinely 'misinterprets the law' by allowing them to engage in any political-related activity while receiving a tax exemption. Then-IRS Deputy Commissioner Steven Miller replied at one point that the agency has broad discretion – which it appears to have used – in choosing which organizations to approve and which to reject. 'There is no standard questionnaire used to obtain information about political activities,' Miller insisted. Gordon Trowbridge, a spokesman for Sen. Levin, told MailOnline that he 'believes the problem here is that the IRS has apparently failed to enforce the law, involving both liberal and conservative groups.' Trowbridge said the senator's office had already published much of his correspondence that Judicial Watch released Wednesday, some of it back in 2012. 'In a July 2012 letter he made public later that year, he cited two television ads, one targeting a Democratic candidate and one targeting a Republican candidate,' Trowbridge told MailOnline. Levin has focused in his letter to the IRS on an apparent contradiction in two separate Treasury Department regulations. One specifies that 501(c)(4) status, one of several tax-exempt designations the IRS can award, is reserved for groups that operate 'exclusively' for social welfare and don't engage in partisan politics. But another federal government guideline specifies that groups can be considered 'exclusively' focused on public welfare if they are 'primarily engaged' in promoting a community's general welfare. That conflict – between regulators who take the word 'exclusively' literally and those who rely instead on the word 'primarily' – has vexed lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. In May 2013, a Treasury Department inspector general report found that the IRS had been 'using inappropriate criteria to identify [conservative] organizations applying for tax-exempt status (e.g., lists of past and future donors).' The IRS's secret program of playing political favorites continued for more than 18 months, the report revealed, and 'delayed processing of targeted groups applications' in the run-up to the 2012 presidential election.","Bombshell emails indicate handling of scheme targeting conservative nonprofit groups was quarterbacked at the IRS's D.C. office .

"Everton manager Roberto Martinez hailed Romelu Lukaku as being 'back to his best' after the striker convincingly won his heavyweight contest with Manchester City's £32million defender Eliaquim Mangala on points. Lukaku, criticised this season for some lacklustre performances, was too quick and strong for his rival on a number of occasions and was the catalyst for a stirring Everton comeback against the champions. The Belgian – signed for £28million from Chelsea in the summer after a successful loan spell at Goodison Park - twice outpaced Mangala to nearly score, forced the City defender into a yellow card with another strong run and by the end the centre-half was panicky enough to nearly concede a penalty against Phil Jagielka, and then let Steven Naismith free for the equaliser that saw Everton salvage a 1-1 draw. Romelu Lukaku was denied by a Joe Hart's legs when he raced through down the right in the first half . Lukaku was a handful for both City defenders, here tussling with Argentine Martin Demicheli . Roberto Martinez hailed Lukaku as being back to his very best after the draw with City . Lukaku, 21, said after his FA cup goal against West Ham in midweek that he had asked Martinez to play more direct football to help his game. And the Everton boss was happy enough with his centre-forward on Saturday. 'Romelu is a player who needs to be at his physical best because of the power and pace in his game,' said Martinez. 'He can't contribute by just being half-fit and after the World Cup he wanted to make himself available even when he wasn't fully 100 per cent. The equaliser from forward Naismith on Saturday saw Manchester City lose ground on league leaders Chelsea . Fernandinho, celebrating with Sergio Aguero, put Manchester City in front at Goodison Park n Saturday . The Brazilian midfielder was unmarked in the six-yard box to flick a header into the bottom corner . 'Now he feels strong and can work for the 90 minutes. He proved in the races with Mangala and Martin Demichelis that he is strong. He would score in that position against Joe Hart nine times out of 10 but on this one the goalkeeper made a very good save. Romelu was full of character and responsibility. He looked back to his very best.' Mangala is finding his first season in English football but boss Manuel Pellegrini went through the same thing with Demichelis last season. 'We will analyse all the performances with the players but I hope people remember Demichelis had criticism last season and he became a very important player for us,' said the City manager.","Everton drew 1-1 with Manchester City at Goodison Park on Saturday .

"The U.S. Army plans to utilize 3D printing technology to build warheads with smaller more compact parts that both save the army money and allow for more security measures. '3D printing of warheads will allow us to have better design control and utilize geometries and patterns that previously could not be produced or manufactured,' James Zunino, a researcher at the Armament Research, Engineering, and Design Center told Motherboard. Zunino explains that since 3D printing allows for smaller more precise parts and more sensors, it will make for a safer design that won't break the bank. Precision also allows for more effective and lethal weapons. Small parts mean big changes: 3-D printed parts may transform the way that the US Army builds weapons such as warheads and missiles . 'Warheads could be designed to meet specific mission requirements whether it is to improve safety to meet an Insensitive Munitions requirement, or it could have tailorable effects, better control, and be scalable to achieve desired lethality,' Zunino said. 3D printing could allow for the printing of intricate structures all at once as oppose to individually assembling a weapon's parts. '3D printing also allows for integrating components together to add capabilities at reduced total life cycle costs,' Zunino explained. 3D printing will also make munitions more affordable. 'It is expected that 3D printing will reduce life-cycle costs of certain items and make munitions more affordable in the long run through implementation of design for manufacturability, and capitalizing on the add capabilities that 3D printing and additive manufacturing can bring to munitions and warheads.' More efficient: 3D printers allow for mass producing precise parts that will add to weapon safety and lethality all at a cheaper price . The Daily Dot reports that so far the army has utilized 3D technology to make bio printed skin for wounded soldiers. Technology can scan a soldier's injury and replicate it so that doctors can practice treating certain types of wounds. 'Many of the injuries soldiers receive the field are not traditional. A lot of the medical community sees [3D printing] as a new approach to medicine. We can 3D scan injuries. We can replicate with those injuries are. Surgeons and medics can practice on those specific types of injuries and provide better service to the war fighter,' said Thomas Russell, director of the U.S Army Research Laboratory. Whether it's healing soldiers or producing state of the art technology, the U.S. army has 3D printers on the brain. 'Maybe someday an entire warhead or rocket could be produced as the technology further matures,' said Zunino.

"Peter Lynagh went without sex for an entire year after his housemate bet him $2000 he couldn't . A Melbourne man who gave up sex for a year gained much more than he bargained for when a bet with a friend took on a life of its own. In late 2012 Peter Lynagh joked with his housemate he was fed up with the single life, which revolved around late nights partying and one night stands. 'I was going to give up women and sex... He (my housemate) said I couldn't even go a week, then this got me wound up even more,' Mr Lynagh told the Daily Mail Australia. From there what started as a $2000 bet between the pair grew to more than $50,000 being raised over the course of the year after a Facebook post 'went nuts' and Pete's Chastity for Charity was born. 'I had a flash of inspiration that I could give that money to the charity, make it bigger than me,' he said. The rules were for an entire year from the 1st of January 2013, Mr Lynagh, 33 at the time, wasn't allowed to jump into bed with anyone at all, though kissing was passable. He pledged to give all funds raised to Australian charity Free to Shine, an organisation which aims to save young Cambodian girls from the sex trade and instead educate them, and described the whole experience as 'a roller-coaster emotionally.' However an early lapse meant he came very close to breaking the ban in the first few months, and admitted the woman he was with was the one who had to put on the brakes. The Melbourne man set up a Facebook page called Pete's Chastity for Charity and raised more than $50K for a charity that supports children in Cambodia . 'No one thought I could do it... I nearly came really close to breaking it, I started seeing a girl and I don't know why,' he revealed. 'I think she was just enjoying the fact I wasn't trying to get in her pants.' 'That was a turning point, I just said I really had to take it seriously.' Mr Lynagh described the following months as a real journey of self-discovery, and along the way he found there were many parts of himself he wasn't entirely happy with. He focused his energy into other aspects of his life, started his own business and took a trip to Cambodia in September to see where the money raised from his abstinence was going. In September of last year he travelled overseas to work with the kids and see where the money was going . With his help the charity was able to employ extra workers on the ground and double the amount of girls it looked after. 'Once I'd seen what was happening, it was really humbling,' Mr Lynagh said. From here, he has aspirations to start a charity of his own, but for now has thrown his support behind The Big Umbrella project, a joint effort with The Father Bob Maguire Foundation with promotes anti-slavery and rehabilitation programs in Nepal. Earlier this year he made the trip to Kathmandu, and has just launched a fundraiser to deck out these kids, many of whom are orphans previously living on the streets, in brand new soccer gear. He has plans to start a charity of his own, and although would never give up sex for that long again wants to do something equally as 'crazy' When asked if he would ever go without sex for so long again, Mr Lynagh said he would be open to be doing something similar, but struggled to name something more difficult to give up. 'I don't think I would do no sex again for a year, I would like to something else crazy and out there and different.' 'If anyone can think of anything else crazy or quirky, I'm open to suggestions.'","Peter Lynagh's mate bet him $2K he couldn't give up sex for 12 months .

"Stabbing: Leonardo Henry, 25, broke into his ex-girlfriend's home and stabbed her repeatedly . An 11-year-old Oklahoma girl shot her mother's abusive ex-boyfriend after he broke into their home and began stabbing her mother Tuesday morning. Eleven-year-old Jayda Milsap shot Leonardo Henry, 25, with a handgun twice after he broke into her Oklahoma City home and began stabbing her mother in the eye, neck and chest, KFOR reports. Just a week before the incident, Milsap's mother, Brandy Moreno, filed a restraining order against Henry  claiming he 'had been molesting (several kids) in the middle of the night for several years,' KFOR reports. She later told authorities she was afraid that Henry would hurt her or the children because she reported him to the police. The Oklahoman reports that a neighbor said Moreno taught Milsap how to use the handgun one week before the incident 'so she could protect herself.' The lessons came in handy. Henry  broke through the back door of the home at 4am leaving a trail of broken glass. Moreno's two children and Henry's three children were in the home at the time of the attack, New York Daily News reports. After being shot by Milsap, Henry reportedly fled and was found down the street from the home, authorities say. He was taken to the hospital but police say he will soon be booked at the Oklahoma City Jail. The Oklahoman reports that both Moreno and Henry were taken to the University of Oklahoma Medical Center in serious condition. Broke in: Henry broke in through the back door leaving a trail of glass on the back porch . Sister: Henry's sister Emma Spence said that, though she hates to admit it, Henry may be guilty of the alleged sexual abuse . Hospital officials reportedly refused to report on the current condition of the two but KFOR reports that both the victim and Henry are expected to survive their injuries. Milsap's neighbors  hail her as a hero, according to KFOR. Even Henry's sister Emma Spence said that she salutes the 11-year-old and that her brother may be guilty of the sexual abuse, though she hates to admit it. 'I salute her,' Spence told KFOR. 'It was awesome that she did that for her mom...I'm 21 and I don't even know how to use a gun.' Milsap's neighbor, Carolyn Marsee said, in a KFOR interview, that she hopes a judge puts Henry away for a long time. 'I could care less if he dies, because what he did was very wrong,' Marsee said. Authorities say that, as of now, the shooting appears to have been justified and the children have been taken into protective custody with the state Department of Human Services.

"Chelsea were denied another clear penalty  in their 2-0 win over Newcastle – fuelling Jose Mourinho's suspicions that the club is suffering from a media campaign which is influencing referees’ decisions.

For sure you could make an argument out for that being a penalty kick but our preference would be to try to focus on the improved performance in the second half.’ Chelsea though were fortunate that East chose to be lenient when Nemanja Matic stopped Remy Cabella with an outstretched-straightened arm in the 73rd minute, choosing to award only a yellow card to the midfielder. ‘There were a couple of challenges from Matic which were a little bit over zealous,’ said Newcastle stand-in coach John Carver. Mourinho had plenty to say during the game but he remained tight-lipped after the final whistle . ‘I was worried for Remy. He’s only six stone, soaking wet – but he’ll get more of that. He just has to move the ball a little bit quicker.’ Mourinho has failed to appear for scheduled press conferences since his FA charge last week and a Chelsea spokesman said: ‘There is an FA charge and he decided to take a back seat while that is in play. 'The club and the board fully support his position on this. The fact that he wanted to get into a debate over refereeing, over what he saw as a campaign, we full support that to. We think it should be something that can be debated.’ Mourinho clashed with Newcastle coaching staff but he later made up with caretaker boss John Carver .","Ref Roger East missed a clear hand ball in the penalty area from Newcastle defender Fabricio Coloccini .

"British motorists are being 'ripped off' at the pumps and paying up to 43p a litre more than drivers on the Continent for their fuel, a damning new report reveals today. UK motorists are being fleeced by some the highest pump prices in Europe as even drivers in neighbouring France pay 29p a litre less for their diesel compared to Britain. Motoring groups say garages are ‘profiteering’ by dragging their feet and failing to pass on the benefits of falling wholesale prices of up to 6p a litre for diesel alone. Details are revealed today in the new Post Office Travel Money annual report into motoring. Motorists are being fleeced by some the highest pump prices in Europe, a report suggests . The Post Office said even after exchange-rate discrepancies were stripped out, diesel on the Continent was still cheaper than Britain in 19 of the 22 countries surveyed: ‘It does smack of a rip-off.’ Chastened British supermarkets yesterday responded to the damning findings and angry criticism from motoring groups such as the RAC by cutting up to 2p off the cost of a litre of diesel – though critics said much more was needed. Drivers motoring through France will pay a staggering 29p a litre less for their diesel than in UK, the new Post Office report reveals. On diesel prices Britain finishes in a dismal 20th place out of 22 European countries surveyed with an average price of  £1.37 a litre, compared to just 94p in cheapest Andorra – a difference of 43p a litre - and 99p in runner up Luxembourg,  £1.08 in fourth place France and £1.11 in sixth place Spain. That means for a family driving 1,000 miles – 500 each way – a drive through France would be £44.26 less than for the same journey in the UK, with French bill coming to £163.17 compared to £207.42 in Britain. For fill-ups in cheapest Andorra the price difference would be £65.56. Price differences also exist on petrol prices though the gaps are less dramatic with the UK in 12th place out of 22 at £1.31 a litre compared to  £1.04 in cheapest Andorra,£1.11 in runner-up Luxembourg,  £1.18 in sixth-place Spain and £1.26 in 10th place France. The Post office report says: ‘At £1.37, the UK emerged as one of the most expensive countries for diesel motoring.’ The price gap between fuels is also acute. On the Continent diesel is up to 27p a litre cheaper than unleaded petrol while in Britain it costs 6p more than four-star. Motoring groups say garages are ¿profiteering¿ by dragging their feet and failing to pass on the benefits of falling wholesale prices of up to 6p a litre for diesel . On the bright side, the report says lower pump prices on the Continent generally and a stronger pound against the Euro  will give UK drivers a bumper Summer bonus when motoring across Europe – especially neighbouring France. But experts advise cross-Channel drivers to fill-up on foreign soil rather than pay exorbitant prices in Britain. The Post office report notes: ‘Lower prices in European petrol stations mean that UK tourists on Continental motoring holidays can expect their cars to drive more miles for less cash this year. Fuelled by the strong pound, pump prices have fallen in 20 of 22 countries surveyed.’ Biggest price falls have been in France, with petrol down 15per cent and diesel dipping 18percent compared with last year, says the Post Office report. Spain's prices have also fallen - with petrol down 4.8per cent and diesel down 4.3per cent. The Post Office report notes: ‘The biggest fall in the cost of unleaded petrol and diesel fuel has been in France, where the litre price is down 23p for unleaded and 24p for diesel. This year’s price fall means diesel drivers will pay 29p a litre less in France than in the UK.’ It adds: ‘A combination of cheaper fuel and the strong pound means UK tourists can expect to pay 15 per cent less for unleaded petrol (£1.26) and 18 per cent less for diesel (£1.08) at French pumps. ‘This means that 1,000 miles of motoring through France will cost £45 less than last year in a car using unleaded petrol (£191) and £47 less for diesel drivers (£163). ‘ . Details are revealed today in the new Post Office Travel Money annual report into motoring . Prices are also down this year in two other European destinations popular with UK holiday motorists – Spain and Ireland. In Spain, where  four out of ten (38 per cent) said they have driven, pump prices are down 6p a litre for unleaded (£1.18) and 5p for diesel fuel (£1.11). A third of motorists said they had driven in Ireland, where a litre of unleaded petrol is 13p now cheaper than last year (£1.28). Overall, the report noted: ‘Pump prices have fallen by up to 24p per litre year-on-year in European motoring holiday destinations.’ Austria (£1.14 a litre), Czech Republic (£1.15) and Switzerland (£1.17) also offer comparatively cheap petrol, while Greece (£1.07 a litre), France (£1.08) and  Austria (£1.08) are among the best-buy countries for diesel. But UK motorists looking for the best fuel deals would do well to avoid Norway which has the dearest petrol (£1.65 a litre) and the most-expensive diesel (£1.50).  Other countries where fuel costs are high include Turkey, where petrol is £1.55 a litre, and Holland where it costs £1.51. Andrew Brown of Post Office Travel Money urged drivers to do their homework before traveling:‘In France, especially, it will pay drivers crossing to French ports to fill up when they reach foreign soil because of the big drop in fuel prices there.’ RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said UK garages were dragging their feet and that their actions smacked of profiteering: ‘Fuel retailers must reduce the price of diesel at the pumps as the wholesale cost is now almost the same as petrol - yet average forecourt prices are still 6p a litre more expensive. ‘Transparent, fair fuel pricing is vital for the economy and to maintain the trust of motorists. While two thirds of Britain’s 29million cars run on petrol we use twice as much diesel, around 26billion litres a year.’ Ahead of the damning Post Office report, Asda cut up to 2p a litre off its diesel with a price cap of 131.7p a litre. Petrol prices remain unchanged at 127.7p a litre. Asda said significant falls in the wholesale price of diesel allowed it to pass on cost savings directly to its customers.","Motorists fleeced by some of the highest prices in Europe, report shows .

"At a dinner McDonald's hosted for reporters and bloggers, waiters served cuisine prepared by celebrity chefs using ingredients from the chain's menu. A Kung Pao chicken appetizer was made with Chicken McNuggets doused in sweet and sour sauce and garnished with parsley. Slow-cooked beef was served with gnocchi fashioned out of McDonald's french fries and a fruit sauce from its smoothie mix. For dessert, its biscuit mix was used to make a pumpkin spice 'biznut,' a biscuit-doughnut hybrid. The event, held in New York City's Tribeca neighborhood, was billed 'A transforming dining experience of ""fast food"" to ""good food served fast.""' Attendees tweeted out photos and the night was written up on various websites.

(AP Photo/Eric Risberg, File) The dishes aren't intended for McDonald's restaurants. Instead, the evening is part of a campaign by McDonald's to shake its reputation for serving cheap, unhealthy food. At a time when Americans are playing closer attention to what they eat, the company is trying to sway public opinion by first reaching out to the reporters, bloggers and other so-called 'influencers' who write and speak about McDonald's. It's just one way McDonald's is trying to change its image. In the past 18 months, the chain has introduced the option to substitute egg whites in breakfast sandwiches and rolled out chicken wraps as its first menu item with cucumbers. Last fall, it announced plans to give people the choice of a salad instead of fries in combo meals. And in coming months, mandarins will be offered in Happy Meals, with other fruits being explored as well. McDonald's declined to make an executive available for this story, but CEO Don Thompson said early this year: 'We've got to make sure that the food is relevant and that the awareness around McDonald's as a kitchen and a restaurant that cooks and prepares fresh, high quality food is strong and pronounced.' The company faces an uphill battle, especially if the past is any indication. The salads it introduced more than a decade ago account for just two to three per cent of sales. And the chain last year discontinued its Fruit & Walnut salad and premium Angus burgers, which analysts said were priced too high for McDonald's customers at around $5. The problem is that some simply people don't consider McDonald's a place to get high quality food, in part because the prices are so low. And while McDonald's has added salads and a yogurt parfait to its menu over the years, Americans are gravitating toward other attributes, like organic produce and meat raised without antibiotics.

In . some ways, the image McDonald's is battling is ironic, given its . reputation for exacting standards with suppliers. Thompson has also . noted the ingredients tend to be fresh because restaurants go through . them so quickly. 'The . produce and the products that we have at breakfast and across the menu . are fresher than — no disrespect intended — what most of you have in . your refrigerators,' he said at an analyst conference in May. But . even that reputation for supply chain rigor was recently tarnished when . the chain's longtime supplier was reported to have sold expired meat to . its restaurants in China.

Richard Adams, who used to own McDonald's restaurants in San Diego and . now runs a consulting firm for franchisees. Anne . Johnson, for instance, said she eats at McDonald's because she can get a . burger, fries and drink for about $5. But Johnson, a New York resident, . doesn't think there are any healthy options there. 'Basically, it's junk food,' she said. Adding . to its challenge, McDonald's can't seem to raise prices without driving . people away. Pressured by rising costs for beef and other ingredients, . the chain tried to move away from the Dollar Menu in 2012 with an 'Extra . Value Menu' where items were priced at around $2. But . customers are apparently righteous about the $1 price point, and the . strategy was scrapped. Last year, McDonald's changed its tactic a bit, . hoping not to turn off customers. It tweaked the name of the 'Dollar . Menu' to the 'Dollar Menu & More.'

Meanwhile, . the company acknowledges there are problems with how people perceive . its food. 'A lot of our guests don't believe our food is real,' said Dan . Coudreaut, director of culinary innovation at McDonald's, in an . interview last year. The . image of McDonald's food is a growing concern for the company at a time . when U.S. sales have been weak for two years. The last time McDonald's . managed to boost a monthly sales figure at home was in October, and the . company warns its performance isn't expected to improve anytime soon. McDonald's . has said it has other problems, including slow and inaccurate service . at its restaurants. But improving perceptions about its food is also a . priority. Following the . dinner in New York last fall, the company hosted a similar event last . month for reporters covering the Essence Festival in New Orleans. Beignets filled with grilled chicken and dusted with sugar were served . alongside a packet of McDonald's honey mustard sauce. Other . 'chef events' in local markets are planned for coming months, according . to Lisa McComb, a McDonald's spokeswoman. She declined to provide . details but said the events will be a spin on a recent contest between . two friends to make a gourmet dish out of a Big Mac meal. McComb said McDonald's wasn't associated with that particular contest, which was posted online. The . company continues to tweak the menu, too. The new Bacon Club burger . McDonald's is promoting comes on a brioche bun and looks more like . something that might be found at a trendy burger joint. It costs $5 or . $6, depending on where you live, making it the most expensive sandwich . on the menu. In Southern . California, McDonald's also is testing a 'Build Your Own Burger' concept, with the patties being cooked to order more slowly on a . separate grill. Beyond the menu, the company is determined to take control of its narrative. 'We're . going to start really, really telling our story in a much more . proactive manner,' said Kevin Newell, U.S. brand and strategy officer . for McDonald's said late last year.

"Putin: Fracking makes ¿black stuff come out of the tap¿ . Russian agents are secretly working with environmental campaigners to halt fracking operations in the UK and the rest of Europe, the head of Nato warned yesterday. Vladimir Putin’s government has ‘engaged actively’ with green groups and protesters in a sophisticated operation aimed at maintaining Europe’s reliance on energy exports from Moscow, said Nato Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen. He said the Russians had mounted a highly developed disinformation campaign to undermine attempts to exploit alternative energy sources such as shale gas. Moves to start fracking in the UK have been disrupted following a sustained campaign by environmentalists that has created fears about its impact. Speaking at the Chatham House foreign affairs think-tank in London, Mr Rasmussen said: ‘I have met allies who can report that Russia, as part of their sophisticated information and disinformation operations, engaged actively with so-called non-governmental organisations – environmental organisations working against shale gas – to maintain European dependence on imported Russian gas.’ He declined to give fuller details of the alleged plot, but said: ‘That is my interpretation.’ He would not say what form the Russians’ apparent engagement with the environmentalists took or whether groups concerned were aware that they were dealing with Moscow’s agents. According to Mr Rasmussen, who supports the experimental fracking operations, improving energy security is of the ‘utmost importance’ and requires European nations to develop more diverse sources of supply. ‘It also, in my opinion, involves the better functioning of the European energy market so that one single supplier is not able to blackmail one single nation,’ he said. Britain has vast reserves of shale gas trapped in rocks thousands of feet underground that may be extracted by firing water and chemicals to fracture the rock. Scientists say we are sitting on deposits of enough shale gas to supply the whole country for at least 40 years, mirroring the North Sea oil boom of the 1970s. But shale gas development has not yet taken off here, unlike in countries such as the US where it has proved highly popular. Opponents in the UK have warned that the process risks causing earthquakes, polluting water, blighting the countryside and affecting house prices. Plots: Nato Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said the Russians had mounted a highly developed disinformation campaign to undermine attempts to exploit alternative energy sources such as shale gas . There have been fierce protests against the technique, with exploratory drilling near the village of Balcombe, West Sussex, abandoned last year after the site was overrun by demonstrators. Mr Putin has repeatedly voiced concerns about fracking, once telling a global economic conference that ‘black stuff comes out of the tap’. And Russia’s state-owned gas giant Gazprom, the world’s biggest gas producer, says fracking has ‘significant environmental risks’ including water contamination. David Cameron has told opponents to embrace fracking as part of efforts to reduce dependence on Russian energy supplies. Mr Rasmussen’s comments drew an angry response from Greenpeace, which saw a group of activists threatened with up to 15 years in jail last year after they staged an anti-drilling protest on a Russian off-shore oil platform. A Greenpeace spokesman said: ‘The idea we’re puppets of Putin is so preposterous that you have to wonder what they’re smoking over at Nato HQ. ‘Mr Rasmussen should spend less time dreaming up conspiracy theories and more time on the facts. ‘Fracked gas will probably cost more than Russian imports. There’s little chance fracking will generate more than a small fraction of Europe’s gas needs and it won’t even do that for at least ten years.’ Friends of the Earth’s head of campaigns, Andrew Pendleton, was equally dismissive. ‘Perhaps the Russians are worried about our huge wind and solar potential, and have infiltrated the UK Government,’ he said.","Putin's government 'engaged actively' with green groups and protesters .

"The richest 10 per cent of Britons control more than half the country's wealth, new research has revealed. The annual Credit Suisse global wealth report, released yesterday, has revealed Britain as the only country in the G7 group to have increased inequality this century. While inequality has fallen in France, Germany, Canada and Japan - and remained flat in the U.S. and Italy - the share of Britain's richest one per cent has climbed. The rise mean the nation's super-rich now control 54.1 per cent of the country's wealth, up from 51.5 per cent in 2000 and 52 per cent in 2007. Wealth per adult: The richest nations, with wealth per adult over $100,000 (£63,000), are found in North America, Western Europe and among the rich Asia-Pacific and Middle Eastern countries (in red) It was the second-highest year-on-year increase in the world, second only to the U.S which now has more than 14million dollar millionaires. Oxfam’s head of inequality, Emma Seery, said: 'In the UK, successive governments have failed to get to grips with rising inequality. 'This report shows that those least able to afford it have paid the price of the financial crisis whilst more wealth has flooded into the coffers of the very richest.' 'These figures give more evidence that inequality is extreme and growing, and that economic recovery following the financial crisis has been skewed in favour of the wealthiest. 'In poor countries rising inequality means the difference between children getting the chance to go to school and sick people getting life saving medicines. Globally, wealth skyrocketed 8.3 per cent over the past year to a record $263trillion (£165trillion). But the research found the distribution of the riches has become increasingly unequal - with the median wealth plunging 14 per cent since 2007 to $3,641 (£2,289) per adult. As a sign of wealth concentration, the number of dollar millionaires globally has shot up 164 per cent since 2000 to 34.8million individuals today - with 41 per cent of them living in the United States. Global wealth now stands 20 per cent above the peak before the global financial crisis and 39 per cent above the low seen at the height of the crisis in 2008, according to the Global Wealth Report. It said: ‘The overall global economy may remain sluggish, but this has not prevented personal wealth from surging ahead during the past year.’ The study of the wealth holdings of 4.7billion adults in more than 200 countries found aggregate household wealth has more than doubled since 2000, when it stood at $117trillion (£74trillion). And in the next five years, wealth is expected to rise by 40 per cent to $369trillion (£231trillion). Today, each adult has an average of $56,000 ($35,000) - an all-time high for average net worth. The decline in the median to $3,641 - the level at which half of the sample is lower and half higher - indicates that inequality, which remained flat or declined from 2000 to 2007, is once again rising. Increasing: China's share of the middle class has doubled since 2000 and now accounts for one third of people in that category . ‘The findings show that inequality has tended to rise since 2008, particularly in developing economies,’ Markus Stierli of the Credit Suisse Research Institute said. The study credits most of the rise in wealth over the past year to North America, which accounts for 34.7 per cent of global household wealth, and Europe, which accounts for 32.4 per cent. Both regions showed hikes of about 11 per cent. In contrast, Latin America saw little change, while China recorded only a small rise of around 3.5 per cent, and India saw its wealth fall 1 per cent. On a country level, Britain, South Korea and Denmark recorded the largest percentage gains, while Ukraine, Argentina and Indonesia saw the largest losses, it said. Switzerland meanwhile maintained the highest average wealth per adult, at $581,000 (£365,000), followed by Australia, Norway, the U.S. and Sweden. Some 128,000 of the world's millionaires have assets of at least $50million (£31million), with nearly half of them living in the U.S. and nearly a quarter in Europe. Credit Suisse said it expected the number of global millionaires to exceed 53million in 2019, with the number in China expected to nearly double from its 1.18million today. Some one billion people meanwhile belong to the global middle class, with wealth ranging from $10,000 (£6,000) to $100,000 (£63,000), the study showed. China's share of the middle class has doubled since 2000 and now accounts for one third of people in that category, it said.","Richest 10 per cent now control 54.1 per cent of Britain's wealth .

"A New Mexico woman is being tested for Ebola after returning from Sierra Leone with symptoms similar to those displayed by victims of the virus. However, health officials say that the 30-year-old teacher is unlikely to have the untreatable disease. Although she has a fever, muscle aches, headaches and a sore throat, the woman has had no known exposure to the virus, which can only be passed on through bodily fluids, and not through the air or water. Scroll down for video . University of New Mexico Hospital, where the 30-year-old teacher is being tested for Ebola . She is being tested by the Department of Health and the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at the University of New Mexico Hospital 'out of an abundance of caution', health officials say. Despite the unlikelihood that the woman has Ebola, those treating her are still wearing protective clothing, while visitors are also limited. Dr Meghan Brett, the UNMH epidemiologist. told the Albuquerque Journal: 'Returning from overseas with a fever could be a lot of things. It could be routine.' Nancy Writebol, 59, is showing signs of recovery from Ebola at Emory University Hospital, Atlanta . And Dr Robert Bailey, associate dean for clinical affairs at hospital’s School of Medicine, told the Santa Fe New Mexican: 'There really isn’t a risk to the public at this point. The risk of Ebola is not having the patient in the hospital - being in a situation like the folks in Africa are experiencing right now with folks getting sick in rural villages and nobody recognizes it.' Blood samples should show by Wednesday or Thursday whether the woman has the virus or not. While Ebola has claimed more than 1,100 lives in west Africa, the only confirmed cases of the virus in the U.S. are two health care workers who picked it up in Liberia. Dr Kent Brantly (pictured) and ms Writebol were the first to receive an experimental medication called ZMapp . The pair, a man and a woman, are being treated at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, and are showing signs of recovery. Nancy Writebol, 59, and Dr Kent Brantley, 33, have been undergoing experimental treatment, as doctors look to find a cure. They were the first two people to be given experimental drug ZMapp, which doctors hope will help them fight the virus with a 90 per cent fatality rate. While Dr Brantly was able to walk into the hospital, Ms Writebol was in worse condition when she arrived last week but she was still able to recognize her son when she saw him for the first time. 'There was a little crease of a smile that came up and we were both in tears,' Jeremy Writebol recalled on the Today show. 'I was able just to say, ""Mom I love you"".' President of SIM, the Christian organisation Ms Writebol works for, said: 'This could possibly be an opportunity for Emory Hospital to help understand what’s going on and find a cure. That would be incredible,' the Los Angeles Times reported. Ebola symptoms normally show up between two and 21 days of coming into contact with the disease. The New Mexico teacher returned to the U.S. on August 4 and begun displaying symptoms of illness of August 15. So far, there have been more than 2,100 confirmed and suspected cases of the disease. It has claimed the lives of at least 1,145 people from Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria and Sierra Leone, as well as that of a Spanish priest last week. Patients were forced to flee an isolation ward in Liberia yesterday after an armed attack on an isolation ward. Some of the 29 quarantined people have now been brought to another hospital after being chased from where they were staying in Monrovia, while others remain loose. The National Institutes of Health say Ebola victims usually die of shock.","Health officials say it is unlikely the woman has the untreatable virus .

"King Richard III did plan to be buried in York, not Leicester, a new letter unearthed in the National Archives suggests. The extraordinary letter, discovered by historian and Tory MP Chris Skidmore, provides fresh ammunition to those who believe the King was establishing a major new religious foundation at York Minister with a view to it becoming his mausoleum. It shows that Richard III wanted the 100 priests at the new foundation to use their prayers to make him ‘more acceptable to God and his saints’. A painting of King Richard III  from the 16th Century housed in the National Portrait Gallery in London . Writing in tomorrow’s edition of BBC History magazine, Mr Skidmore says the letter, written five months before his death, suggests Richard’s ‘real intention’ in establishing the college at York may have been to follow the 15th Century trend for aristocrats to turn similar foundations into mausoleums. He says: ‘The connection between Richard’s establishment of the foundation at York and the salvation of his own soul could hardly be any clearer.’ Leicester Cathedral has won the tussle to provide the final resting place for Richard III following a lengthy court battle in which campaigners claimed he wanted to be buried at York Minister, . The case was thrown out, with the High Court ruling there was ‘no public law case’ to interfere with the decision to bury the late King in Leicester, where his bones were found under a car park in 2012. But the new letter threatens to reopen the debate over whether he should rightly be buried at York Minister. The document, which has lain undiscovered for centuries, gives a fresh insight into Richard’s decision to establish a 100-strong college of priests at York. The letter, dated 2 March 1485, records the King angrily demanding that the priests be paid so that they can pray for him. The King points out to the authorities at the Duchy of Lancaster that the have been given powers to ‘ask, gather and levy all and any sum… to sustain and bear the charge of the finding of a hundred priests now being of our foundation’. Stressing the personal importance of the issue, he warns he is ‘not willing our said priests to be unpaid of their wages, seeing by their prayers we trust to be made more acceptable to God and his saints’. This letter by King Richard, dated 2 March 1485, suggests he wanted to establish a major new religious foundation at York Minister with a view to it becoming his mausoleum . Mr Skidmore, author of ‘Bosworth: The Birth of the Tudors,’ said Richard’s comments suggest his intentions at York may have been ‘to follow the growing trend for 15th century aristocrats across Europe to establish their own chantry foundations and, ultimately, mausoleums.’ He told the Daily Mail that the letter was significant because it came at a time when Richard was ‘in a dark place’. He said: 'This is an intriguing insight into the mind of Richard III, and demonstrates there are still new finds to be made in the archives. 'At the time of writing the letter, Richard's queen was mortally ill, and would die two weeks later. The king may have been contemplating his own mortality, especially with the growing threat of Henry Tudor who would invade just five months later. 'It doesn't prove that Richard wished to be buried at York, but it certainly raises interesting questions over the king's own piety and intentions.’ Scientists at the University of Leicester said this skeleton found under Greyfriars car park in Leicester was that of King Richard III . Mr Skidmore said that, despite the discovery, he personally favoured burial of Richard at Leicester on the ‘finders, keepers principle’. Richard III was killed at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485. He was buried in a Leicester church, but the building was lost to later development. His bones were then discovered under a Leicester car park in 2012. Authorities in Leicester have said they will reinter his body with ‘dignity and honour’. But a campaign group, the Plantagenet Alliance, claimed York was a more suitable location for Richard's remains as he had spent his childhood and much of his adult life in the North.","Document suggests King was establishing a religious foundation at York .

This time however, despite the veterans advanced age, the jump was a whole lot easier. 'It didn't compare,' said Martin to CNN, 'because there wasn't anybody shooting at me today.' Martin . made his jump as ceremonies to commemorate the 70th anniversary of . D-Day draw thousands of visitors to the cemeteries, beaches and . stone-walled villages of Normandy this week.

He revealed he was jumping now because he may be the last man from his unit of the 101st Airborne Division to ever do it again.

Martin . recalled that on the first night as Allied troops parachuted in for the . D-Day invasion, local people thanked them for coming even as their . houses were burning, and he has since received a warm reception in . France. 'Some people will come up to you and cry . and say, 'I was a little girl back then and I remember what happened, . and you gave us our freedom,'"" Martin said. He . also recalled the terror he felt as he sat in his Dakota aircraft . preparing to be parachuted into the drop zone behind the beaches of Utah . - where thousands of Americans lost their lives on D-Day. 'Everybody . was scared all the time, and if they tell you anything differently they . are full of crap,' the former paratrooper recalled to CNN. 'But you just do what you had to do regardless of it. That's the difference.' Martin, . who was a private in the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, was among . the first Americans in combat in Europe. After Normandy, where his unit . fought to capture key bridges, he parachuted into Holland in 'Operation . Market Garden' and fought at Bastogne during the Battle of the Bulge. As . a defense industry worker, he had a deferment from military service, . but Martin said he saw that France and Britain could not win the war in . Europe on their own and that men with families were joining the service . and being drafted. He enlisted at age 21 and was later awarded a Purple . Heart and a Bronze Star.

"Britain could be stripped of even more powers under plans to create a new super-powerful EU president who would not be directly elected by voters. A group of Eurocrats have secretly devised a scheme to merge the jobs currently done by Herman Van Rompuy, president of the European Council, and Jose Manuel Barroso, president of the European Commission. The new Europe chief would be in charge of both the administrative and political arms of the EU and have sweeping control over the entire union. Tight control: Job would be merger of those currently done by Jose Manuel Barroso (left) and Herman Van Rompuy (right) The UK has been excluded from the covert discussions, which were were uncovered by Independent Labour peer Lord Stoddart of Swindon. Critics fear David Cameron is doing nothing to prevent the ominous plans, according to the Daily Express. 'This is a plot by people who want to abolish nation states and create a United States of Europe,' said Lord Stoddart. 'The whole thing is barmy. These people are determined to achieve their final objective. Eurosceptic? Critics fear David Cameron is doing nothing to prevent the ominous plans . 'The only hope for Britain is to leave the EU and become an independent nation.' Tory backbench MP Douglas Carswell said: .

He confirmed the existence of . the plot in the House of Lords by asking Foreign Office ministers to reveal what they knew about the . merger discussions. Lord Howell pointed out that the holder of this new office . would be both Europe’s political and administrative leader, giving them even more powers than the U.S. president. A Foreign Commonwealth Office spokesperson said: 'As has been widely reported for a couple of months, the idea of merging the Commission and European Council presidencies has been informally discussed before. We believe that any proposal to merge these two offices would need treaty change and the UK Government would not agree to such a proposal.

"It was almost as if David Moyes had borrowed some of the magic of the FA Cup on Sunday night at Anoeta as his Real Sociedad played at being giant-killers and took the scalp of Barcelona. On one of the greatest nights of his managerial career Moyes masterminded a 1-0 win with the side he took over last November seeing off Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar in style. He was given a helping hand by opposing coach Luis Enrique who bizarrely left Messi out of his starting line-up – perhaps the Barca coach was also paying homage to the world’s oldest club cup competition by resting his most important players. VIDEO Scroll down for all the Big Match Stats as David Moyes delivers a  giant killing .

Booked: Mathieu, Alves, Neymar . That strange team sheet which also included Neymar, Gerard Pique, Dani Alves and Ivan Rakitic on the bench was the first shock of the night, the second came after just one minute when a header from Jordi Alba went flying past his own keeper to give Real Sociedad the lead. Barca came into the game having picked up just one of a possible 12 points in their last four visits to Anoeta. They were facing a Real Sociedad side who had already beaten Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid at home. Luis Enrique’s side now needed a goal but with top scorer in the league Messi (15 goals) on the bench and Neymar, Barca's second highest league scorer with 1, alongside him that was always going to be more difficult. This was not the way for Barcelona to take advantage of Real Madrid having lost to Valencia in the earlier Sunday game giving them the chance to go top. Luis Suarez was looking for his second league goal of the season and might have fancied his chances from a free-kick on 20 minutes but Xavi took the set-piece and sent it over the bar. Suarez then charged through on goal but played in Pedro who squandered the chance. The former Liverpool striker cut a frustrated figure in an attack between Pedro and youngster Munir El Haddadi. It wasn’t what he signed up for when he made his £75million pound switch in the summer. Suarez played in Pedro again but this time the winger crossed and when the ball hit Inigo Martinez on the arm Suarez appealed but the referee waved away the calls for a penalty.

Real Sociedad's Prieto (centre) and Sergio Canales (right) leap for joy as a dejected Suarez tries to appeal . Real Sociedad almost made the most of the stroke of good fortune going down the other end and nearly doubling their lead. Full-back Alberto de la Bella admitted recently that Moyes has been encouraging him to overlap a-la Leighton Baines and the defender flew down the left and crossed for Xabi Prieto who just failed to connect under pressure from Jordi Alba. It was the perfect chance to make it 2-0 but there was another scare for Barça moments after. Sergio Canales pulled off a clever turn that left Martin Montoya on the seat of his shorts and the former Real Madrid man shot at Claudio Bravo only for the one-time Real Sociedad keeper to palm the effort away. Vela then charged through and was booked for diving, the former Arsenal man had gone down under a challenge from Javier Mascherano. With two minutes left of the first half and Messi already warming up Barca had their first shot on target but it came from distance from Pedro and was comfortably saved by Geronimo Rulli. Real Sociedad supporters whistled match official Carlos del Cerro Grande off the pitch at half time after he booked Inigo Martinez in injury time for handling as he stopped Suarez going past him. The ball did not appear to have touched the defender as he went to ground. All Barça eyes were on Messi ready to make his delayed entrance at the start of the second half. He replaced Munir on 45 minutes and Neymar replaced Pedro on the hour – once the Brazilian had removed his necklace. He was perhaps not expecting to come on having had the least rest during the midwinter break. Despite the changes it was Real Sociedad who looked like scoring next with Prieto heading just over after Bravo had failed to come for a cross. Messi tried to bundle his way through at the other end as the visitors did their best to get a foothold back in the game. He took the next sent piece but came no closer than Xavi had in the first half. Alves was thrown on too and with Barca switching to three at the back Real Sociedad needed some heroic defending to see out the second half but with Inigo Martinez superbly marshaling the troops Moyes men did exactly that. Suarez had the best chance but was brilliantly denied by Rulli. After so many headlines about Moyes’ future at Manchester United, on Monday morning the inquests will all be for his rival Enrique. The Spaniard’s job is in doubt. Moyes has won his first big game in Spain and is settling in very nicely indeed. 12 months ago, David Moyes was reeling after Manchester United were dumped out of the FA Cup at the first hurdle by Swansea City.

"A second . long-suffering Comcast customer in two days has taken to YouTube to . voice his frustrations with the cable company’s apparently terrible . customer service. Aaron . Spain, from Illinois, claims he was kept on hold for three-and-a-half hours when he . called on Monday evening and attempted to cancel his service. In . the end, Spain had to call again the next day after he realized his . epic wait had been in vain and the customer service department had . closed for the evening. Scroll down for video . 'I'm pissed': Aaron Spain claims he was kept on hold for three-and-a-half hours when he called on Monday evening and attempted to cancel his service . In the video clip, Spain can be seen using a second phone to call the Comcast customer service number. After . getting through various menu to reach the cancellation option, an . automated voice states that they are closed for the day. Spain's other . phone shows he had been on hold for three hours and 25 minutes at that point. 'That’s how long I’ve been on hold and they’re closed. I’m pissed,' he said in to camera. Spain claims he has spent nearly a month to get . his Comcast service set up correctly at his apartment to no avail. He told Reddit that he decided to keep holding for hours because he was tired of the . company’s 'poor customer service.' 'I will simply never use . their services again. Honestly I don’t know why I stayed with them for . the 3+ years I had been with them other than poor research on my part,' Spain wrote. 'To . their credit, apart from the hold fiasco (of which I fully realize I’m . not the first or last to have this happened to) the phone support were . polite, courteous, and helpful to the extent they are allowed to be. 'It . was the repeated failure of dispatched technicians that did it in for . me. I work in the tech industry so I get how it is to be yelled at all . day by people that just want to be helped. I don’t like to treat anyone . that way, especially at a call center which is so easily dehumanized.' Spain was finally able to cancel his service on Tuesday after calling up and achieving his aim within 15 minutes. 'Felt . bad for the guy I talked to as I gave him little opportunity to offer . me any other resolution,' Spain posted on Reddit. 'I did clarify it . wasn’t his fault, I wasn’t mad at him directly, and complimented him on . doing what I asked and doing his job well.' A Comcast customer, calling himself 'Tim Davis', grew so frustrated with the poor service he received that he recorded his calls with the cable company and used them to prove that they lied to him about charges . Spain's YouTube video has already been viewed over one million times, which is more than his fellow Comcast complainer, who called himself 'Tim Davis' online. He grew so frustrated with ISP's poor service that he recorded his calls with the cable company and used them to prove that they lied to him about charges. He posted his exchanges on YouTube on Sunday and it has received over 700,000 views since. Davis claims the company only refunded him $182 in unnecessary charges after he played them his recording of the exchanges. The incident came about after Tim moved to a new apartment in Eugene, Oregon, a month ago and installed his modem and set up his Wi-Fi himself. The problem started when Tim checked his next bill and found that he had been charged $132 for failing to install his modem properly. Something which had never been an issue . Not long after, his internet connection began to stop working for 5 to 10 minutes at a time and so he called Comcast to complain. Together, Tim and the representative figured out that the problem was caused by the cable outside of the apartment and that it wasn't his fault. Based on his previous experience with the cable company, Tim asked the representative to confirm wouldn't be charged for the repair. This assurance was captured on tape. A Comcast technician then visited the building where Tim lives and fixed the problem. The problem started when Tim checked his . next bill and found that he had been charged $132 for failing to install . his modem properly. Something which had never been an issue. On top of that, Tim was also he was charged another $50 for having Comcast set up his Wi-Fi network - again something that Tim had already done himself. When he called Comcast to query the charges, Tim was put on hold for an hour before he hung up. Eventually he spoke with a rep called Daisy who informed him that Comcast had subtracted $100 from his bill for 'service discounts.' Despite his bill being more than halved, Tim said he was still unhappy about the charges. Next, he was offered an upgrade to a faster internet service. The offer was worth less than the $82 that Comcast was still asking Tim to pay and so he said no. Next, Daisy told him that there was simply no way she could remove the charges or reimburse his account. When Tim spoke to a rep at Comcast he was told him that there was simply no way they could remove the charges or reimburse his account (stock image of Comcast call center) Taking the blame: An internal memo from Comcast COO Dave Watson blames the company for training customer service reps in potentially annoying tactics . Tim then revealed that he had a recording of a phone call in which Comcast told him he wouldn't be charged. Finally, Comcast backed down and gave him back his money. 'Why were you not able to do that before?' Tim asked. 'Again, . that is a valid charge,' Daisy said. 'But since I advised my manager . that there is a recording, and you were misinformed, then he's the one . who can approve that $82.' 'You're telling me that if I didn't have a recording of that call, you wouldn't have been able to do it,' he said. 'That is correct, yes.' Tim, who works as a senior IT analyst for a large company, posted about his experience with Comcast on Reddit and received a deluge of people with similar experiences. Last . month, Comcast made headlines after another customer recorded and . published a phone call with customer service. In that call, a Comcast . rep refused to let a couple cancel their service when they wanted to . switch cable and Internet providers. A . leaked memo reveals that high-ranking executives at Comcast admit the . excruciating customer service call that recently went viral was mostly . their fault. The company's chief operating officer Dave Watson says in his memo that the nagging, begging and condescending endured for 18 minutes by Ryan Block was part of what Comcast paid and trained the employee to do. 'It was painful to listen to this call, and I am not surprised that we have been criticized for it,' Watson says in the document first leaked to Consumerist. The memo . surfaced just a week after the call to Engadget founder Ryan Block - who . recorded it and put it on Soundcloud, where it's now been played over 5 . million times - went viral. 'We . are embarrassed by the tone of the call and the lack of sensitivity to . the customer’s desire to discontinue service,' Watson wrote. Comcast is currently seeking regulatory . approval to buy Time Warner Cable for $45 billion, a deal that would . make the largest cable company in the world even bigger.

"Scientists claim that eating lots of sugar (illustrated) and other carbohydrates, harms both the brain's structure and function . A diet high in sugar could be damaging your brain as well as inflating your waistline, scientists have warned. In the past research has linked sugary foods with obesity but a new study has now found the risks associated with a sugar laden diet could have more widespread health implications, eating away at a person's brain power. A team at Charité University Medical Centre in Berlin found eating lots of sugar and other carbohydrates harms both the brain's physical structure as well as its function. They discovered high levels of glucose are associated with worse memory in healthy adults and could poetntially lead to more people suffering dementia. The new research backs up previous studies, which have shown that diabetes - characterised by high levels of blood glucose - has been linked to an increased risk of dementia, Scientific American reported. Experts have also previously found that high blood sugar levels are linked to a smaller hippocampus, which is an area of the brain used for remembering events and facts. AS part of the new study, scientists wanted to find out whether glucose has a negative effect on memory in healthy people without diabetes. They looked at short-term and long-term glucose markers in 141 healthy adults without any signs of diabetes, who took a memory test. The participants also underwent an MRI scan to examine the structure of their hippocampus. The experiment revealed that higher glucose blood levels were linked with bad memory as well as a smaller hippocampus. Agnes . Flöel, a neurologist at Charité and co-author of the study, said . the results ‘provide further evidence that glucose might directly . contribute to hippocampal atrophy'. However, she said the study cannot confirm a causal relation between brain health and eating lots of sugar. Scientists will explore whether dietary and lifestyle changes might reverse changes in the brain. Experts recently urged people to halve their sugar intake to just five teaspoons a day, in order to tackle soaring obesity levels. Guidelines from scientists advising Public Health England - the agency given the job of tackling obesity - said that women should have no more than five to six teaspoons of sugar a day, and men seven to eight. The experiment revealed that higher glucose blood levels were linked with bad memory and a physically smaller hippocampus (shown in red) that is responsible for long-term memory . Currently, Britons consume an average of 15 teaspoons daily, mainly due to the high volumes of sugar hidden in everyday items such as fruit juice, muesli, yoghurts, sandwiches and ready meals. Senior doctors and academics want the Government to force food manufacturers to cut sugar levels, ensure products are clearly labelled and impose a tax on soft drinks, but so far, options are only being considered. In the meantime, experts are advising parents to ban fruit juice, squash and soft drinks from the dinner table and give their children only water and milk. While some parents think that fruit juice is healthy, nutritionists have pointed out that it has played a part in fuelling sharp rises in obesity rates, type 2 diabetes and heart disease. A typical teenager consumes 40 per cent more sugar than they should and Adults take in 13 per cent too much. A study published in the British Medical Journal last month, claims that more than one in three adults have 'pre-diabetes,' a term used to indicate that a person has raised sugar levels and is therefore at a greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes, which develops in adulthood, can shave six years off a person's life. Previous studies have shown that diabetes, which is characterised by high levels of blood glucose, has been linked to an increased risk of dementia (illustrated with a stock image) Diabetes UK said that more than 280,000 people a year are diagnosed with diabetes ¿ the equivalent of the population of Newcastle upon Tyne . New figures show hundreds of people are diagnosed with diabetes every day in Britain. Diabetes UK said that more than 280,000 people a year are diagnosed with diabetes – the equivalent of the population of Newcastle upon Tyne. Each day 738 people are told that they have type 2 diabetes – which is linked to being overweight – and 30 are diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, which is not linked to weight. About 3.8million people in the UK now have the condition and about 35 per cent of the population have borderline diabetes. Diabetes UK has called for more focus on preventing type 2 diabetes, saying that if the rate of people developing the condition continues the consequences could be ‘disastrous’. The charity’s chief executive,  Barbara Young, said: ‘It is deeply worrying that more than 700 people a day are being diagnosed with diabetes and this clearly shows the frightening scale of what is fast becoming a national health emergency. ‘If we continue to see people being diagnosed at this rate then the consequences will be disastrous. ‘As the number of people with diabetes grows, we are likely to see even more people endure devastating health complications such as amputation and kidney failure and more people die tragically young. 'It would also lead to an increase in NHS costs that would be simply unsustainable. As a country, we are still not giving diabetes healthcare the priority it needs and we also need to get much better at preventing type 2 diabetes before it is too late.’","Scientists at the Charité University Medical Centre in Berlin claim sugar and carbohydrates harm the brain's structure and function .

Arfield’s effort in particular was superb. The winger, who briefly stunned Chelsea here with a cracker in the opening game of the season, does not do ordinary goals. The Burnley and Queens Park Rangers teams walk out at Turf Moor to begin their Premier League clash on Saturday afternoon . Dutchman Leroy Fer takes down the ball for QPR with Burnley's George Boyd (right) watching on at Turf Moor . There appeared to be little danger when the winger collected a throw-in tight on the left-hand touchline in the 12th minute, but he slipped the ball past Mauricio Isla, cut inside Dunne, then curled an inch-perfect shot wide of Robert Green and inside the far post. Burnley manager Sean Dyche said: ‘Scotty Arfield’s goal is tremendous, two nutmegs and a great finish. If Alexis Sanchez had scored that it would have been shown a thousand times on TV this weekend. We’ll be lucky to get 15. ‘A lot is made about the energy and desire of the team and the tactical understanding, but we do have some quality and it doesn’t always get a mention.’ Harry Redknapp had a rather different take on it as he bemoaned his team’s defending. ‘We’ve got three men around their guy,’ he said. ‘We’re not talking about Lionel Messi are we? He has gone past three of us far too easy.’ Redknapp had sprung a surprise by naming Adel Taarabt in his line-up, tucked in behind Austin. It was the Moroccan’s first Premier League start of the season and, perhaps more significantly, his first appearance since falling out with his manager in October after Redknapp had accused him of being ‘three stones overweight’.

However, it was always likely to be Austin who would make an impact against his old club and the striker had already hit the post when he earned the penalty that brought QPR level just after the half-hour. Eduardo Vargas played the ball into the box again and Austin took control of it before guiding the ball away from Jason Shackell. Dean Marney unwisely stepped in with an outstretched leg and his former team-mate did not need any further encouragement to take a clumsy fall. Andre Marriner made the right decision pointing to the spot but the Burnley fans booed Austin and chanted ‘cheat’ after he got up to rifle the penalty past Tom Heaton for his 14th goal of the season. Burnley hit back when Ashley Barnes lifted the ball forward for Ings in the 37th minute and Stephen Caulker looked favourite to win possession as it bounced on the edge of his own box. However, Ings touched the ball away from him and turned past Dunne before slipping the ball through the defender’s legs and past Green.

QPR defenders watch on as keeper Rob Green just misses out on saving Danny Ings' left-footed strike from the centre of the box . ‘A top-drawer goal,’ said Dyche. Again Redknapp disagreed. ‘It’s a shocking second goal, an horrendous one to give away,’ he said. ‘You’ve got to be stronger in that situation. It has cost us dearly.’ Green pulled off a string of fine saves in the second half and when Barnes put the ball in his net it was ruled out for a foul on the former England goalkeeper. No matter. Burnley closed out a win that could prove vital in the survival scrap. For QPR and Redknapp, however, it could have the opposite effect.

Prices grew by almost 20 per cent this year in the capital, compared to less than four per cent in the north-east. David Newnes, director of Reeds Rains and Your Move estate agents, said: ‘A north/south divide in the field remains evident in the race back from the debris of the financial crash.’ The average house price in the UK was £274,000 in August, according to the ONS, a record high after rising almost 12 per cent this year.

A first-time buyer typically now has to pay £210,000 for a starter home. Howard Archer, of IHS Global Insight, said despite the ‘robust’ price rises, growth was likely to become more restrained this winter. Toughened lending rules came into force in April under the Mortgage Market Review (MMR), which forced lenders to grill mortgage applicants about their spending habits to ensure they could afford their repayments. This had a dampening effect on the market. Dr Archer said buyer interest would also be ‘constrained’ as prices in parts of the UK became unaffordable, amid low wage growth.

"A professor of neuroeconomics at a university in Georgia has discovered that dogs have emotion, just like humans. Gregory Berns, a professor of neuroeconomics at Emory University, Atlanta, who has been testing the results of MRI scans on his dog’s brain, has discovered that our canine friends use the same part of the brain as humans to ‘feel’. His initial goal was to determine how dogs’ brains work and what they think of humans, according to the New York Times. Dog feelings: Canines have emotions just like humans, shows new research . Dog's life: Yes, they like to slobber. But it doesn't mean they don't have feelings . Months of research: Gregory Berns, a professor at neuroeconomics at Emory University, Atlanta, has discovered that dogs have emotion . By looking directly at their brains and bypassing the constraints of behaviourism, MRIs can tell humans about dogs’ internal states. People usually do not enjoy MRI scans and you have to hold completely still during the procedure. In conventional veterinary practice, animals are put under anaesthetic so they don’t move during a scan. 'But that means they can’t study their brain functions, at least, not anything interesting like perception or emotion,' says Berns. He started training his own dog, Callie, a skinny black terrier mix from the southern Appalachians, to go into the MRI simulator he had built in his living room. With the help of his friend, Mark Spivak, a dog trainer, the dog learned to place her head in a custom-fitted chin rest and hold rock-still for up to 30 seconds. MRI scans: The dogs had their brain functions scanned by MRI machines . Their study, published in the Behavioural Processes, involved training a dozen dogs to remain motionless, while unsedated and unrestrained, in an MRI machine . Months of training: Mark Spivak, a dog trainer, helped Berns to teach the dogs how to lie completely still in the MRI machine for up to 30 seconds . Maps of brain activity: The scans  at first determined which parts of the dogs' brain distinguished the scents of familiar and unfamiliar dogs and humans . After months of training and some trial-and-error at the real MRI scanner, they were rewarded with the first maps of brain activity and managed to determine which parts of her brain distinguished the scents of familiar and unfamiliar dogs and humans. He found there was a striking similarity between dogs and humans in both the structure and function of a key brain region: the caudate nucleus. The caudate sits between the brainstem and the cortex and is rich in dopamine receptors. In humans, the caudate plays a key role in the anticipation of things we enjoy, like food, love and money, according to Berns. In dogs, the research found that activity in the caudate increased in response to hand signals indicating food. The caudate also activated to the smells of familiar humans. And in preliminary tests, it activated to the return of an owner who had momentarily stepped out of view. 'Do these findings prove that dogs love us? Not quite. But many of the same things that activate the human caudate, which are associated with positive emotions, also activate the dog caudate,' said Berns. Neuroscientists call this a functional homology, and it may be an indication of canine emotions. The ability to experience positive emotions, like love and attachment, would mean that dogs have a level of sentience comparable to that of a human child. Same part of the brain: Research found that activity in the dog's caudate increased in response to the return of an owner who had momentarily stepped out of view . Same same: The things that activate the human caudate, which are associated with positive emotions, also activate the dog caudate. Berns says it should be a step towards changing the way we treat dogs . Berns believes this begs a change in the way humans think about dogs, which have long been considered property. Though the Animal Welfare Act of 1966 raised the bar for the treatment of animals, they solidified the view that animals are things — objects that can be disposed of as long as reasonable care is taken to minimise their suffering. He suggest the idea that, since the Supreme Court has already included neuroscientific findings in some cases showing brain imaging to determine whether someone is mature in adolescence, then ‘perhaps someday we may see a case arguing for a dog’s rights based on brain-imaging findings’.","Gregory Berns, a professor of neuroeconomics at Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia, says dogs use the same area of the brain as humans do to feel .
Berns' research is the result of months of MRI scans on dogs who are not sedated but trained to sit perfectly still in the machine .
The results show that dogs use the caudate nucleus part of the brain when responding to humans they know .
It is the same part of the brain humans use in the anticipation of things we enjoy, like food, love and money .

"Doctors have reported a surge in cases of ‘digital dementia’ among young people. They say that teenagers have become so reliant on digital technology they are no longer able to remember everyday details such as their phone numbers. South Korean experts have found that those who rely more on technology suffer a deterioration in cognitive abilities more commonly seen in patients who have suffered a head injury or psychiatric illness. Experts blame technology for 'digital dementia'. The number of people aged between 10 and 19 who use their smartphones for more than seven hours every day has leapt by 18.4 per cent . ‘Over-use of smartphones and game devices hampers the balanced development of the brain,’ Byun Gi-won, a doctor at the Balance Brain Centre in Seoul, told the JoongAng Daily newspaper. South Korea is one of the most digital nations in the world and internet addiction, among both adults and children, was recognised as far back as the late 90s, says a report in The Telegraph. ‘Heavy [technology] users are likely to develop the left side of their brains, leaving the right side untapped or underdeveloped,’ he said. The right side of the brain is associated with concentration and underdevelopment affects attention and memory span, which could in as many as 15 per cent of cases lead to the early onset of dementia. Byun Gi-won, a doctor at the Balance Brain Centre in Seoul, said that overusing smartphones and gaming devices hampered brain dvelopment . Sufferers are also reported to suffer from emotional underdevelopment, with children more at risk than adults because their brains are still growing. The situation appears to be worsening with the percentage of people aged between 10 and 19 who use their smartphones for more than seven hours every day leaping to 18.4 per cent - an increase of seven per cent from last year. The Korean findings come after a study, carried out by UCLA, found that young people were increasingly suffering from memory problems. The research, published earlier this month, found that 14 per cent of young men and women between aged 18 and 39 complained that their memory was poor. The U.S. study blamed modern lifestyles for the problem -  saying that spending time on a computer and texting prevents people focussing and memorising information. They also blamed stress, saying hectic lifestyles prevent concentration information retention.","South Korean experts have a noticed surge in teenagers with poor memory .

"The message from the Aston Villa fans was all too clear as they crashed to another defeat: 'We want Lambert out,' they chanted. There was some murmuring of discontent during last week's narrow 1-0 FA Cup win over Blackpool but nothing like this with boss Paul Lambert also taunted with 'You don't know what you're doing' after he substituted Carlos Sanchez.

For Konchesky it was a moment to remember, as he drilled home after nemesis Alan Hutton had failed to clear Leo Ulloa's hopeful cross. It came only a month after the former England left back was sent off – later rescinded – for clashing with the right back at Villa Park and this was another fiery encounter with Matty James and Ciaran Clark both sent off late. Marc Albrighton made only his second start for Leicester following his summer move from Villa as Nigel Pearson opted for an attacking system with Anthony Knockaert occupying the other flank and Ulloa and Dave Nugent operating up-front.

Villa's Gabriel Agbonlahor attempts to block the pass of Foxes' Danny Simpson as Leicester claims a valuable three points . It was the hosts who defied their league position to take control of this game with Nugent seeing an early shot deflected wide from Danny Simpson's cross. Leicester really should have taken the lead on 13 minutes from a delightful break. Knockaert's powerful long ball was well controlled by Albrighton whose run picked out Nugent who somehow sidefooted wide with Knockaert also queuing up to score behind him. Pearson's side missed another good chance as Nugent headed wide from almost on the goal-line as Ulloa headed on Knockaert's cross. David Nugent misses a golden opportunity for Leicester as Villa's American keeper Brad Guzan makes himself big . Villa could have capitalised on Leicester's failure to take advantage of their early chance as Gabby Agbonlahor caught the home defence napping but shot well wide. Then Tom Cleverley saw an effort deflected into the hands of Ben Hamer, preferred in goal to Mark Schwarzer, from the edge of the area while Jores Okore blazed well over from Ashley Westwood's corner. But Leicester finished the half strongly with Nugent seeing a volley from the edge of the area come back off the bar with the headed rebound from Ulloa going over. They got their goal in the first minute of stoppage time to Konchesky's delight. It was his fifth goal in 146 Foxes appearances. Leicester continued where they had left off at the start of the second half with Brad Guzan spectacularly saving to keep out Matty James' header from Albrighton's cross. From the resulting James corner Westwood's header nearly went into his own net. Villa fans had had enough as they chanted 'we want Lambert out' and they cheered ironically when Christian Benteke shot tamely at goal. They had Guzan to thank again when he saved well from Albrighton who had burst through to run onto a Nugent pass. Villa were fortunate not to concede a penalty as Westwood appeared to foul Ulloa in the area as he shaped to shoot from Knockaert's pass.

"Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard has been accused of spinning a yarn after a PR stunt to show off her domestic skills unravelled yesterday. The Welsh-born leader came under fire for incongruous photos showing her knitting a toy kangaroo present for Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge’s baby. The photo-shoot for Australian Women’s Weekly show the prime minister  - often criticised for her perceived lack of homemaking instincts -  sat in an armchair surrounded by balls of wool and her dog Reuben faithfully by her feet. Australian PM Julia Gillard has been attacked for the pictures in Women's Weekly knitting a kangeroo, meant as a gift for Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge's baby . ‘It’s a cute project to work on,’ she said. ‘In terms of knitting for Kate’s baby - I knit for babies, in part, because they are smaller projects. ‘I’ve got not that much time in my life. You can get them done and there’s a sense of satisfaction in having completed it,’ she added. But the pictures of homely bliss caused her critics to drop their stitches. They dismissed the domesticated scene as a ‘contrived’, saying Gillard has long made a habit of rejecting feminine presentations. One columnist wrote she was  ‘giving encouragement to young female politicians by plying a hobby now synonymous with mad old aunts.’ Nationals Senator Fiona Nash said the photos showed ‘a lack of connection’ with the Australian public. Gillard, pictured with the Queen, is a republican and has been criticised for making a present for the baby . Gillard has been subjected to several personal attacks recently including being questioned live on radio about the sexuality of her partner Tim Mathieson . The PM’s press office insisted it was . not just a PR opportunity -  even though the magazine said the idea for . the shoot came from her spin doctors. Christopher Pyne, Liberal MP, told reporters: 'We know the prime minister is good at spinning a yarn - and now we have the picture to prove it.' Gillard, 51, from, Barry, Vale of Glamorgan, has been subjected to several personal attacks recently. The sexuality of her partner was questioned by an Australian radio host and barbed comments have been aimed at her figure - with friends saying she is the victim of infamous Australian male chauvinism. Others questioned how her knitting for the royal baby sat with her strong republican stance. 'I campaigned for a yes case. We will get there again,' she told the magazine. 'There is a real sense of respect for the Queen, so I do think a natural moment to look again will be when her reign comes to an end. ‘Prince William and Kate, and their child will still be personalities in Australia; people will still follow their lives with interest,’ she said.","Gillard has been criticised for photoshoot for Australian Women's Weekly .

"ISIS controls a vast compound in Iraq containing 2,500 rusting chemical weapons rockets, according to the Iraqi government. The site was bombed by the US during the 1991 Gulf War, but the munitions there were only partially destroyed, according to the UN - then left to Iraq to take care of. However, Iraqi officials wrote to the United Nations this summer claiming that abandoned weapons containing the lethal nerve agent Sarin are still in the ruins of the Muthanna State Establishment, which made chemical weapons in the 1980s and early 1990s, and that this is now in the hands of the violent jihadists. They warned that they had watched equipment there being looted on CCTV. A CIA picture of the Muthanna State Establishment, which produced chemical weapons on an industrial scale .

A U.S. Army Third Infantry Division soldier loads materials discovered in an explosives laboratory hidden in a home April 15, 2003 in Baghdad, Iraq . Militants then shut the surveillance cameras at the depot down, the New York Times reported. Iraq's UN Ambassador Mohamed Ali Alhakim wrote to the UN saying that 'armed terrorist groups' took over the Muthanna complex, which lies 60 miles north of Baghdad, on June 11. In a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, Ambassador Mohamed Ali Alhakim said remnants of a former chemical weapons programme are kept in two bunkers there. 'The project management spotted at dawn on Thursday, 12 June 2014, through the camera surveillance system, the looting of some of the project equipment and appliances, before the terrorists disabled the surveillance system,' Alhakim wrote in the letter dated June 30. 'The Government of Iraq requests the States Members of the United Nations to understand the current inability of Iraq, owing to the deterioration of the security situation, to fulfill its obligations to destroy chemical weapons,' he said. The Muthanna complex measures three by three miles and was thought to be capable of producing around 4,000 tonnes of nerve agent a year. Alhakim singled out the capture of bunkers 13 and 41 in the sprawling complex 35 miles (56 kilometers) northwest of Baghdad in the notorious 'Sunni Triangle.' The last major report by U.N. inspectors on the status of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction program was released about a year after the experts left in March 2003. It states that Bunker 13 contained 2,500 sarin-filled 122-mm chemical rockets produced and filled before 1991, and about 180 tons of sodium cyanide, 'a very toxic chemical and a precursor for the warfare agent tabun.' However, U.S. Defence Department spokesman Rear Admiral John Kirby said earlier that the United States' best understanding was that 'whatever material was kept there is pretty old and not likely to be able to be accessed or used against anyone right now'. 'We aren't viewing this particular site and their holding it as a major issue at this point,' Kirby said. 'Should they even be able to access the materials, frankly, it would likely be more of a threat to them than anyone else.' It was revealed this week that about 5,000 chemical weapons were recovered or destroyed in Iraq following the 2003 invasion but the Pentagon chose to keep the findings top secret. An investigation by The New York Times has revealed that U.S. forces happened across the hidden caches of warheads, shells and aviation bombs between 2004 and 2011. Secrets: In 2002 President George W. Bush said Hussein was developing a program of chemical weapons but no evidence of such weapons was ever found . But the information wasn't made public for several embarrassing reasons including the fact some of the weapons were U.S.-made, plus they had been sitting dormant since the early 1980s and therefore didn't support President George W. Bush's rationale for going to war. The weapons - most of them mustard agents in 155-millimeter artillery shells or 122-millimeter rockets - were developed by Saddam Hussein during the Iran-Iraq war which raged between 1980 and 1988. But on September 12, 2002, President Bush had contended that Hussein was developing new chemical weapons capable of 'mass destruction'. 'Right now, Iraq is expanding and improving facilities that were used for the production of biological weapons,' he said. But all the weapons found had been developed before 1991. In March 2003, President Bush received a mandate from the U.S. Congress to lead an invasion of Iraq, asserting that Iraq was in violation of UN Security Council Resolution 1441. With strong support from British P.M. Tony Blair, the Bush administration claimed that Sadam and his forces were in possession of weapons of mass destruction that posed a threat to U.S. security and that of allies including the U.K. and Australia. After investigation following the invasion, the U.S. led Iraq Survey Group concluded that Iraq had ended its nuclear, chemical and biological programs in 1991 and had no active programs at the time of the invasion, but that they intended to resume production if the Iraq sanctions were lifted. Although no active chemical weapons program was found, at least 17 U.S. troops and 7 Iraqi police officers were burned or wounded when chemical devices exploded. President Bush later said that the biggest regret of his presidency was 'the intelligence failure' in Iraq, while the Senate Intelligence Committee found in 2008 that his administration 'misrepresented the intelligence and the threat from Iraq'. The U.S. completed its withdrawal of military personnel in December 2011, during the ninth year of the war. The rise of ISIS means that the U.S. will send an army headquarters to Iraq for the first time in three years to assist local security forces struggling to resist advances by the fundamentalist group. Another reason for the cover-up, according to The Times, was that five of the six chemical weapons encounters involved weapons designed by the U.S. '''Nothing of significance'' is what I was ordered to say,' said Jarrod Lampier, a now-retired Army major who was present when forces found 2,400 nerve agent rockets in 2006 - the largest chemical weapons discovery of the war. Soldiers were also loathe to report finding the caches as documenting chemical weapons added hours of extra work to their load. Chemical warfare specialists had to be called in, and waiting for them to arrive put coalition forces in dangerous positions. 'I could wait all day for tech escort to show up and make a chem round disappear, or I could just make it disappear myself,' one ex-soldier told The Times. The mustard shells could be put in with other explosives that needed to be destructed and then detonated. However, handling chemical weapons lead to many injuries, which were not taken seriously by military doctors at the time. Many explosive ordnance disposal personnel were not aware that the shells they were handling contained chemicals, believing them to be regular old artillery. At least 17 American military personnel and seven Iraqi police were sickened by poisons - usually sarin and mustard gases.

Many of the shells would leak liquid during transportation, exposing the soldiers to the potentially-lethal fumes. Symptoms ranged from disorientation and nausea to blindness and huge, seething blisters. Jarrod Taylor, a former Army sergeant on hand for the destruction of mustard shells that burned two soldiers in his infantry company, joked of 'wounds that never happened' from 'that stuff that didn't exist'.

"Winning an Olympic gold should be a moment of great joy for any athlete at London 2012. But for Chinese diver Wu Minxia securing her golden hat-trick on Sunday at the Aquatic Centre in east London was followed by shock and sadness. Straight after a triumph in the women's Synchronised 3m Springboard that made her a legend in her sport, the 26-year-old's  family decided it was the right time to tell her a devastating family secret. Tinged with sadness: Minxia Wu of China celebrates her gold medal in women's Synchronised 3m Springboard. She was then told the devastating secret . They admitted to their daughter that her grandparents died - over a year ago. And instead of telling her, they kept it back. Wu's family also revealed that her mother had been battling breast cancer for several years, something Wu had no idea about. The reasoning was clear: they wanted her to win at all costs and didn't want family matters to interfere with her diving career. Winners: Wu Minxia (left) and her diving partner He Zi wave to spectators after receiving their medals . Wu, who with teammate He Zi won the last two synchronised gold medals in Athens and Beijing, was an overwhelming favourite to win gold again and successfully lead China's quest to unite every Olympic and world diving gold medal. She was under intense pressure to succeed - and so were her family. Father Wu Yuming said: 'It was essential to tell this white lie.' Wu began diving training at the age of six, and left home at 16, bound for a government aquatic training institute. She is one of her sport's brightest stars, and part of that is thanks to the price paid in her personal life. 'We accepted a long time ago that she doesn't belong entirely to us,' Wu Yuming told the Shanghai Morning Post. 'I don't even dare to think about things like enjoying family happiness.' Wu's mother defended her decision by . saying she decided to wait until her breast cancer was in remission . before breaking the news to her daughter of her condition. The admission has sparked a debate in China over the country's win-at-all-costs mentality when it comes to the Olympics. The . pursuit of success has been publicly chased by the government-backed . sports national sports program with unshakeable zeal over the past two . decades. In a country . where messages of congratulations from the government to athletes . through the state news agency are only sent to gold medalists, not those . winning silver or bronze, there now seems to be a backlash against this mentality. The revelations about Wu followed fierce criticism from a national . newspaper when a 17-year-old weightlifter failed to medal.

"A leading feminist writer has claimed that Rihanna is the new Princess Diana in a highly controversial article which argues the pair share a ‘ravishingly seductive flirtation’ with the press. Camille Paglia, an American author and lecturer, said the late Diana and the 24-year-old Bajan superstar were both adept at using every photo opportunity to convey ‘allure, defiance or revenge.’ She argues that the messages are drawn from the pair’s turbulent romantic life, then targets their respective partners Prince Charles and Chris Brown. A leading feminist writer has claimed that Rihanna is the new Princess Diana in a highly controversial article which argues the pair share a ‘ravishingly seductive flirtation’ with the press . Writing in The Sunday Times magazine, Paglia added that both women were victims of a ‘festering romantic triangle and had transformed themselves from ' sensitive, wounded, but appealingly bubbly and good-natured provincial girls' into living sculptures for the lens. She said:  'Not since Diana rocketed from a shy, plump kindergarten aide to a lean, mean fashion machine has there been such a ravishingly seductive flirtation with the world press.' Ms Paglia, who has in past essays accused Taylor Swift and Katy Perry of killing feminism with their 'insipid, bleached-out personas', compared an iconic 'stage-managed' image of a lonely Diana at the Taj Mahal after the breakdown of her marriage with a shot of Rihanna on her balcony in Barbados, in turmoil over her relationship with Chris Brown. She argues that the messages are drawn from the pair¿s turbulent romantic life, the targets their respective partners Prince Charles and Chris Brown (pictured here with Rihanna at the Grammy awards) Camille Paglia, an American author and lecturer, said the late Diana and the 24 year old Bajan superstar were both adept at using every photo opportunity to convey 'allure, defiance or revenge' She also drew parallels with the childhoods of the two women. Both emerged from broken homes. Rihanna was raised in a bungalow in Barbados, and witnessed her father battle a crack cocaine addiction and abuse her mother. Diana Frances Spencer, was born on July 1, 1961, at Park House near Sandringham, Norfolk - the youngest daughter of the then Viscount and Viscountess Althorp. Her parents divorced when she was six. Ms Paglia said Rihanna's self-released shots - many of which were published to millions of fans on her Twitter feed -  have a 'genuinely artistic atmospheric eroticism' the like of which has 'not been seen in decades.' She used a shot of Rihanna completely naked from the waist down lolling in front of a fireplace smoking and drinking, and with a fur blanket slung over her head as an example of her 'impressive visual archive'. Ms Paglia said some of Rihanna's more candid shots were reminiscent of the work of Kathy Keeton - a South African ballet dancer who once edited Viva and whose fashion editor was Anna Wintour. She said the fireplace photos evoked European art films which featured enchantresses Jeanne Moreau and Delphine Seyrig. Diana in front of the Taj Mahal, during a Royal tour of India in 1992. Ms Paglia has compared the 'stage managed' image of Diana looking lonely and wistful, with shot of Rihanna on her balcony in Barbados . Rihanna was pictured on her balcony in Barbados over Christmas while in turmoil over her relationship with Chris Brown . She said both women were the victims of a . 'festering love triangle' - Rihanna, between her Brown and his one time . girlfriend Karrueche Tran - and Diana with Prince Charles and Camilla, . now his second wife . She concludes that while Diana, 'rebuffed' but eventually accepted her exile, Rihanna, in the 'classic syndrome of the battered woman, still pities and hopes to change and save her abuser.' Rihanna reconciled with partner Chris Brown in 2012, while he was still on probation for attacking her in 2009. In an interview with Oprah Winfrey, Rihanna described Chris as the 'love of my life' and opened up about her complicated feelings for the man who was convicted of assaulting her at a pre Grammy's party. She revealed she had forgiven him for the brutal attack and felt she was the only one who could help him. Ms Paglia said Rihanna's self-released shots - many of which were published to millions of fans on her Twitter feed -  have a 'genuinely artistic atmospheric eroticism' the like of which has 'not been seen in decades' She admitted: 'I thought I hated Chris and I realised it was love that was tarnished. 'It looked like hate because it was ugly, it was angry, it was inflamed, it was tainted and I realised that what it was. I had to forgive him because I cared about him still. And the minute I let go of that, I started living again.' Born Robyn Rihanna Fenty in Barbados, the young singer was given her big break in 2003 when she was introduced to music producer Evan Rogers, who was on holiday in Barbados at the time. After hearing the youngster sing, the producer her to New York to record a demo. Soon she was signed to the label of hip hop megastar Jay Z and shot to international stardom. Lady Diana Spencer experienced a similarly rapid rise to fame - from one of her first tastes of press attention as she innocently posed aged 20 outside Young England Kindergarten in Pimlico, to the many photocalls - staged and otherwise - which followed in the next 17 years of her life. Diana, who died in a car accident in a Paris underpass along with her lover Dodi Fayed, would be 51 years old had she survived the crash in 1997. Ms Paglia declared Madonna the future of feminism 20 years ago. She . has since launched attacks on Katy Perry and Taylor Swift for killing . feminism, and Lady Gaga for being 'stripped of genuine eroticism.' Camille Paglia, is a self styled 'dissident feminist', outspoken on pop culture, and who has been described as a feminist bete noire. The 65-year-old has been a professor at The University of the Arts in Philadelphia, PA since 1984, but  came to attention with the publication of her first book, 'Sexual Personae', in 1990, when she also began writing about popular culture and feminism in mainstream newspapers and magazines. It is these articles which have propelled Paglia to the controversial figure she is today. One scathing attack saw her conclude that Katy Perry and Taylor Swift, have 'insipid, bleached-out personas' that hark back to the man-pleasing, pre-feminist era. In an article for The Hollywood Reporter, she wrote that as a result, many of today's young women fail to realize the role their sexuality plays in society and 'partying till you drop has gotten as harmless as a Rotary Club meeting'. She said: 'Swift’s meandering, snippy songs make 16-year-old Lesley Gore’s 1963 hit It’s My Party (And I’ll Cry if I Want to) seem like a towering masterpiece of social commentary, psychological drama and shapely concision. 'Indeed, without her mannequin posturing at industry events, it’s doubtful that Swift could have attained her high profile.' She cuttingly described Perry as a 'manic cyborg cheerleader'. Paglia previously slammed Lady Gaga, insisting her over-the-top sexuality is actually 'stripped of genuine eroticism'. She said the star's willingness to dress in crazy outfits as an example of 'every public appearance... has been lavishly scripted in advance'.","Camille .

"CLICK HERE to read the full match report . Alan Pardew praised the professional attitude of his Crystal Palace players compared to his former Newcastle charges after making a winning start on his return to Selhurst Park. The Eagles came from behind to defeat Tottenham 2-1 in front of home fans after the new manager challenged his team to be more adventurous. 'I only have one criticism, which is a strange one for the manager to make - they are too honest, too straight. You can't win Premier League games if you are too disciplined,' he said. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Alan Pardew: Mike Ashley texted to hail 'great result' Alan Pardew celebrated his return to Selhurst Park with victory over Tottenham . Crystal Palace moved out of the Premier League relegation zone after coming back to win 2-1 . 'You have to take chances, take risks. You have to have a few maverick players, the player I brought on in the second half (Wilfried Zaha)... that's what the team needs. 'There's a fantastic set of professionals here, I haven't had one fine this week and I'm finding that very unusual as a Newcastle manager - because we used to fine players every 42minutes! 'I'm not being disrespectful to Newcastle players, it's just different set up. I just want to free this team up a little bit and if we do that we could play like we did in the last 20 minutes. Pardew described falling behind to Tottenham as 'the best thing that happened' as his  side moved out of the Barclays Premier League relegation zone.. Dwight Gayle celebrates after bringing Crystal Palace level with a second half penalty . Pardew revealed he had to fine one of his former Newcastle players every 42minutes . In what was Pardew's first home match since taking the reins, Spurs looked set to spoil his return to Selhurst Park when they took the lead early in the second half through Harry Kane. But a penalty from Dwight Gayle and Jason Puncheon's low strike turned things around, with the Eagles ending a winless run in the league stretching back to November 23. Pardew told Sky Sports: 'It feels really great for everybody. 'This team has got the shackles on and the exuberance they had at the back end of last year, I knew it wasn't something we were going to get out of them unless we got a goal. 'We started poorly but that wasn't the approach. That's sometimes how the mindset is. So at half-time I managed to get into them and it kind of kicked in a little bit, ironically when Spurs scored. It might sound a bit strange but it was probably the best thing that happened to us.' Eagles midfielder Jason Puncheon screams with delight after scoring the winner .

'The decision contributed because we controlled the game for 65minutes and then the penalty changed the game, ' he said. 'Sure we made a mistake afterwards but the penalty decision was key. 'I don't know if Stambouli got the ball but it is difficult to give an opinion because my players say he didn't touch the player.

"After the travel chaos which preceded the game perhaps Jay McEveley can be forgiven for the erratic hand gestures at the back-post. Was he hailing a cab? Or stopping a Routemaster? Sheffield United were 18 minutes from a clean sheet in the first leg of this Capital One Cup semi-final, when McEveley challenged Roberto Soldado for a deep cross. First his right-hand went up in a hopeful appeal for offside and then his left hand swung through the line of the ball, clearing it somewhere into the crowd. Andros Townsend jumps for joy after scoring from the penalty spot to give Tottenham a first-leg lead over Sheffield United . Jay McEveley handled the ball inside his own penalty area in the 74th minute to give Tottenham a penalty . Townsend stepped up to the spot and coolly converted to put Tottenham ahead with just over 15 minutes to play . Tottenham: Vorm 6, Walker 6, Dier 6.5, Vertonghen 6, Davies 5, Stambouli 7 (Paulinho 75), Mason 5.5 (Dembele 65, 6), Townsend 8, Kane 6, Eriksen 6, Adebayor 5 (Soldado 65, 6). Subs Not Used: Rose, Kaboul, Lennon, Friedel. Booked: Adebayor. Goals: Townsend (pen) 74. Sheff Utd: Howard 6.5, Flynn 6, Basham 6, McEveley 5, Harris 7, Doyle 6, Reed 7, Campbell-Ryce 7, Scougall 6 (Kieran Wallace 87), Murphy 5.5, McNulty 7 (Baxter 83). Subs Not Used: Alcock, Higdon, Turner, Kennedy, Adams. Booked: McEveley. Att: 35,323 . Ref: Neil Swarbrick (Lancashire). Ratings by MARTHA KELNER . Helped by his assistant, referee Neil Swarbrick awarded the penalty and Andros Townsend stepped forward to smash Tottenham into the lead with a confident strike and give them a glimpse of Wembley. That was all that separated the League One team from their Barclays Premier League hosts. Overall, Spurs were probably worth the narrow victory having dominated the game while rarely troubling Sheffield United goalkeeper Mark Howard, but this tie is not over. Nigel Clough’s side proved that they are not short on belief. The game ended with them on the attack in search of an equaliser, and they coped well with pre-match problems which saw the game delayed because United’s team-bus was stuck on the congested streets of north London. Travel issues aside, the South Yorkshire team must have made their way to White Hart Lane in confident mood, having reached the semi-finals of last season’s FA Cup and beaten West Ham and Southampton on the road to the same stage of this competition. They have not reached a major final since 1936, and Clough has acquired a giant-killing knack. There was no inferiority complex as they opened at a strong tempo, hustling Spurs, refusing to let them settle. In midfield they snapped into tackles and spreading the ball wide and goalkeeper Howard launched it forward with great gusto when given the chance. Jamie Murphy enjoyed early flickers of success against Kyle Walker, Tottenham’s former Sheffield United defender, as the 4,000 visiting fans sang: 'Kyle Walker, he wants us to win'. Michael Doyle lashed one effort over in the chaos of the first 10 minutes, before the Premier League side were able to impose any degree of control. Tottenham striker Emmanuel Adebayor, who was jeered by fans, tries to evade the challenge from Sheffield United's Michael Doyle . Spurs winger  Townsend turns away from pressure from Sheffield United's McEveley . Even then, it was unconvincing. Adebayor, starting for the first time since early November, was unable to link up and allowed his frustrations to boil over when he flung an arm at Louis Reed a few yards from the Sheffield United bench. Clough and his coaching staff reacted angrily. They were certain an elbow had been thrown with intent as Reed crashed to the deck. There was certainly heavy contact, although it was Adebayor’s left hand which caught the 17-year-old around the jawline, rather than his elbow. Still, it was a hand in the face and Mauricio Pochettino must have been relieved when Swarbrick pulled out a yellow card rather than a red one. Tottenham defender Kyle Walker and Sheffield United's Stefan Scougall both leap to try and win a header . Harry Kane holds off Scougall as he attempts a run at Sheffield United's defence during the first leg of the semi-final tie . Spurs captain Adebayor talks to Walker during the first leg of the last-four contest at White Hart Lane . Many Tottenham supporters were surprised to see Emmanuel Adebayor made captain for the night, given that he has played just 32 minutes of football since November, his future at White Hart Lane is in doubt and he looked largely uninterested against Sunderland at the weekend. This time he managed to avoid being booed by his own fans at the start, but was seriously off the pace and ineffectual. In the absence of Hugo Lloris and with Younes Kaboul on the bench, the Tottenham boss had taken the strange decision to make Adebayor his captain for the night. Just four days earlier, some Spurs fans had booed the Togo striker as he came on as a substitute, unhappy with the application of their £100,000-a-week top-earner this season. His reception was warmer on Wednesday, but supporters cheered the change when he was replaced by Soldado midway through the second half. They prefer the fella who cannot score but clearly tries, and especially if he helps them over the line by winning a penalty. It would have been far worse had Adebayor been dismissed for his careless challenge on Reed, who accepted an apologetic handshake before the game went on. Adebayor is shown a yellow card in the first half (left) before being substituted in the 65th minute (right) Adebayor cut a frustrated figure on a cold evening at White Hart Lane, and he was jeered by supporters when substituted . Adebayor's evening came to an end after 65 minutes when he was substituted by Roberto Soldado to boos from the home fans, which seemed to make Nigel Clough chuckle . Clough was still demanding answers from fourth official Roger East as Jamal Campbell-Ryce burst inside from the right and zipped a low cross-shot close but the brief interruption energised the home team. With England boss Roy Hodgson in the crowd, Townsend became more influential, running at left-back Bob Harris, although his delivery was as haphazard as ever. On the other flank, Harry Kane found it difficult to get into the game for the first half-hour, although he was more effective when he drifted inside as the game went on. Eric Dier was the first to test United’s ‘keeper Howard, with a powerful header from a free-kick swung in from the right by Townsend. Dier’s contact was strong but he could not direct the ball well and Howard was able to push the effort aside. Christian Eriksen’s long ball over the top was collected by Adebayor with a decent first touch but he screwed a volley well wide under pressure from McEveley. Dier went close with a glancing header, again from an in-swinging Townsend free-kick, this time inches wide. But Stefan Scougall fired a warning Tottenham’s way when Ben Davies was dispossessed by Reed deep in his own territory. Scougall’s effort from the edge of the penalty area was narrowly off target. Spurs dominated possession and forced Sheffield United back as the second half went on, but Clough’s defensive unit were organised and committed even if they did start to show signs of tiring. Roberto Soldado came on for Adebayor, and he forced Sheffield United defender McEveley into a mistake that won Spurs a penalty .

All four of Townsend’s goals for Spurs this season have been penalties — two in the Europa League, one in the Capital One Cup and one in the Premier League . McEveley was booked for a mistimed slide on Townsend and some panic set in but optimism was rising among the noisy United fans. They had seen another performance to belie the club’s third tier existence and their remains the possibility of another trip to Wembley and their first major final since 1936. Bradford’s adventure two years ago has given hope to all lower league teams in this position, but Spurs have the edge thanks to McEveley’s hand signals and Townsend’s penalty.","Andros Townsend scored from the penalty spot in the second half for Tottenham .

"A gang of 24 men and women are accused of stealing more than £400,000 of taxpayers' money in a 'large-scale, organised attack' on the benefits system. The 18 men and six women, all aged between 19 and 24, are accused of 'hijacking' the identities of members of the public before posing under fake names in order to claim Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA) and Employment Support Allowance (ESA). It is alleged some members of the group also had access to third party personal data which allowed them to pass identities onto other people. Scroll down for video .

Andrew Penhale, Deputy Head of the CPS Specialist Fraud Division, said: 'Following an investigation by the Central Criminal Investigation Service, part of the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), the CPS has authorised charges against 18 men and six women, all of whom live or work in London, in connection with alleged benefit fraud. 'On dates between July 2011 and September 2013, it is alleged that these individuals took part in a large-scale, organised attack on the DWP benefits claims and payments system, dishonestly obtaining £446,844.85 between them. 'In order to carry out this fraud, it is alleged that the defendants hijacked the identities of innocent members of the public without their knowledge or consent.

"A teenage tennis star has revealed how being ‘fat shamed’ two years ago by the U.S. Tennis Association (USTA) has helped her develop the mental toughness to succeed. Taylor Townsend, 18, become the youngest American to reach the third round at the French Open in over a decade when she beat 21st-ranked Alize Cornet 6-4, 4-6, 6-4 on Wednesday. Currently ranked 205th, Townsend may still carry a few extra pounds for a rising tennis player, but says she used the very public criticism as motivation to improve her game. Taylor Townsend, 18, has revealed how being 'fat shamed' two years ago by the U.S. Tennis Association  has helped her become the youngest American to reach the third round at the French Open in over a decade . ‘It helped me believe in myself more,’ she told CBS Chicago. ‘It also opened my eyes to say, “You know, you're not going to look like everyone else.”’ The Chicago native was the reigning number one junior tennis player in the world in 2012, when the  USTA said they wouldn't finance any other tournament appearances until she lost weight and got into better shape. 'Our concern is her long-term health, number one, and her long-term development as a player,' Patrick McEnroe, general manager of the USTA's player development program, told the Wall Street Journal at the time. Townsend went to the tournament anyway - her mom paid their travel expenses - and she won the junior doubles title and advanced to the quarterfinals in the singles division. Townsend exited the French Open on Friday after losing to Spain's Carla Suarez Navarro, but the teenager is predicted to have a big future in the sport . The Chicago native was the reigning number one junior tennis player in the world in 2012, when the  USTA said they wouldn't finance any other tournament appearances until she lost weight and got into better shape . After the USTA controversy, Townsend stopped working with coaches from the association and started training with former Wimbledon runner-up Zina Garrison in Washington. 'I started working really hard trying to get in the best shape that I could be for my body,' Townsend said. 'It actually turned out to be a huge strength for me.' Following the 2012 incident, Townsend received support from Serena Williams, another tennis star to have received flack over her less than svelte figure. 'For a female, particularly, in the United States, in particular, and African-American, to have to deal with that is unnecessary,' said Williams. 'Women athletes come in all different sizes and shapes and colors and everything. I think you can see that more than anywhere on the tennis tour.' In 2007, Williams won the Australian Open singles title despite being in what has been described as 'the worst shape of her career' In 2007, Williams won the Australian Open singles title despite being in what has been described as 'the worst shape of her career'. Former U.S. tennis star Lindsay Davenport also ranked among the largest players on the women's tour - standing at 6-foot-2 and weighing 175lbs - and still became number one. Former number one on the men's side, Mats Wilander said: 'You have to be fit underneath, I don't think you necessarily have to look ripped.' The USTA later reimbursed Townsend's mother for their travel costs to the 2012 U.S. Open, and Townsend and the organization have since reconciled. She exited the French Open on Friday after losing to Spain's Carla Suarez Navarro, but the teenager is predicted to have a big future in the sport.","Taylor Townsend, 18, become the youngest .

"Travellers are being warned about a scam in which people are promised $999 in credit for flights or holidays. Would be holiday-makers in Australia have reported getting automated messages purporting to be from Qantas or Virgin Australia, informing them that they have been chosen to receive $999 towards a holiday. They are then asked to press one on their phones, and are directed to 'consultants' who ask for personal and financial information. Bogus: The Qantas name is being used by scammers attempting to get financial information from people . Qantas and Virgin have also issued warnings about the scam, which has nothing to do with either airline. 'Consumers, businesses and airlines are all reporting the scam,' said the fair trading minister for New South Wales, Mr Mason-Cox. 'There is no end to the variety of scams or the devious devices scammers will employ to take people’s money and personal information. The promise of a credit on flights may be appealing but I urge people to hang up on these calls.' Mr Mason-Cox said scammers attempt to lure people in by asking them for some personal information needed to enable them to redeem their prize. 'Typically they have been asking for the person’s age and if they have a valid credit card,' he said.Scammers can obtain people's private numbers fraudulently or from anywhere it has been publicly listed. Hang up! Scammers attempt to lure people in by asking them for some personal information needed to enable them to redeem their prize . And people can still receive scam calls even if they have a private number or have listed their number on the Australian Government’s Do Not Call Register. Information about the scam can be found on the Scam Watch website, which advises: 'SCAMwatch and Qantas are warning people about automated calls from scammers posing as Qantas staff claiming that they’ve won a credit towards their next holiday. 'If you receive this call, hang up...If you hand over your credit card details, you will find that money has been taken rather than deposited from your bank account.' The scammers are persistent, according to reports, with some consumers and businesses saying they have received several such calls in one day. Qantas stated on its website: 'We are aware that some customers are receiving automated phone calls purporting to be from Qantas. 'These calls are not from us, and can easily be identified as unauthentic. Qantas consultants will always call customers directly to discuss their bookings and do not use an automated phone system when contacting customers proactively.' Qantas also points out that calls are being made to people who are not even customers of Qantas. People took to Twitter to warn others about the scam, with one Tweeter warning, 'I just had a robocall claiming to be from #qantas that I won $999 towards my next holiday. No surprise, it's a #scam.' Another tweeted: 'Received clever SCAM phone call today (from so called @VirginAustralia), past booked flights allowed us $945 credit, needed to give CC.'","Automated message promises credit of $999 towards flights or a holiday .

"The beige colonial boasts four bedrooms, an updated kitchen - and the chance to own a slice of Russian spy history that inspired the new television series The Americans. The U.S. Marshals Service is selling a Montclair, New Jersey, home whose previous owners were arrested in 2010 by the FBI and accused of being members of a Russian spy ring. Authorities said the home's former occupants went by the aliases Richard and Cynthia Murphy and led what appeared to be a banal suburban life. Spies' den: The Montclair, NJ, house where KGB agents 'Richard Murphy' and 'Cynthia Murphy' were arrested by the FBI has been put up for sale by the U.S. Marshals Service . Sleeper agents: The home's former occupants  - deep-cover KGB agents - went by the aliases Cynthia Murphy (left) and Richard Murphy (right), but their real names are Lydia and Vladimir Guryev . Stranger than fiction: The 2010 real-life spy drama inspired the new FX series The Americans, which follows two married undercover KGB agents Philip and Elizabeth Jennings, played by Matthew Rhys and  Kerri Russell . Lawyers for the couple said the man was a stay-at-home father to two daughters and his wife worked for a New York accounting firm and made $135,000 a year. It was all an elaborate, illegal ruse straight out of the popular FX series The Americans, which was in fact inspired by the real-life spy saga. Like in the show, which follows married Russian sleeper agents Philip and Elizabeth Jennings, the Murphys - whose real names are Vladimir and Lydia Guryev - were part of a group of deep-cover Russian operatives who had been living in the U.S. for years under the guise of leading seemingly normal lives. Guryevs and eight others – including the redheaded beauty Anna Chapman - were arrested in June 2010 after a decade-long counterintelligence probe that led to the biggest spy swap since the Cold War. Both pleaded guilty to conspiring to act as an unregistered agent of a foreign country and were deported not long after their arrests. The Guryevs lived in New Jersey for more than 15 years and had two children: Kate, 11, and Lisa, 9, who were later taken away by FBI agents. Average home: The beige colonial four-bedroom house with $444,900 list price is located on Marquette Road in Montclair, described by one realtor as a perfectly ordinary street . Until recently, the dwelling was plastered with 'No Trespassing' signs and other court documents . Fixer-upper: Neighbors say Murphys' former residence has fallen into disrepair, with overgrown bushes and brown lawn in the front yard . Prosecutors described a ring that used techniques both elaborate and seemingly out of a Cold War spy movie. The group meshed into American life while engaging in clandestine global travel with fake passports, using invisible ink and engaging in practices so sophisticated the government would not describe them in open court. It was all toward the goal of infiltrating U.S. policy circles and learning about U.S. diplomacy and weapons information. Cynthia Murphy provided financial planning for venture capitalist Alan Patricof, a political fundraiser with extremely close ties to Bill and Hillary Clinton. When the case broke, the secretary of state's spokesman issued a statement as an attempt to distance Mrs Clinton from the spy ring. 'There is no reason to believe that the Secretary of State was a special target of this spy ring,' her spokesman said. In 2009, authorities allege the Guryevs were asked to find out information from people involved in U.S. politics and foreign policy about President Obama's impending trip to Russia and how he would negotiate with regards to the START nuclear arms treaty, Afghanistan and Iran's nuclear program. Authorities said they found $80,000 in crisp $100 bills in the Montclair home, which was paid for by the Russian government. The home has an unfinished basement and a $444,900 list price with Fast Track Real Estate Co., of nearby Waldwick. Double-life: Richard Murphy (left) shown with suspect Christopher Metsos (right) was a mostly stay-at-home dad to two pre-teen children with his wife who worked for an accounting firm that had close ties to Bill and Hillary Clinton . The sale comes after a default judgment in a federal civil case that ordered the marshals to sell the property. Until recently, the dwelling was plastered with ‘No Trespassing’ signs and other court documents. Neighbors in Montclair told NBC News that they were relieved that the house finally has been put up for sale because over the past three years, it has become an eyesore. According to the real estate site Zillow.com, the average-looking house at 31 Marquette Road sold in September 2008 for $481,000. The two-story residence has four bedrooms, one-and-a-half baths and was built in 1950. 'If there is an ""Ozzie and Harriet"" road in Montclair, it's Marquette,' real estate agent Roberta Baldwin told NJ.com in 2010. 'You couldn't get more normal. You couldn't find anything more quiet and demure.' In The Americans, which takes place in the 1980s, Philip Jennings, played by Matthew Rhys, and his wife and spy partner Elizabeth, portrayed by Kerri Russell, live in a similarly ordinary house in a quiet Washington DC suburb. Agent provocateur: One of the Moscow agents caught by the FBI in 2010 was the redhead stunner Anna Chapman, who since being sent back to Russia has turned into a TV personality . As young KGB agents, Philip and Elizabeth were sent to the US in the 1960s with instructions to lead a normal life, build a family and blend in while fulfilling their mission to serve the Motherland. When they are not trying to steal state secrets or outsmart their FBI agent neighbor, the pair of sleuths moonlighting as travel agents are struggling to keep their marriage from falling apart. like the Guryevs, the Jenningses have two young children, which significantly complicates matters for them. In fact, several couples who were exposed as Russian spies in 2010 also had kids, some as young as one year old,  who ended up being left behind when their parents were sent back to Russia. According to court documents filed in the case in 2010, like in the case of the fictional characters in The Americans, the Guryevs’ main objective was to blend in. One message from their handlers back home read: ‘You were sent to USA for long-term service trip. Your education, bank accounts, car, house, etc – all these serve one goal: fulfill your main mission, i.e. to search and develop ties in policymaking circles and send intels [intelligence reports] to C[enter].’","Richard and Cynthia Murphy were exposed in 2010 as Russian spies Vladimir and Lydia Guryev .

"Hebrew graffiti thanking Adolf Hitler and denouncing Zionism have been sprayed inside Israel's own Holocaust museum in Jerusalem.

"The Air Force’s new secret superspy plane is flying in the airspace above Area 51 and will likely be ready for missions by 2015. The large, classified unmanned RQ-180, developed by Northrop Grumman, is designed for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) missions. The secret unmanned aerial system (UAS), funded through the Air Force’s classified budget, was awarded to Northrop Grumman after a competition that included Boeing and Lockheed Martin. Stealth in the sky: The Air Force's new secret superspy plane, the RQ-180, is flying in the airspace above Area 51 and will likely be ready for missions by 2015. This is an artist rendering of what it will look like . The aircraft will conduct intelligence missions that have been left unaddressed, and under wide debate, since the retirement of the Lockheed SR-71 in 1998, according to Aviation Week. It is also set to take the place of Lockheed Martin Corp.'s RQ-170 Sentinel, which was the plane used in the operation that killed Osama Bin Laden. Although the new plane is top secret and details of it have yet to be released, it is definitely very big. Publicly available overhead imagery shows that new hangars at Northrop's Palmdale, California, site and at the Air Force's Area 51 test center in Groom Lake, Nevada, have been built to hold an aircraft with a wing span of more than 130 feet. This makes it much bigger than the RQ-170, which has an estimated wingspan of between 65 feet and 90 feet. The RQ-180 carries radio-frequency . sensors such as active, electronically scanned array (AESA) radar and . passive electronic surveillance measures, according to Aviation Week. It could also be capable of electronic attack missions. Area 51: A dirt road that leads to the restricted Area 51. The stealth plane is reportedly flying over this area already as the Air Force is making trial runs . Top secret: The classified unmanned RQ-180, developed by Northrop Grumman, is designed for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) missions. it is being tested over Area 51, pictured, at the moment . The Air Force nor Northrop Grumman have wished to comment on the classified airplane. Air Force spokeswoman Jennifer Cassidy said that the Air Force ‘does not discuss this program’. This aircraft’s design is key for the shift of Air Force ISR assets away from ‘permissive’ environments - such as Iraq and Afghanistan, where Northrop Grumman’s non-stealthy Global Hawk and General Atomics’ Reaper operate - and toward operations in ‘contested’ or ‘denied’ airspace, according to Aviation Week. Big plane: Publicly available overhead imagery shows that new hangars at Northrop's Palmdale, California, site and at the Air Force's Area 51 test center in Groom Lake, Nevada, have been built to hold an aircraft with a wing span of more than 130 feet . The new UAS underpins the Air Force’s determination to retire a version of the RQ-4B Global Hawk after 2014, despite congressional resistance. The RQ-180 eclipses the smaller, less stealthy and shorter-range RQ-170 Sentinel. The plane will be another to the growing fleet manufactured by Northrop Grumman. The latest was the Triton unmanned aircraft system which completed its first flight from the Northrop Grumman manufacturing facility in Palmdale on May 22. The 80-minute flight successfully demonstrated control systems that allow Triton to operate autonomously. Triton is designed to fly surveillance missions up to 24-hours at altitudes of more than 10 miles, allowing coverage out to 2,000 nautical miles. Fleet of UAS planes: The Triton unmanned aircraft system is shown completing its first flight from the Northrop Grumman manufacturing facility in Palmdale, California, in May . If the previous patterns for secret ISR . aircraft operations are followed for the RQ-180, the new UAV will be jointly controlled . by the Air Force and the CIA. This arrangement has been used for the RQ-170, which is operated by the Air Force’s 30th Reconnaissance Sqdn., according to a fact sheet the Air Force released after one of the aircraft turned up in Iran in December 2011. The Iranians proudly displayed on state television a stealthy U.S. unmanned aircraft it claimed it had downed while conducting reconnaissance overflights, which turned out to be the RQ-170. Northrop Grumman’s financial reports point to a possible award of a secret UAS contract in 2008, when the company disclosed a $2 billion increase in the backlog in its Integrated Systems division, said Aviation Week. This year, Northrop Grumman financial reports acknowledged that an unnamed aircraft program entered low-rate initial production, the Pentagon term for low-volume deliveries that begin as testing and near completion, and before the program is approved for full production.","The Air Force’s new secret superspy plane is flying in the airspace above Area 51 and will likely be ready for missions by 2015 .

"More than one in five properties in some areas of London are being sold to foreign buyers, new figures have revealed. Campaigners have warned of a 'dire housing crisis' after more than 20 per cent of properties for sale in the richest areas of the capital were bought by foreigners over the past four years. Some estate agents are reporting even higher rates of international sales, with some saying more than half of all their listed properties are going to overseas purchasers. Scroll down for video . More than 20 per cent of properties in the London borough of Westminster are being sold to foreign buyers . The international scrum for the capital's homes has fuelled fears that British buyers are being priced out of the market. Others say that many of the properties becoming foreign-owned are being left empty and used as investments. Labour MP Sadiq Khan, who obtained the figures from the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS), is campaigning to stop developers advertising properties overseas before they are advertised in the UK. He said: 'Londoners are being priced out of the housing market by an influx of foreign buyers, who see London property as an investment and in many cases leave properties sat empty as ""ghost homes"". 'While Londoners suffer from the dire housing crisis under David Cameron, there are more than 60,000 homes sat empty across the city. 'In some parts of London, up to one in five of homes, already in short supply, are not available to Londoners as a result.' Central London has seen a huge boom in foreign buyers of houses and flats, with these boroughs the worst hit . It is not just the exclusive areas that are being bought up. Around 12 per cent of properties in cheaper Tower Hamlets were also bought by overseas customers last year . The City of Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea have the highest level of foreign sales, with more than 20 per cent of homes in both areas sold to overseas buyers. Other sought-after areas were the City of London, with 17 per cent of property sales going to buyers abroad, and Tower Hamlets, at 12 per cent. Camden, Islington and Hammersmith and Fulham were also in the top 10 boroughs targeted by overseas investors. City of Westminster - 21% . Kensington and Chelsea - 20% . City of London - 17% . Tower Hamlets - 12% . Camden - 9% . Islington - 7% . *Figures show percentage of home bought by foreign buyers in the last four years . It comes after the average sale price of prime property in central London soared to £4.7million between June and August this year, up from £3.7million in the preceding three-month period. Rich foreigners are queueing up to buy the latest high-end residential properties on the market, including a planned £100million complex of 22 luxury flats in Old Queen Street - next door to Downing Street and Buckingham Palace. Richard Barber, a partner for the estate agent WA Ellis in Knightsbridge, said 54 per cent of his company's sales were to overseas buyers - and there was a shortage of affordable homes. He said: 'Supply is at a much higher rate per foot than the ordinary man in the street can afford. 'Homes are being built at very high luxury levels on expensive land. A nurse is not going to be able to buy a property in Chelsea or Kensington, and the fact a foreigner can buy it isn't going to make the difference.' The figures emerged after it was revealed that soaring house prices are dragging increasing numbers of middle-income families into higher rates of tax. London saw a 20 per cent increase in house prices last year, while the rest of South East experienced a rise of more than 12 per cent. The rapid increase means that even an average-priced home in those areas is now in the three per cent stamp duty bracket and is worth more than £325,000 required for estates to be included in the 40 per cent top rate of inheritance tax. Kensington Palace Gardens, whose occupants include the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, has been labelled 'millionaires' row' after its home were bought up by the super-rich .","More than 20 per cent of homes in  parts of capital sold to foreign buyers .

"As our future Queen, many would forgive Kate for treating herself to a new designer outfit every time she had to make a public appearance. But the Duchess of Cambridge is far cleverer than that. She has no desire to be seen as a mere clothes horse - and frequently recycles outfits she has worn at previous high profile events to show the public that she is not frittering the public purse away on endless designer clothes. Yes, she spends a certain amount on clothes from top designers - but she'll wear the items again and again - just as the Queen does, or notoriously thrifty Princess Anne, who regularly brings out a dress she first wore 40 years ago. And for yesterday's Wimbledon appearance, Kate did just that. She chose a £1,100 cable knit Alexander McQueen dress she had worn a year ago to the day, during the North American tour she and William embarked upon last summer. 2012 Kate wore the cream knit Alexander McQueen dress for her appearance in the Royal box . 2011 The Duchess first wore the dress exactly a year ago to the day - with the same LK Bennett shoes . It was their first official Royal tour as husband and wife, and Kate's wardrobe was under the microscope. She wore the dress on the fourth of July 2011, for a visit to Canada's Prince Edward Island. It caused a stir among fashion cognoscenti at the time, given that it was a six-year-old dress - ancient in fashion terms - from the 2006 collection by Alexander McQueen, the same fashion house behind her wedding dress. Not only was it 12 seasons old, but it had been worn by another high profile star, Sarah Jessica Parker, who was photographed in the navy version in the year of its release. But Kate, who teamed the dress with the same £165 blue suede LK Bennett pumps she had on yesterday,  wore it with panache. The dress was just one of a series of impeccable choices on that trip - and one of the few items from that time we have seen again since. The tour was seen a great success, and it sealed the status of the new couple as the thoroughly modern, entirely likeable, popular new face of the monarchy - so it is no wonder that Kate has a fondness for this dress. The . £1,1000 Alexander McQueen cable knit dress comes from the British design . house's 2006 collection - when the late founder Alexander McQueen was . still at the helm. Sarah . Jessica Parker wore the style the year it was shown on the catwalk, . while Kate caused a stir in the fashion world when she wore it a full . six years afterwards. It . was exactly a year ago yesterday that she wore the McQueen garment - on a . visit to Prince Edward Island last year during the tour of Canada she . embarked upon with William just a few months after the Royal Wedding. A familiar style: Kate wore the dress exactly a . year ago today - with the same navy suede LK Bennett pumps she is . wearing today - while actress Sarah Jessica Parker wore a navy version . of the dress in 2006 . Tennis ace: Kate wore a cream knit Alexander McQueen dress for her appearance in the Royal box. It was a dress she has worn before - but this time the style was well-pitched for the sporting event . In the event, it was the perfect choice for a day at the tennis too. Always . impeccably turned out, Kate has an undeniable flair for fashion and . frequently dresses as the occasion demands, whether it be top-to-toe red . for Canada day, or a green coat for St Patrick's Day. So it is no surprise that she seemed to have referenced 1920s tennis style with her outfit choice. Arriving . with William just in time to watch Roger Federer take Youzhny in . straight sets on Centre Court, followed by Andy Murray's tense victory, . looked as though she'd shopped from a Wimbledon kit list from the . roaring Twenties. After . Federer dispatched with his Russian rival in straight sets, the royals . were in for a far more stressful experience as British hope Andy Murray . took on Spain's David Ferrer.

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge may have made the most high profile appearance of the day, but this was by far a day off for the rest of the senior Royals. Lately it seems as though not a day goes by without an engagement for the Queen, who at 86 seems to be working harder than ever before. The Queen and Prince Philip were in Scotland where they attended a Glasgow Cathedral service as part of the ongoing Diamond Jubilee celebrations.

"Scan: An improved version of MRI can spot the earliest stages of life-threatening diseases, researchers have said. Pictured is a doctor helping a patient with an MRI scan . A new scanner can spot the earliest stages of life-threatening diseases including cancers in seconds, researchers say. The early detection could see the disease picked up when they are at their most treatable. The device is an improved version of MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) which is currently used by doctors to pick up tumours, multiple sclerosis, heart disease and other illnesses. At present the amount of detail that can be probed is limited but MRF (magnetic resonance fingerprinting) can collect a vast amount of information in one measurement. It uses mathematical formulas called pattern-recognition algorithms to figure out in a few seconds if a patient has anything to worry about. Each body tissue and disease has a unique fingerprint that can be used to quickly diagnose problems, say the scientists. By using their technology to look for different physical properties simultaneously they differentiated white and grey matter from cerebrospinal fluid in the brain in about 12 seconds. They promise to do this much quicker in the near future and believe an MRI scan will be standard procedure in annual check-ups. A full-body scan lasting only minutes would provide far more information, making diagnostics cheap. Dr Mark Griswold, Professor of Radiology at Case Western Reserve School of Medicine, in Ohio, said: 'The overall goal is to specifically identify individual tissues and diseases, to hopefully see things and quantify things before they become a problem. 'But to try to get there we've had to give up everything we knew about the MRI and start over.' MRI is a radiology technique which uses magnets, radio waves and a computer to produce a range of images of the body's tissues and structures. Treatable: The early detection could see diseases picked up when they are at their most treatable. Pictured is a human cancer cell . MRF can obtain much more information with each measurement than a traditional MRI. Prof Griswold, who spent three years developing it, likens the difference to a pair of choirs. He said: 'In the traditional MRI everyone is singing the same song and you can tell who is singing louder, who is off-pitch, who is singing softer. But that's about it.' Information: According to the scientists, the amount of detail which can be probed from an MRI scan (pictured) is limited, but MRF can collect a vast amount of inforamtion in one measurement . The louder, softer and off-pitch singing is represented by dark, light or bright spots in the scan a radiologist must interpret. For example an MRI would show swelling as a bright area in an image. But brightness doesn't necessarily equate with severity or cause. Prof Griswold said: 'With an MRF we hope with one step we can tell the severity and exactly what's happening in that area.' The fingerprint of each tissue, disease and material inside the body is therefore a different song. In an MRF each member of the choir sings a different song simultaneously. Prof Griswold, whose machine is described in the journal Nature, said: . 'What it sounds like in total is a randomised mess.' Other researchers have tried to use multiple parameters in MRI's but this group was able to scan fast and with higher sensitivity than in previous attempts. Prof Griswold said: 'This research gives us hope. We can see it's possible the MRI can see all sorts of things.' The group expects to reduce scanning time and continue to build the songbook - or library of fingerprints - over the next few years.","Improved version of MRI could detect life-threatening diseases when they are at their most treatable .

"As London Fashion Week kicks off in  the UK tomorrow, models will be stalking the catwalks with unsmiling faces and serious expressions. Not so, Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, who made sure to grin, grimace and mug her way down the runway for Naomi Campbell's Fashion For Relief show at Somerset House on Thursday night. Wearing a long black dress with her hair falling loose around her shoulders, Sarah, 55, gave something of a performance, spreading her arms wide as she joined a range of celebrities to raise money for the war against Ebola. Sarah, Duchess of York, announces her presence on Naomi Campbell's Fashion For Relief catwalk . The Duchess of York makes one of her signature facial expressions, as she walks down the catwalk . The high necked, sleeveless dress hugged the duchess's figure but she managed to sashay on the graphic-print runway in black high heeled courts. Her jewellery was kept simple with pearl earrings, a delicate silver necklace with an opal at its centre, and a silver bracelet strewn with stones. The event kicks off London Fashion Week, which officially opens tomorrow, with a fundraising showcase that teams famous faces with renowned designers. It's not the first time the duchess has strutted her stuff for a good cause as she's something of a Fashion Relief regular. She rarely wears anything other than black, and her appearances in the charity shows have been no exception with her wearing  a series of long inky garments. In 2007, she showed off her generous enbonpoint while walking the runway with daughter Princess Beatrice. She kept her hands resolutely at her sides for the event raising money to help the fight against ebola . Famous for her outgoing personality, the Duchess of York didn't hold back in Somerset House tonight . In 2005 she joined the fashion benefit to aid victims of Hurricane Katrina and in 2010, she donned a voluminous black kaftan for Haiti event. Supermodel Naomi Campbell launched Fashion For Relief in 2005 to help those affected by Hurricane Katrina. Since then more than £5 million has been raised, with victims of the 2011 Japanese tsunami and floods in the UK benefiting. Tonight at the £50-a-head event, the duchess joined celebrities like Katie Price, in a tuxedo and red lipstick, Pixie Lott, Vivienne Westwood, Georgia May Jagger, Caroline Flack and Katie Piper on the catwalk. Strike a pose: Perhaps Naomi Campbell has given Sarah some advice on how to stand on the catwalk . The black dress Sarah wore will be auctioned to benefit Campbell's Fashion For Relief charity . Dresses were donated by designers including Dolce & Gabbana, Givenchy, Alexander McQueen, Azzedine Alaia, Vivienne Westwood, Stella McCartney, Balmain, Marchesa and Versace. Naomi, who also lent her star-power to the catwalk, said: 'I'm thrilled to return to London to open London Fashion Week for this very special cause close to my heart. 'The Fashion For Relief Show is an incredible event and this year we hope to raise more money than ever before. 'Raising awareness for Ebola and educating about its prevention is crucial to help prevent the spread of this deadly disease.'

"Ashley Cole became the 11th Englishman to play for a foreign club in the Champions League when he was named in Roma's starting XI, following in some illustrious (and rather bizarre) footsteps. The likes of Steve McManaman and Owen Hargreaves have won the competition with European sides, while David Beckham had a high-profile stint at Real Madrid. We defy anyone, however, to remember Scott Minto and Michael Thomas turning out for Benfica against HJK Helsinki in 1998. Here, Sportsmail looks at those 10 previous Englishmen abroad... Roma's Ashley Cole tries to get in between Vincent Kompany and Jesus Navas in the Champions League clash . Cole was back on home soil and was impressive in Roma's draw at Manchester City . Steve McManaman (Real Madrid) Converted from a tricky winger to a workhorse midfielder in Madrid, McManaman won the Champions League twice with Real, in 2000 and 2002. His finest moment came in the 2000 final against Valencia, when he scored a spectacular scissors-style volley in a 3-0 victory for Real. Steve McManaman (front) with his winners' medal after the 2000 Champions League final . Owen Hargreaves (Bayern Munich) OK, OK, Hargreaves was born in Canada but by the time he won the tournament with Bayern in 2001 he had already played for England Under 21s, which is good enough for him to make it on this list. He was part of one of Bayern's many dominant sides and forced himself into the full England team. He would later win the Champions League again with Manchester United. Owen Hargreaves won the CL with Bayern Munich in 2001, and here runs away from Real's Claude Makelele . David Beckham (Real Madrid) The most famous footballer on the planet when he moved to Madrid, Beckham did not actually have much success at the Bernabeu. He won La Liga in his final season but the Galacticos, of which he was part, did not reach the Champions League semi-finals while he was there - a poor return for a team with such talent. David Beckham cannot shake off Hargreaves in Real's last 16 clash with Bayern Munich in 2007 . Michael Owen (Real Madrid) The striker had a solitary season at the Bernabeu in 2004-05, during which he was frequently used as a substitute. He scored his first Real goal in the Champions League, against Dynamo Kiev, but that was the only time he netted in Europe that season as Los Blancos failed to get past the last 16. Michael Owen celebrates his goal against Dynamo Kiev in 2004, while Jonathan Woodgate salutes his effort against Rosenborg the following season . Jonathan Woodgate (Real Madrid) One of Real's more bizarre signings, Woodgate was hampered by injury (he did not play at all during his first season) and famously scored an own goal then was sent off on his debut. He did have a little more success in Europe and scored his only Madrid goal in the Champions League, against Rosenborg. Joe Cole (Lille) This loan move in 2011-12 was meant to revive Cole's career but it did not quite succeed. He was overshadowed at the then-French champions by Eden Hazard and had limited impact in Europe. He played six times for Lille in the Champions League but did not score as the club finished bottom of their group. Joe Cole (left) has a shot under pressure from Inter Milan defender Lucio while on loan at Lille . Scott Minto, Brian Deane and Michael Thomas (Benfica) It's impossible not to lump these three in together as they all moved to Portugal at around the same time. Deane and Thomas were signed by Graeme Souness, while left back Minto joined the Portuguese giants under the previous boss Mario Wilson. None of the trio made much impact in the Champions League. Deane scored in the first round against Beitar Jerusalem but Benfica did not make it beyond the group stage and Minto and Thomas both played in a humbling 2-0 defeat by HJK Helsinki. Brian Deane (left) and Scott Minto both played for Benfica in the Champions League . Michael Thomas holds off Kaiserslauten's Marian Hristov during the fateful Champions League campaign . Matt Derbyshire (Olympiacos) Possibly the most bizarre addition on this list, seeing as he has never managed to hold down a regular starting spot in any Premier League team, never mind one in the Champions League. But with his move to Olympiacos in 2009, he was given the opportunity to play in Europe's elite competition. He had domestic success in Greece but less on the continent, and was sent off against Bordeaux in 2010. He is now at Rotherham . Matt Derbyshire went from a peripheral figure at Blackburn to playing in Europe for Olympiacos .","Steve McManaman and Owen Hargreaves both won Champions League with foreign clubs .

"Golfing great Greg Norman said he was 'one lucky man' to still have his left hand after slicing into his arm with a chainsaw while tree trimming at his Florida home. The 59-year-old Australian needed surgery to repair nerve damage following the accident on Saturday. In a phone call with the Today show on Monday, Norman said that his arm had been pulled down on the still-running chainsaw blade by a heavy tree limb. Scroll down for video . Golfing great Greg Norman posted this picture of himself on Sunday, thanking fans for the well wishes and joked: 'At least I can still play tennis' The Australian professional golfer said he was 'one lucky man' after a horrifying chainsaw injury at his Florida home . Norman said today: 'I'm pretty good, it was an interesting Saturday afternoon to say the least.' The golfer said that he does a lot of chainsawing at his ranch in Colorado, 'so I'm not a rookie'. He said that he went to grab a tree limb while trimming foliage at his south Florida home on Saturday with his left hand while he had the saw in his right with the blade still running. Norman said that he had taken his finger off the trigger so the chain was slowing down but the heavy limb started coming straight down instead of falling away from him. 'The weight of the limb was heavier than I expected and it brought my arm right down on top of the blade and I heard this crunch,' he added. The golfer said that the chainsaw cut into his arm above his wrist where a watch would be worn. It missed his main artery by mere millimeters. The 59-year-old told Today that before he went out chainsawing he had a 'premonition' that something would go wrong. He said: 'Lo and behold, the moral of the story is trust your premonition. If I ever have that feeling again, I'm not doing what I'm supposed to be doing.' The former world number one, who has won 91 golf events in his career including the British Open twice in the 1980s, posted an Instagram picture on Saturday of himself lying in a hospital bed with a heavily-bandaged left arm. Greg Norman revealed he was in hospital via an Instagram post on Saturday in which he said he had been involved in an accident while using a chainsaw . The image shows the former golfer lying in a hospital bed, hooked up to tubes and monitors. He wrote: ''I was one lucky man today. Damaged, but not down and out. Still have left hand.' 'Working with a chainsaw ALWAYS be respectful of the unexpected. I was one lucky man today. Damaged, but not down & out. Still have left hand,' Norman, nicknamed the 'Great White Shark', said in a message on Twitter with the picture. According to the Golf Channel on Sunday, Norman sustained no muscular damage in the accident, which occurred while he was cutting back trees on his property. A week ago, Norman posted a picture of himself on Instagram working with a chainsaw to cut a small tree. 'Time to trim the sea grapes today. Never ask someone to do something that you can do yourself. Love to work!' he said. On Sunday, Norman posted another Instagram, this time with him standing shirtless in front of the tree, giving a thumbs-up with his right hand while his left arm was protected by a purple foam brace. 'Thank u all for your concern & good wishes. All well the morning after the accident. Here I am at the scene of the crime w/my new fashion statement!' Norman said. He added: 'At least I can still play tennis.' Norman, who has won 91 professional world events and was ranked the world's best golfer during the peak of his career, now lives in Florida.

"Andrea Downie says she slipped on a grape while shopping and can no longer work . A Queensland woman is suing Woolworths for $320,000, claiming she slipped on a grape and injured her back. Andrea Downie, 39, from the Sunshine Coast, has filed a claim with the District Court in Brisbane, claiming she fell at the Tewantin Woolworths store in March or April last year. Ms Downie claims the fall injured her back and caused an existing condition of post-traumatic stress disorder to flare up, meaning she could not return to work, reported the Courier Mail. Ms Downie is suing Woolworths claiming that the supermarket failed to keeps its floors clean. She also claims the grape was 'in clear view' of staff and that the supermarket chain failed to have an 'adequate system of inspecting floors'. Ms Downie claimed Woolworths staff failed to be alert to hazards and spills, or warn her about loose grapes on the floor. She also said Woolworths should place mats on the floor of the produce section to stop loose grapes from 'escaping' onto the floor. Woolworths defended itself against the claims saying that Ms Downie did not complain to staff about the fall when it occurred and that it is 'uncertain' of the truth of her claim. Scroll down for video . Ms Downie allegedly slipped wile shopping at the Tewantin story. The company says it is 'uncertain' if Ms Downie really did slip and fall, but if she did the damages she is claiming are 'excessive' 'If the fall occurred as alleged by [Ms Downie], it was not reported to anyone at Woolworths on the day,' the company states in its defence, reported the Courier Mail. Woolworths stated that if the incident did occur, the damages claimed by Ms Downie were 'grossly excessive and unreasonable' and any loss of income results from her pre-existing physical and psychiatric conditions. Woolworths offered to settle the case in April and the case will go to trial on November 17. Woolworths declined to comment further on the matter. Lawyer Sam Macedone told Today that the case was 'very interesting' because the incident was reported after the event. He advised anyone involved in a slip-and-fall incident to report the accident to management immediately. 'If you fall over and you believe it’s their fault, you’ve slipped on something that’s on the floor, make a report of it straight away… Make sure it's on the record,' he said.","Andrea Downie claims she slipped on a grape at Woolworths .

"A drama about comedian Tommy Cooper's life, set to air tomorrow, has appalled his daughter Vicky Cooper who has branded the film 'all lies'. The film titled Not Like That, Like This, will be shown on ITV  tomorrow from 9pm and will feature actors including David Threlfall, of Shameless fame, Harry Potter actress Helen McCrory and New Tricks star Amanda Redman. But the day before the film, which will expose Cooper as an abuser and a drunk, is set to be watched by millions across the country, Ms Cooper has said that her father would be 'disgusted'. Scroll down for video . The shocking ITV drama about Tommy Cooper's life will be aired tomorrow night but the comedian's daughter has branded the film 'all lies' Vicky Cooper pictured with her father in 1971. Vicky was 17 at the time of the picture. She said that her father would be 'disgusted' by the ITV drama which is set to air tomorrow . The timing of the film will tie in with the 30th anniversary of the comedian's death but, far from a tribute to one of the Queen's favourite performers, it will claim that Mr Cooper was a drunk and a domestic abuser. Cooper died of a heart attack live on stage in front of millions of . viewers, during a performance on the London Weekend Television variety . show at Her Majesty’s Theatre in 1984, aged just 63. The two-hour production focuses almost entirely on his affair with his assistant Mary Fieldhouse known as Mary Kay. His daughter has criticised ITV for not allowing her to have a full input in the production process. She told The Sunday Mirror that she wanted to meet the producers but that she was barred from discussions about the script. The claims come after its writer Simon Nye said that Ms Cooper had approved of the script. He said: ‘We were anxious, but she was very nice about it.’ Ms Cooper argues that her father would not have been such a well-respected and adored figure if the film's content was true. A trailer of the ITV drama, see below, shows Cooper drinking heavily and hitting his wife after she confronts him about an affair. Another scene shows Ms Fieldhouse with a bruised cheek, but the comedian's daughter said that she never saw her father 'lay a finger on anyone' - although she admitted that her father had a 'terrible temper'. Tommy Cooper is pictured with his family, wife Gwen (L), son Thomas, (centre) and daughter Vicky (R) Tommy Cooper pictured with his daughter Vicky and son Thomas, aged five and two in 1980. The timing of the film will tie in with the 30th anniversary of the comedian's death . The drama was filmed in the family's former home in Chiswick which Ms Cooper said was 'insensitive'. She said the house was a place of cherished memories. The film suggests that Cooper's wife Gwen Cooper knew about the affair with Ms Fieldhouse. His daughter said that the depiction is inaccurate because her mother only found out about the affair once Ms Fieldhouse's book For The Love of Tommy was published in 1986. In the film, Gwen Cooper also smokes, which Ms Cooper has said is another error because her mother stopped smoking when she was diagnosed with tuberculosis and was left with one lung. Cooper died of a heart attack live on stage in front of millions of viewers, during a performance on the London Weekend Television variety show at Her Majesty¿s Theatre in 1984, when he was aged just 63 . And although the drama focuses on Cooper's mistress, again, his daughter claims this is not a faithful representation of his life because the woman was 'just a fill-in'. Writer, Simon Nye has defended the drama, refuting claims that it is a disrespectful portrayal of the late Cooper. He said it was fair to include the domestic violence scenes because they were 'on record' but he added that 'I hope that we did it in a delicate way.' He added: 'You don’t want people who don’t know Tommy’s comedy to go away thinking he was a wife-beater. 'But he was physical, and he was physical with his wife, who gave as good as she got.' The flaws in Cooper's character were first revealed in 2011 when extracts from the diaries of Cooper’s agent Miff Ferrie were published. The diaries, which form the basis of much of the ITV film, revealed how in 1969 Ferrie took a call from Gwen Cooper, saying she was leaving her husband because he had hit her in front of the children. In 1973, Ferrie wrote: ‘She is divorcing him . . . he keeps beating her . . . I spoke to [Tommy] who said she must be drunk! It would be farcical if it weren’t so tragic.’ Another time, Ferrie noted: ‘She is divorcing Tommy. Can’t stand it any more. He keeps beating her up. Last time was on their anniversary.’ ITV was unavailable for comment on the statements from Ms Cooper. Tommy Cooper and his wife Gwen.

"Ashley Cole reacted angrily to questions about his fallout with Rio Ferdinand on Monday night on his return to England for Roma’s Champions League clash with Manchester City. Ferdinand claims in his new autobiography that he felt ‘betrayed’ after Cole defended John Terry in court in 2012 over allegations that he racially abused his brother Anton, and failed to phone either of the Ferdinands to explain his actions. Asked what he felt about his former England teammate’s comments, Cole snapped: ‘I’m here to talk about football not that.’ Ashley Cole reacted angrily to questions about his fallout with Rio Ferdinand . Ashley Cole trains with his Roma team-mates at the Etihad Stadium on Monday . Roma players were in high spirits as they prepared to face Manchester City . The 33-year-old fumed for several minutes while questions were directed to Roma coach Rudi Garcia, but later said that he accepted Chelsea’s decision to offload him at the end of last season along with fellow veteran Frank Lampard, who could play against Cole for City in Tuesday's Group E tie. ‘I don’t think Chelsea were wrong,’ he added. ‘A decision was made and I’m fine with it. I had eight great years there and I still speak to the staff and players. I’m enjoying my football and hopefully I can emulate what I achieved at Arsenal and Chelsea.’ John Terry was alleged to have racially abused Anton Ferdinand during a Premier League clash in 2012 .

A Champions League winner with Chelsea in 2012, Cole left Stamford Bridge after eight years this summer to move to Serie A. Teammate Frank Lampard ended up at City and the two former England internationals could come up against one another on Tuesday. ‘It’s good to see Joe Hart and Lamps – I never expected to play against him,’ said Cole. ‘It will be good to see him if we’re both selected. ‘I think everyone knows what Lampard brings to every team. It’s another experienced player for City and he brings goals. He scored one against Chelsea. He probably didn’t like that but he’s paid to do a job. It was probably a bit disappointing for him to do that against Chelsea.’ Ashley Cole could come up against former Chelsea teammate Frank Lampard . Asked if Chelsea were wrong to offload them both, he replied: ‘I don’t think Chelsea was wrong. A decision was made and I’m fine with it. I had eight great years there and I still speak to the staff and players. ‘I’m not playing that well (at Roma). I won’t get carried away. I need more games. I’m enjoying my football and hopefully I can emulate what I achieved at Arsenal and Chelsea.’ City lost their opening Group E tie to Bayern Munich while Roma – who have won all five of their Serie A games this season – thrashed CSKA Moscow 5-1. And Cole believes that will heap further pressure on the Premier League champions to avoid another damaging defeat. ‘Of course it will make it more difficult for them to qualify,’ he added. ‘It will be a tough game. It will make it hard for them to catch up certainly and put us top of the group. Ashley Cole has endured a slow start to his Roma career .

They have been champions twice. They have Toure, Dzeko, Aguero, Hart and then they sign Lampard. These players are known worldwide because they win things, they have won the Premier League and now they will be aiming to win the Champions League as well . ‘They have great players all over the pitch.

Of course it’s different to the Premier League. You are up against different players, most of them have very good technique and the Premier League is fast and furious. Serie A is slower, though we like to attack and play fast. ‘The manager is always on us to go forward and play. The football is different but I’m getting used to now and enjoying playing Italian football.

"A video has emerged of the smiling Florida college dropout believed to be the first American to carry out a suicide attack in Syria. In footage released Friday by an al-Qaeda-linked group fighting in Syria, Moner Mohammad Abu-Salha, smiles while talking about wanting to die. The 22-year-old, who used to live about 130 miles from Miami, is believed to have been part of a mass suicide bombing on May 25, which targeted several army positions. All smiles: Florida college dropout-turned-suicide bomber Moner Mohammad Abu-Salha was filmed smiling and talking about wanting to die . Blast: Abu-Salha is believed to have taken part in a mass suicide bombing that targeted the army in Syria in May . The Nusra Front, which released the video, claimed two of the other three suicide attackers in the assault in the government-held northwestern city of Idlib were from foreign countries, including one from the Maldives. Smiling, and talking in broken Arabic, Abu-Salha is heard on the film saying: 'I want to rest in the afterlife, in heaven. There is nothing here and the heart is not resting. 'Heaven is better. When people die they either go to heaven or hell. There is happiness beyond explanation.' The video, released by Nusra Front's media arm, al-Manara al-Baydha, was posted on jihadi websites. It corresponded with Associated Press reporting about the attack and Abu-Salha. All American: Abu-Salha grew up in Florida, where he played basketball for a youth league . Opposition forces previously identified the American who carried out the bombing as Abu Hurayra al-Amriki and said he was a U.S. citizen. The name al-Amriki means 'the American' in Arabic. It is unknown how many people were killed in the bombing. Opposition rebels with the Nusra Front said Abu-Salha's truck was laden with 16 tons of explosives to tear down the al-Fanar restaurant, a gathering site for Syrian troops. The other suicide attackers targeted nearby army positions. Abu-Salha grew up in Florida and attended several colleges before dropping out and moving abroad. He lived in various parts of the Sunshine State, where his parents ran several grocery stores. At one point, he shared an apartment with his brother about 130 miles from Miami. The 22-year-old had appeared to have had a regular American upbringing, playing on a basketball youth league, and enjoying sports. But recent trips to Syria had meant federal officials were already keeping an eye on him, the New York Times reported. Thousands of foreign fighters have come to Syria from around the world to fight against President Bashar Assad's forces after the uprising against his government began three years ago. The war, which began in 2011, has since taken on strong sectarian overtones, pitting a Sunni-led insurgency that includes al-Qaeda-inspired extremist groups against a government dominated by Assad's minority Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shiite Islam. Roots: Abu-Salha grew up in Florida, where his parents run several grocery stores . New path: After dropping out of college, Abu-Salha moved abroad . Syria's . uprising began with peaceful protests in March 2011 but escalated into . an armed revolt when government forces launched a sweeping crackdown on . dissent. The . conflict has killed at least 170,000 people, nearly a third of them . civilians, according to activists. Nearly 3 million Syrians have fled . the country. On Saturday, a car bomb exploded in a northern Syrian town near the Turkish border, killing and wounding a number of people. The Aleppo Media Center said the car bomb exploded in a vegetable market in the town of Azaz. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the car blew up near a gas station in Azaz. The Observatory said the blast killed at least four people and wounded several others. The AMC said it killed and wounded a number of people, without offering specific figures. The Observatory and an Idlib-based activist who goes by the name of Asad Kanjo said another car blew up in the northern village of Atmeh near the Turkish border. The Observatory said the blast killed two people. Kanjo said the blast occurred near a market and close to a children's hospital, though it was not affected. The Observatory also said the Syrian troops recaptured the Shaer gas field in the central province of Homs a week after fighters from the Islamic State group captured it and killed dozens of soldiers. Syrian state television confirmed that troops recaptured the field, saying that 'large numbers of Islamic State terrorists were wiped out.' The Observatory said a missile shot down the helicopter Friday night over a neighborhood of Aleppo known as Camp Nairab. Camp Nairab is adjacent to the Nairab military airport southeast of the city, where government aircraft take off to carry out attacks in northern Syria. Attack: Abu-Salha, left, is believed to have driven a truck, top right, filled with explosives to a restaurant where troops gather before blowing it, and himself, up . Assad's forces use helicopters to drop barrel bombs - crude explosives that have killed thousands of people and caused widespread destruction, especially in Aleppo. The Observatory and an Aleppo-based activist who goes by the name Abu Saeed Izzedine said the helicopter crash killed four people, including a child. The Observatory said three of the dead were the helicopter's crew members. Aleppo, once Syria's commercial capital, has been the scene of heavy fighting since rebels seized part of the city in 2012. The Observatory also reported Saturday that the number of soldiers killed over the past few days in a northern military base in Raqqa that was overrun by the extremist Islamic State group has risen to 85. It said the fate of 200 others was still unknown. The monitoring group, which relies on a network of activists inside the country, said Islamic State fighters have executed and paraded the bodies of 'tens' of soldiers in Raqqa, the only provincial capital in rebel hands. Amateur videos posted online by activists showed more than a dozen beheaded bodies in a busy square said to be in Raqqa. Some of the heads were placed on a nearby fence, where at least two headless bodies were crucified. The video appeared genuine and corresponded to other AP reporting of the events.","Al-Qaeda-linked group released footage of attack preparation on Friday .

"Hundreds of flights a day to destinations including South Africa and Dubai are flying over warzones occupied by terrorists who could have access to surface-to-air missiles, raising fears another aircraft could be shot down. Carriers including British Airways and Qatar Airlines are making use of flight paths including a busy corridor directly over Mosul, an Iraqi city that is the stronghold of jihadist group ISIS. The routes are currently considered safe by aviation authorities, but fears have been raised after Flight MH17 was shot down last week, causing many carriers to divert their services from Ukraine. Flight paths: The above map, which shows routes taken by major carriers this month, shows how planes are flying over dangerous areas of the world. Dotted lines are probable routes for which exact data is not available . Corridor over ISIS: The above picture shows a snapshot of planes flying over Mosul, an ISIS stronghold in Iraq, on Sunday morning. The prospect has been raised that ISIS has missiles that could shoot down a plane . Fighters: ISIS militants swept across Iraq and now control a huge portion of the country . ISIS, the terrorist group which took over swathes of Iraq in June and declared it an 'Islamic State', are a brutal, anti-West group which has boasted of holding mass executions, crucifixion and imposing hardline Islamic law on its conquered territory. And today the prospect was raised that the group, which has looted Iraqi army supplies including attack helicopters and tanks, also has access to surface-to-air missiles capable of bringing down a passenger jet. Lieutenant-Colonel Richard Williams, a former SAS commander in Iraq and Afghanistan, has said it is 'perfectly possible' the militants have seized missiles from their operations in Syria. Holiday destination: Flights to South Africa, which pass over embattled parts of northern Africa, are cause for concern . Routes: Dubai, pictured, is one of the destinations which can be reached by flying over ISIS-held Iraq and Syria . Speaking to The Times, he said: 'They may also have skilled operators, given the amount of defectors from the Syrian regime and the old Iraqi army staff that will be around. 'I would like someone to show me that they don’t have them, rather than wait to be proved wrong.' Many flights to Asia, including routes to popular holiday destinations like Dubai, use the flight corridor over Mosul. There are also concerns over areas of north Africa such including Mali, where a plane crashed on Thursday, killing all 116 passengers. It is not clear what brought down the plane. Crash site: Flight paths over danger zones have come under scrutiny after MH17, the wreckage of which is pictured above, was brought down over eastern Ukraine after following a popular flight path . Fears: The prospect has been raised that surface-to-air missiles, which are believed to have brought down MH17, are also in the hands militant groups worldwide . Flights from UK airports which pass over the danger zones head to destinations including Johannesburg in South Africa, Doha in Qatar and parts of southern India. A spokesman for British Airways declined to comment on specific routes, but said they had decided all the flight paths they do take are safe. She said: 'Our flight plans vary depending on a variety of factors, but our highest and first priority is always the safety of our crew and customers. 'Some parts of the world are closed to commercial airline operations and we would never fly in airspace unless we were satisfied that it was safe to do so.' Other carriers provided similar responses.","Hundreds of flights a day pass over territory held by likes of ISIS in Iraq .

"With his public school education and aristocratic-sounding name, it’s hardly surprising Benedict Cumberbatch has been branded one of Britain’s poshest actors. But the Sherlock and Star Trek star has railed against the tag, insisting it’s unfair to typecast him as another stereotypical ‘posh kid’. In an interview with today’s Mail on Sunday Event magazine, he says: ‘There’s always going to be somebody spitting blood about my wooden-faced toffee-named crappy acting.’ Benedict Cumberbatch has railed against the tag of being one of Britain's poshest actors . The star of Sherlock tells The Mail on Sunday's Event magazine that it is 'lazy' to treat all public school actors the same way . The 36-year-old, who was brought up in Kensington and educated at £30,000-a-year Harrow, says it is ‘lazy’ to treat all public school actors the same way. He adds that he prefers working in the US because they are less interested in class. ‘No one minds so much over there,’ he says. ‘It’s rather about how good you are at your job. I was desperately proud of my parents for sending me to Harrow. It was a huge stretch for them. They were working actors who never knew when the next pay day might come. ‘My parents wanted the best for me. I wasn’t sent to the school my dad went to. I’m not a hereditary peer. Cumberbatch stars in the newest instalment of the Star Trek franchise . ‘One of the best things about being an actor is that it’s a meritocracy.’ Cumberbatch, who last year threatened to leave the UK because he was sick of being seen as ‘a moaning, rich, public school bastard’, adds: ‘I’m definitely middle-class, I think. 'I know others would argue but I’m not upper-class. Upper-class to me means you are either born into wealth or you’re royalty.

"Two Chinese officials have been arrested on suspicion of buying corpses from grave robbers in order to burn the bodies and hit government cremation targets. The crimes, which took place in the southern Guangdong province, were uncovered after a grave robber in the city of Beiliu in neighbouring Guangxi province was caught removing a body. He told investigators that he had been stealing corpses from tombs on the orders of two officials who had been concerned they would miss the Chinese government's controversial monthly cremation quota, which was installed to ensure enough land is given over to farming and property development. Sick: The crimes, which took place in the southern Guangdong province, were uncovered after a grave robber in the city of Beiliu in neighbouring Guangxi province was caught removing a body . The first reports of grave robbing in Beiliu emerged in June, when a local man contacted police to say his grandfather's tomb had been broken into and the body removed, according to Xinhua. In China the deceased are often buried in large tombs which allow people to perform ancestor worship rituals. Veneration of the dead by living relatives in deeply rooted in Chinese culture. In July a grave robber surnamed Zhong was arrested and confessed to stealing the body. He added that he had also taken more than 20 other corpses from graveyards in surrounding villages, putting them into bags and transporting them into neighbouring Guangdong province. There, he claims, two funeral management officials surnamed He and Dong purchased the bodies. According to local media the men later told investigating officers that they had burned the corpses in order to hit a controversial monthly cremation quota. Tradition: In China the deceased are often buried in large tombs which allow people to perform ancestor worship rituals. Veneration of the dead by living relatives in deeply rooted in Chinese culture . Mr Dong is said to have paid approximately £300 each for 10 corpses, while Mr He paid roughly £150 per body. It is not yet known how many the latter ended up purchasing. Xinhua reported the deals were allegedly 'approved' by the government, adding that since the arrests a number of other villages have come forward to report bodies missing from graves. The monthly cremation quota has caused controversy because ancestor worship is deeply rooted in Chinese culture. Many Chinese people also believe a person's body must be left untouched in order for them to enter the afterlife without difficulty. The regulations have led to a number of families secretly burying family members to get around the law, and there were even reports of elderly people committing suicide before the quota came into place so they could be guaranteed a traditional burial.","Funeral management officials allegedly bought corpses from grave robber .

Old kitbag: The adventurous grandfather of four journeyed by car, van, cargo ship, rickshaw and even horse-drawn chariot . The childhood sweethearts had visited South Africa together 25 times before Mrs Howitt died last year of lung disease. The grandfather of four has now raised nearly £6,000 for the LOROS Hospice, Leicester, where his wife of 55 years spent her final days. Mr Howitt met Diana when they were teenagers and decided he wanted to pay a memorable . tribute to the woman he loved. The brave hitchhiker carried his late wife's ashes in a little blue container and travelled through the night for weeks to reach his final destination, but said he was never afraid. Epic adventure: The route taken by the 80-year-old, through dozens of countries . Keeping her safe: The building industry sales consultant carried his wife's ashes in a tiny blue container . 'I never felt threatened,' he said. 'From the day I set off hitchhiking down the A47 from Leicester to the day I got to Cape Town. I’m not saying I’m particularly brave, I just never felt in any danger. 'I believe in God’s protection and I read Psalm 91 every day. 'Diana and I met when she was 15 and I was 16, we met at Melbourne Hall Church in Leicester and I was perhaps the one that didn’t run away fast enough. 'She loved Table Mountain and actually it was only the fifth time that we went there that she plucked up enough courage to go all the way to the top on the Table Mountain Aerial Cableway. Determined: In Egypt on a River Nile ferry near Luxor and in the Valley of the Kings . 'My work took me to South Africa often training people in the building industry so we had been there 25 times together, we spent anniversaries there and both loved the country.' Mr Howitt, who is a Christian, said he stayed in all sorts of accommodation at some of the most fascinating places in the world during his long trip in memory of his beloved wife. 'I visited Petra, the ancient city in Jordan, which was an amazing experience as I was taken there on horse-drawn chariot. 'When I got to Wadi-Haifa in Sudan I couldn’t find anywhere to stay so I just slept outside under the stars on an inflatable mattress, which is the only time I used it. 'I met a lot of different people but often language was a problem, from the southern Sudanese border I spent 22 hours on a cattle truck overnight to the Nairobi capital of Kenya.

'When we crossed the equator they stopped it especially for me and I was able to scatter some of Diana’s ashes there too. 'I had one journey where the driver only knew three words of English - ""Winston Churchill"" and ""Tito"" and would repeat them in varying order at regular intervals.' He started one day in Germany and had covered 600 miles and five countries by the end of it, finally heading to bed in Bulgaria. As part of the National Service, he had covered 12,000 miles of the UK travelling to training, and later in life he had hitchhiked around the coast of South Africa and in Israel. Even though he was 60 years older this time around, Mr Howitt said the worst his body went through  on his latest trip was some minor aches and pains. Special place: Mr Howitt, a Christian, said he and his wife had spent many anniversaries in South Africa . He said: 'In the last few days my big toes began to swell, so like a fast bowler in cricket, I cut out part of his shoes to relieve the pressure. 'This has been on my mind for well over 12 months and when you’re going for an objective, you visualise its achievement. 'I’ve done what I set out to do.

"Judge Nicolas Cooke QC, pictured, allowed James Parker's court application to attend a gig in Ibiza as he too had 'been behind the wheels of steel himself' An Old Bailey judge allowed a DJ allegedly involved in a £750,000 fraud to fly to Ibiza for a gig. DJ James Parker, 41, is accused along with three other men of submitting a string of false invoices to Marsh Ltd in a two-and-a-half year swindle. He denies committing fraud by false representation. Parker, who specialises in 'house' music, applied for permission to fly to the Spanish party isle later this month to perform alongside DJs Tall Paul and Judge Jules. Judge Nicholas Cooke QC allowed the bid in court - confessing he had ‘been behind the wheels of steel’ himself. When Judge Cooke revealed his musical past, Matthew Lawson - Parker's defence - joked: 'I will have to Google it.' Judge Cooke, who took silk in 1998, was handed a flyer for Parker’s upcoming . gig at the Es Paradis for a return of legendary club night Clockwork . Orange - 20 years after it first began. After doing so, Mr Lawson told the court: ‘He works as a DJ and continues to do so - the flyer is from one of the Ibiza clubs and has his name on it.’ An initially skeptical judge commented: ‘In my experience, the fact a DJ’s name appears on the flyers does not mean as huge amount.’ However, he was then convinced to allow the bid after hearing Parker’s bail had already been varied twice before. Parker, who is subject to bail conditions to stay at his home in West Norwood, southeast London and not to contact his co-defendants, will be allowed to fly to Ibiza from July 24 to 29 to play the gig. Parker, Ricky Merry, 45, Paul Seaman, 57, and Jason Senior, 48, are jointly accused of submitting a string of false invoices to insurance brokers Marsh Ltd to obtain £713,628.73 between November 4, 2008 and March 29, 2011.

"It was the 'Giant' German aircraft shot from the skies while delivering tanks and weaponry to the battlefield during the Second World War. Now nearly 70 years after being shot down by a British fighter, experts have found the only surviving example of the Messerschmitt 323 'Gigant' transport plane, 200ft underwater off the coast of Sardinia. The Me-323 - the largest land-based transport aircraft from the War - was on its way to the Tuscan city of Pistoia from its German base in Sardinia when it was hit by a Bristol Beaufighter fighter plane in July 1943. Wreckage: The rusting wreck of the Messerschmitt 323 was found by a small team of Italian divers off the Sardinian coast . Submerged: The 45-tonne transport plane - found 69 years after it was shot down - was thought to be the biggest of its kind in the War . Discovery: Divers had been looking for the wreckage of another plane when they found the Messerschmitt, a find described as being 'of great historical importance' After being taken down by the long-range fighter plane, it plunged into waters off the Maddalena islands, an idyllic getaway island now popular with holidaymakers. But a small team of divers and amateur historians have since 'stumbled upon' the wreckage hundreds of feet underwater, claiming the rusting Messerschmitt is amazingly still intact. CAPACITY: 130 troops/10-12 tonnes of equipment . LENGTH: 28.2m (92ft 4in) WINGSPAN: 55.2m (181ft) HEIGHT: 10.15m (33ft 4in) MAXIMUM SPEED: 285km/h (177mph) CRUISE SPEED: 218km/h (136mph) CLIMBING RATE: 3.6m/s (710ft/min) Remarkably, divers found the wreckage while they were searching for another sunken plane. Aldo Ferruci, a diving instructor and photographer who took pictures of the wreck, told The Daily Telegraph: 'It was just by chance that we found it because we were actually looking for a different plane wreck. 'We had understood that the Me-323 was in a totally different location so we were lucky to stumble on it. 'It is in good condition – it is almost intact, with the six engines still all in line.' Other experts described the find as one of 'great historical importance'. Second World War historians say they are aware of 'no other complete surviving Messerschmitt-323 Giant in existence.' There . were an estimated 213 Messerschmitt 323s made, with the transport . plane's first flight in 1942, before it was retired in 1944. It could take a load of up to 12 tonnes, or 120 fully-equipped men, and could reach speeds of around 210km/h (130mph), though variants like the D-6 could reach up to 285km/h (177mph). Only around 200 of the giant planes were ever produced, with the Messerschmitt's seeing action between 1942 and 1944. The Messerschmitt came into use due to the Germans' demand for airlifting vehicles and weaponry overseas as part of the Nazis' plan to invade Great Britain. Massive: The Messerschmitt could carry up to 25,000lbs, or 120 fully-equipped men, and regularly carried tanks and weaponry to the battlefield . The Messerschmitt recently found had been travelling from its . German base in Sardinia to Pistoia in Tuscany when it was shot down over . the Maddalena island in 1943 . Freight was loaded on to the enormous planes through double doors that formed the curved nose of the plane. The wartime discovery is the second in the space of three months, after divers found the wreckage of an Italian navy battleship, also off the Sardinian coast. Experts found the Roma 69 years after it was sunk by the Germans, in an incident which claimed 1,400 lives.","Wartime transport plane found 200ft underwater off Sardinian coast 69 years after it was shot from the skies .

"British teachers are among the best paid in Europe – but work fewer hours in the classroom, an international report found. The average primary school teacher in England earned £27,832 in 2011, much more  than in France, Spain and Italy. Scottish primary school teachers take home even more  – £30,168. Yet English primary teachers teach for just 684 hours a year, compared to 936 in France and 770 in Italy. Classroom: Teachers in England receive the equivalent of £40 for every hour spent teaching, leaving them ranked sixth overall by the OECD . Age: UK teachers are also younger than most other countries, with almost two thirds under the age of 40 . It means that while an English primary teacher earns £40.69 per hour spent in the classroom, a French teacher gets just £22.27. Only three other countries in Europe have higher pay rates for primary school teachers. The revelation comes in a report by . the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, which . represents industrialised nations. It will add to concerns that public sector staff are hugely overpaid compared to their competitors. Our GPs are also among the best . remunerated in the world.Despite the findings, a poll yesterday by . teaching union NASUWT revealed that 53 per cent of teachers say their . job satisfaction has fallen over the last year. Some 78 per cent said their biggest . concern was workload and 45 per cent were unhappy with pay levels. Teaching unions are preparing for nationwide strike action before the . end of the year. Pay: Teachers in Luxembourg are the best paid which their Slovak counterparts receive the least . Time: Teachers in Chile spend 1,120 hours-a-year teaching, much higher than the rest of the OECD's list of countries . Young people in the UK spend almost two-and-a-half years out of work on average, longer than those in many other developed nations, a major international study shows. Many young people will be out of the job market because they have 'given up, more or less', according to Andreas Schleicher, the OECD’s deputy director for education and skills. He warned that the 'biggest challenge' to the UK at this time is to help those youngsters who do not have decent qualifications and struggle to find work. Overall, UK young people aged between 15 and 29 expected to spend 2.3 years on average either unemployed or out of the labour force entirely, OECD figures for 2011 show. This is higher than in many other countries including the Netherlands (1.1 years), Iceland (1.2 years), Norway (1.3 years), Australia (1.7 years) and Germany (1.7 years). The report, entitled Education at a . Glance, shows that across the OECD, the average wage for a primary . teacher with 15 years’ service in 2011 was £23,976. English teachers fared much better, . taking home £27,832 in 2011 prices. It put us far ahead of France . (£20,843), Spain (£25,990), Italy (£20,728) – but behind  Germany . (£36,881). Across the OECD, teachers spend 786 hours teaching, compared to 684 in England. It means an English teacher’s hourly . rate of £40.69 is behind only Luxembourg, Germany, Denmark, the US and . Canada. The OECD average is £30.50. The study found that English teachers . earn a great deal more at the start of their careers than the OECD . average, although this lead falls behind the average as they reach the . end of their career. The report also shows that our . teachers are among the youngest in the West. Almost a third are under . 30, against an OECD average of 13 per cent. Andreas Schleicher, the OECD’s deputy . director for education and skills, said: ‘Primary school teachers in . England are particularly well-paid compared to others, but in the UK . class sizes are larger. ‘The English system is to give . teachers tougher work because of larger classes, but gives them fewer . teacher hours so they can give better lessons for larger groups.’ Last night a Government source said the OECD report showed the teaching unions were making unrealistic demands. He said: ‘The teaching unions should stop damaging children’s education by calling strikes. ‘Instead they should be demanding teachers spend more time teaching and focusing on the key academic subjects. ‘We can either start working as hard as the Chinese, or we’ll all soon be working for the Chinese.’","England's teachers earn equivalent of £40 per hour spent teaching .

Waiters can now whizz the iTray over tables and between chairs at speeds of up to 25 miles per hour, or six times faster than they usually walk . Known as the iTray, it is controlled with an iPad, which restaurant staff tip in the direction they want the food to travel. Staff load the tray, fly it to a customer’s table up to 50 yards away, and return it when they see the food has been removed. Currently there are just two of the devices in operation, at the chain’s Soho branch in central London. If it proves popular it could be rolled out to all 64 of Yo! Sushi’s UK restaurants next year. It is not Yo! Sushi’s only foray into . automated food delivery. It was the first UK chain to introduce . conveyor belt service and speaking robot drinks trolleys . Staff at a central London branch of Japanese chain YO! Sushi are trialing the gadget, which is controlled via an iPad . The company launched the iTray to mark the release of their new burger, which replaces the traditional bun with Japanese toasted rice . Waitress Gabriella Micu, 28, said: . ‘It’s really fun for customers and I hope we can get to the point where . we can serve guests from the central kitchen as it would definitely help . to cut down the time walking around the restaurant.’ The iTray is made from a light-weight carbon fibre frame. YO! Sushi said it currently has two models in operation. The food-laden drone is then steered around the flagship store, in Soho, by tilting the iPad in the direction you want it to travel . The company claims it has launched the iTray to mark the release of their new burger, which replaces the traditional bun with Japanese toasted rice. The beef patty is also substituted for teriyaki chicken, kimchi salmon, prawn katsu, tilapia katsu (whitefish) or tofu katsu. Customer Mark Love, 26, from London, said: 'When I ordered the burger I never imagined it would come flying towards me on a tray. 'It was amazing and the weirdest thing, like something out of a science fiction novel. It was delivered as if by magic, like an alien flying saucer bringing food directly onto my table.' Robin Rowland, CEO of YO! Sushi, said: 'We brought the famous kaiten conveyor belt to the UK, introduced interactive call buttons, speaking robot drinks trolleys, self-heating plates and video game toilets. 'Now we have introduced the iTray, which is great fun.' Mike Lewis, YO! Sushi executive chef, said: 'We've been training our Soho team for several weeks now to get used to working with our new flying friend. 'With the YO! Burger, we wanted to introduce our customers something entirely new, inspired by Japan and exclusive to us. 'It's taken several months to develop, a raft of new kitchen equipment, but with the YO! Burger and iTray we know guests will feel like they've had a taste of the future.'","Food-laden drone 'on trial' at YO! Sushi branch in London .

"A blood test will soon allow doctors to tailor breast cancer treatment individually in a breakthrough  which they hope will save thousands of lives. Until now, medics have relied on scans to tell them whether a tumour is responding to therapy. But a test developed at Cambridge University could give them the earliest warning yet that a chosen approach is ineffective, allowing them to try an alternative. It could be available for widespread use in less than three years, and the makers hope it will not only save or extend patients’ lives, but minimise the unpleasant side-effects associated with  many treatments, such as chemotherapy. Breakthrough: A blood test developed by scientists at Cambridge University could provide an early warning that certain breast cancer treatments are ineffective . In the study, backed by Cancer Research UK and published in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers took regular blood samples from 30 women with advanced breast cancer. They looked at three markers in the blood to see if they reflected advancement or regression in the disease. One of the indicators, ‘circulating tumour DNA’, was detected in 29 of the 30 participants where changes in their cancer had been identified. Although the tests were carried out on women with metastatic breast cancer – an aggressive form of the disease which has spread to other organs – scientists suggest it should work on all breast cancer sufferers, allowing for tailored treatments. In 2010, 49, 564 women and 397 men were diagnosed with breast cancer. A total of 11.633 died . In 2010, 49,564 women and 397 men were diagnosed with breast cancer, with 11,633 deaths. Dr Sarah-Jane Dawson, who is based at Cancer Research UK’s Cambridge Research Institute, said: ‘The main objective of the blood test is to see if someone is responding to their treatment and if not then switch them to an alternative therapy. ‘Hopefully this tailored approach will translate into better survival rates or in the case of those with metastatic cancer, extend their lives for as long as possible. ‘The next step is to integrate this technology into a clinical trial. ‘We anticipate it should be routinely used within the next two to three years.’ Currently, doctors monitor the progress of treatment by using scans to observe how the cancer is responding. The blood tests give an earlier and more detailed ‘real time’ picture of changes taking place in  the body. Lead author Professor Carlos Caldas added: ‘This study highlights the potential of personalised cancer medicine. ‘Fragments of DNA are shed by cancer cells when they die, meaning they can be detected in blood samples using sensitive new sequencing techniques. The levels of tumour DNA tell us how the cancer is responding to treatment.’ Professor Peter Johnson, Cancer Research UK’s chief clinician, said: ‘These results hold the promise of a system that could allow us to modify someone’s treatment as their cancer changes, and they suggest an exciting way to quickly get hold of the personal details of a cancer, to target it for the most effective therapy.’ A breakthrough drug for women with an aggressive form of breast cancer could prevent their condition worsening for an extra six months. Up to 10,000 women a year could benefit from the drug pertuzumab which today gets a licence for use in Britain from the European Medicines Agency. It works against the HER2-positive form of the disease and doctors say it could transform treatment in the same way as the ‘wonder’ drug Herceptin. Trials show women on combination treatment of pertuzumab, Herceptin and chemotherapy lived on average for 18 months without their disease worsening, compared with 12 months for those not taking the new drug, also known as Perjeta. Dr David Miles of the Mount Vernon Cancer Centre in London said: ‘I’ve seen the disease getting worse in front of me and then women recovering when they have pertuzumab.’","Test developed at Cambridge could save thousands of lives .

"It's been a week since androgynous model Andreja Pejic came out as a transgender woman and after a long wait, she's now opening up about what she describes a 'life-saving' decision. Andreja, 22, underwent sexual reassignment surgery earlier this year to transform herself from a man to a woman, a move she's been planning since the age of 13, and although her looks haven't changed, her sexual anatomy - at last - has. 'Now I can stand naked in front of a mirror and really enjoy my reflection,' she told Style.com. 'And those personal moments are important.' 'Those personal moments are important': Andrej (pictured in April) had been planning her sexual reassignment surgery since the age of 13, and now that it's finally done, she can fully enjoy the sight of her naked body . Born in Bosnia in 1991, Andreja - who was born with the male name Andrej but has since added an 'a' to feminize it - grew up with her family in Australia, and was discovered by a talent scout while she working at McDonald's; kicking off her highly successful modelling career in 2010. In America, which she says is less 'progressive,' Andreja has worked primarily on the male board of her agency DNA, whereas in Europe, she has been on both male and female boards. 'I told my men’s agent [in New York] about two weeks before the operation,' she explains. 'Because I didn’t want anything to stop me. 'And then recently, I had a meeting with the women’s [team], and they’ve been very positive about moving from the men’s board to the women’s board, which is amazing. It’s something I guess no one’s ever done.' Now a woman: Andreja (pictured this month) has been working as both a male and a female model in Europe, but in America, which she describes as less 'progressive,' she has been on her agency's men's board . Making moves: '[My agency] has been very positive about moving from the men's board to the women's board. It's something I guess no one's ever done,' Andreji says, pictured in 2012 (left) and in 2013 (right) It is unclear whether or not Andreja plans to have breast surgery, but for the stunning six-foot-one blonde, her sexual reassignment surgery marks a major milestone is leaving all traces of manhood behind. 'I felt like my options were either to be a gay boy or a straight boy. I didn’t feel that I was gay' The only time in her life when she embraced being male, she says, was in her pre-teens. 'I went on sort of a boyhood campaign from age nine to about 13. I felt like my options were either to be a gay boy or a straight boy. 'I didn’t feel that I was gay, so I didn’t know that there were any other options until the age of 13, when I went online and discovered that there’s a whole community of trans people out there.' Chameleon: It is unclear whether the stunning six-foot-one blonde (left and right) plans to have breast surgery as part of her transformation . High fashion: In 2011, Andreja walked the runway during the . Jean-Paul Gaultier women's show as part of the Paris Haute Couture . Fashion Week Spring/Summer show (pictured) Despite her roaring success in the fashion industry thus far - she credits designer Jean Paul Gaultier, photographer Juergen Teller, and former French Vogue editor Carine Roitfeld as being particularly supportive - Andreja says she still faces 'roadblocks' as a transgender model. 'Particularly when working with cosmetic brands or perfumes or those sort of commercial, corporate things,' she reveals. 'It’s been more difficult. They don’t have any market research, and people in that world aren’t risk takers. 'You have to prove to them over and over that you are liked by people, you have a skill, and you can sell a product.' The big reveal: Andreja posted this selfie on Facebook last week with a message to her fans:  'I hope to show that after transition (a life-saving process) one can be happy and successful in their new chapter' It's not a problem, however, that she is facing with Hollywood. Andreja has just bagged herself a role in director Sofia Coppola's upcoming film adaption of The Little Mermaid, playing one of the lead character's sisters. For the model and now actress, who says she is currently single but 'open to love,' her message to fans is simple. In a statement she posted to Facebook last week when she first broke the news, she wrote: 'As a transgender woman, I hope to show that after transition (a life-saving process) one can be happy and successful in their new chapter.'","Andreja – formerly Andrej – Pejic, 22, went public about her decision to have sexual reassignment surgery last week .

"Cowboy builders botched Stonehenge and may have never even finished it, according to a leading historian. Professor Ronald Hutton described the prehistoric wonder on Salisbury Plain, Wiltshire, as ‘a unique and possibly failed experiment – as much a triumph as a disaster’ in a talk at the Daily Mail Chalke Valley History Festival. It is a triumph, he said, ‘because the darned thing’s still there and it’s the most famous prehistoric monument in the entire world’ built by somebody who was ‘insane enough to want to try the experiment of working enormous stones as if they were wood’. Cowboy builders: Crowds gather at dawn at Stonehenge in Wiltshire for the Summer Solstice last Saturday . The claims were made by University of Bristol historian, Professor Ronald Hutton (pictured) ‘They pulled it off but they had some bad times along the way,’ said Professor Hutton, an expert on paganism from Bristol University. ‘When they put up one of those great sandstone blocks in the outer circle, it slipped when it was being put in its hole, fell over and broke in half. ‘If you were a decent bunch of builders what you’d do then is, after a great deal of screaming and complaining, chuck the two broken bits away and bring another one intact and do it properly. ‘They didn’t. They put one broken bit on top of the other broken bit, jammed a lintel on top and hoped they’d stay together. They didn’t, they fell over quite soon after. ‘So these people are working under . pressure, they don’t have the resources or the time to get another . stone. This is the heart of the disaster that Stonehenge ended up being. Sunrise: A professor said it was 'a unique and possibly failed experiment - as much a triumph as a disaster' Wide view: Stonehenge, the prehistoric wonder on Salisbury Plain, near Amesbury in Wiltshire . ‘Because of shoddy or high-pressure, . efficiency-gaining, new Stone Age engineering, we have lost the great . engineering feat of Stonehenge.’ The . avenue that leads into Stonehenge is aligned directly on the mid-summer . sunrise so that two of the stones frame the sunrise ‘like the sights of . a camera or gun’. But Professor Hutton said the ‘even more stunning effect’ at the mid-winter sunset was lost – because of another mistake by the builders. He said they built a trilithon – two massive upright stones with a lintel on top – but one of the uprights was not rooted deeply enough in the ground. ‘At some time, that stone skidded out,’ said the professor. ‘It fell headlong across the altar stone, knocking the altar stone to the ground and breaking in half itself. That massive lintel tumbled down and still lies where it fell. They never tried to fix it. ‘So Stonehenge was built by cowboys. It is on the one hand one of the greatest building successes in the story of the human race and from another point of view one of the greatest catastrophes.’ King Arthur Pendragon, the Battle Chieftain of the Council of British Druid Orders and Titular Head and Chosen Chief of the Loyal Arthurian Warband Druid . King Arthur Pendragon (pictured right), the Battle Chieftain of the Council of British Druid Orders and Titular Head and Chosen Chief of the Loyal Arthurian Warband Druid order, the ‘political warrior arm of the modern druid movement’, caused a stir during a question and answer session after Professor Hutton’s talk. Having listened intently throughout, the druid suddenly sprung to his feet when another audience member asked the historian: ‘It’s a heinous thought, but has anyone ever proposed to rebuild Stonehenge?’ King Arthur shouted: ‘That’s my heinous thought!’, reducing festival-goers to laughter, before sitting down quietly again next to his partner Kazz, a ‘priestess’ whose druid name is Caliope Muse. Professor Hutton said: ‘It’s a valid proposal and there is this kind of sneaking wish than more archaeologists have so far liked to admit that to put up the great trilithon and this time anchor it properly would actually restore Stonehenge to its ancient glory - we’d get the point of the whole monument again.’ Afterwards, King Arthur told the Mail: ‘I went on record at the turn of the millennium and said a far better thing for the modern druids to do and a legacy to leave to our grandchildren would be to rebuild Stonehenge and put the lintels back up. ‘It would certainly stand the test of time - unlike the Millennium Dome, which they did put up. I still feel it would be a good legacy to leave to future generations if we did in fact rebuild it.’","Professor Ronald Hutton: It was 'unique and possibly failed experiment'

"Boxing legend Muhammad Ali received another title for his legendary collection yesterday when he was honoured with a Liberty Medal for his role as a humanitarian fighter. The sporting icon took centre stage at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia to receive the award for his longtime role outside the ring as a fighter for humanitarian causes, civil rights and religious freedom. The three-time world heavyweight champion received an honour that his wife, Lonnie Ali, called 'overwhelming'. Scroll down for video . Family affair: Ali receives the award from his daughter Laila in a ceremony which the legendary fighter's family described as 'overwhelming' She said: 'It is especially humbling for Muhammad, who has said on many occasions, ""All I did was to stand up for what I believe"".' 70-year-old Ali, who has battled Parkinson's disease for three decades, stood with assistance to receive the medal from his daughter Laila Ali. He looked down at his medal for several moments and then waved to the crowd. The award comes with a $100,000 cash prize. Ali was born Cassius Clay but changed his name after converting to Islam in the 1960s. He refused to serve in the Vietnam War because of his religious beliefs and was stripped of his heavyweight crown in 1967. A U.S. Supreme Court ruling later cleared him of a draft evasion conviction, and he regained the boxing title in 1974 and again 1978. Legend: The boxing icon received the award from his daughter Laila for his lifetime role as a fighter for humanitarian causes . One of his most famous fights took place in Zaire, now the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where he battled George Foreman in the 'Rumble in the Jungle' in 1974. At the ceremony Thursday, retired NBA star Dikembe Mutombo recalled the impression Ali's visit made on him as an 8-year-old growing up in that country. 'He changed my life,' said Mutombo, who also is a trustee of the Constitution Center. 'I can never forget how inspired I was to see a black athlete receive such respect and admiration. One of a kind: Ali's family, including his wife Lonnie (second left) and sister-in-law Marilyn Williams (right) said the icon received the award despite 'standing up for what he believes in' Another title for the collection: Ali, who has been battling Parkinson's disease for three decades, did not speak at the award ceremony . 'He changed how the people of Zaire saw themselves, and in turn how the world saw them.' Legend: Ali, pictured here in 1978, was a three-time world heavyweight boxing champion . Since hanging up his gloves in 1981, Ali has traveled extensively on international charitable missions and devoted his time to social causes. Ali received the nation's highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, in 2005. He also has established the Muhammad Ali Parkinson Research Center in Phoenix and a namesake educational and cultural institute in his hometown, Louisville, Ky. The National Constitution Center, which . opened in 2003, is dedicated to increasing public understanding of the . Constitution and the ideas and values it represents. It awards the Liberty Medal annually . to a person who displays courage and conviction while striving to secure . freedom for people around the world. Previous .

"Bloodied and bruised having been battered around the face, these are the shocking images of a cyclist who was the victim of a horrific road rage attack. Philip Elliott, 51, was cycling home from work in Hull, East Yorks, when Daniel Miller leapt from a car and attacked him. Miller, 22, repeatedly punched Philip and slammed his head into the ground. Horrific: Cyclist Philip Elliott suffered a fractured cheekbone and fractured eye socket after being battered by drunken lout Daniel Miller . Traumatised: The cyclist said he suffers nightmares and cannot leave the house at night after the savage beating . Scarring: Mr Elliott, 51, said he has only been out in the dark twice since suffering the road rage attack in February this year . Onlookers feared the cyclist was dead after the horrific assault. He was left unconscious on the ground and suffered a fractured cheekbone and a fractured eye socket. Car passenger Miller had sunk ten pints of lager at a pub in Spring Bank, Hull, when he was collected by his girlfriend in her car. Hull Crown Court heard she pulled in front of Philip, nearly hitting him. After the near collision Miller sprang from the vehicle and viciously 'beat Elliott to a pulp', after which witnesses thought he had been killed. Mr Elliott said: 'I had just finished work and was riding my bike home as normal. A car pulled up in front of me and just stopped abruptly by the kerb and this man started shouting. 'I actually thought he was shouting at somebody else. I was about to ride around the car when he punched me. Cowardly: Miller fled the scene after the attack, but was later caught and jailed for three years . Mr Elliott also suffered heavy bruising to the side and top of the head after being punched repeatedly by Miller on his way home from work . 'The last thing I remember is getting punched in the face. He beat me to a pulp. He really went to town on me. I feel lucky to be alive. 'I don’t feel safe now. I’ve only been out in the dark twice since it happened.' Prosecutor Nick Adlington said: 'Miller blamed the cyclist for cycling in the middle of the road without lights, thereby causing the near collision. 'He decamped from the car and punched the complainant a number of times. Lout: Drunken thug Daniel Miller drank 10 pints of lager before subjecting Elliott (right) to the vicious beating . 'He punched him to the ground and appeared to grab him by the scruff of his neck and punched him a number of times while he was on the ground. 'In between punches, Mr Elliot’s head was being banged on the floor. He was unable to defend himself and was bleeding heavily from his head.' Miller fled the scene to a hotel in West Yorkshire with his girlfriend after the attack, shortly after 8pm on February 26. They returned to Hull the next day and were caught through number plate recognition when the car they were driving entered the city. Miller pleaded guilty at Hull Crown Court to grievous bodily harm with intent. Judge John Dowse told him: 'We have seen the photos of what you did to this man. You effectively beat him to a pulp. 'It was unprovoked. You left the car and you savaged him.' Miller, an electrician, was jailed for three years and three months. He has previous convictions for assault occasioning actual bodily harm and possessing cocaine.","Cyclist Philip Elliott, 51, subjected to vicious beating from drunken thug .

"For a long time, I struggled to comprehend how Cyril Smith's influence had allowed him to escape the law for so long. Then I got a call from a former officer with the Metropolitan Police. There was, he said, a simple explanation. His enormous working-class appeal left the Director of Public Prosecutions worried that Cyril might be able to do something remarkable if he went to trial — win public sympathy for paedophilia. This sounds incredible now, but as the former police officer went on to explain: ‘They knew how popular he was in Rochdale and thought it might backfire. They thought ladies in Rochdale would be offering their children up in a show of support.’ Former Blair ministers Patricia Hewitt (left) and Harriet Harman (right), plus current shadow minister Jack Dromey, were all recently identified by the Mail as senior figures in the NCCL when it was linked to the Paedophile Information Exchange . Jack Dromey attended key meetings . My head was spinning at the thought. It sounded complete lunacy. But if you followed this story down the rabbit hole into the Seventies Wonderland you quickly had to acknowledge there were more than a few advocates for paedophilia. The Paedophile Liberation Front and the Paedophile Information Exchange were two of the more high-profile liberation campaigns that sprung up at the time, seeking to reclassify paedophilia as ‘intergenerational relationships’. One of the leading members of the Paedophile Information Exchange was the British diplomat, Sir Peter Hayman, who was later jailed. These weren’t simply loony fringe sects. As has been exposed by the Mail, they were affiliated to the National Council of Civil Liberties (NCCL), now known as Liberty, and would pop up frequently in the media. Part of their strategy, as their chairman Keith Hose freely admitted, was to ‘seek out as much publicity for the organisation as possible’ and ‘the only way to get more paedophiles joining PIE’ was ‘to make paedophilia a real public issue’. In this they succeeded. They had as many as a thousand members, and were influential. In 1978 they sent every Member of Parliament a copy of their booklet, Paedophilia: Some Questions And Answers. The national media reported on their views and the NCCL seemed sympathetic. Most alarmingly, a letter published in the NCCL house magazine, Rights, in 1982, argued that more needed to be done to champion paedophile rights. ‘Consensual sex between adults and children is simply people of different age groups being nice to each other,’ the author claimed. Worryingly, it seemed that a fair few on the Left, including some who have subsequently become key figures in the Labour Party were fooled into giving this hideous group shelter. [Former Blair ministers Patricia Hewitt and Harriet Harman, plus current shadow minister Jack Dromey, were all recently identified by the Mail as senior figures in the NCCL when it was linked to PIE]. All of which helped Cyril’s cause and kept him hidden from scrutiny. It seems unthinkable now, but groups like these tried to water down parliamentary Bills which were intended to protect children from child abusers, and academics loudly championed their cause. Cambridge professor Donald West was among those leading the charge of the child sex abuse lobby. It was ‘unwise’, he argued, ‘to over-dramatise institutional abuse’. Cyril Smith's enormous working-class appeal left the Director of Public Prosecutions worried that the MP might be able to do something remarkable if he went to trial - win public sympathy for paedophilia . With this sickening liberal wind behind them, it was hardly surprising that ugly networks quickly grew to protect and provide for paedophiles of a high social status. Secret parties, underground grooming activities and vile associations all developed out of these thriving networks. The Elm Guest House in Barnes, South-West London, soon became the centre of a VIP paedophile ring. But although it was raided by the Vice Squad in 1982, allegations of child abuse were never followed up. Only after recent political pressure in Parliament has a police investigation finally started to look into allegations of boys being trafficked from a nearby care home run by Richmond Council, to be abused at this guest house by a paedophile ring. There has been much speculation as to who was part of this sordid club, but the Metropolitan Police confirmed that Cyril Smith was a visitor. I found eyewitness proof of this when I was passed the details of someone who was forced to work at Elm Guest House in the early Eighties as a masseur. ‘He knows all about Cyril,’ my source told me. ‘See if he’ll speak to you.’ The Paedophile Liberation Front and the Paedophile Information Exchange were two of the more high-profile liberation campaigns that sprung up at the time, seeking to reclassify paedophilia as 'intergenerational relationships'. Above, a demo outside a PIE meeting in 1977 . The man, who was 16 at the time and understandably doesn’t want to be named, answered straight away. ‘How did you get my number?’ he demanded. There was fear in his voice. He warned me of the dangers of digging too deep into what went on at Elm Guest House. ‘The police told me not to say anything about it. You know what happened to Carole, don’t you?’ Carole Kasir ran Elm Guest House from 1979 to 1982. Paedophiles from all over the country would attend parties there and boys were sexually abused. It was raided by police in 1982 and shut down. Years later, Kasir threatened to expose all the people who’d attended her parties. Soon afterwards she was found dead of an insulin overdose. The fear in the former masseur’s voice is genuine and not for the first time I wonder whether victims of abuse can ever feel safe no matter how much distance they put between themselves and their abusers. I learned that Cyril had visited Elm Guest House several times for sessions with this 16-year-old lad. He liked to receive oral sex. On one occasion ‘Tubby’, as he was nicknamed, got stuck in the sauna and had to be hoisted out. Another victim has gone public to say that Cyril had a friendship with notorious paedophile and founding member of the Paedophile Information Exchange, Peter Righton, who co-authored a book, Perspectives On Paedophilia, which championed the right of adults to have sex with children. Cyril was part of a bigger story and I’m sure he wasn’t the only high-profile figure, or even politician, involved in preying on and abusing young boys all over the country.

"A county court judge who approved his own pistol permit has been reprimanded on Judicial Conduct - after accidentally firing the weapon in his courthouse chambers. Judge Vincent Sgueglia, the sole licensing officer in Tioga County, New York, was trying to repair his .38 caliber Smith and Wesson revolver during a break in court proceedings when he accidentally fired it at a wall. The 70-year-old judge discharged the weapon in his own chambers after approving his own pistol permit. Censured: Judge Sgueglia accidentally fired a revolver after approving his own pistol permit . The bullet from the firearm lodged in a wall, but noone was injured after the incident in 2010. Sgueglia has since been censured by the New York State Commission on Judicial Conduct. According to reports, Judge Sgueglia had begun carrying a pistol after receiving threats from members of the public. The judge reportedly feared for his own safety after receiving death threats from jail inmates and being followed while driving home from the courthouse. The commission found that Sgueglia should not have used his decision-making authority for his own benefit, noting the permit has no restrictions and covers 20 pistols. Fired: Judge Sgueglia discharged a .38 caliber Smith and Wesson revolver . No one was hurt by the bullet fired from the revolver, but court officials were in a room nearby, it was reported. Tioga County Sheriff’s investigators determined the incident was an accident. Sgueglia first took office in 1993 and his term in office was due to end at the end of this year. He will not serve as a judicial hearing officer after leaving the bench and must not defer to another judge. Commission Administrator Robert H. Tembeckjian said: 'To his credit, Judge Sgueglia readily acknowledged this principle and agreed that he should be censured for violating it and for his carelessness in repairing and firing a weapon in the courthouse. 'We are lucky and grateful that no one was injured.'",Judge Vincent Sgueglia accidentally discharged his own revolver during court recess .
"A celebrity hairdresser whose clients include the Duchess of Cambridge has been fined £40,000 after one of his stylists suffered third degree burns in a fire at his salon. Stylist Gail Purcell received serious burns after an accident at the boutique owned by Daniel Hersheson, who has styled the hair of countless celebrities at the salon over the years, when her skirt was set alight by a candle used to create atmosphere. Hersheson is the head of a family beauty dynasty which includes wife Ruth, son Luke and daughter Lauren, and whose clients have included Kate Middleton, socialite Tara Palmer Tomkinson, model Pixie Geldof and actress Sienna Miller. Accident: Gail Purcell suffered third degree burns when her clothes caught fire at the salon in West London . According to statements gathered by London Fire Brigade safety inspectors, Ms Purcell had to run to different parts of the building in Conduit Street trying to find water and help to put the fire out. Hersheson spends most of his working time at the Conduit Street branch but also works one day a week at Harvey Nichols. No fire alarm sounded, no one appeared to know what to do and no first aid was given before paramedics arrived at the blaze in 26 May 2009. Ms Purcell was taken to Chelsea and Westminster hospital following the fire and was found to have suffered third degree burns. London Fire Brigade were not called to the blaze but attended the flagship boutique on 29 May 2009 to conduct a fire safety inspection, where a number of serious safety concerns emerged. The salon of celebrity stylist Daniel Hersheson (left) was fined £40,000 after a hearing at Southwark Crown Court attended by the hairdresser's wife Ruth (right) They found fire doors at the luxury salon were propped open, storage was blocking some of the corridors, fire alarms were faulty and there was a substandard fire risk assessment in place.

"A dog has become the first pet in Britain to be killed by an electronic cigarette. Staffordshire Bull Terrier Ivy died within hours of chewing on a bottle of nicotine-laced liquid used to fuel the smoke-free vaporiser. Her owner Keith Sutton, 56, bought the device in a bid to cut down on his tobacco habit. The battery-powered aid works by heating up the 'e-liquid' into a gas which the user inhales like real cigarette smoke. Staffordshire Bull Terrier Ivy died after chewing on a bottle of nicotine-laced liquid used in an e-cigarette . Coach driver Mr Sutton, of Redruth, Cornwall, had left a bottle of the liquid on his dining room table when 14-week-old Ivy bit into it. She immediately started frothing at the mouth and vomiting and Keith rushed her to the vets, where she was given huge doses of steroids, but died from nicotine poisoning early the next day. There are currently warnings on the bottles but grandfather Keith wants to see e-liquid become a controlled substance before it kills another animal. He said: 'I peered round the corner from the kitchen and the dog was on the floor with the bottle of e-liquid. 'She had chewed it and pierced the plastic container. She had only ingested the tiniest amount but by the time I picked her up she was frothing at the mouth. Keith Sutton with an E-cigarette similar to the one which killed his pet dog . Keith Sutton says Staffordshire bull terrier Ivy died of nicotine poisoning hours after chewing on the E-cigarette . Nicotine is a highly poisonous substance that can kill both humans and animals. In the Three Act Tragedy by Agatha Christie, Belgian detective Hercule Poirot investigates when one character, Sir Bartholomew Strange, was poisoned with nicotine, a colorless, odorless liquid lethal at just a few drops. Toxicology experts warned that drinking the equivalent of just two bottles of e-liquid could deliver enough nicotine to kill a human. There were nine UK deaths from nicotine poisoning in the three decades leading up to the 1970s, when nicotine was available in liquid form in insecticides. The lowest fatal dose was between 50 and 60 milligrams - equivalent to smoking about 20 to 30 cigarettes or drinking two high strength bottles of e-liquid containing 24 milligrams of nicotine each. Nicotine poisoning induces vomiting, muscles spasms and seizures. In fatal cases it interferes with the central nervous system and causes respiratory failure. It is also highly poisonous to cats and dogs. Common signs to watch for include vomiting, abnormal heart rate, uncoordination, tremors, weakness and collapse. Nicotine is a rapid acting toxin and, often, pets will show signs of poisoning within 1 hour of ingestion, the Pet Poison helpline warns. The . toxic dose for nicotine in pets is 1/2-1 mg per pound of pet body . weight, while the lethal dose is 4 mg per pound of pet body weight. So a 40lb dog would get very sick after eating one cigarette - but would need 11 cigarettes to die from nicotine poisoning. Pets ingesting small amounts of nicotine often vomit spontaneously and may self-decontaminate. However, even when vomiting occurs, veterinary evaluation after ingestion is typically recommended so that the heart rate, blood pressure and neurological status can be monitored. Treatments including additional decontamination, IV fluids and medications to slow the heart rate, decrease the blood pressure or stop tremors may be needed. 'I attempted to cool her down with cold water but I don't know any dog first aid, I just did whatever came into my mind. 'Her . tongue was blue, her lips were blue. She messed herself, then she . vomited. 'My partner was on the phone to the vet who said get her here as . quickly as possible. 'When we got there the vet went on to the veterinary websites but couldn't find anything about nicotine poisoning. 'He eventually went away and got an old book on poisons. He shook his head and told us it wasn't good. 'He gave her an injection of steroids, then put her on a drip and promised to phone us every couple of hours through the night. 'They . said the first 12 hours were critical and we received a call after 12 . and a half hours saying she had passed away. Her lungs and heart had . given up.' Keith - who uses an eKarma Vaporiser . fuelled by k-Liquid - is one of an estimated four million people in . Britain who have turned to electronic cigarettes. The World Health Organisation has refused to endorse the device until long-term trials prove they are safe. The . e-liquid itself contains chemicals such as propylene glycol and . polyethylene glycol 400 which are mixed with vegetable glycerin and . various flavourings, plus varying amounts of nicotine. While . it would take a large dose of nicotine to harm a human, experts say a . dog would only have to ingest 10 milligrams per kilogram of animal . weight to be in danger. There have been reports of pets fatally chewing on tobacco but Ivy is believed to be Britain's first canine victim of e-liquid. Keith wants to see much clearer health warnings on bottles and wants them sold as controlled substances like medicines or alcohol. Ivy, who came from an RSPCA rescue centre, was treated at Animal Veterinary Services in Hayle, Cornwall. Vets there confirmed that Ivy's symptoms, which included vomiting, diarrhoea, difficulty in breathing and heart problems, are all typical of nicotine poisoning. A spokesperson said: 'The dog started to get a reaction after 30 seconds of piercing the bottle. 'We managed to keep her going for a few hours, but she died in the early hours of Monday morning. 'The fluid is potentially fatal for dogs and they are perfectly capable of putting a tooth through the packaging.' Keith's vaporizer was a Falcon electronic cigarette, produced by a different company, UK-based Prestige Vaping. Neither company has responded to a request for comment. Nicotine is also a highly toxic to humans. Professor Alastair Hay, professor of toxicology at Leeds University, said: ""Make no mistake nicotine is a potent and highly toxic chemical that kills. 'When you smoke cigarettes the concentration of nicotine is small and delivered over a period of time so the compound is metabolised and broken down in the body. 'But when it was used in insecticides there were quite a few cases of humans dying as a result of drinking it, either deliberately or accidentally. 'Certainly these bottles of e-liquid should come with clear warning labels and they should be kept well away from children.' Sheila Merrill, public health adviser at the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, added: . 'Nicotine is a toxic substance and poisonous to children. 'This is why it is important to treat electric cigarettes and its components - including the e-liquid - in the same way as you would household chemicals, by storing them out of the sight and reach of children in a locked cupboard. 'If you believe that your child has ingested nicotine, seek medical advice immediately.'","Staffordshire Bull Terrier Ivy died within hours of chewing on a bottle of nicotine-laced liquid used to fuel e-cigarette .

"'Inappropriate': The X Factor was embroiled in yet another sleaze row yesterday after a raunchy performance by controversial singer Lady Gaga prompted hundreds of complaints . The X Factor is embroiled in yet another sleaze row after a raunchy performance by Lady Gaga prompted hundreds of complaints. The controversial singer stripped to her underwear and danced provocatively across the stage in a pre-watershed results programme watched by nearly a million children on Sunday night. Outraged parents said her display was ‘completely inappropriate for a family show’, and campaigners called for Ofcom to take tough action against ITV for allowing it to be shown on air. Vivienne Pattison, director of pressure group Mediawatch UK, accused the broadcasting regulator of being too lenient on similar performances in the past. She said: ‘The X Factor are doing everything they can to keep their ratings up. I don’t think things like this should be in TV. It is damaging to the children who watch the show. It tells children, particularly young girls, “This is what you have to do if you want to make it in the music industry”. The biggest stars are always shown taking their clothes off.’ Lady GaGa, 27 – whose real name is Stefani Germanotta – appeared on stage wearing flesh coloured pants, a bra covered with white shells and a blonde wig. Supported by ten scantily clad backing dancers, she performed her new single Venus while writhing around on stage. Ditching her wig and the shells, she then began rubbing her hands over her torso as she repeatedly sang ‘Do what you want with my body’. The routine ended with her crawling across the stage and onto a piano, where she remained for a post-performance interview with host Dermot O’Leary. Ofcom said it had received more than 100 complaints yesterday and is currently assessing whether to launch a full investigation. Another 60 viewers complained directly to ITV after Lady Gaga’s provocative routine was aired at 8.30pm, before the 9pm watershed. Miss Pattison said: ‘Even if it doesn’t break the letter of Ofcom’s rules, it certainly breaks the spirit. Ofcom have let things like this go unpunished so many times in the past, they have single-handedly redefined what is acceptable on TV. ‘People say it is up to parents to protect their children. But that is becoming increasingly difficult. You’d have to live in a bubble to avoid it.’ Many viewers were appalled at the exhibition. Of a total audience of 8.8million, an estimated 975,000 were children under 16. Writing on Twitter, Matthew McCaw wrote: ‘Lady Gaga’s song choice was completely inappropriate for a family show.’ Steve Thomas added: ‘What was she thinking wearing next to nothing on a family show?’ Keely . Morley said: ‘Just rang ITV livid. Lady gaga totally inappropriate 4 . family viewing & the message ‘do what u want 2 my body’ awful.’ Stripped: The routine, which included Gaga rubbing her hands over her body as she sang 'Do what you want with my body', ended with her crawling across the stage and onto a piano . Complaints: Ofcom said it had received more than 100 complaints about Lady Gaga's performance, in which she was supported by ten scantily clad backing dancers . Despite the public outcry, X Factor judges Sharon Osbourne, Nicole Scherzinger, Louis Walsh and Gary Barlow seemed delighted with Lady Gaga’s performance and gave her a standing ovation. Mrs Osbourne – who had witnessed the star strip completely naked at London club G-A-Y the previous evening – gave her a hug and proclaimed: ‘This truly is a goddess’. It is the latest in a long line of provocative performances by pop stars on ITV’s flagship reality shows.In May, the channel was attacked for allowing US star Jennifer Lopez perform in a skimpy thong during a Britain’s Got Talent results show. Outrage: Christina Aguilera courted controversy when she performed on the X Factor in a bra top and skimpy pants, prompting Ofcom to say the routine was 'at the very margin of acceptability' And in 2010, singers Rihanna and Christina Aguilera provoked outrage when they performed on the X Factor in bra tops and skimpy pants. At the time, Ofcom was criticised for saying the performances were ‘at the very margin of acceptability.’ An ITV spokesman defended Lady Gaga’s routine yesterday, saying: ‘We do not believe Lady Gaga’s performance was inappropriate for the family audience of The X Factor Results show, which has an established tradition of featuring performances from the biggest music stars of the moment. Lady Gaga is well known for her highly individual performance style.’","Singer danced provocatively in routine watched by nearly a million children .

"Notoriety: Richardson, pictured in 2007, was thought to have earned millions through his notorious gang's operations but left an estate worth just £21,000 . Infamous London gang leader and rival to the Kray twins Charlie Richardson has died. The 78-year-old – a heavy smoker – had suffered from emphysema for some years but is understood to have died from blood poisoning following a gall bladder complaint. His sister Elaine and some of his children were by his bedside. Richardson was at one time the most feared criminal in the capital. He developed an empire in South London in the 1950s and 1960s which embraced fraud, gambling, protection rackets – and generated terror through torture, claims which he later denied. He was arrested on the day England won the World Cup in 1966. His trial heard he was alleged to have used iron bars, pliers and electrodes on anyone who crossed him. The Camberwell-born crime lord was found guilty of fraud, extortion, assault and grievous bodily harm, and was jailed for 25 years. Together with his brother Eddie, he was as infamous as Ronnie and Reggie Kray and ‘Mad’ Frankie Fraser. Known as the ‘Torture Gang’, their trademark was pinning victims to the floor with six-inch nails and removing their fingers and toes with bolt cutters. The Richardson Gang were also known for torturing enemies at their scrap metal yard by attaching electrodes to their nipples and genitals and delivering electric shocks, having already placed them in baths of water to make the electricity more potent. The gang would frequently carry out mock trials for victims, before administering punishments including whippings, cigarette burning and teeth being pulled out by gang member 'Mad' Frankie Fraser. They were then made to clean up their own blood. The brutal method of trial by kangaroo court and subsequent torture was said to be known as 'taking a shirt from Charlie', as Richardson would often give victims a clean shirt in which to return home afterwards. Crime lords: Charlie Richardson (left) and brother Eddie's trademark was said to be nailing victims to the floor before removing their toes with bolt cutters . Renowned: Charlie Richardson (2nd right) along with brother Eddie (3rd right, holding face) dabbled in torture, protection and drug dealing in the 60s . They also set up bogus firms, acquiring goods on credit and selling the stock before making off with the cash. Born into a war-torn London, Charlie was two years older than his brother Eddie and  six years older than their youngest sibling, Alan. He and Eddie, turned to a life of crime when the departure . of their father left their family penniless. Eddie Richardson last night confirmed his brother died yesterday morning in Pembury Hospital, Kent. He . said: ‘I haven’t spoken to him in years so I am not the best person to . speak to about his death. But he will be missed by his six children. ‘I can’t say he was a good father, but he was a father. He leaves a big family behind him. ‘Members of his family were with him in hospital. I’m sure they will be upset and disappointed, losing a dad is difficult. ‘I lost count of how many grandchildren he had. ‘It came as a surprise to some, but not to me. He had been ill for years and has suffered with breathing problems – emphysema – for a long time due to smoking.' Today it emerged he had refused to get medical treatment for his stomach pain because he was scared of doctors, despite suffering in agony for weeks. His close friend David Fraser, son of Richardson Gang enforcer “Mad” Frankie Fraser, said: “He kept putting off going to the doctors. 'When he finally went, he was admitted to hospital and never came out.' He died in the arms of his wife, Ronnie. Mr Fraser, who spent time in prison with the ex-gang leader, added that his death came as a shock as he had been expecting to meet him for lunch this week. 'He was in pain for a few weeks. Ronnie kept saying: ""You have got to go to the doctor,"" but he was a typical man.' Brothers in arms: Charlie Richardson (left) and Eddie Richardson at the peak of the criminal powers, along with Mrs Charlie Richardson (later Mrs Jean Coulter) Slick: Charlie, pictured left in a 60s TV programme, headed up the Richardson Gang, whose members included 'Mad' Frankie Fraser (right) Rivals: Charlie Richardson was known to be as fearsome in the London crime underworld as Ronnie and Reggie Kray (above) In 2004 his life story was told in a film starring former pop star Luke Goss. Richardson always insisted the torture stories were just a myth and were simply used to help convict his gang. He added: ‘If you can find anyone who says they got nailed to the floor by us or got their toes cut off I will give you £10,000 for each one. 'We were fitted up. I never touched a single toe. I did 18 years for nothing.’ Reborn: Charlie Richardson's life was turned into a 2004 film, with Luke Goss taking the role of the notorious gangster . He escaped from an open prison in 1980 and fled to Fance. During attempts to publicise his requests for freedom, Richardson even dressed as Santa Claus and gave presents to children. He was later re-arrested and returned to jail, before being allowed out again on day release in 1984. Richardson first met the Krays in prison, and a feud developed between the two sets of siblings in 1965. The two pairs had several run-ins over the years and their rivalry nearly spilled over into full-blown war in the late 1960s. The Richardsons, along with 'Mad' Frankie Fraser and George Cornell, were the main rivals of twin brothers Ronald ""Ronnie"" Kray and Reginald ""Reggie"" Kray during the 1950s and '60s. The two rival sets of brothers controlled London, operating through armed robberies, arson, protection rackets, assaults and torture, with the Krays based in East London and the Richardson gang from South London, also entrenched in the West End. Their turf war began after a brawl during a Christmas party at the Astor Club in December 1965. It was here that George Cornell, insulted Ronnie Kray, calling him a ‘fat poof’ after first meeting the Krays while in Shepton Mallet Prison. Shortly after the incident Cornell was seen walking down Whitechapel Road shouting: 'Where's that fat w*****?' referring to Ronnie Kray. Ronnie Kray showed up at the Blind beggar pub where Cornell was drinking, and shot Cornell through the head at close range. In March 1966 a gun battle took place in a club called Mr Smiths in Rushey Green with the Richardson gang going there with the intentions of wiping out the Krays. However there was only one member of the Kray gang present. He was shot dead. Frankie Fraser , a good friend of the Richardsons was shot in the hip and Eddie was shot in the backside. They were taken to hospital and on their release they were charged with affray and sentenced to 5 years in prison. Frankie Fraser was originally charged with the murder of Dickie Hart but was found not guilty. Other notable characters in the Richardson gang included the notorious hit man Jimmy Moody, Roy Hall (who operated the electric generator), Albert Longman, and Tommy Clark. Moody was the main enforcer for the Richardsons, but also did 'freelance work' for the Krays and became one of the most feared criminals to emerge from the London underworld. A further member of the gang, Harry Beard, is known for frequently urinating on a collector of protection money, who was twice warned by the Richardsons after he pocketed the money.Another infamous killing at the time was that of Jack ""The Hat"" McVitie, a minor member of the Kray’s gang, killed by Reggie Kray, in a move that eventually led to their convictions.","Richardson, together with brother Eddie, was one of most feared gangsters in 60s London .

"Jailed: Gary Pattison tried to smuggle the 97% cocaine in amongst 89 boxes of flowers . A florist owner who tried to smuggle cocaine worth £23.5 million into the country in boxes of flowers has been jailed for 18 years. Gary Pattison, 52, hid the drugs in a lorry load of chrysanthemums and was today found guilty at Sheffield Crown Court of importing cocaine. He owned Sharon Pattison's Florists and a haulage company called Sharon Pattison Logistics, and tried to smuggle 84kg of the drug, which was 97% pure, into the country from the Netherlands. Pattison, from Hull, travelled to Rotterdam in his own lorry in February to collect the consignment, and was caught by border officers on his return two days later. The lorry contained 89 boxes of flowers, but three looked different, and when X-rayed officers found they contained kilo blocks of cocaine. Pattison's trial had heard that detectives discovered almost £50,000 of cash at Mr Pattison's home in Woodmansey, Hull, and at some of his businesses following his arrest. However, his fiancee, Lindsey Manson, told the court some of the money belonged to her. The court heard the couple also had thousands of pounds of foreign currency in their safe, including nine 500 euro notes, which are no longer accepted in the UK due to their links to criminals. Ms Manson said she had obtained the large euro notes at a travel agents in 2008 for Mr Pattison to use for purchasing flowers abroad and had not got around to cashing them in. Caught: Officers investigated Pattison's haul after spotting three boxes which looked different to the rest . Haul: Pattison's stash was worth £23.5m, and weighed 84kg . Mr Pattison was stopped in his lorry on February 10 as he returned to Hull from the flower market in Aalsmeer, Holland. The florist previously told Sheffield Crown Court he had loaded 17 trolleys containing hundreds of flowers into his truck, but didn't check the order because he had taken the company on 'trust' that it was correct. The court heard the three boxes containing the drugs were up to six times heavier than the other boxes of flowers and Mr Pattison's fingerprints were on two of the boxes. The florist attempted to smuggle the drugs into the country in the back of this lorry from Holland . Gerry Smyth from the Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca) said: 'Pattison acted as a shipping agent for organised crime groups by arranging for a large quantity of high purity cocaine to be smuggled into the country. 'Anyone who assists criminals in this way is a target for Soca. If you come on to our radar we will pursue you relentlessly, track you down, and put you behind bars. Not only has Pattison lost his freedom, he now faces being stripped of his illicit profits.'","Gary Pattison attempted to smuggle in 84kg of cocaine in lorry .

"The mother of a soldier who committed suicide has bravely decided to allow footage of his lifeless body at a public inquiry into the military's handling of her son's death. Corporal Stuart Langridge's body was found hanging from a chin-up bar in his barracks after the Afghanistan veteran was diagnosed with post traumatic stress disorder. His mother claims the 28-year-old, who was found hanged in at Canadian Forces Base Edmonton, was not properly treated for his condition, having already attempted suicide five times in one year. Tragic: Cpl Stuart Langridge's mother Sheila appears at a public inquiry into the death of her son, right . It has now emerged that after hanging himself on March 15 2008, Cpl Langridge's body was left in place for four hours by investigators while they documented and searched everything in the room. Graphic, disturbing images of Cpl Langridge's body were never released to news media, but have since been played at the public inquiry into his death. The inquiry is set to investigate not only the Defence Department's handling of Cpl Langridge's case, but also how it copes with soldiers suffering from mental illness and post-traumatic stress. Cpl Langridge had previously said he would rather die than return to his unit, having served in tours of Bosnia and Afghanistan. Battle: Cpl Langridge's mother Sheila Fynes (pictured with her son) claims military officials did not do enough to help her son with his condition . Cpl Langridge's mother Sheila, along with her husband Shaun Fynes (left) arrive at the hearing earlier this year with Michael Blais president of Canadian Veterans Advocacy . He attempted suicide six times in 2008 before his eventual death, had been treated in hospital and resorted to alcohol and cocaine. His mother, Sheila Fynes, said decisions made by military medical staff during the last weeks of his life were 'thoughtless, humiliating and destabilizing.' Describing the decision to allow footage of his death at the inquiry, she told the Globe and Mail: 'There are times when I think I’ve shared the most personal thing about Stuart’s life and I hope... I hope it wasn’t for nothing.' The distressing footage zooms in on Cpl Langridge's head and face. Federal lawyers representing the Defence Department said that if the video were to be shown, it would have to be shown completely. Cpl Langridge, who served in Bosnia and Afghanistan, said he would 'rather die' than go back to his unit . Claims: Shaun Fynes and wife Sheila listen to testimony at the public inquiry in Ottawa earlier this year, where they say decisions made by military medical staff during the last weeks of his life were 'thoughtless, humiliating and destabilizing.' Mrs Fynes added: 'At first, we said: ""No, we don’t want anybody ever to see that"". 'But then [after] discussions with our lawyer [and] between ourselves, we decided there would be no better way for the chair to understand our allegation of the total disrespect shown to Stuart in his death, than for him to see it.' 'Was it the right decision? It keeps me awake at night.' After Cpl Langridge's death, further blunders by the Defence Department added to the grief his family were going through. The military took a year and two months to deliver Langridge's suicide note to his devastated parents. Cpl Langridge's family have accused members of the National Investigative Service of conducting a biased investigation intent on absolving high-ranking members of the Canadian Forces of blame.","Cpl Stuart Langridge hanged himself in March 2008 .

"Key roles: Harriet Harman and husband Jack Dromey. They were leading officials in the NCCL, which was linked to predatory pedophile group PIE . The full extent of the shocking links between three senior Labour figures and a vile group that tried to legalise sex with children can be exposed today. The trio held key roles in a human rights organisation that supported the notorious Paedophile Information Exchange. Labour’s deputy leader Harriet Harman, her husband, home affairs spokesman Jack Dromey, and former health secretary Patricia Hewitt were all leading officials in the National Council for Civil Liberties. Astonishingly this Left-wing group granted ‘affiliate’ status to PIE and built close links with it. The group of predatory paedophiles was calling for the age of consent to be cut to just four. Police are now investigating PIE as part of Operation Fernbridge, launched in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal. A senior source on the investigation says there is evidence PIE members were abusing children ‘on an industrial scale’. The Home Office is also probing shocking claims that the Labour government of the 1970s may have helped finance the paedophile group. Civil servants are trawling through decades of files after an ‘insider’ claimed tens of thousands of pounds were funnelled to PIE in the form of annual grants to the network of child abusers while James Callaghan was in Downing Street. A Daily Mail investigation has discovered that during the 1970s and 1980s: . * Miss Hewitt described PIE in glowing terms as ‘a campaigning/counselling group for adults attracted to children’; . * The NCCL lobbied Parliament for the age of sexual consent to be cut to ten – if the child consented and ‘understood the nature of the act’. * It called for incest to be legalised in what one MP dubbed a ‘Lolita’s charter’; . * The NCCL claimed research shows young paedophile victims are often ‘consenting or even the initiators of the sexual acts involved’; . * It filed a submission to Parliament claiming that ‘childhood sexual experiences,   willingly engaged in, with an adult, result in no identifiable damage’. *  Miss Harman, as NCCL legal officer, tried to water down child pornography laws. *  NCCL lawyers acted for a PIE member who was quizzed by police over appalling behaviour. The Mail has repeatedly sent detailed questions to Miss Harman, Miss Hewitt and Mr Dromey about their links to PIE and whether they now regret supporting such a vile group. Neither Miss Hewitt nor Mr Dromey replied. A spokesman for Miss Harman said: ‘This story is untrue and ridiculous.’ Leading figure: Former Health Secretary Patricia Hewitt. She was general secretary of the NCCL from 1974-1983 . In December, when the Mail first drew attention to the links between the NCCL and PIE, a public apology was issued by Shami Chakrabarti of Liberty, which is the name the NCCL now goes under. Miss Chakrabarti, who was born in 1969 and had nothing to do with the sordid affair, said: ‘It is a source of continuing disgust and horror that even the NCCL had to expel paedophiles from its ranks in 1983 after infiltration at some point in the Seventies. ‘The most important lesson learned by Liberty over the subsequent 30 years was to become a well-governed modern human rights movement in which protecting the vulnerable, especially children, will always come first.’ The NCCL was part of the radical Left lobbying for a change in the law to reflect a more ‘enlightened’ attitude to sex between adults and minors and promote the ‘human rights’ of paedophiles. Harriet Harman, former legal officer at the National Council for Civil Liberties . Miss Hewitt was general secretary of the NCCL from 1974-83. Miss Harman was a newly-qualified solicitor when she became the NCCL’s legal officer in 1978 until 1982, when she entered Parliament. Mr Dromey sat on the NCCL executive committee for almost a decade, from 1970 to 1979. The extraordinary links between PIE and the NCCL emerge in archives of internal NCCL documents held at the University of Hull and the London School of Economics. PIE’s campaigning in the 1970s caused public outrage. The group’s members did not present themselves as child abusers but as ‘child lovers’ keen to ‘liberate’ children from sexual ‘repression’. In 1978, Miss Harman wrote a briefing paper on the Protection of Children Bill, which sought to ban child pornography. She claimed such a law would ‘increase censorship’ and argued that a pornographic picture of a naked child should not be considered indecent unless it could be proven that the subject had suffered. In 1976, the NCCL filed a submission to a parliamentary committee claiming a proposed bill to protect children from sex abusers would ‘lead to damaging and absurd prosecutions’. ‘Childhood sexual experiences, willingly engaged in , with an adult result in no identifiable damage,’ it read. ‘The real need is a change in the attitude which assumes that all cases of paedophilia result in lasting damage.’ In 1982, Miss Hewitt published ‘The Police and Civil Liberties’, in which she discussed the jailing of PIE secretary Tom O’Carroll for conspiracy to corrupt public morals. She wrote: ‘Conspiring to corrupt public morals is an offence incapable of definition or precise proof.’ After the Daily Mail highlighted the connection between the NCCL and PIE in December, a spokesman for Miss Harman said: ‘The very suggestion that Harriet was in any way supportive of the PIE or its aims is untrue and misleading.’ The Metropolitan Police began Operation Fernbridge in January 2013 into allegations that residents of a children's home in Richmond, West London, were taken to the nearby Elm Guest House in Barnes, where they were abused.","Harriet Harman, Jack Dromey and Patricia Hewitt linked to vile group .

"Exotic animals can make popular pets but a cat with a touch of the supernatural will stand out in among the neighbours’ moggies. A new breed of cat that looks like a werewolf and behaves like a dog has been developed by U.S. breeders . The Lykoi gets its spooky looks because of a genetic mutation in a domestic shorthair cat, which prevents the curious creature from growing a full coat of fur, making it looks like a werewolf. Scroll down for video... Spooky: Breeders have developed this new breed of cat that looks like a werewolf and behaves like a dog . This pet is for life and not just Halloween: The Lykoi's supernatural appearance will make it very popular . Just like supernatural werewolf characters, the cats have a 'strong prey drive'  that 'causes them to stalk and pounce on everything they consider to be prey'. The werewolf character from the 1981 film, Werewolf in London, is pictured . The Lykoi gets its spooky looks because of a genetic mutation in a domestic shorthair cat, which prevents the curious creature from growing a full coat of fur. Its name comes from the Greek for wolf and translates as ‘wolf cat. The animal has no hair around its eyes, nose, ears and muzzle as well as a consistently patchy coat on the rest of its body. It behaves like a dog as it hunts for prey and toys and is also friendly and loyal to owners. Due to incomplete hair follicles, the cat has a patchy coat, moults and can go completely bald some of the time. A total of 14 litters of kittens not from the original litter have been reported and there are just seven breeders registered in the world. Its name comes from the Greek for 'wolf' and translates as ‘wolf cat’ as the animal has no hair around its eyes, . nose, ears and muzzle as well as a consistently patchy coat on the rest . of its body. Curiously Lykois are said to have a ‘hound dog personality’. ‘They like to hunt around the house for whatever they can find. 'They show caution to strangers, but warm up quickly and become very friendly,’according to the breed’s website. Perhaps in parallel to supernatural werewolf characters, the cats have a ‘strong prey drive’ that ‘causes them to stalk and pounce on everything they consider to be prey.’ However, unlike a werewolf, whose . personality chances at full moon, Lykois are said to be friendly and . playful as well as loyal to their owners. The Lykoi (pictured left and right) gets its spooky looks because . of a genetic mutation in a domestic shorthair cat, which prevents the . curious creature from growing a full coat of fur, making it looks like a . werewolf . The Lykoi's name comes from the Greek for wolf and translates as 'wolf cat' as the animal has no hair around its eyes, nose, ears and muzzle as well as a patchy coat on the rest of its body (pictured) The first official Lykois came about as the result of a natural mutation of the shorthair cat. ‘The gene is a natural mutation that appeared in the domestic cat population,’ said Breeder Johnny Gobble. ‘There was no human intervention to create the cat.  We are simply using the genetics of natural processes,’ he added. There were three ‘foundation breeders’ – Mr Gobble, his wife Brittney Gobble and Patti Thomas, who located the first two kittens, while it was Mr Gobble used cats from two groups of kittens to breed the first Lykoi kittens. They found that the cats were not a Sphynx (a breed of hairless cat) that had retained some of its fur and this was confirmed by DNA testing that did not find the Sphynx gene. In fact, researchers found that a new breed had been created, but they wanted to make sure the kittens were completely healthy before breeding them. Tests were run to rule out genetic illnesses and dermatologists at the University of Tennessee examined the animals for skin abnormalities . Researchers wanted to make sure the kittens were completely healthy before breeding them . Looking out for the full moon? Unlike a werewolf, whose personality chances suddenly, Lykois are said to be friendly and playful as well as loyal to their owners . Tests were run to rule out genetic illnesses and dermatologists at the University of Tennessee examined the animals for skin abnormalities. While none were found, the scientists were stumped at first as to what had caused the strange coat. They then found that some of the animals' hair follicles lacked all the components needed to create hair and that follicles that did have an undercoat were imbalanced so the hair could not be maintained. Consequently the cats moult and can go completely bald some of the time – not just on a full moon. The first official Lykois (like the one pictured) arose from a natural mutation in black domestic shorthair cats . It is hoped that the felines will be categorised as a 'preliminary new breed' by the The International Cat Association (TICA) this coming Autumn when they will be able to be shown at cat shows. A total of 14 litters of kittens not from the original litter have been reported and there are just seven Lykoi breeders registered in the world, making the kittens hot property. Mr Gobble said that breeders get requests for the unusual kittens daily and he gets asked about the breed at least ten times a day. ‘We are doing our very best to monitor breeding cats to ensure that the Lykoi cat will be a new breed that has wonderful health, great personality, and the Lykoi (werecat) look,’ he said.

"Russia's prime minister promised to pour funds into Crimea during a surprise visit to the annexed peninsula today as the government looks to tighten their grip on the region. Dimitry Medvedev pledged to give funds to improve power supplies, water lines and education while residents captured trains loaded with Russian military equipment travelling towards the capital Simferopol. Leading a delegation of Cabinet ministers on a surprise visit, Medvedev also said he would quickly boost salaries and pensions. Despite the show of political strength, Russian troops were pulled back from the border with Ukraine amid signs the Kremlin is being stung by Western sanctions. Salute: Russia's Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev watches Russian troops marching as he takes part in a wreath laying ceremony at a World War Two Memorial . Show of strength: Medvedev (front) visits the 13th Ship-Repairing Yard of the Black Sea Fleet of the Russian Defense Ministry in Sevastopol . But Moscow has also made it clear they will not be handing back Crimea to defuse the worst crisis in East-West relations since the Cold War. Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin also tweeted a photo of himself upon his arrival in the region with the words 'Crimea is ours, and that's that'. Medvedev said Russia will create a special economic zone in Crimea - a peninsula of two million people - that will create incentives for business with lower taxes and simpler rules. Russia will also seek to develop the region as a top tourist destination and will try to ensure that plane tickets to Crimea are cheap enough to encourage more Russians to visit. He said: 'We must create a new investment history for Crimea, which will be more successful than what it has been.' Paying respects: Leading a delegation of cabinet members to the region, he lay a wreath at the city memorial for the defenders of Sevasatpol . Military equipment: T-72 tanks are unloaded from railway platforms at a railway station in Gvardeyskoe village near Simferopol . Power: Soliders unloaded the armoured vehicles which will be stationed in the region, strengthening Russia's military presence . According to defence news website Intercepts, footage also emerged showing equipment on its way to Krasnodar Krai, a Russian . peninsula between the Black Sea and Temyuk Bay, before it is loaded on . to barges on their way to Port Krym in eastern Crimea. The . United States says progress on resolving the East-West stand-off over . Ukraine depends on Russia pulling back troops massed on the border. Following today's announcement by Russia, it was not clear whether other . troops would pull back or had already withdrawn. The . Defence Ministry said it was pulling forces out of the Rostov region . near Russia's border with Ukraine after month-long military exercises. Residents in Crimea have captured on video Russia's military progression into the area . Videos have been posted online showing trains loaded with Russian equipment travelling west towards the Crimean capital Simferopol . The videos appear to show tanks, vehicles and other militay equipment as they are transported on flatbed freight trains . 'The battalion ... has completed its field exercises at the Kadamovsky training grounds in the Rostov region and is beginning its march to its permanent base in the Samara region,' the ministry was quoted as saying. A battalion numbers between 300 and 1,200 troops. Russia says the build-up near the border is part of military exercises and there are no plans to move forces across the border into Ukraine, but the United States and NATO have voiced alarm over Moscow's intentions following its annexation of Crimea . A special government ministry has been created to oversee Crimea's development. It was estimated that as many as 100,000 soldiers forward, but the figure has been reduced to 10,000. According to defence news website Intercepts, the equipment appears to be on its way to Krasnodar Krai, a Russian peninsula between the Black Sea and Temyuk Bay, before being loaded on to barges on their way to Port Krym in eastern Crimea . Russia's prime minister promised to pour funds into the newly annexed peninsula during a surprise visit to Crimea today . Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in . March after a hastily called referendum held just two weeks after . Russian forces had overtaken the Black Sea region. Ukraine and the West . have rejected the vote. 'People . in Crimea mustn't lose anything after joining Russia, they must only . make gains,' Medvedev added. 'People expect us to create conditions for . calm and respectable life, confidence in tomorrow, the feeling of being . part of a strong country. We must meet these expectations.' Medvedev emphasized the need to ensure a . stable power supply. Crimea currently gets about 80 percent of its . electricity and a similar share of its water from Ukraine, and power . cutoffs last week raised fears that the Ukrainian government could use . energy as a weapon to bargain with Russia. Medvedev said Russia already has made sure that Crimea has enough backup power capacity to ensure an uninterrupted electricity supply. He added that Russia will work on long-term solutions to Crimea's energy problem that could involve linking the region to Russia's power grid or developing local power generation. He said efforts will also be made to quickly repair water supply infrastructure to reduce loss of water. In the future, Crimea could get water supplies from Russia or create its own water reservoirs. Russia's defense minister, meanwhile, announced Monday that all Crimean men of conscription age will get a deferral from the draft for one year. Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, second left, speaks to school-children while visiting Crimea in Simferopol, Crimea, today . In Moscow, the lower house of parliament voted unanimously Monday to annul agreements with Ukraine on Russia's navy base in Crimea. In 2010, Ukraine allowed Russia to extend the lease of the fleet's base until 2042 on an annual rent of $98 million and price discounts for Russian natural gas supplies. Medvedev has said that Russia had given Ukraine $11 billion in gas discounts in advance and should claim the money back once the lease deal is repealed. If Moscow makes the move, it would further raise pressure on the cash-strapped Ukrainian government that now depends on Western loans to avoid bankruptcy. The United States and the European Union have slapped travel bans and asset freezes on members of Russian President Vladimir Putin's inner circle for the annexation and warned that Russia will face even more painful sanctions if it tries to invade eastern Ukraine. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, left, shakes hands with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov before the start of their meeting at the Russian Ambassador's residence about the situation in Ukraine, in Paris on Sunday . Ukraine and the West have also voiced concerns that the buildup of Russian troops near the border with Ukraine raises the threat of an invasion. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry raised the issue during his talks in Paris with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Sunday. The talks dragged on for four hours but did not produce any visible breakthroughs. Russia has pushed for Ukraine to become a . federation where regions would have broad powers - a clear attempt to . preserve its leverage there by relying on Russian-speaking regions in . the east and south. The U.S. says it's up to the Ukrainians to determine . the structure of their government and Ukraine's new government has . rejected Moscow's push for federalization. Pro-Russian activists stand atop an old tank outside a museum in Donetsk on Sunday . But in a sign that Russian-U.S. talks could be inching toward a compromise, a senior Russian diplomat changed his tone Monday while speaking about Ukraine's presidential election on May 25, which the West has urged Moscow to recognize. Deputy Foreign Minister Grigory Karasin said in remarks carried by Russian news agencies that the Ukrainian vote should be fair and transparent. While Karasin reaffirmed that constitutional reform in Ukraine should remain the top priority, his statement seemed to indicate a softening of Russia's previous stance that the presidential vote was premature and needed to be pushed back to the fall. Karasin refused to say if Moscow would recognize the outcome of the vote.","Residents film freight trains carrying military equipment into Crimea .

"The London 2012 Paralympics is set to be a sell-out  - but people should still expect to see some gaps in seating, officials said today. Organisers revealed that around 2.3m tickets have been sold, 200,000 short of their target. But chief executive Paul Deighton said they expect to hit their ticket goal, with half the remaining seats on sale before Games-time. The organisers are 'delighted' with the interest in the Paralympics. Paralympic organisers will be hoping to avoid a repeat of some Olympic days where there were swathes of empty seats . Not sold out: Many empty seats were spotted at Olympic swimming events, but officials say they are 200,000 tickets away from a complete sell-out . London 2012 chairman Lord Coe predicted that many people watching these events for the first-time will be 'blown away'. Many of the day pass tickets have been created to allow people to take in different sports as many of them will be new spectators of Paralympic events. Mr Deighton said: 'If you take the venues like Goalball where effectively you have got a mixture of people in that venue and about a quarter of seats will be general admission for people who want to watch that sport - then there will be about three-quarter of the seats that will be for people who are rotating through on a day pass. Paul Deighton, chief executive of LOCOG, said organisers were on course for a sold-out Paralympics . 'The whole point is to give people a chance to sample different sports so you will see a churn through the biggest chunk of most of those venues. You will see some empty seats there as people move through them and try different sports. ' Figuring out the availability of tickets, which is affected by issues such as seating and camera positions, organisers 'really are down to the last two or three per cent of tickets in each venue,' according to Mr Deighton. He said: 'We really only want to make sure that we only sell a ticket where a seat actually exists and you have a good view.' The take-up and resale of some tickets which go to the athletes’ friends and families depends on who qualifies for the later rounds of the competitions. Members of the public should expect to see some empty accredited seats at the Paralympics, an issue that frustrated many spectators who could not get a ticket for the Olympics. He said: 'There are fewer accredited seats at the Paralympic Games than there were for the Olympics but it is still the same basic situation where we set aside banks of seats for athletes to watch their fellow athletes, for broadcasters, written press, officials and representatives from the sports federations. 'To the extent our experience of how they churn through those seats tells us that if it is possible to sell some more we will put those on the market just as we did at the Olympic Games.' He imagines it will 'probably be slightly fewer' tickets available than came up during the Olympics as the organisers now have more experience of managing the seating arrangements. David Cameron, Boris Johnson and Lord Coe look . on as Claire Lomas, who became the first person to complete a marathon . in a bionic suit, lights the Paralympic cauldron in Trafalgar Square . this morning . Changes: The Olympic Stadium in Stratford has undergone a Paralympic makeover ahead of the Games . Ready for the next show: The giant Olympic rings . in cities across the UK have started coming down and many are being . replaced with the 'agitos' He said: 'Our very detailed understanding of where you have a restricted view or haven’t and where you can move the barriers between accredited and non-accredited areas is really very well refined now. 'I think the way we can manage the bowl at the Paralympics is much more rifle shot because of the experience we had at the Olympics.' The ticket sales budget for the Paralympics is more than £25 million in comparison to the Olympic Games of half a billion.","2.3m tickets sold for Games, 200,000 short of overall target .

"Max Verstappen, the 17-year-old prodigy, pulled out of the garage and turned into the pages of Formula One history. To bright sunshine here in Suzuka, he become the youngest driver to take part in a grand prix weekend. He immediately looked at ease in the Toro Rosso on the most demanding of all F1 tracks, providing evidence that he is a special talent. However, whether he will live up to his boss Helmut Marko’s lofty claim that his ability is reminiscent of Ayrton Senna remains to be seen.

I am very proud.’ Verstappen Jnr batted any questions about his age being a factor moving forward. 'I'm not focused on the age, it doesn't matter to me,' he said. 'I think at the end, age doesn't make any difference - if you are ready for it and you have prepared well, age is just a number. 'Sebastian (Vettel) started when he was 19 and look at him now, some people can make it and some cannot.' Verstappen, went on to suggest people could race in the sport as young as 14 - but is not looking at early comparisons between himself and four-time world champion Vettel.

'I can't complain really, I enjoyed it a lot and that was the main thing today - just to get experience and make a lot of laps,' he added. 'I think in general it was more about learning the car, there is quite some difference compared to the 2012 car so I just build it up lap-by-lap and by the end you get used to it. It is always good to drive an F1 car.' Toro Rosso team principal Franz Tost has confirmed Verstappen will compete in free practice at all of the remaining races, with the exception of the Russian Grand Prix next weekend.

'We all know that this race track is quite difficult to learn so we gave him the opportunity to go out. He is doing a good job. 'We have changed it so he has a little less front downforce and I hope that he can do as many laps as possible.

"A woman was savagely knifed in a machete attack which left both her hands severed before he stabbed her in the head with the 18-inch blade. Battling Maria Del Carmen Gomez was attacked by an ex-boyfriend who slashed both her hands almost clean off before stabbing her in the head with an 18-inch blade. The 53-year-old, who underwent life-saving surgery as medics frantically rushed to reattach her hands, made a remarkable recovery from the brutal attack. But now she has been given the crushing news that she also has cancer. Recovery: Ms Gomez, later diagnosed with metastatic uterine cancer, shows the extent of her hand injuries after her machete attack earlier this year . Battling: Gomez, right, underwent chemotherapy and extensive surgery for the cancer treatment alone, months after the attack which saw her knifed in the head and arms . Horrific: Surgeons carried out a painstaking five-hour operation on Gomez's hands after she was slashed outside a convenience store in Vegas five months ago . Mrs Gomez, who still has heavy bandaging on her hands and scars on her head, was recently told she has metastatic uterine cancer. She endured a five-hour surgical procedure to remove her uterus and ovaries as experts cut out the cancer from her colon, diaphragm and lymph nodes. Medics found that the machete victim had a malignant disease at an 'advanced stage' but was curable. They plan to give her chemotherapy treatment and are hopeful she will recover. Her new ordeal comes just months after she was horrifically knifed outside a convenience store in Las Vegas, Nevada, on March 21. Accused: Gomez's ex-boyfriend, Armando Vergara-Martinez, 49, has since been charged with attempted murder and domestic violence . Her attacker was said to be Gomez's ex-boyfriend, Armando Vergara-Martinez, who stabbed her before slashing his own neck. Martinez, 49, was saved my medics, but faces trial in October on charges including attempted murder and domestic violence. Doctors said that Gomez could have been decapitated if her attacker had aimed a couple of inches lower. Medics also praised her remarkable . resilience in battling through the machete attack recovery and now . refusing to be beaten by cancer. Dr. Nick Spirtos, the gynecologist who headed the cancer surgical team, . told the Las Vegas Review Journal: 'If anybody can make it, she can. She . was remarkably positive going into surgery. 'She . showed me the scars on her head and her hands from the machete and . said, 'This cancer isn't going to get me either.' She has an incredible . spirit.' Medical staff who . reattached Gomez's hands after the machete attack believe she was . covering her head with them when she was knifed. Dr. Albert Capanna, a neurologist who helped carry out the painstaking . operation, said: 'If he had come down another inch with his blows, he . would have cut her head right off.' Speaking a month after the attack, Gomez told how she lost consciousness after being stabbed in the head. She told CBS earlier this year: 'I tried to open my car. He started hitting me without saying [anything]. 'He stabbed me two, three times on my head. I felt such strong hits over there. 'He cut these three fingers and left it on the floor.' Brutal: Gomez was also savagely knifed in the back of the head during the frenzied attack earlier this year . Savage: Surgeons managed to reattach Gomez's hands in an operation, after the attack severed both at the wrist . She has since said she has no idea why she was attacked. Two years ago she had already reported Martinez to police for attacking her. He spent 41 days in jail no a misdemeanour strangulation charge. Gomez added: 'I never went back to him, but I did speak to him on the phone. 'And then one day he said he needed help getting recommendations for a job.

"With her rosy cheeks, bronzed skin, gorgeous defined brows and expertly applied eye make-up, the Duchess of Cambridge never fails to look flawless. And despite a legion of 'copy-Kates' best efforts to discover what gives her that famous glow, the Duchess of Cambridge’s beauty essentials have been kept under wraps. Until now.

Kate, 32, is said to be keeping her skin in tip-top condition on her tour of Australia and New Zealand with the help of her favourite Lancome Hydra Zen face cream and Advanced Genifique serum. The new mother was reportedly sent the products, which she is said to have been a firm fan of for years, in mid-March. The £39.50 face cream claims to moisturise and soothe skin for long-lasting hydration, perfect for those long, sunny days on tour and for getting over the drying effects of a long-haul flight. Enriched with naturally-derived plant extracts, it promises to relieve skin from environmental skin aggravation and, if used every morning, it will apparently help create a radiant, glowing complexion.

"In artistic terms they were at polar opposites of the photographic spectrum. The wanton destruction and grim resilience of war is not a subject you would associate with high fashion glamour shots of the rich and beautiful. But when flamboyant photographer Cecil Beaton was enlisted during the Second World War, his striking collection showed the six-year conflict in a new, more graceful, picturesque light. Relaxed: A soldier orders a cup of tea in the Forces Canteen at . Victoria Station in 1942. The soldier pictured was the butler of a close . friend of photographer Cecil Beaton . As well as glamorous portraits of British soldiers, Beaton's portfolio . also catalogues famous landmarks, such as a war-ravaged Bloomsbury . Square in London . War effort: A female welder works on the deck of a new ship in Tyneside in 1943, in another expertly-composed Beaton photograph from the 7,000-strong collection . Dressed to impress: Smartly-dressed Flight Lieutenant David Donaldson poses for a portrait. Right, a wren serving with the crew of a harbour launch in Portsmouth, 1941 . The photographer, whose most notable subjects included Elizabeth Taylor, Marilyn Monroe and Audrey Hepburn, was commissioned for an altogether grittier photographic project that could be used as propaganda. Moving him away from his usual fare of royalty and fashion models, the Ministry of Information asked Beaton to document Britain's war effort. The renowned photographer pictured young men and women in a typically glamorous light, in spite of the ravages, destruction and chaos engulfing Britain in 1940. Battered: A wider image from Beaton's collection shows bomb damage to the Church of St. Anne and St. Agnes in London in 1940 . Make do and mend: A sailor on board HMS Alcantara uses a portable sewing machine to repair a signal flag on a voyage to Sierra Leone, while a British sailor on shore leave in Harrogate looks natural in front of the camera in 1941 . Photogenic: Although also cataloguing damage to buildings, . Beaton also captured images like this one of Wren officers at . the Royal Naval College in Greenwich in 1941 . Villagers cross duckboards over floating bamboo poles in Kwangsi, China in 1944. The poles were soaked in fresh water to prepare them for construction use . War heroes: Squadron Leader M L Robinson of No 609 Squadron RAF sits on the wing of his Hawker Hurricane at RAF Biggin Hill in 1941 for a relaxed portrait picture . Blitz spirit: A workman uses a wheelbarrow to clear debris from the floor of St Mary-le-Bow church . after its first bombing. It was completed destroyed in 1942. His eye-catching portfolio stays away from corpses, blood and the unimaginable horror of the front line, featuring instead photogenic soldiers presenting a united front for the Allied Forces. Even so, Beaton does tug on the heartstrings in his collection: one of the most memorable images shows wounded three-year-old Eileen Dunne at Great Ormond Street Hospital, in an evocative picture which would later grace the cover of Life magazine in September 1940. The picture was clearly effective - as it was taken with the aim of generating sympathy for the British and helping sway America into intervening in the war. Iconic: Renowned photographer Cecil Beaton, who died in January 1980 . Throughout a distinguished career, Cecil Beaton achieved worldwide fame as a photographer, designer, writer, cartoonist, diarist and socialite. The Hampstead-born photographer is widely remembered as the leading British portrait and fashion photographer of his day. During his career he photographed Queen Elizabeth and the Queen Mother, who he described as his favourite royal sitter. He was also employed as staff photographer for Vanity Fair and Vogue, and went on photograph Audrey Hepburn, Marilyn Monroe and Elizabeth Taylor. As a commissioned war photographer, it was Beaton's image of a young girl in Great Ormond Street Hospital which arguably persuaded America to join the global conflict. Before the image was published on the cover of Life magazine in 1940, America was yet to participate in the Second World War. But the evocative image saw the U.S. public put further pressure on their government to assist Britain. After the Second World War he turned to Broadway, working as a set, lighting and costume designer. His creative flair saw Beaton win Academy Awards for costume design on films Gigi (1958) and My Fair Lady (1964). He also designed the period costumes for the 1970 film On a Clear Day You Can See Forever. By the end of the 1970s his health had deteriorated, and he died at his Wiltshire home in January 1980, aged 76. Elsewhere he features soldiers . relaxing after a Libyan desert patrol and a sailor repairing a signal . flag on the way to Sierra Leone. Beaton . took a staggering 7,000 pictures in all during the project, which were . passed through the ministry's Censorship Division before being published . in books and magazines. But . after being catalogued without using his name, the raft of images . became lost in archives until they were recently re-discovered. A collection of more than 100 pictures . are now on display at London's Imperial War Museum, in an exhibition . titled 'Cecil Beaton: Theatre of War'. Hilary Roberts, head curator of the museum's photographic archive, found over 100 unknown pictures while examining files. Well traveled: Wren stewards at the Royal Naval College, Greenwich form this picture in Beaton's portfolio, along with a war image from Cairo, Egypt, in 1942 (right) Global effort: Three men of the Long Range Desert Group enjoy a moment's . relaxation with cigarettes after returning to headquarters in, Siwa, Libya, in 1942 . She . recognised them as being similar in style to the work of Beaton, and . confirmed they were his work by matching them to his diary records. She said: 'The Ministry was in disarray in those days and the records weren't kept well. 'It was not practice to record the name of the photographer. But we always knew these images existed somewhere.' After ceasing wartime operations, the . Ministry of Information deposited Beaton's war photos with the Imperial . War Museum, London. The photographer was briefly reunited with his vast body of work shortly before his death.

All hands to the pump: A fireman dampens down flames in a bombed building during the Blitz in London in 1940. Four years later, Beaton photographed the Chinese Police force grouped in a circular doorway at headquarters in Chengtu . Digging in: A woman made homeless by the Blitz receives a hit meal at a welfare centre in Bermondsey, London, in 1940 . Describing the experience, he wrote . in his diary: 'Yesterday I went to the Imperial War Museum, not my . favourite place, to see the collection of photographs that I had taken . during the war for the Ministry of Information. 'It was an extraordinary experience . to relive those war years; so much of it had been forgotten, and most of . the people are now dead. 'It was fascinating to see the scenes . in old Imperial Simla, the rickshaws drawn by uniformed servants, the . grandeur of the houses, the palaces, the bar scenes, the men on leave . swigging beer, I had not realised that I had taken so many documentary . pictures, some of purely technical interest. 'Looking at them today, I spotted . ideas that are now ‘accepted’, but which, thirty years ago, were before . their time. The sheer amount of work I had done confounded me.'

"Hostile: Bar owner Gareth Sale arrives at court accused of turning an air rifle on his customers . An English pub landlord pulled a gun on customers after they tried to order drinks in Welsh, a court heard. Gareth Sale became involved in a heated row with drinkers days after taking over the Royal Oak pub in Penrhyndeudraeth, Gwynedd. The 26-year-old landlord allegedly . produced an air rifle after taking exception at locals trying to order . drinks in their native language. Mr . Sale, along with his partner who were new to the area and didn't speak . Welsh, asked their customers to order drinks in English. But . when customers ordered in Welsh, Mr Sale ejected a group from the pub while brandishing an air rifle loaded with a gas canister, a jury were . told. The young landlord is said to have remarked after producing the gun: 'I just want to f****** scare them.' Sion ap Mihangel, prosecuting, told . the court: 'The defendant denies the charge. His case is as they were . new to the area and didn't speak Welsh they asked their customers to . order their drinks in English. 'Some of their drinkers had taken offence and became aggressive. A crowd had gathered outside and he feared for his safety.' Caernarfon . Crown Court heard that the landlady had become involved in a heated . discussion with locals about ordering in Welsh as she 'could not . understand it'. She is said to have remarked: 'Welcome to f****** Wales. What a lovely reception you are giving us.' Sale disputed that the weapon came out . of its case and would have been seen out of it or that he said he . intended to frighten anyone. Customers . were told to leave and the doors were locked. But there was banging on . doors and windows. Sale was told by a man that he couldn't throw people . out for ordering in Welsh. Row: Gareth Sale became involved in a heated argument with customers at the Royal Oak after they ordered drinks in Welsh . But he allegedly replied that he had a Japanese Akita dog and guns and people should know this. The prosecution claim he fetched the rifle. Mr . ap Mihangel said police went to the public house that night and spoke . to the defendant and his partner, who had been drinking. A jury at Caerarfon Crown Court heard the pair had taken over the Royal Oak pub, but objected to customers ordering drinks in their native language . The prosecutor added : 'There is no issue that night there had been a disagreement at the bar regarding the use of the Welsh language. That is what triggered this incident.' Sale told police he had been drinking vodka and Coke, and his partner had significantly more alcohol and was argumentative with locals. Sale, of Dunston, Gateshead, denies possessing a firearm with intent to cause fear of violence on June 18 last year. He said he feared for his safety and accepted his actions were 'foolish.'

You made my day a delight.' Rudenstein replied; 'Well, that's good.' The hearing was held to discuss the defense's motion to have the trial aborted as one of the prosecution's key witnesses has stated she will not travel from London to Philadelphia to testify. Theresa Gyamfi was present on February 11, 2011, when Claudia Aderotimi allegedly received a silicone injection in her buttocks from Windslowe. Windslowe is also charged with practicing medicine without a license and aggravated assault for an injection she gave another exotic dancer . Claudia Aderotimi (above) died in February 2011 after receiving a silicone injection in her buttocks . Though she had no medical training, Windslowe (above) would charge $1,000 to $1,800 per injection .

A coroner has testified that the industrial-grade silicone spread to her lungs and brain and caused a pulmonary embolism. The judge ruled that Gyamfi's testimony from a 2012 preliminary hearing could be read to the jury.

Police in Tbilisi guarded several dozen gay activists and bused them out of the city center shortly after they arrived at the gathering.

A number of protesters carrying bunches of stinging nettles threatened to use them on gay activists. They insist that homosexuality runs against Georgia's traditional Orthodox Christian values.

"Annie Lennox does not seem to be a big fan of today's young pop stars. The legendary Scottish singer, who found fame as one half of the internationally acclaimed group the Eurythmics alongside Dave Stewart, was asked in a recent interview to further explain comments she made earlier this year that Beyonce was not a 'feminist,' but rather a 'feminist lite.' And Lennox did not hold back. Scroll down for video . Round two: Annie Lennox (performing above with Dave Stewart as the Eurythmics) has again spoken about her belief that Beyonce is not really a feminist in a recent interview . Putting it bluntly: Lennox (seen at the Grammys in 1995 on left and the 2004 Oscars on right) told NPR that 'twerking is not feminism' 'Listen, twerking is not feminism,' said the 59-year-old artist. 'It's not - it's not liberating, it's not empowering. It's a sexual thing that you're doing on a stage; it doesn't empower you. That's my feeling about it.' In addition to Beyonce, twerking has been a big part of musical artists like Rihanna and Miley Cyrus' recent stage and music video performances. In the interview, with NPR's Steve Inskeep, the singer also broke down just what her problem is with pop music these days. 'The reason why I've commented is because I think that this overt sexuality thrust -- literally -- at particular audiences, when very often performers have a very, very young audience, like 7 years older, I find it disturbing and I think its exploitative. It's troubling. I'm coming from a perspective of a woman that's had children,' she explained. Sorry girls: In addition to Beyonce (left) another famed twerker is singer Rihanna (right) Queen: Of course, the biggest twerker of all is Miley Cyrus (seen above performing with Robin Thicke at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards) This whole debate began when Lennox was asked what she thought about the 33-year-old labeling herself a feminist while on stage at the MTV Video Music Awards back in August. 'I just love her performances - but I'd like to sit down [with her]. I think I'd like to sit down with quite a few artists and talk to them. I'd like to listen to them; I'd like to hear what they truly think,' Lennox said at the time to Pride Source. Lennox also seems to be well aware of how polarizing her opinion on the subject is, telling Inskeep at the end of their interview, 'Maybe this is a good thing because it creates debate.' The singer was on the program to promote her new album, Nostalgia.","Annie Lennox has responded to recent comments she made about Beyonce, saying that the singer was not a 'feminist' but rather 'feminist lite'

"Brave: Little Dominick Andujar was said to have tried to save his sister from the rapist when he was stabbed . A six-year-old boy who was killed by an intruder high on marijuana had been trying to save his sister from the attacker, a court heard yesterday. Dominick Andujar was allegedly stabbed to death by Osvaldo Rivera, 31, who was also accused of slashing the throat of the boy's 12-year-old sister. Rivera allegedly slashed the throat of the girl, who has also made an allegation of rape against him following the attack at their home in Camden, New Jersey, on Sunday night. The girl, whose condition in hospital . has been upgraded from critical to stable, suffered a slashed windpipe. Rivera, . who admitted in court to having smoked a 'wet' combination of marijuana . and PCP before the killing, has yet to be charged with sexual assault. The alleged attack wept in court during an appearance on Tuesday, where bail was set at $5m. During . an interrogation, Rivera had asked: 'How bad did I hurt them?' assistant prosecutor Christine Shah said during the hearing. Authorities have since interviewed . the girl following the attack, which happened at . around 2.30am on Sunday morning. Accused: Osvaldo Rivera, who wept in court on Tuesday, admitted to . being high on drugs when he allegedly attacked the two children, killing . one of them . Rivera, 31, admitted to being high on a 'wet' combination of marijuana and PCP when he stabbed and killed Dominick Andujar, right . Police say the attacker broke into the children's house and stole into an upstairs bedroom, where he savaged the two children. After she was attacked, the girl ran through her neighborhood screaming for help - her throat cut open and bleeding profusely. Both children had been sleeping downstairs when the assault began, police said. Rivera, who did not enter a plea, is charged with murder and attempted murder, but prosecutors said more charges will be filed. Authorities said he had a drug arrest in 2009 but no other convictions. He did not yet have an attorney Tuesday. The 12-year-old was able to help police track down the attacker by identifying him as what sounded like 'Poppy.' Investigators learned Rivera was known by the nickname 'Popeye' and had spent nights at an apartment in the area of the city. Police found him hiding between a mattress and bedroom wall in the apartment. They said they also found blood-stained sneakers that matched bloody footprints in the home where the children were assaulted. The children were being watched by a 14-year-old girl, authorities said. The teen, who was unharmed, was caring for them because their mother recently underwent surgery and was still in the hospital. Memorial: Mourners leave cuddly toys outside the house in Camden where Dominick Andujar died at the weekend . Killing: Rivera is said to have entered the house in Camden through an upstairs bedroom before the carrying out the double knife attack . Authorities said they are analyzing batches of wet from Camden to see if it has been tampered with or if there is something chemically different about the wet now on the streets of Camden, a city across the river from Philadelphia that continually ranks as one of the nation's most dangerous. In a recent incident, authorities believe Chevonne Thomas was high on 'wet' when she beheaded her two-year-old son Zahree on August 22 in Camden. Thomas had a history of substance abuse and mental health disorders, according to the Department of Children and Families. Shocking: The attack deeply shook resident of Camden, New Jersey, the murder capital of the nation . Horrific: The 12-year-old ran door to door in her neighborhood screaming for help after she had her throat cut . After the attack early Sunday morning, the 12-year-old ran out of the house and began pounding on doors, screaming for help. She banged on several doors until neighbor Nakyta McCray woke up and found her, barely alive. 'I went to the house and saw her sitting there with her throat cut open and barely breathing,' she told ABC Philadelphia.

"A young motorist is locked in a legal battle after having his personalised license plate revoked because it was deemed 'obscene'. Robert Anaya has insisted that the plate on his car, which reads 'IB6UB9' is an 'inside joke' and not a lewd sexual reference. The driver, who is in his early 20s, purchased the personalised plate in early 2009, but has since been contacted by the Motor Vehicle Division telling him it had been revoked. Lewd: Mr Anaya's license plate has raised complaints from other motorists in Sante Fe, New Mexico . The firm said they had received enough complaints about the plate to cause its cancellation. In appealing the decision to revoke the plate, Mr Anaya said it was an inside joke originating from a quip he made to an acquaintance while playing roulette at a casino. A S.U. Mahesh, a spokesman with the Taxation and Revenue Department, told ABQJournal the plate was 'not in good taste'. He said: 'If Mr. Anaya wants to put a bumper sticker on his car, or get a non-state-issued plate and put it on the front of his car, he can do that. 'It’s clear the plate implies an obscene statement and is not in good taste.' Anaya’s attorney, Leon Howard, said: 'There’s nothing in the administrative code for the application process that allows MVD to repeal something that has already been approved. 'He’s already been given the privilege and, once given the privilege, it can’t be taken away. 'What he (Anaya) has is some vague meaning that has a personal meaning to him.' Mr Anaya added through his legal representative that his case had wider implications. Mr Anaya's attorney claimed the license plate was not a problem until his client bought a new car (above) in April and registered the plate . Mr Howard said: 'If you allow the government to start chipping away at our constitutional rights, it can have more serious implications in the future. 'Mr. Anaya feels bullied by the MVD.' Howard claimed Anaya's license plate was not seen as a problem until he bought a new car in April and the dealership had an issue verifying a valid registration plate. A complaint about the 'obscene' plate was said to have come from the governor's office in Sante Fe, New Mexico. Asked if he will take the case any further if the appeal is denied, Anaya’s attorney said he wasn’t sure. Howard said: 'I do have a good basis, I think, to bring a claim for civil rights. But at the end of the day, this is about a license plate.'","Robert Anaya's plate, 'IB6UB9' branded 'obscene' by Motor Vehicle Division .

"A New Hampshire state lawmaker has called a Democratic congresswoman 'ugly as sin' and said that her opponent is one of the most attractive women in politics. Representative Steve Vaillancourt, a Republican from Manchester, compared U.S. Representative Annie Kuster to a drag queen in a clueless blog post on NH Insider last week. He explained that he was inspired to write the post after hearing 'some polling data which went by too fast for me to write down' and which he later could not track down on Google. The poll revealed that 'an attractive candidate can have as much as a seven to ten point advantage over a less attractive (or even an unattractive) candidate,' he wrote. Scroll down for video . Clueless: Rep. Steve Vaillancourt, pictured, called a Democratic congresswoman 'ugly as sin' in a blog post . A candidate needs to be attractive to win, but can't be 'so drop dead gorgeous as to intimidate those watching', he explained. He then asked what this might mean for Kuster's re-election race against her opponent, Republican Marilinda Garcia, in New Hampshire's 2nd congressional district in November. 'Let's be honest. Does anyone not believe that Congressman Annie Kuster is as ugly as sin? And I hope I haven't offended sin,' Vaillancourt wrote. But by contrast, 32-year-old Garcia, is 'one of the most attractive women on the political scene anywhere, not so attractive as to be intimindating [sic], but truly attractive', he wrote. He said that Garcia is so attractive that Democrats have struggled to find a bad picture of her. 'If looks really matter and if this race is at all close, give a decided edge to Marilinda Garcia,' he wrote. Cruel: He said Rep. Annie Kuster, pictured left, looked more like a drag queen than most men in drag. By comparison, he said that her Republican opponent Marilinda Garcia, right, was 'truly attractive' But he doesn't stop there. He then tells a bizarre story of a 'rather attractive drag queen' whom he saw outside a bar named Mados during a recent trip to Montreal and said he thought of Kuster, 58.

He concluded: 'Annie Kuster looks more like a drag queen than most men in drag.'

Kuster's campaign has declined to comment on the blog post. But Garcia said the 'sexist' comments 'have absolutely no place in political discourse'. 'Both Rep.

'I hope that as time moves forward and more female candidates run for political office around the country, people will focus on the content of our ideas rather than what we wear and how we look.'

Vaillancourt has refused to say if he stands behind his comments. The lawmaker is no stranger to controversy. In 2012, he was forced to publicly apologize for saying 'Sieg Hiel' and giving a Nazi salute during a heated floor exchange. Although one recent independent poll by WMUR puts Garcia ahead, Kuster has long been leading the polls, results show. Kuster, a mother-of-two, was elected to office in 2013.","In a blog post, Republican Steve Vaillancourt wrote that Representative Annie Kuster 'looks more like a drag queen than most men in drag'

"A former Premier League striker has been suspended from Twitter after allegedly launching a campaign to tweet raunchy pictures of women sent in by their ex-boyfriends. Controversial footballer Leon Knight is being investigated by police after allegedly setting up the site called 'S*** Alert Pictures' on the social networking site. Suspended: Knight, who was once on the books at Chelsea, has been temporarily banned from Twitter after his latest indiscretion . The 29-year-old, who has already courted trouble on Twitter by abusing WAG Danielle Lloyd, has been suspended from the site. He had publicised the 'event' under the strapline, 'It's judgment day b*****s', before discussing the raunchy pictures of women, uploaded without permission, under the hashtag #sap. Knight, currently without a club, tweeted 'taster' pictures of women befor Twitter intervened and suspended his account after complaints. Although some Twitter users appeared to encourage Knight to post the pictures before his account was suspended, the footballer was largely condemned on the social networking site for his behaviour. Knight has played for 15 different clubs in his career, in five different countries. He was released from his last team, Northern Irish side Glentoran, after sending alleged homophobic tweets. Defended his wife: Footballer Jamie O'Hara has previously challenged Knight after his wife Danielle (right) was abused by the striker on Twitter . His latest indiscretion on Twitter comes just a month after the failed journeyman striker was investigated for abusing Danielle Lloyd, the wife of Wolves midfielder Jamie O'Hara. Knight had an argument through the social network with Miss Lloyd's husband, with whom the model has two children. O'Hara, 25, was incensed after Knight, 29, tweeted to him: 'You're married correct !! But ur married to a raging s**t bag [sic]' Knight followed up the comment with many other accusations relating to Danielle's past, insinuating that she'd played the field with many other footballers in her time. O'Hara wrote: 'If at @leonknight82 has got a problem he should give me a call instead of giving the bigun on twitter to a women with two kids. Lashed out: Ex-Chelsea player Leon Knight tweeted some unkind comments about Danielle Lloyd recently . He added: 'To all people asking me about Leon knight this is now in the hands of the police and my lawyers, jealousy is the the route to all evil.' Clearly upset, Danielle later took to her own page and wrote: 'Sadly I might be coming off Twitter as I can't take much more abuse from scum when all am trying to do is be a good mum & wife I love all[sic].' However, Danielle later changed her mind about shutting down her Twitter account. The investigation into Knight's Twitter comments comes as prominent celebrities have spoken out about personal attacks aimed at their accounts and police begin to crack down on online abuse. Rose to Danielle's defense: Jamie O'Hara was understandably outraged by Leon's comments, and quick to retaliate . Stuart Hyde, chief constable of Cumbria and the Association of Chief Police Officers spokesman on social media, said earlier this week: ‘Social media is increasingly part of police business and the law covers situations where you have comment that goes way beyond legitimate opinion. 'We don’t just deal with people who are famous. People have the right to freedom of speech but it has to be within the law.’ Under the Malicious Communications Act 1988, any 'indecent or grossly offensive' message that causes 'distress or anxiety' to the recipient can lead to prosecution. The maximum punishment is a fine not exceeding level four on the standard scale - i.e. no more than £2,500.","Leon Knight suspended from site after promising to post raunchy pictures without permission .

"A suspected fugitive sniper who opened fire on his neighbours held police at bay for several hours before being shot dead. The gunman in Arlington, Washington State, shot a neighbour in the leg before opening fire on a SWAT team during a dramatic shoot-out in nearby woodland. Police in armoured vehicles surrounded the man spotted with a rifle and a scope in Arlington, Snohomish County north of Seattle, as the stand-off unfolded on Sunday afternoon. Armoured police Arlington . Stand-off: Armoured vehicles and police cars rush to the scene after initial reports of a neighbourhood shooting north of Seattle . They had originally been called out to reports of a shooting on a residential driveway before the man, who has not been identified, went on the run to woodland near Arlington. Snohomish County Sheriff's spokeswoman Shari Ireton said late on Sunday that the male suspect was deceased and a weapon was recovered. No other details were immediately available. She said authorities continued to search for a possible second suspect. The man who was shot in his driveway about 1:30 p.m. called authorities before he was taken to a hospital with a non-life threatening injury. Officers understood someone was in the woods, shooting at vehicles or people, so they initiated a SWAT team call. Soon after police said their armoured vehicles were hit 'several times' by gunfire from the woods. The shooting took place outside Arlington, Washington State, around 50 miles north of Seattle . Shoot-out: Residents heard several shots from woodland outside Arlington, before police declared the man had been found dead . Resident Linda Purtteman, who was walking her dog in the area Sunday afternoon, told The Seattle Times that she heard gunshots, but initially was unfazed by them. 'I have a few neighbors who go shooting a lot out here, so I didn't think anything of it,' she said. But then, a neighbor told her shots had been fired at a SWAT team and people in the area were urged to stay indoors, she said.","Gunman spotted with rifle and scope in Arlington, north of Seattle .

"Russian President Vladamir Putin blew off U.S. president Barack Obama's claims this morning that he not telling the truth about his government's relationship with pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine. 'Who is he to judge, ' Putin told CNBC during an interview this morning. 'Who is he to judge, seriously?' he repeated, according to a translator. 'If he wants to judge people, why doesn't he get a job in court somewhere?' 'If [President Obama] wants to judge people, why doesn't he get a job in court somewhere?' Russian President Vladimir Putin said during an interview today . Putin, right, told, CNBC' anchor Geoff Cutmore, left, during the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum in St. Petersburg, Russia 23, that maybe America had put sanctions Russian businesses because it wanted an economic edge . Putin made the comments during an on-stage interview at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum as CNBC host Geoff Cutmore was telling him Obama had 'accused you, as you know, of untruths when it comes to supporting some of the separatists groups...' At that point, Putin interrupted Cutmore to make fun of president Obama, which drew laughter from the audience. In a more somber tone, Putin told added, 'I don't think he accused me.' 'It's his point of view. And I have my point of view, when it comes to certain things,' he said. Cutmore then tried to ask him if his country would allow Ukraine's scheduled election to take proceed peacefully this Sunday, to which Putin said, 'Oh come, on, really? He's a difficult man to deal with. Where did you get this guy?' Pro-Russian armed militants stand guard at a barricade which faces a position manned by Ukrainian army soldiers, near the eastern Ukrainian city of Slavyansk, Donetsk region. Putin said today that the crisis in Ukraine had evolved into a full-scale civil war and blaming the West for escalating the crisis . Russia and the U.S. have been engaged in a stand off over the former country's invasion Crimean Peninsula, which was under the control of Ukraine until February. In March, Crimea broke off from the Ukraine with the help of Russian separatist forces and joined Russia. Russian-backed separatists have since invaded other eastern areas of Ukraine, taken over government buildings, kidnapped journalists and engaged in deadly assaults with Ukrainian security forces. Russia made an agreement with the U.S. and EU in mid-April that it would use its influence on the pro-Russian forces in Ukraine to get them to vacate power, but the promise never came to fruition. 'So far at least we have seen them not abide by the spirit or the letter of the agreement in Geneva,' President Obama said days later. 'Instead we continue to see malicious, armed men taking over buildings, harassing folks who are disagreeing with them, destabilizing the region and we haven't seen Russia step out and discouraging it.' When Russia still did not fulfill its part of the agreement, the U.S. introduced sanctions on a handful of the countries businesses, singling out the ones whose executives had close ties with Russia's leader. 'The goal here is not to go after Mr. Putin personally,' President Obama said in announcing the sanctions. 'The goal is to change his calculus,' Obama said, and 'encourage him to actually walk the walk and not just talk the talk when it comes to diplomatically resolving the crisis in Ukraine.' On Friday Putin claimed that the West was the blame for the instability in Ukraine, not Russia, and 'now, they want us to clean up the mess they created.' Putin called the sanctions on his friends 'illegal' and said they ought to sue the U.S. 'They don't have any relation to the events in Ukraine or Crimea, he said. 'Maybe the Americans, who are quite shrewd, want to win a competitive edge over Europe by insisting on introducing sanctions against Russia?' Putin acknowledged that that sanctions have hurt his friends' businesses but said they are 'experienced entrepreneurs' and will be just fine. The Russian leader also predicted that the U.S.' sanctions on his country would end up backfiring. 'Economic sanctions as a tool of political pressure are eventually going to attack the economy of the countries who have initiated the sanctions,' he said. Putin joked that 'you can’t force people to like you' but he  hopes 'common sense, good sense and national interest, will push' the U.S. and the other European countries that have place sanctions on his country to continue working with his country.","After his speech at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum today Russian president Vladamir Putin participated in an on-stage interview .

"Al Qaeda has released a new video of American hostage Warren Weinstein giving a personal plea to Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu because 'American has abandoned him'. The 71-year-old, who was taken prisoner in Pakistan last August, delivers a video message in which he says President Obama 'has shown no interest in my case'. It is thought that Weinstein is being held in the tribal regions along Pakistan's border with Afghanistan. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Plea: Mr Weinstein, 71, has been videoed delivering a message asking Benjamin Netanyahu for help as President Obama has 'abandoned' him . Prisoner: Weinstein, left, shown pleading with Barack Obama in May, and shown in England in 2009, right . A video was posted earlier this year on jihadist websites by Al Qaeda's media division Al Sahab . In the brief one-minute message, Weinstein, sat in a plain white tshirt and appearing calm and healthy, asks Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu to 'intervene on my behalf'. He asks the Israeli leader for help in meeting Al Qaeda's demands, although he does not specify what these are. Previous Al Qaeda conditions for his release have included the freeing of militant suspects and a halt to U.S. airstrikes. The aid worker said President Barack Obama and the American government 'have shown no interest in my case.' Claim: Weinstein made a direct plea to Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu (left) after saying he was abandoned by President Obama . He appealed to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for help 'as one Jew to another,' asking him to accept the militant group's demands so he could return to his family. He did not specify in his statement how the Israeli leader could end U.S. airstrikes or have militant suspects around the world released. Weinstein spoke while sitting down in front of a camouflage background. He wore a white T-shirt. His captors were not visible. The video was posted on the Internet by al-Qaida's media arm, Al-Sahab, according to IntelCenter, a U.S.-based group that monitors media websites. It contained the Al-Sahab logo. Pakistani students walk past Weinstein's house in Lahore, from where he was kidnapped, this morning . Weinstein was abducted last August in the eastern Pakistani city of Lahore after gunmen tricked his guards and broke into his home. He was the country director in Pakistan for J.E. Austin Associates, a U.S.-based firm that advises a range of Pakistani business and government sectors. Al-Qaida issued a video last December in which the group's leader, Ayman al-Zawahri, said the American would be released if the U.S. stopped airstrikes in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Somalia and Yemen. Al-Zawahri also demanded the release of all al-Qaida and Taliban suspects around the world. In May, Weinstein appeared in another video in which he said he would be killed unless President Barack Obama agreed to al-Qaida's demands.","Warren Weinstein makes plea for Isreali PM to 'intervene'

"Student Raffaele Sollecito, who was cleared of the brutal sex murder of Meredith Kercher, has revealed how he had sex with former girlfriend Amanda Knox the first night they met. Italian Sollecito, 28, was convicted alongside Knox in 2009 of killing Miss Kercher, but the pair were freed last October after their convictions were overturned due to a lack of evidence. Now Sollecito has been pictured enjoying a party lifestyle and promoting a new book which is set to shed light on his relationship with Knox before the death of Miss Kercher, a 21-year-old from Leeds University. Looking almost unrecognisable, Raffaele Sollecito the ex-boyfriend of Amanda Knox smiles for the camera at the Burning Man festival in Nevada early this week . Innocent: U.S. citizen Amanda Knox, left, and her then-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, of Italy, outside the rented house where 21-year-old British student Meredith Kercher was found dead (file photo) In the book he reveals how he ended up sleeping with Knox on the very day they met. The revelations in his book, which he wrote about the case with British author Andrew Gumbel, is expected to earn him more than £1million when it is released next week in the United States. Describing his first intimate night together with Knox, 25, he said: 'I showed Amanda around and invited her to plop down on the bed while I loaded a film on my computer. 'Of course, by the time I settled in next to her, all thoughts of the movie were quickly forgotten and we pulled each other's clothes off before the opening credits finished rolling. 'When I woke up the next morning, Amanda still had her arms wrapped tightly around me. I remember feeling safe and warm in a way I hadn't since I was a little kid. 'We related in a sweet, almost childlike way, maybe because we didn't share a native language.' In Honour Bound: My Journey To Hell And Back With Amanda Knox, the bespectacled computer studies graduate reveals his true feelings for the 25-year-old blonde American, who he met just a week before tragic Meredith was found semi naked and with her throat slashed in the bedroom of her house. Attending the massive 50,000 person open air . desert festival, Sollecito looks a different person from the troubled . soul who appeared in court last year . The annual counter-culture festival relies on a . system of barter-trade and not money to purchase goods and services . while at the event . Raffaele Sollecito stands with a man dressed as a leopard with the mountains of the Black Rock Desert behind him . Raffaele Sollecito seemed to really get into the spirit of things at the Burning Man festival . The murder made headlines around the world and the pair were famously photographed kissing and cuddling outside the scene of the crime - and in the ensuing trial Knox was portrayed as man-hungry and her boyfriend as an obedient puppy. Sollecito also revealed how he became jealous when just days into his relationship with Knox he discovered her on Facebook chatting to her former boyfriend David Johnsrud. He says: 'I asked who he was. Right away, she explained that she, like Meredith, had left behind a boyfriend when she came to Italy. His name was David Johnsrud, known as D.J., and they were still in regular contact. 'In fact, they chatted or e-mailed almost every day. D.J. was spending his junior year in China, and given the distance, it hadn't made sense for them to stay together as a couple. 'I could tell just by looking at Amanda that she was still attached to him. Even though we'd only known each other a few days, I had fallen for her - and it hurt.' He also describes the moment he met Knox again for the first time after they were sensationally cleared of the murder last year due to a lack of evidence - after spending four years in jail and being convicted in 2009. Murder charges: Raffaele Sollecito, left, and . Amanda Knox, right, are pictured arriving for a hearing in Perugia's . court, in 2009; in Sollecito's book, he maintains his innocence but says . he and his then-girlfriend behaved oddly . The pair were filmed kissing, cuddling and stroking each other outside as the police were investigating the murder . Sollecito said: 'I wasn't just nervous about setting eyes on her again. I felt I was suffering from some sort of associative disorder, in which it became difficult for me to focus on my genuine and continuing fondness for Amanda without being overwhelmed by an instinctive, involuntary revulsion at everything the courts and the media had thrown at her. 'Two different Amandas - the real one, and the distorted, she-devil version I had read about and seen on television nonstop for four years seemed somehow blurred in my unconscious mind.' Knox and Sollecito were held by police just five days after the 2007 murder because of their odd behaviour - initially they could not remember clearly what they were doing as they had been smoking marijuana the night of the killing and detectives watched in amazement as the pair kissed and cuddled in front of Meredith's grief stricken friends while they waited to be interviewed. Knox performed cartwheels in the police station and sat on Sollecito's lap - and they were also later filmed buying lingerie, the American promising her boyfriend she would wear it later while they had 'wild sex.' Brutal murder: Meredith Kercher was killed in her apartment on November 1, 2007 . In his book Sollecito admits their behaviour was 'odd' but at the same time he hits out at the sloppy police investigation which was so crucial in clearing them after experts revealed at the appeal evidence was unreliable as it had been poorly handled and was contaminated. He admitted they also had no real alibi as the couple were smoking marijuana the night of the murder and they only had 'each other' to explain what they were doing the night of the killing. At their first trial which ended in December 2009 Knox was jailed for 26 years and Sollecito for 25 years after they were found guilty of murder and sexual assault. A third man ivory Coast drifter Rudy Guede, 25, has also been convicted and he was initially given 30 years but this was reduced to 16 on appeal. Knox herself has kept a low profile at her home in Seattle since the murder but like Sollecito she has also signed a multi million dollar book deal and it is due out next year. Sollecito is in the United States ahead of next week's book launch and he is not expected to return to Italy until next month following a TV appearance on CBS. Anxious moments: Raffaele Sollecito waits in . Perugia's Court of Appeal before hearing that he won his appeal against . his murder conviction on October 3, 2011 in Italy . Testifying: Sollecito testified during a session of Knox's appeal trial in Perugia's courthouse on June 27, 2011 . His father Francesco, speaking from his home near Bari, said: 'Raffaele has been in America for the last few weeks finishing off the final details on the book and preparing for the presentation next week. I think it will take place in New York. 'For the moment it won't be coming out in Italy and there are no immediate plans for the book to be translated into Italian. I haven't read the book yet and I only know a few of the details. 'I can't say for certain if Raffaele really did write that he and Amanda were smoking marijuana in the house the night Meredith was killed - to me it's a minor matter but on the other hand it does prove that Raffaele and Amanda were doing something else while the poor girl was murdered.

Release: Knox, pictured right at Rome's airport, . gave an emotional press conference once she got back home in . Washington, left, a day after she was acquitted of murder in October . 2011 . 'Once the presentation is over and he has given his TV interview he will return to Italy and resume his university studies in Verona. As far as I know he hasn't meet up with Amanda while he has been in the United States but they do speak regularly. 'The most important thing is that we are waiting hopefully for the decision of the Italian Supreme Court in March when they will both be finally cleared and this nightmare will be over.' Sollecito has spent most of the last month in the United States and his Facebook page shows him in San Francisco where he worked with the book's British author Andrew Gumbel and also most recently in New York. His Facebook profile shows him as being friends with Amanda's sister Deanna and her step sister Delaney as well as her step mum Cassandra. Under his profile he describes himself as 'honest, calm, positive young man but an incurable daydreamer.'","Student first slept with 'Foxy Knoxy' a week before Meredith Kercher was found dead .

"A pair of primary school children were given cocaine instead of sweets when they went trick or treating. Plastic bags containing the white powder were handed to youngsters taking part in traditional Halloween fun in Royton, Greater Manchester, at around 7.50pm yesterday. The wraps were taken to police and examined and confirmed to contain cocaine. Scene: Two children on this street in Greater Manchester were given cocaine instead of sweets when they went trick or treating last night . It is not clear whether the children had tried any before it was discovered. Donald Junior Green, 23, has been charged with possession of Class A drugs and is due before Oldham Magistrates' Court tomorrow morning. A 21-year-old woman was arrested on suspicion of possession of Class A drugs and was later released without charge. Swap: The wraps of the Class A drug were discovered by parents and the police confirmed it was cocaine . Superintendent Catherine Hankinson, of Greater Manchester Police, said: 'The parents and police acted quickly when this report was made, in the interests of public safety. 'We understand this to be an isolated incident.' Elsewhere in Manchester a gang of robbers disguised in Halloween outfits carried out a gems raid - while pretending to be out trick or treating. The thugs in curly red and black wigs and Guy Fawkes-style masks had been walking down a street with collection buckets before they brought real life terror to a jewellery store. Armed with crowbars and a hammer the three men burst into the shop in Tyldesley Arcade, in Wigan, Greater Manchester and terrorised a heavily pregnant woman, her colleagues and customers and demanded valuables before escaping to a nearby getaway car. Meanwhile in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, a man was left in a critical condition after accidentally hanging himself on a noose that had been set up as a Halloween prop at a nightclub. The 25-year-old was taken to hospital from Pink Punters. Nightclub owners and police said it had been a 'freak accident'.

"Remarkable intervention: Diane Abbot said feminism was partly to blame for damaging the family . Feminism is partly to blame for the breakdown of the family, one of Labour’s most senior female politicians has said. Diane Abbott, the party’s public health spokesman, said that major issues facing society ‘stem from family breakdown’. And in a surprise admission from one of the Left’s most outspoken feminists, she conceded that women’s rights campaigners have neglected the family. Miss Abbott, a divorced mother with one son, also highlighted the harmful impact on society of internet pornography and fast food. Perhaps most surprising, however, is her argument that Left-wingers and feminists should make family breakdown a key battleground rather than leave the issue to Conservatives. In an interview with The Guardian, she said: ‘Those of us who came of age at the height of feminism had very mixed views about the family, since it seemed to be defined as a heterosexual thing with a certificate, children and mum at home.’ But she said the Left had to recognise that ‘some of the biggest public health issues stem from family breakdown’, explaining: ‘Doctors say to me that so many of the drug and alcohol problems they see stem from family difficulties.’ In a nod to Labour orthodoxy, Miss Abbott said: ‘When I talk about stable families, I do not only mean the heterosexual, 2.1-children set-up, but also extended families or same-sex relationships.’ But she added: ‘I still believe some kind of stable family structure is vital and that is what most people want around them. I do not think we should abandon that terrain to the Right.’ Miss Abbott’s intervention is remarkable since it echoes the views of Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith. Miss Abbott, who stood for the Labour . leadership in 2010, said local authorities should have stronger powers . to ban the spread of fried chicken shops and other fast food outlets, . adding: ‘For too many children, fast food is not a treat but a dietary . staple.’ Miss Abbott recognised that 'some of the biggest public health issues stem from family breakdown' Advice: Miss Abbott also said local authorities should have stronger powers to ban fast food outlets . Surprising: The Labour MP's views echo those of Work and Pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith . Miss Abbott also threw her support behind Tory MP Claire Perry’s crusade to introduce controls on viewing internet pornography. ‘Children very young, ten or 11, can go online and see stuff they could not have bought in a newsagent 20 years ago,’ she said. ‘This crude pornification is new, and leads to the objectification of the human body, especially girls’ bodies.’ Miss Abbott also said she had come to support school uniforms – traditionally opposed by the Left – to combat the modern obsession with designer brands. She said: ‘There are these young mums that do not necessarily read to their children, they do not take them to the library, but they think they are good mums because their children are dressed in brand names from top to bottom.’","The Labour MP said big issues facing society 'stem from family breakdown'

"A social media app which promises anonymity and claims to be the safest place on the internet is spying on its users and tracking their locations, it has been claimed. Whisper, which urges people to reveal intimate details about their lives to others, has been accused of monitoring the whereabouts of its users - including some who have specifically requested not to be followed. There are claims a team at the company is tracking users it thinks are newsworthy - including military personnel, people working at Disney and a 'sex-obsessed lobbyist' working in Washington DC. Scroll down for video . Whisper, which urges people to reveal intimate details about their lives to others, has been accused of monitoring the whereabouts of its users . The claims were made by the Guardian newspaper which suggested Whisper was occasionally sharing information with the US government. The company, which has its headquarters in Los Angeles, has already hit back at the reports, with the editor-in-chief Neetzan Zimmerman taking to Twitter to describe them as being 'riddled with outright lies'. Rejecting any wrongdoing, it told the newspaper that it 'does not follow or track users' and said it was false to suggest it was monitoring people without its consent. Whisper's editor-in-chief Neetzan Zimmerman (pictured) has taken to Twitter to describe the reports as being 'riddled with outright lies' Whisper, set up two years ago, has become popular with young people around the world - especially in the U.S, with estimates suggesting people send 2.6million messages a day. Earlier this year, the firm was valued at more than $200million. Users, who do not have a public identity on the app, post short messages superimposed over pictures. But the Guardian claims that some are being tracked despite choosing to disable the app's geolocation features. It reports that once users have opted out of geolocation services, the company can extract their rough location using IP data from their smartphones on a targeted 'case-by-case' basis. Whisper, which has its headquarters in Los Angeles, was set up two years ago with the aim of allowing users to post messages anonymously enabling them to share intimate details about their private lives. Users, who do not have a public identity, send out short posts displayed as text superimposed over an image. People can then respond to a message either publicly or privately. There have been reports that Whisper's popularity has grown so much in the last two years - especially in the US - that it had reached 3billion monthly page views in December last year. The Guardian claims to have gathered information during a three-day visit to the company's headquarters. The newspaper says that CEO Michael Heyward recently described the app as the 'safest place on the internet'. It says Whisper has acknowledged it researched locations of people who they considered were sending out newsworthy messages - adding that this was typically done using GPS data. But Whisper said it did not store usernames, phone numbers or personally identifiable information. But in a statement sent to the Business Insider, a Whisper spokesman said: 'Whisper does not collect nor store any personally identifiable information from users and is anonymous. 'There is nothing in our geolocation data that can be tied to an individual user and a user’s anonymity is never compromised. 'Whisper does not follow or track users. The Guardian’s assumptions that Whisper is gathering information about users and violating user’s privacy are false.' Whisper spokeswoman Tracy Akselrud told The Washington Post  that the company was not sharing 'specific user data with any organisation' but had been working with the Defense Department as part of research into post-traumatic stress disorder.

"It's a delicacy usually consumed in small portions. But Andy Murray is such a fan of sushi he is able to eat 50 portions in one sitting. High in protein and carbohydrates, the fish-based diet  has helped the British number one build up an imposing 6ft 3in, 13½ stone frame. Without the extra rations the Scot’s punishing schedule would see him lose around 8kg of muscle in a year. More than a mouthful: Andy Murray seeks out sushi wherever he play and can put away an incredible 50 portions in a single sitting . He needs to eat within an hour of the end of a match and makes sure his team has tracked down a high-quality sushi restaurant wherever he plays. At Wimbledon he has been known to put sushi in an ice cooler so he can have it brought to him at the end of a late game. Murray puts away an astonishing 6,000 calories a day washed down with at least six litres of water . He also eats large quantities of red . meat, pasta and rice spread over six meals in a day. Breakfast is a . yoghurt and a peanut butter bagel with a protein shake. The 6,000 calories a day are washed down with at least six litres of water. Alcohol, processed foods and sugar are avoided at all costs. The energy-rich meals are burned off throughout the day during his tennis sessions, hot Bikram yoga, stretches and weight training. Nino Severino, who has coached top British players, says: ‘Andy is such a physical player that every time he slams down his foot he is basically ripping his body to shreds. He then needs to replenish the lost protein because that’s a big element of rebuilding. Players like sushi because it tastes fresh and is not fried. ‘There’s something called a glycaemic window. The body needs the carbohydrates and protein to replenish the muscles and the liver with glycogen. The rice helps that process.’ The Australian Institute of Sport has recommended sushi for all its athletes in the past and tennis ace Serena Williams and baseball star Alex Rodriguez are fans. Scientists believe the benefits of sushi are one reason the Japanese are among the healthiest nations in the world. The omega-3 fatty acids in fish are linked to heart protection and improved circulation and rice is a good source of protein. The energy-rich meals are burned off throughout the day during his tennis sessions, hot Bikram yoga, stretches and weight training . Meanwhile, the seaweed wrapped around the rolls is rich in iodine. But despite its healthy reputation, the Japanese food came under attack recently from those who say it is worse than a McDonalds takeaway. Critics say many sushi rolls contain very little fish and are laced with fatty mayonnaise – not to mention filled with processed carbohydrates. Soy sauce, which often accompanies a sushi lunch, contains high salt levels – as does otherwise healthy miso soup.","Fish-based diet has helped Murray one build up a 6ft 3in, 13½ stone frame .

"Monty Python star Michael Palin has backed calls to save a picturesque seaside resort from having a Costa Coffee. Southwold in Suffolk has become a hit destination for upmarket holidaymakers, with the coffee giant now looking to install its first branch in the trendy seaside resort. Palin, 69, also famous for his travel programmes, spoke out after campaigners lost the latest round of their battle to keep Costa out. Popular: Southwold in Suffolk is a hit destination for upmarket holidaymakers . Speaking at the re-launch of the Suffolk resort's Electric Picture Palace cinema, he declared it was important to protect Southwold's 'harmony' to prevent it becoming like other seaside towns across the country. His outburst came after Costa Coffee was given the green light last week to open a cafi at 70 High Street, Southwold, a move which objectors fear will harm the business of its independent traders. He said 'I don't think anywhere can totally resist change, but Southwold is a very special place. It's a town full of harmony and architectural features that go together beautifully and the fact that is still here is wonderful. 'I wouldn't be very happy if they started knocking through walls and putting in big supermarkets. 'Southwold has got a uniqueness that comes from being slightly cut off, but we have to keep its unique image because we do not want it to look the same as every other seaside town. 'The place has such a wonderful feeling - why would you want to change it much?' Travel broadcaster Palin, 69, backed opposition to the Costa Coffee plans by saying Southwold's 'harmony' should be protected . The legendary comic fell in love with Southwold after holidaying in north Suffolk as a child and went on to meet his wife Helen in the town, while his parents retired to the area in 1966. Fictional Southwold Estate is the country estate of the family of Lady Marjorie Bellamy in the ITV British drama Upstairs, Downstairs, and the town has been used as the setting for numerous films and television programmes. Julie Myerson, setting her 2003 murder novel Something Might Happen in Southwold, called it 'a sleepy, slightly self-satisfied seaside town'. 1984 writer George Orwell (then known as Eric Blair) spent time as a teenager and in his thirties in Southwold, living at his parents' home. A plaque can be seen next door to what is now the fish and chip shop at the far end of the High Street.","Broadcaster says Southwold, Suffolk should keep its 'harmony'

"For nearly 20 years I’ve been on benefits. Despite earning a good salary as a journalist and broadcaster and being married to a chartered accountant, the Government money lands in my account each month. I accept it happily, without so much as a twitch of embarrassment. I’m not alone. I have friends who are lawyers, doctors, pharmacists — all highly paid professionals — who are also unapologetic in their receipt of these state handouts. I’m not talking about a tax loophole or state backhander that allows the streetwise to filch from an already over-committed welfare state. I am, of course, referring to child benefit. Scroll down for video . Selfish: Writer Angela Epstein at home with three of her four children . This has always been a one-size-fits-all payment, which is not affected by the level of income coming into a household. This counts as recognition by the tax system that, as parents, we deserve a little help in supporting our families, regardless of our gross income. For people like me and my husband, it also means that those who plough a lot into the system are guaranteed to get at least a little out. But now, just because my children are growing up in a household where both their mother and father earn a decent living, the State wants to renege on its part of the deal. As part of the Coalition’s austerity programme of spending cuts, a million households in the UK — the wealthiest 15 per cent — will soon wave goodbye to this helping hand. In a disgraceful act of financial myopia, the Government is axing or partially axing the broad entitlement of family allowance. Any household where one parent earns more than £50,000 a year will lose a proportion of the benefit on a sliding scale — 1 per cent for every £100 earned over this threshold. Those earning more than £60,000 lose all of their benefit. In our house, that means our benefit payments will soon be no more than a childhood memory since my salary hovers around £50,000 and my husband’s is significantly more. Child benefit cuts: Work and Pensions secretary, Ian Duncan Smith, is behind the reforms . No longer eligible for the monthly payments, we will be left with the invidious choice of either giving it up completely or continuing to take the benefit and then having it clawed back from us when we fill in our tax forms for the financial year. I understand that we are going through a time of great financial difficulty in this country and that sacrifices must be made to get us back on track. But why should my children lose out, simply because their parents have had the temerity to work hard and earn a good living? It’s the one payment everyone in society receives, and makes us all feel like the State is behind family life. It’s the one payment everyone in society receives, and makes us all feel like the State is behind family life . Child benefit was introduced as a tax-free payment aimed at helping parents cope with the cost of bringing up children. Inferred in its genesis was a moral as well as financial responsibility. For as any parent can tell you, the cost of bringing up children is never-ending. If the State commits itself to showing support for the financial security of the family, what right has it to discriminate against those of us with a higher salary? Why should we forfeit such protection? Child benefit is as rightfully mine as it for the chap I know whose property company nets him £150,000 a year and for the woman I see on the school run who works as a supermarket cashier. It is a moral imperative. Either we all get it or none of us do. There are those who may well protest that if you earn at least £50,000 then surely you can’t possibly even notice the money — which by the way is £20.30 a week for the first child and £13.40 for each extra one until they are 18. And since my eldest son Sam, 19, is now away at university and his brother Max, 17, is hoping to do the same next year, child benefit for my other two children, Aaron, 14, and Sophie, eight, will soon be worth only £1,752 a year. But it’s astonishing how handy this . money becomes. As one friend pointed out, child benefit has gone a long . way towards school uniform, school trips and all the other enduring . costs of raising children. I . have certainly found it to be so. Over the years, those several . thousand pounds have paid for both the expected and collateral expenses . of child-rearing, such as swimming lessons and never-ending supplies of . stationery. Family man: Prime Minister David Cameron has a young family of his own but backs the cuts . My child benefit goes into a domestic account and, as it mounts up, I use it only for what my children need. A trip to Clarks for the start of the school term last month cost nearly £100. There was something quite heartening to think the State was directly responsible for ensuring my children had shoes. A friend of mine whose husband works in sales for a salary of around £52,000 and who stays at home to raise their young baby, is already deeply worried about the cuts. She pointed out that the £80-or-so a month she receives makes a significant difference, if only for the monthly nappies and formula milk bill. It also makes her feel as if she is contributing something to the family pot. I have always respected my child benefit, even when, as the years passed, its value began to diminish as my salary increased. When Sam was born 19 years ago, I was . making pennies as a trainee reporter while my husband was scratching . around trying to set up his own business. The extra monthly pay check made a . difference. The money was set aside for the needs of our baby son, as it . has been for his siblings ever since. There are those who may protest . that if you earn at least £50,000 then surely you can’t possibly even . notice the money — which by the way is £20.30 a week for the first child . and £13.40 for each extra one until they are 18 . So what if gradually more money came into the pot. The State had pledged its support for all parents. Why should that change? Aside from all emotional arguments, on a practical level, junking child benefit is a ludicrous move.Under the new rules, two breadwinning parents who each earn £49,000 will keep all of their child benefit. But a couple, in which one person earns £60,000, lose all of theirs. Meanwhile, the end of child benefit for the so-called squeezed middle will leave in its wake a tax system in which a man (or woman) supporting a partner and children will be treated the same as someone on the same income with absolutely no dependants. How can this be anything other than a grotesque perversion of our benefit system? What’s more, how on earth can the taxman uncover whether unmarried couples are a family unit if they do not declare this? Is this not an open temptation to lie? Suddenly, your partner could just be a lodger, a friend, a one-night stand or an old flame passing through for old times’ sake. But if you’re married — as I have been for 22 years — it’s easy for the taxman to see your financial affairs and check on your details. So, once again, those of us who believe in matrimony for the stability of the family (oh, the irony) are being penalised by the State. Removing child benefit from higher-earning families rests on the point of discrimination: earn more and the State will give your children less. Yet the State is already squeezing our children every which way it can. University tuition fees for our eldest, now a medical student, are a massive £9,000 a year. And what’s to stop discrimination bleeding elsewhere, dismantling other universal benefits? Take state education — which for the moment (at least) is free. You can almost hear them clucking over their calculators in Whitehall: if one pupil’s father is a dentist and the other has a badly paid job, should education be free for both? And why should a GP treat both the child of a road sweeper and the child of a City banker for nothing, when the latter could so clearly afford to pay? Why? Because my children are no different to yours and child benefit is as much mine as it is yours. To cut it is a direct strike on parents who have done nothing more than work hard for their families, and pay their taxes. Silly me for thinking all  children were equal. In the lamentable eyes of our Government, some it seems are more equal than others. VIDEO: Unfair?

"George W. Bush has called for the stigmatizing word 'disorder' to be removed from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, which he claims hinders military veterans' transition into civilian life. The former president told a George W. Bush Institute summit this week that some veterans are reluctant to seek help and that employers often don't realize the condition can be treated. 'As a result of public misunderstanding, employers sometimes cite it as a reason for not hiring vets,' Bush said. 'As most doctors today will tell you, post-traumatic stress is not a disorder. Post-traumatic stress or PTS is an injury that can result from the experience of war. And like other injuries, PTS is treatable.' Moving forward: Former President George W. Bush believes PTSD should stop being called a disorder because it stops employers from hiring sufferers . ABC News reported that, according to the U.S. Department . of Veterans Affairs which still uses the designation 'PTSD', about 30 . percent of post 9/11 veterans suffer from the malady, which hinders . their reintegration into civilian society. The result is that many former troops struggle to find work and often lack the necessary skills to move into employment. Bush said his institute has been working with Syracuse University to study these issues and the results will be released in spring. He said the information will help employers understand what veterans have to offer, noting that both veterans and employers have a hard time translating military experience. 'You don't see many job postings that say: 'Wanted: Experience hunting insurgents and terrorists. Willing to risk life for co-workers',' Bush said. 'Or what's a veteran supposed to put down? My last office was a Humvee?' He told ABC News that he 'has a duty' to ensure all veterans have a fighting chance. 'Obviously I get slightly emotional talking about our vets because I have an emotional…,' he said, trailing off. 'I’m in there with them. These are men and women who volunteered in the face of danger. 'I mean, they knew right after 9/11 that the nation would seek justice and to protect ourselves. And some got hurt, and some of them need a lot of help. And our nation owes a huge debt of gratitude.' Healing: Retired Colonel Miguel Howe, left, gets a playful pat on the head from former President George W. Bush during a break in this week's 'Empowering Our Nation's Warriors' summit . Fair-minded: Jill Biden, wife of Vice President Joe Biden, believes the community owes it to veterans to assist with their rehabilitation . He said his institute will also work with higher education officials on how to recruit and retain veterans. 'We recognize that in helping our veterans we can unleash the potential of a generation of resourceful, determined and experienced leaders,' Bush told the summit. Jill Biden, wife of Vice President Joe Biden, also spoke at the summit which included panel discussions with former military leaders, business people and nonprofit leaders. Jill Biden and first lady Michelle Obama founded the Joining Forces campaign to rally the country around its servicemen and servicewomen. 'Our military families have done so much for our country and each of us can do something in return,' Biden said. Looking for answers: The George W. Bush Institute is working with Syracuse University on a study of the issues affecting veterans who have served since 9/11 . One such solider is Jake Wood who served as Marine Corps squad leader in Iraq and a sniper in Afghanistan. Back home, the Medal of Valor recipient has founded Team Rubicon, a nonprofit organization which is now working on veteran reintegration projects. 'Whether they have a job or not, there’s an opportunity for organizations like Team Rubicon, like The Mission Continues, to provide veterans with perhaps that sense of purpose, that sense of mission they had while they had the uniform on,' he told ABC News. 'The work doesn’t end when the last troop leaves Afghanistan. That’s only really when the work begins.'","The former president claims PTSD is an injury, not a disorder, which can be treated .

"There are houses for cold climates, which are designed to keep in the precious warmth; there are houses for hot climates where architecture allows for air to sweep through and keep inhabitants cool. However, until now, the two were difficult to combine. But this new incredible folding house is able to, in the words of its creators, 'metamorphosize' into eight different configurations to adapt to seasonal, meteorological and even astronomical conditions. Autobots, transform! This computer generated graphic shows the incredible concept for a house that can 'metamorphosize' into eight different configurations depending on the weather . For example, in the summer plan, bedroom one faces east and watches the sun rise as its inhabitan wakes up. It can then rotate so that the user is constantly in sunlight, while the house generates energy through its solar panels. The revolutionary home is based on the work of an early 20th Century mathematician who discovered a way to dissect a square and rearrange its parts into an equilateral triangle. The flexibility of the house allows adaptation from winter to summer and day to night by literally moving inside itself. Thick heavy external walls unfold into internal walls allowing glass internal walls to become facades; doors can become windows, and vice versa. The layout consists of two bedrooms, an open-plan living room and a bathroom, but it too can be adapted to suit the needs of different living situations. Design: The revolutionary home is based on the work of an early 20th Century mathematician who discovered a way to dissect a square and rearrange its parts into an equilateral triangle . Adaptable: Thick heavy external walls unfold into internal walls allowing glass internal walls to become facades; doors can become windows, and vice versa . Living space: The layout consists of two bedrooms, an open-plan living room and a bathroom, but it too can be adapted to suit the needs of different living situations . The incredible house is the brainchild of British architects David Grunberg and Daniel Woolfson, who launched the D*Haus company to develop the concept. The shape-shifting home was first . conceived as part of Mr Grunberg's graduation project, for which he . designed a house that could withstand the extreme sub-Arctic . temperatures in Lap Land, a region infamous for its harsh weather. The pair's design, which they call D*Dynamic, is based on the work of English author and mathematician Henry Dudeney, a leading puzzle creator. In 1903 Dudeney invented a way to cut an equilateral triangle into four pieces that could be rearranged into a square, a conundrum he dubbed the 'Haberdasher's Puzzle'. The D*Dynamic house realises this mathematical curiousity as a solution to living in extreme climates. Sections would fold out on rails so interior partitions could become exterior walls in warm weather. The whole building could even rotate to follow the direction of the Sun throughout the day. In a release, D*Haus describe their house, which is yet to be built, as 'a product of an applied mathematical realisation'. 'The D*Haus Company is set to cause a revolution in architecture and design by transforming Dudeney’s idea from the conceptual, to the physical,' the release adds. 'Inspired by Dudeney’s logic puzzle, each D*Haus dwelling is capable of adapting to changing patterns of living in the future. 'D*Haus is continuing the journey that Dudeney began by breathing new life into a century-old concept; not only to define a space, but a lifestyle.' Henry Ernest Dudeney (April 10, 1857 – April 23, 1930) was an English author and mathematician who specialised in logic puzzles and mathematical games. He is known as one of the country's foremost creators of puzzles. Mathematical basis: Henry Dudeney's Haberdasher's Puzzle inspired the design of the house . Although Dudeney spent his career in the Civil Service, he continued to devise various problems and puzzles. Dudeney's first puzzle contributions were submissions to newspapers and magazines, often under the pseudonym of ""Sphinx."" Dudeney later contributed puzzles under his real name to publications such as The Weekly Dispatch, The Queen, Blighty, and Cassell's Magazine. For twenty years, he had a successful column, ""Perplexities"", in The Strand Magazine. One of Dudeney's most famous innovations was his 1903 success at solving the Haberdasher's Puzzle, which involved cutting an equilateral triangle into four pieces that can be rearranged to make a square. A remarkable feature of Dudeney's solution is that the each of the pieces can be hinged at one vertex, forming a chain that can be folded into the square or the original triangle. Two of the hinges bisect sides of the triangle, while the third hinge and the corner of the large piece on the base cut the base in the approximate ratio 0.982: 2: 1.018. Dudeney showed just such a model of the solution, made of polished mahogany with brass hinges, at a meeting of the Royal Society on May 17, 1905. He also published the first known crossnumber puzzle in 1926 and has been credited with inventing verbal arithmetic and discovering new applications of digital roots.","D*Haus concept can 'metamorphosize' into eight different configurations .

"Churchgoers are to be urged to take a stand against gay marriage by the leader of Roman Catholics in England and Wales. In a letter to be read from 2,500 pulpits during mass this Sunday, the Archbishop of Westminster will warn that David Cameron’s pledge to legalise homosexual marriage would threaten the true meaning of a sacred union. In a significant intervention in the gay marriage debate, the Most Reverend Vincent Nichols will urge the country’s five million Roman Catholics to sign petitions and lobby their MPs about the changes. Controversy: The letter by Reverend Nichols (left) argues marriage between a man and a woman is at the 'foundation of our society'. Lord Carey (right) said no one had the right to redefine the institution . The letter warns that plans to extend marriage to same-sex couples would be a ‘profoundly radical step’ that reduces it to a vague commitment between two people. The letter says the roots of marriage lie in human nature and the pattern of complementarity and fertility in the union are affirmed by many other religious traditions. It argues that matrimony is an expression of 'our fundamental humanity' and says: 'Neither the Church nor the State has the power to change this fundamental understanding of marriage itself.' It continues: 'Its status in law is the prudent fruit of experience, for the good of the spouses and the good of the family. 'In this way, society esteems the married couple as the source and guardians of the next generation. As an institution marriage is at the foundation of our society.' The text, which is co-signed by the RC Archbishop of Southwark, the Most Reverend Peter Smith, argues that marriage between a man and a woman is at the ‘foundation of our society’. In an article for the Daily Mail last month, Lord Carey, the former Archbishop of Canterbury, wrote: ‘Marriage precedes both the state and the church, and neither of these institutions have the right to redefine it in such a fundamental way.’ Backing: The Prime Minister is a strong supporter of plans to legalise same-sex marriage . The . last time the leadership of the Roman Catholic Church used a pastoral . letter to intervene on a political issue, during attempts to inflict . quotas on faith schools in 2007, the government climbed down within . days. The letter is expected to have a more . moderate tone than comments made at the weekend by Keith O’Brien, leader . of the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland, who described gay marriage . proposals as grotesque. Cardinal O’Brien insisted that the reforms would shame the United Kingdom in the eyes of the world. He said: ‘Since all the legal rights of marriage are already available to homosexual couples, it is clear this proposal is not about rights but rather is an attempt to redefine marriage at the behest of a small minority of activists. ‘If marriage can be redefined so that it no longer means a man and a woman but two men or two women, why stop there? Why not allow three men, or a woman and two men, to constitute a marriage, if they pledge their fidelity to one another?’ The Prime Minister is a strong supporter of plans to legalise same-sex marriage, which are also supported by the Lib Dems, and are set to be formally unveiled later this month. But the proposal has divided the Conservative Party and put Mr Cameron on a collision course with religious leaders. Prime Minister David Cameron’s official spokesman said: 'The Government has made clear its commitment to equality. 'We believe people should have the option of civil marriage, irrespective of sexual orientation.' He also said that the timing of the consultation had been chosen to allow legislation to be taken through Parliament before the general election planned for 2015. But he declined to speculate on the timetable for any Bill, telling reporters: 'We normally set out the timetable for legislation at the time of the Queen’s Speech and we do it session by session. 'We have purposefully set up this consultation with a timetable that would allow us to have that legislation in this Parliament.' Reverend Vincent Nichols' letters warns that plans to extend marriage to same-sex couples would be a 'profoundly radical step' Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg told ITV’s The Agenda: 'I think marriage is defined surely by two people who love each other and want to make a commitment to each other. 'Depriving same-sex couples of that public display in this day and age, I think most people think ""Come on, let’s move with the times"".' Civil partnerships were introduced for gay couples in 2005 but by law they cannot be referred to as marriages. The clergymen are the latest to denounce the Government’s backing for marriage to include gay couples. In January, the Anglican Archbishop of York, Dr John Sentamu, insisted governments did not have the moral authority to redefine marriage. If the law is changed, Britain will become the seventh European country to recognise same-sex marriage, after the Netherlands, Belgium, Sweden, Spain, Portugal and Norway. The Catholic archbishops’ letter also appears to challenge Equalities Minister Lynne Featherstone’s remarks last week that the church does not ‘own’ marriage and that the state was entitled to make changes to the institution. ‘The reasons given by our Government for wanting to change the definition of marriage are those of equality and discrimination,’ the letter says. ‘But our present law does not discriminate unjustly when it requires both a man and a woman for marriage. It simply recognises and protects the distinctive nature of marriage. ‘Changing the legal definition of marriage would be a profoundly radical step. Its consequences should be taken seriously now. ‘There would be no recognition of the complementarity of male and female or that marriage is intended for the procreation and education of children. ‘The roots of the institution of marriage lie in our nature. This pattern is affirmed by many other religious traditions – understood as a lifelong commitment between a man and a woman.’",Archbishop of Westminster will warn legalising gay marriage 'threatens true meaning of a sacred union'
"The BBC's Editorial Compliance unit has blasted its flagship Today programme over its failure to provide balance on a debate on climate change. The show's editorial team was found to have given minority views and opinions 'equal footing' to those of the scientific consensus. The programme, broadcast in February during the major flooding crisis featured climate change scientist Sir Brian Hoskins from Imperial College London who was debating the issue with a founder of the Global Warming Policy Foundation, which is sceptical as to its impact. The interview by Justin Webb, pictured, was criticised for giving an 'equal footing' to minority views on climate change during the Today programme broadcast in February during the major flood crisis . The main complaint for made by former Green Party councillor and low-energy specialist Chit Chong who said the BBC acted irresponsibly in allowing the debate to consider the existence of climate change. Speaking today Mr Chong said: 'Dismissing climate change today is the same as trying to argue that smoking is not harmful. The science has proved the existence of climate change. 'By broadcasting programmes that question the existence of climate change, the BBC is confusing people, allowing them to deny what is actually happening. It is not responsible journalism. 'Politicians look at the public mood when considering policy and if sections of the population are sceptical to climate change, the government's policy decisions will reflect that.' A BBC . spokesperson said: 'The BBC is committed to impartial and balanced . coverage of climate change. We accept that there is broad scientific . agreement on the issue and reflect this accordingly. 'Across . our programmes the number of scientists and academics who support the . mainstream view far outweighs those who disagree with it.' Ceri Thomas, the then editor of the Today programme admitted they should have 'clarified in the audience's minds the ideological background to the arguments' Former Chancellor of the Exchequer Lord Lawson appeared on the show as a founder of the Global Warming Policy Foundation. During . the show, Lord Lawson claimed that 2013 was 'unusually quiet' for . tropical storms and that 'nobody knows' about the true extent of climate . change. Lord Lawson said that investing in green energy was a waste of money and those resources should be focused on improving defences against bad weather. Several listeners complained to the BBC's Editorial Compliance unit who, according to The Independent, will criticise the show's approach in a report due to be released later today. According to Fraser Steel, head of the unit: 'Minority opinions and sceptical views should not be treated as if it were on an equal footing with the scientific consensus. 'Lord Lawson's views are not supported by the evidence from computer modelling and scientific research and I don't believe this was made sufficiently clear to the audience. 'I do not believe it was made sufficiently clear that Lord Lawson's views on climate change are not supported by the majority of climate scientists, and should not be regarded as carrying equal weight to those of experts such as Sir Brian Hopkins.' Today's then editor Ceri Thomas said: 'Whilst there may be a scientific consensus about global warming - that it is happening and largely man-made - there is no similar agreement about what should be done to tackle it; whether money should be spent, for example, on cutting carbon emissions or would be better used adapting our defences to the changing climate. 'Lord Lawson is not a scientist, but as a former Chancellor of the Exchequer is well qualified to comment on the economic arguments, which are a legitimate area for debate. 'We believe there has to be space in the BBC's coverage where scientific consensus meets reasonable argument about the policy implications of that consensus view. That said we do accept that we could have offered a clearer description of the sceptical position taken by Lord Lawson and the Global Warming Policy Foundation in the introduction. That would have clarified in the audience's minds the ideological background to the arguments.'","Today programme gave 'undue prominence' to climate change opponent .

"A suicide bomber this morning rammed a small sedan into a mini-bus carrying foreign aviation workers to Kabul airport, killing 12 people. The bomber has been named by Afghan insurgents as Fatima, 22, who was reportedly wearing a suicide vest and blew herself up on a large avenue northwest of the city centre near the airport. Islamist group Hezb-e-Islami claimed responsibility for the attack, with spokesman Haroon Zarghoon saying it was launched in retaliation for a film mocking the Prophet Mohammad. Scroll down for video . Devastation: Afghan security officials guard the site of the suicide bomb attack near Kabul Airport today . Abandoned possessions: Afghan security personnel carry bags belonging to foreign contractors . Carnage: Security staff inspect the scene. Islamist group Hezb-e-Islami has claimed responsibility for the blast . Horrific sight: Bodies were seen lying by the mangled mini-van, which was thrown at least 50 metres . The criminal director for the Kabul . police department, Mohammad Zahir, said eight South Africans believed to be foreign . aviation company workers died in the . blast and ten Afghan bystanders were wounded. The other person killed was believed to be Afghan - possibly a driver or translator for the group. The explosion, which went off in front of a petrol station, was so powerful it hurled the mini-bus about 50 metres (46 yards). Reports from the scene said at least six . bodies lay next to the destroyed mini-van. Eight Afghan workers were also said to have been injured in the blast. Wreckage: An Afghan security officer investigates at the site of the attack, which is thought to have been carried out by a 22-year-old woman wearing a suicide vest . Investigation: Nato's soldiers and Afghan forces inspect the scene after the latest outbreak of violence . Putting out the flames: Afghanistan firefighters pour water on the remains of the Sedan that carried the bomber along a major highway leading to the airport . Interior Ministry spokesman Sediq Sediqi confirmed the death toll and said tests were being carried out to determine if the suicide bomber was a woman. An eyewitness at the scene said he was waiting for a bus to go to work at 6.45am when he saw a small white sedan ram into the mini-bus. 'The explosion was so powerful and loud that I could not hear anything for ten minutes,' said Abdullah Shah, a teacher waiting at a bus stop. 'It was early and there wasn't much traffic.' The bombing came a day after hundreds of Afghans burned cars and threw rocks at a U.S. military base in the capital in a demonstration against the anti-Islam film. One police vehicle was burned by the mob before they finally dispersed around midday yesterday. Proximity: The bomb blast happened near Kabul airport, killing nine and injuring eight others (file picture) Hizb-i-Islami is led by former warlord Gulbuddin Hekmatyar. The group has recently sought to participate in a so-far fruitless peace and reconciliation effort led by President Hamid Karzai. As part of the group's effort, it offered a peace plan that called for a broad-based government. Hizb-i-Islami is a radical Islamist militia that has thousands of fighters and followers across the north and east of Afghanistan. Its 65-year-old leader is a former Afghan prime minister and one-time U.S. ally who is now listed as a terrorist by Washington. Devastating: The incident was the first reported suicide car bombing ever to be carried out by a woman in Afghanistan . The Taliban have also threatened to increase their attacks against foreign targets to avenge the controversial film. Taliban fighters last week attacked a large British base in southern Afghanistan, killed two U.S. Marines and destroyed six fighter jets. Nato forces killed 14 insurgents and captured another who participated in the attack. In a torrent of violence blamed on the . film last week, the U.S. ambassador to Libya and three other Americans . were killed in an attack in Benghazi. Shocking violence: The bomber was driving a Sedan and blew it up beside a minivan carrying foreigners on a major highway leading to Kabul's international airport . Widespread anger: Afghan police arrive at the scene of the attack, which was apparently launched in retaliation for a film mocking the Prophet Mohammad . U.S. and other foreign . embassies were stormed in cities in Asia, Africa and the Middle East by . furious Muslims. At least nine other people were killed. The news will raise fears that anger . over the film will feed into deteriorating security as the U.S. and other . Western countries try to protect their forces from a rash of so-called . insider attacks by Afghan colleagues. The U.S. has sent ships, extra troops and special forces to protect U.S. interests and citizens in the Middle East, while a number of its embassies have evacuated staff and are on high alert for trouble. Despite Obama's efforts early in his tenure to improve relations with the Arab and Muslim world, the violence adds to a host of problems including the continued US military involvement in Afghanistan, Iran's nuclear programme, the Syrian civil war and the fall-out from the Arab Spring revolts.

"Energy companies are making £101 profit a year from every family – an astonishing 1,000 per cent increase in just five years. Industry regulator Ofgem yesterday announced a full-blown inquiry into the energy market as it revealed that the profit figure had doubled from £48 last year, despite a fall of up to 38 per cent in wholesale gas and electricity prices. Ofgem confirmed that the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) will investigate the energy market and whether the major players are taking advantage of price movements to unfairly boost profits. Scroll down for video . Industry regulator Ofgem yesterday announced a full-blown inquiry into the energy market as it revealed that the profit figure had doubled from £48 last year, despite a fall of up to 38 per cent in wholesale gas and electricity prices. The . regulator has been highly critical of the ‘big six’ companies – British . Gas, Npower, SSE, EDF, Eon and Scottish Power – for not passing on the . fall in wholesale prices to customers. Ofgem . chief executive Dermot Nolan said: ‘Now is the right time to refer the . energy market to the CMA for the benefit of consumers. ‘The CMA investigation offers an important opportunity to clear the air. The energy market is also going to change rapidly over the next few years. ‘A CMA investigation should ensure . there are no barriers to stop effective competition bearing down on . prices and delivering the benefits of these changes to consumers.’ Ofgem’s . figures highlight a steady and painful rise in energy bills and profit . margins over the past five years – a time when some consumers have faced . a nightmare choice between heating and eating. In 2009, the average annual wholesale cost of energy was £756 per household and the average bill was £1,282. Once other costs were taken into account, this left the energy companies with an average profit per customer of £9. A year ago, the profit margin was up to £48. The latest figure shows the average wholesale cost has fallen even further to £612, yet the average bill has jumped again to £1,346, taking the average profit margin per household to £101 – a 1,000 per cent increase in just five years. Ofgem said the price of gas for next-day delivery was at its lowest level since September 2010 and was 38 per cent down on last year. Prices for electricity were 23 per cent lower than in June 2013. Energy firms, however, buy most of their gas and electricity at long-term prices. These have also fallen over the past few months, but not as dramatically. The executive director of consumer group, Which?, Richard Lloyd, said: ‘This is a watershed moment for the broken energy market and millions of people struggling to cope with spiralling bills.‘The investigation must leave no stone unturned.’ Citizens Advice chief executive Gillian Guy added: ‘This investigation is long overdue and needs to lift the floorboards on the energy market and take a long, hard look at why it fails consumers.’ Labour MP John Robertson called for massive fines if any of the companies are found guilty of rigging the market and bills. He said: ‘The tens of millions in fines should go straight back into the pockets of consumers who have been ripped off all these years.’ Angela Knight, the chief executive of the industry’s trade body Energy UK, said: ‘The competition inquiry will allow us to put to bed the toxic debate and shine a light on the progress the industry has already made.’","Ofgem yesterday announced a full-blown inquiry into the energy market .

"The Earth's largest expanse of water isn't on the surface of the planet, but instead is buried deep within its mantle, researchers have found. They claim the ingredients for water are bound up in deep rocks, and scientists believe the discovery may represent the planet's largest water reservoir. Deep pockets of magma were found using seismic waves beneath North America, and this magma is said to be a clear sign of water. The presence of liquid water on the surface is what makes our 'blue planet' habitable, and scientists have long been trying to figure out just how much water may be cycling between Earth's surface and interior reservoirs through plate tectonics. They now believe reservoirs 400 miles under the surface hold the key. This water is not in a form familiar to us -- it is not liquid, ice or vapor. This fourth form is water trapped inside the molecular structure of the minerals in the mantle rock. The weight of 250 miles of solid rock creates such high pressure, along with temperatures above 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit, that a water molecule splits to form a hydroxyl radical (OH), which can be bound into a mineral's crystal structure. So far, researchers claim they only have evidence the water sits beneath the U.S. But they plan to carry out further tests to see if it wraps around the entire planet. The presence of liquid water on the surface is what makes our 'blue planet' habitable, and scientists have long been trying to figure out just how much water may be cycling between Earth's surface and interior reservoirs through plate tectonics. Northwestern geophysicist Steve Jacobsen and University of New Mexico seismologist Brandon Schmandt say the findings, to be published June 13 in the journal Science, will aid scientists in understanding how the Earth formed, what its current composition and inner workings are and how much water is trapped in mantle rock. 'Geological processes on the Earth's surface, such as earthquakes or erupting volcanoes, are an expression of what is going on inside the Earth, out of our sight,' said Jacobsen, a co-author of the paper. 'I think we are finally seeing evidence for a whole-Earth water cycle, which may help explain the vast amount of liquid water on the surface of our habitable planet. 'Scientists have been looking for this missing deep water for decades.' Scientists have long speculated that water is trapped in a rocky layer of the Earth's mantle located between the lower mantle and upper mantle, at depths between 250 miles and 410 miles. Jacobsen and Schmandt are the first to provide direct evidence that there may be water in this area of the mantle, known as the 'transition zone,' on a regional scale. The region extends across most of the interior of the United States. A diamond-anvil cell (approximately 5 mm across). Between the tips of these gem diamonds, heating experiments on deep-mantle minerals were carried out at conditions similar to 660 km depth, or about 400 miles below the surface. Schmandt, an assistant professor of geophysics at the University of New Mexico, uses seismic waves from earthquakes to investigate the structure of the deep crust and mantle. Jacobsen, an associate professor of Earth and planetary sciences at Northwestern's Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences, used observations in the laboratory to make predictions about geophysical processes occurring far beyond our direct observation. The study combined Jacobsen's lab experiments in which he studies mantle rock under the simulated high pressures of 400 miles below the Earth's surface with Schmandt's observations using vast amounts of seismic data from the USArray, a dense network of more than 2,000 seismometers across the United States. This image shows a high-pressure diamond cell of the mineral hydrous ringwoodite, or blue crystal. When heated with a laser, a dehydration reaction occured and ringwoodite was transformed to higher pressure minerals. That dehydration reaction . was observed beneath North America by using seismic waves . 'Melting of rock at this depth is remarkable because most melting in the mantle occurs much shallower, in the upper 50 miles,' said Schmandt, a co-author of the paper. 'If there is a substantial amount of H2O in the transition zone, then some melting should take place in areas where there is flow into the lower mantle, and that is consistent with what we found.' If just one percent of the weight of mantle rock located in the transition zone is H2O, that would be equivalent to nearly three times the amount of water in our oceans, the researchers said. Schmandt and Jacobsen's findings build on a discovery reported in March in the journal Nature in which scientists discovered a piece of the mineral ringwoodite inside a diamond brought up from a depth of 400 miles by a volcano in Brazil. That tiny piece of ringwoodite - the only sample in existence from within the Earth - contained a surprising amount of water bound in solid form in the mineral. Fragments of the blue-colored mineral called ringwoodite, synthesized in the laboratory. This . mineral is thought to exist in the mantle at depths between about 500 and 700 km depth, and act act as a sponge for water . 'Whether or not this unique sample is representative of the Earth's interior composition is not known, however,' Jacobsen said. 'Now we have found evidence for extensive melting beneath North America at the same depths corresponding to the dehydration of ringwoodite, which is exactly what has been happening in my experiments.' For the study reported in Science, Jacobsen subjected his synthesized ringwoodite to conditions around 400 miles below the Earth's surface and found it forms small amounts of partial melt when pushed to these conditions. 'When a rock with a lot of H2O moves from the transition zone to the lower mantle it needs to get rid of the H2O somehow, so it melts a little bit,' Schmandt said. 'This is called dehydration melting.' 'Once the water is released, much of it may become trapped there in the transition zone,' Jacobsen added.","Ingredients for water are bound up in rock deep in the Earth's mantle .

"President Barack Obama said denying climate change is like arguing the moon is made of cheese, as he issued a call to action on global warming to Saturday's graduates of the University of California, Irvine. Obama issued the call to the tens of thousands gathered at Angel Stadium even though he said Congress 'is full of folks who stubbornly and automatically reject the scientific evidence' and say climate change is a hoax or fad. Obama said others duck the question. Commencement: President Obama spoke at the commencement address at University of California, Irvine, on Saturday . 'They say, ""Hey, look, I'm not a scientist."" And I'll translate that for you: what that really means is, ""I know that manmade climate change really is happening but if I admit it, I'll be run out of town by a radical fringe that thinks climate science is a liberal plot,'"" he said. Obama's address to about 8,000 graduates from the Orange County campus comes two weeks after he announced a contentious plan to dramatically cut pollution from power plants. Obama also used the address to announce a $1 billion competitive fund for communities who have experienced natural disasters to rebuild and prepare for the impact of extreme weather. He described a political system consumed by 'small things' but said Americans should be determined to do 'big things' like addressing climate change, despite the type of opposition he faces from Congress. 'There's going to be a stubborn status quo and people determined to stymie your efforts to bring about change. There are going to be people who say you can't do something. There are going to be people who say you shouldn't bother trying. I've got some experience with this myself,' Obama said. Optimistic: Obama told the graduates they have a reason to be optimistic about their futures in America . 'It's pretty rare that you'll encounter somebody who says the problem you're trying to solve simply doesn't exist. When President Kennedy set us on a course to the moon, there were a number of people who made a serious case that it wouldn't be worth it,' he continued. 'But nobody ignored the science. I don't remember anybody saying the moon wasn't there or that it was made of cheese,' Obama said. The president said today's young dreamers are fed a steady diet of cynicism but argued they have a right to be optimistic. 'Consider this: since the time most of you graduated from high school, fewer Americans are at war,' Obama said. 'More have health insurance. More are graduating from college. Our businesses have added more than nine million new jobs. And the number of states where you're free to marry who you love has more than doubled. That's just some of the progress you've seen.' Janet:  The president sat with former Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, who left the Obama administration to be the University of California president . While in Orange County, Obama also raised money for the Democratic National Committee at a closed-door fundraiser at the Laguna Beach home of Getty oil heiress Anne Earhart. About 25 people paid up to $32,400 to participate in a roundtable discussion with the president. He's spending the rest of the Father's Day weekend on vacation at the Rancho Mirage home of White House decorator Michael Smith and his partner, U.S. Ambassador to Spain James Costos.","Obama gave the commencement address at UC Irvine on Saturday .

"It sounds a little like something Captain Mainwaring might have dreamed up. But don’t panic – not all the fires that raged across Britain during Hitler’s bombing onslaught were homes and factories ablaze. For a cunning plan to build decoy towns and set them alight bamboozled the Luftwaffe into believing they had hit their targets. Burning: A Starfish basket fire is pictured in an unknown location. The Starfish sites - which got their name from the initials 'SF', standing for 'Special Fire' sites - were intended to simulate burning cities during the Blitz . Decoy: A boiling oil fire is pictured at an unidentified Starfish site. Starfish sites were first created in December 1940 and received five blitz attempts just that month . The so-called Starfish towns, named . after initials that actually stood for ‘Special Fire’ sites, were . commissioned to avoid the kind of disaster that destroyed Coventry . during the Blitz. The dummy towns were sited miles away . from communities and cities likely to come under attack. As soon as the . first wave of German bombers lit up or attacked a real target, emergency . teams raced to extinguish the flames – then lit the decoy fires. The aim was to convince the second wave this was the target and to fool them into dropping bombs harmlessly on the decoy site. The ruse was developed by Colonel John Turner, a respected engineer and retired Air Ministry officer. But the construction, deployment and . ignition of the fires may have been more akin to a stroke of Dad’s . Army-style genius. Tanks containing paraffin or diesel were placed on . top of 20ft towers, arranged to resemble rows of buildings or industrial . complexes. Ready for action: An anonymous Starfish site is pictured. Liverpool, Bristol and Nottingham were protected by the sites - with the German pilots thinking that a Starfish site 14 miles away from the latter was Derby . A valve that operated like a toilet . flush was opened to release the fuel on to burning coal, creating an . instant blaze and engulfing the area in black smoke. Then the fire was flushed with water . to send a column of steam into the night sky. Result: a rather . convincing mock-up of a bombing raid that hit its target. Dummy sites were a key tactic to preserving important transport hubs and cities in Britain during the bombings of World War Two. There were around 230 dummy airfields in the UK and 400 dummy urban and industrial sites. Dummy railway marshalling yards and docks also existed in an attempt to trick the Luftwaffe. By the end of the war there were 237 . Starfish sites protecting 81 cities, factories and other potential . targets. Official figures reveal that 730 bombing raids were diverted . to these dummy targets. Among them was one built several miles outside Derby, home of Rolls-Royce aero engine production. Middlesbrough, Bristol, Nottingham, Portsmouth and Cardiff were some of the other major cities protected. Starfish towns were among several decoy projects used to dupe the enemy during the Second World War. Other masterstrokes included building depots of cardboard tanks, or planting landing lights to look like airfields.

"Accused: Timothy Henson allegedly shot dead his mother-in-law's husband and ex-husband on Sunday . A alleged gunman is facing a murder charge after shooting dead his mother-in-law's 19-year-old husband as well as her 70-year-old ex-husband, it was reported today. Timothy Henson kidnapped his mother-in-law and own wife on Sunday evening after a family dispute following a beach trip near Bandon, Oregon. After an argument in a Chevy Blazer, it is alleged that Henson, 43, fired up to three shots, hitting his wife, mother-in-laws husband and her ex-partner. George Micheaux III, 19, died at the scene, while Milton Chester Leach, 70, who was shot outside the vehicle, was removed from life support on Monday. It was reported today that the alleged double killing unfolded after the relatives had spent a day visiting beaches before traveling on Highway 101 south on Bandon. Henson allegedly fired one to three shots inside the vehicle, with a bullet hitting his wife, Vallena Tuell, 30, in the forearm. Henson was arraigned on Tuesday afternoon on charges of aggravated murder, assault and kidnapping . The family lived together in Myrtle Creek, near Interstate 5 about 90 miles east of the crime scene. Henson and his wife lived in the house, the Micheauxs have a trailer on the property and Leach, the ex-husband of Ruth Sherrie Micheaux, stayed in the garage. The group of five are said to have stayed in a motel on Saturday night before heading to the beach on Sunday. Gun drama: The quintet had been on a beach trip near Bandon, Oregon when Henson allegedly opened fire in the back of a vehicle . Coos County district attorney R. Paul Frasier said Leach had terminal lung cancer, and the weekend getaway was a chance for him to enjoy the coast for perhaps a final time. Tuell was treated at a local hospital for her forearm injury and released. It's unclear when Leach and Ruth Micheaux, 47, got divorced.

"Universities are having to employ teams of social media experts because students are no longer using email . Universities are being forced to employ Twitter and Facebook experts in order to communicate effectively with students claiming they don't respond to emails anymore. Exeter University say they now have a social media team on call 24 hours a day, responding to inquiries from students with other institutions adopting similar set-ups. Tech-savvy youngsters armed with the latest smartphones no longer bother with emails - which are viewed as slow and outdated - preferring to tweet requests for help or advice instead. And unlike emails where they can often wait days for a reply, with Twitter the students expect an immediate response. A spokesman for the University of Exeter said: 'Just as sending a letter is no longer the most efficient way of communicating with students, social media has eclipsed email in many respects to become their preferred method of getting in touch with us. 'We are a student-led institution and aim to respond to their needs in the most convenient format for them – be it Twitter, Facebook or SMS. As new technologies and platforms emerge, we will adjust our means of communication to reflect them. 'Another benefit to engaging in this way is that other students who may have the same question can see the response.' Twitter . can be used to create lively interactive forums for individual courses . where student's can discuss and debate the latest issues and share . reading recommendations. On call: Exeter University has a social media team available 24 hours a day to respond to Twitter and Facebook requests . Twitter . accounts have been compulsory for PR students at the University of . Greenwich, for several years, where they are viewed as an essential tool . for keeping up to date with the syllabus. But . the technology can also mean extra pressure for tutors, as students are . now able to Tweet criticism of boring lectures and uninspiring staff. Research . on students' online usage published last year found that laptops are . rapidly being replaced by smartphones and tablets as the primary device . for accessing the internet. Exeter University Vice Chancellor Sir Steven Smith said students expect an immediate response to their tweets . The Global Marketing Trends report also found that 75 per cent of European students admitted to using Twitter 'all the time' with the figure for Facebook even higher at 81 per cent. Birmingham university has responded by creating a virtual learning environment called Canvas offering digital quizzes and recordings of lectures which students access can access using their phones. Katie Connoly, Birmingham University's digital marketing communications manager said she believes students have turned to social media because it is faster than email. She said: 'We’ve noticed a big increase in social media usage over the past 18 months. We’ve gained around 65 per cent of our audiences on Facebook and Twitter since August 2012. 'Engaging with our students on social media is hugely rewarding. You get a real sense of community on our social media channels that reflects our real-life campus community. 'And although students have high expectations on social media, they are often very grateful to us if we can help them in any way. 'The range of inquiries we get is huge – from prospective students looking for course information to current students wanting to know their exam timetables.'","Exeter University now has social media team on call 24 hours a day .

"Murder detectives in Russia have discovered the bodies of two women found underneath a 'Free Pussy Riot' slogan thought to have daubed in their blood on a wall. The message backing the recently-jailed Russian female punk band was found on an apartment wall above the bodies of a woman, 76, and her 38-year-old daughter in Kazan, western Russia. The two women, who are said to have shared a home in the city, are thought to have died from stab wounds between August 24 and 26. Scroll down for video .

Gruesome: The apartment block in the city of Kazan, Russia, where the bodies of the two women, aged 76 and 38, were found . An investigative committee in Tatarstan said their bodies were discovered on Wednesday. The murder probe comes a fortnight after female punk band members Maria Alekhina, Yekaterina Samutsevich, and Nadezhda Tolokonnikova were jailed for two years for a protest against Vladimir Putin. The trio were found guilty of hooliganism after performing a song critical of the Russian President in one of the Russian Orthodox Church's most important cathedrals. An investigator cautioned that the killer was possibly trying to mislead police by drawing attention to supporters of the punk protesters. It did not provide the women’s names and did not reveal details about their occupations or whether they had any connection to the band. Russian tabloid Lifenews quoted an unnamed investigator as saying that the bodies were disfigured by multiple stab wounds. A young woman enters the apartment block in Kazan where the two females were found dead, as police continued their investigations today (right) The jailed band members’ attorney said on Twitter that 'what happened in Kazan is horrible,' calling the case 'either a horrendous provocation or a psychopathic' case. 'I am sorry that some freaks are using Pussy Riot’s band name,' Nikolai Polozov was further quoted by Interfax as saying. In mid-August, a Moscow court . sentenced three band members to two years in jail for performing a 'punk . prayer' against President Vladimir Putin at a Moscow cathedral in . February.

An . investigator in Kazan told a Russian news agency that the murderer was . trying to cover up the crime by attributing the murder to the band’s . supporters. The criminal 'was trying to avoid suspicion' by misleading police, Andrey Sheptitsky told RBK Daily. Kristina Potupchik, a pro-Putin blogger and former spokeswoman for a militant youth group known for its violent pranks against opposition and Kremlin critics, said in a post that the band's supporters 'will not get away' after the killing. She also compared them to U.S. mass murderer Charles Manson, who also used the blood of his victims to write on the walls of their houses.

"Criticism: Right Rev Thomas Burns has accused parishioners of using 'delaying tactics' in opposing the new church . A furious bishop has hit out at his own parishioners for attempting to save a 140-year-old church from demolition. The Right Rev Thomas Burns, Bishop of Menevia, has accused protesters of 'delaying tactics' after their campaign held up plans for a new church in Aberystwyth. Campaigners are fighting to keep Our Lady of the Angels and St Winefride open, but Ceredigion County Council have already approved plans by the Diocese to build a new church, presbytery and hall along with a housing development. Plans to demolish St Winifride's . Church and the neighbouring presbytery and hall, which are in a poor . state of repair, and replace them with blocks of flats have still not . been approved because of objections by parishioners and others. The . Right Rev Burns said he might have to close St Winefride's - built in . 1874 - down for health and safety reasons, leaving Aberystwyth with no . Catholic church at all. Bishop . Burns stressed that it was now 'make or break' time for the parish and . he urged worshippers to tell protesters 'to back down'. He said the plans for a new church in Penparcau were dependant on the sale of the St Winefride's site. 'We . have spent a great deal of time presenting and re-presenting . applications for planning permission,' he said in his message to . parishioners. 'But what has . been most frustrating is the time and energy that has been taken up with . responding to a small number of objectors, who seemed to be speaking on . your behalf but have had no mandate to do so. Closure: Rev Burns has threatened to close St Winefride's Church down over health and safety grounds . 'In our opinion, they have caused setbacks and costs out of all proportion imaginable. 'Throughout these last few years, the structure of St Winefride's Church has continued to weaken. It is in such a bad state that our insurers are assessing whether or not they can continue to provide insurance cover. 'I may soon have to make a decision about closing the church to prevent risks to life and limb.' He urged all parishioners to sign a form agreeing to the demolition of St Winefride's Church and send it to the county council. But objectors to the plans say the present church can be upgraded and the presbytery can be replaced and they asked fellow worshipers to send a letter to the council objecting to the proposals. Row: Parishioners have claimed they simply want a 'rational, sensible debate' on the location of a new church in Aberystwyth . In a letter of response to the bishop, they said: 'Objectors feel no shame whatsoever in acting according to their conscience in seeking a rational, sensible debate on the location of the Catholic Church in Aberystwyth. 'They certainly are disappointed by the bishop's highly emotive tone, which serves only to instil panic, division and fear. 'The supposedly delaying tactics attributed to 'a small number of objectors' have actually been attempts by loyal parishioners to engage the diocese in open, rational debate about the future of St Winefride's. 'The extra costs claimed to have resulted from this can be laid at the door of the diocese for refusing to do this by not making any structural reports fully available for inspection by the parishioners. 'They are expected to believe that the apparently solid building in which they attend mass is about to fall down about their ears.'","Right Rev Thomas Burns accuses parishioners of 'delaying tactics' in their opposition of new church .

"A university professor has 'confessed' to killing his ex-girlfriend and her mother and daubing 'Free Pussy Riot' above their bodies in an effort to mislead police, detectives claim. Russian police arrested 38-year-old Igor Danilevsky after the 76-year-old mother and 38-year-old daughter were found dead in their apartment in Kazan, western Russia, last week. The slogan was scrawled in English on the wall above their bodies, which had multiple stab wounds, according to investigators. Scroll down for video . Suspect: Igor Danilevsky hides his face as he attends Vakhitovsky Court, Kazan . Red herring: The university professor 'admitted' he had daubed the slogan on the wall to mislead police over the double murder . Controversy: Pussy Riot members Maria Alekhina, . Yekaterina Samutsevich, and Nadezhda Tolokonnikova were sentenced to two years' jail for hooliganism earlier this month . Danilevsky apparently stabbed . the younger victim after a disagreement over a planned trip between the . two, and killed her mother when she rushed into the room to help. The professor, who works at a Kazan university, wrote the slogan and stole the . victims' money and mobile phones to make it appear that someone else . committed the crime, authorities said. Police said Danilevsky was a former classmate of the daughter and had been stringing her along after she agreed to him help pay off his debts by borrowing hundreds of thousands of roubles (tens of thousands of pounds) from banks. The suspect, who lives with his parents, allegedly said he had promised to marry the 38-year-old and to take her on holiday. He then grabbed a knife and killed her during a quarrel after he told her the trip was off, he is said to have told the police. After murdering her mother too, he disfigured both women's face and bodies with the knife, before writing on the wall 'to draw suspicion away from himself and portray it as a ritual killing', the regional Interior Ministry said.

"A magistrate issued a heartfelt plea to a cannabis grower urging him to stay away from the drug – after revealing it killed her brother. Yvonne Davies gave Christopher Duncan, 55, the stark warning as she sentenced him to 200 hours’ unpaid work for growing the class B drug. The 65-year-old chairman of the bench told of the ‘living hell’ her family went through when her brother Glen Harding died from an addiction to cannabis. Duncan had appeared before Manchester magistrates after pleading guilty to the production of cannabis. Heartfelt: Magistrate Yvonne Davies said she felt no regrets in speaking out about the dangers of cannabis while sentencing an offender . Police found six mature plants and 18 seedlings in the conservatory of his home in Ancoats, Manchester. Mr Harding killed himself aged 39 after becoming a cannabis addict and developing schizophrenia and depression. Mrs Davies told Duncan: ‘It was a . horrendous time for the family. Cannabis is serious. It puddles the . brain apart from anything else. You have got to stop using it so jack it . in.’ Mr Harding, who died in 1997, was a successful technical draughtsman before falling prey to addiction. Mrs Davies said: ‘He was a very caring and clever person but he had this addiction. Tragic: Glen Harding became addicted to cannabis and threw himself into a canal in 1984 aged 34 . ‘At first he would just smoke it at weekends and the family knew about it but we weren’t happy at all. ‘We tried to discuss it with him on a few occasions but he would just brush off our concerns saying that it wasn’t dangerous. ‘But we noticed a change when he . started smoking it more than just at weekends.’ Mr Harding began using . the drug on a daily basis and, two years before his death, suffered an . epileptic seizure at his workplace in Warrington. He was immediately sent home and eventually lost his job after bosses became aware of his addiction. Mrs Davies said Mr Harding could not cope with unemployment and so smoked more cannabis, eventually developing depression. She said: ‘We noticed a  definite . change in his  personality as he would get angry and very anxious. He . was trying to hide it from us but we all knew what was going on and were . hoping that he would stop.’ Mr Harding went on to develop . schizophrenia and, following a row with his parents one night, stormed . out with the family dog – which returned on its own, soaking wet, . several hours later. His body was found in the canal at . Lock Lane, Partington, by a walker ten days later. Mrs Davies, who lives . in Partington, Manchester, said: ‘People say cannabis is not a big deal . but to me it is enormous. ‘It can absolutely ruin your life and I would urge youngsters to think long and hard before taking it.’ ‘When Glen’s body was found, it had been a living hell for the family.’ The part-time magistrate, who is also . a mental health counsellor and psychotherapist, said she had no regrets . about speaking out – and said it is not the first time she has used her . story as a warning. ‘When I tell people about what happened, some look at me like I’ve got two heads but one woman defendant burst into tears. ‘If I can stop one family going through what I went through it will be worth it.’ Marjorie Wallace, of mental health . charity SANE, said: ‘While some people can take cannabis without lasting . damage, there is a significant minority for whom the drug can trigger . psychotic episodes of paranoia and delusions. ‘While we don’t know who  is vulnerable, the risks to  the mind of taking  cannabis should never be underestimated.’ Warning: Mrs Davies had been sentencing a convicted cannabis grower at Manchester Magistrates Court when she issued the personal warning .","Magistrate Yvonne Davies's brother died from cannabis addiction in 1984 .

"Married comedy legend Bill Cosby broke up with a 'longtime' mistress and decided to stop womanizing after suffering with a bout of middle-aged angst, a new book claims. The 77-year-old entertainer has publicly admitted to cheating on Camille, his wife of 50 years and mother of his five children. However, a new biography, Cosby: His Life and Times, by Mark Whitaker, details the full extent of his infidelity - and tells how the star invited the girlfriend and her MOM out to dinner following the break-up. Scroll down for video . 50 Years together: Bill and Camille Cosby's 50-year marriage has weathered storms, including the star's infidelity and the murder of their only son Ennis in January 1997. The couple are pictured in 2002 . Before making his debut as doting dad, Dr Heathcliff Hutxtable on The Cosby Show in September 1984, then aged 47, the star is said to have decided to cut back on his womanizing. The book also tells how the groundbreaking sitcom was borne out of Cosby's real family life and his tales as a father of five - and how he struggled after turning 40. In an excerpt from the book published in The Hollywood Reporter; it reveals how Cosby - married to Camille since 1964 - was forced to come to grips with the 'frustrations of being a . middle-aged man and father'. It reads: 'In a comic essay for Ebony, Cosby even . talked about how aging had affected his roving eye for women.' '""One of . the most important things when you turn 40 is that you weigh things . thusly,' he wrote. 'You look at the enjoyment you may get from a given . activity, and then you look at the amount of work that may have to go . into it … for example, sex with a young beautiful woman who has plenty . of energy"". 'In a picture that accompanied the story, Cosby stood on a . diving board, smoking a cigar, looking over his shoulder wistfully at a . bikini-clad, mocha-skinned beauty. '""One of those things you want but are . glad you can't have,"" the caption read. 'Cosby didn't tell Ebony . readers about another step that he had taken to prove that he was . serious about cutting back on his womanizing.' The excerpt adds: 'He told one longtime . girlfriend that he wanted to put an end to their relationship, and then . he invited the woman and her mother, who had always disapproved of her . daughter being involved with a married man, out to dinner. ""I'm very . happy to be here,"" the mother told Cosby, ""because I always thought you . had more sense than that!""' The book, out on September 16, is said to have been written with the help of Cosby and his 'inner circle'. Cosby has long been dogged by accusations of infidelity - and has even faced accusations of sexual abuse. Red-faced: Bill Cosby let Tonight show host Jimmy Fallon embarrassed on Monday night - when he told how his wife had given him 'birthday sex' after he turned 77 last month . Still joking: Bill Cosby told Jimmy Fallon 'the most frightening thing that you can hear from your wife on your birthday when you are carrying on...is to hear your wife, who is seven years younger than you, say, 'Keep going!'' Extortion: Autumn Jackson, left, claimed to be Bill Cosby's lovechild and the product of his affair with her mother Shawn Upshaw, right. The pair are seen at a New York City court in July 1997. While Cosby admitted to an affair with Upshaw, he maintained he was not Jackson's father. Jackson, then 22, was sentenced to 26 months in jail for trying to extort $40 million from Cosby . Video Source NBC . In November 2006, Cosby, beloved by America for his role as a cosy, sweater-wearing dad, settled a civil lawsuit with Andrea Constand, 32, a former Temple University employee who claimed Cosby drugged and sexually assaulted her in his Philadelphia-area mansion in 2004. Thirteen other witnesses also came forward voluntarily with similar claims, People magazine reported. Terms of the settlement were not disclosed, but this was not Cosby's first sex scandal accusation. In 1997, Autumn Jackson, then 22, came forward to say she was Cosby's illegitimate child from an affair the comedian had with her mother, Shawn Upshaw. Jackson made the claims just days after the Cosbys' only son Ennis was shot and killed on a Los Angeles freeway on January 17, 1997 aged just 27. Though Cosby admitted to having an affair with Upshaw - he would tell TV interviewer Dan Rather it was a 'rendezvous' - he maintained that Jackson was not his child. Jackson was later convicted on charges of extortion for threatening to take her story to the tabloids unless Cosby paid her $40 million. Breaking racial stereotypes: The Cosby Show revolved around a charming upper middle-class African-American family living in a Brooklyn brownstone . Groundbreaking: New biography Cosby: His Life and Times tells how The Cosby Show was borne out of Bill Cosby's real family life, with tales of his life as a father of five and the middle-aged angst he struggled with being woven in to the storylines . Asked by Oprah Winfrey in 2010 how the couple had weathered the storm of the entertainer's infidelity, Camille Cosby admitted she had known about her husband's affair with Upshaw 'back in the Seventies'. Camille told how she had asked her husband to take a DNA test to be certain he was not the father of Jackson - saying if he had not, 'Autumn Jackson and her cohorts could continue with their story.' Discussing a time when the Cosbys had focused on 'selfish needs', Camille said: 'We were both young. We had to go through a lot. It's difficult to learn to live with somebody, to be unselfish and to be responsible for your behavior - and even to think how you hurt others if you do certain things. 'You go through a transition, if you are committed to each other. You cleanse yourself of all of that baggage, and you look at each other and determine whether the relationship is worth salvaging, whether you really love each other and want to be together. 'Then you realize, 'Wait a minute. I might have been doing this because I just didn't want to think about how this would affect the other person or to allow myself to love someone with emotional intimacy'.' Still together - 50 years on: Bill and Camille Cosby are seen in March 2002 in the audience of the NAACP Image Awards in LA . Meanwhile, after celebrating his 77th birthday on July 12, Cosby made it clear that Camille still gets incites the flames of passion. Indeed, earlier this week he left Tonight host Jimmy Fallon red-faced when he revealed that while he didn't get birthday cake, he did get birthday sex, or as he more charmingly phrased it, 'I got my wife!' Cosby warned the late-night host, 39, that one day, he, too, might come across 'the most frightening thing that you can hear from your wife on your birthday when you are carrying on...'That, he explained, 'is to hear your wife, who is seven years younger than you, say, 'Keep going!''","The Cosby Show legend gave his help with Mark Whitaker's new biography, Cosby: His Life And Times .

"When night falls in Damascus, these days most people lock themselves fearfully in their homes. But a few still venture out, on a mission to drown out the thunder of artillery fire with the boom of dance music. Though shells are raining down on suspected rebel positions in suburbs just a few miles away, these determined revellers head to the Syrian capital's night clubs to try to forget the war on their doorstep. 'Change of atmosphere': Young people dance at a nightclub in downtown Damascus, a city which, like the rest of Syria, has been riven by a 30-month old civil war that is thought to have left 100,000 dead . Raving, I'm raving: Young men dressed in Western-style clothes lift their hands in the air as a track thunders through the club's PA, drowning out the sound of artillery fire hurtling towards rebel-held suburbs . 'I come here for a change of atmosphere,' says Mohammad, a 25-year-old car salesman, who has clearly had a drink or three. 'There is joy here,' he says of the nightclub in the upscale Shaalan neighbourhood, where the barman juggles bottles of spirits. 'I want to live, I don't want to hear any more bad news.' On the dance floor, customers shake to a track popular among supporters of President Bashar al-Assad's regime. 'Don't ask me how or why, it's the army that protects us,' the lyric goes. 'You . and I salute General Maher,' a reference to President Bashar al-Assad's . brother, who heads the elite army Fourth Division but is in fact a . colonel. A barman mixes a drink: Before Syria's civil war began Damascus enjoyed regular music festivals . A place to forget: The night club does brisk business despite the civil war raging around it, with its manager saying that it stays open until 2am. But he asked that its name was not revealed for fear of reprisals . Among the performers is Mudi al-Arabi, a 22-year-old rapper, who returned to Damascus just two months ago after spending the previous two years living in Morocco. He is determined to keep up a happy-go-lucky lifestyle despite the constant threat of death. 'Everyone's going to die some day, but the Syrian people love life and the most important thing is to be happy,' he said. 'If the United States attacks us, I'm sure our army will defend us,' he added. 'Guys come here with their friends or with their girlfriends, to forget the week's routine.' Arabi's songs are heavy with nostalgia for the Damascus of before the war when there were regular music festivals . Now he performs just once a fortnight at private parties. Since the uprising against Assad's rule erupted in March 2011, the authorities have been wary of public gatherings and it has become difficult to get the necessary authorisations. 'It's hard to get permission from the security services,' Arabi said. The nightclub does brisk business despite - or perhaps because of - the war raging outside. 'We stay open until 2:00 am. It's going well,' said 29-year-old manager Bashar. 'But please don't mention the club's name. I'm afraid someone might do us harm because they think we shouldn't be having fun while people are dying.' The club is one of a dozen still open in Damascus 30 months into a conflict that has killed more than 100,000 people and reduced some of the capital's suburbs to rubble.

Seeing the city's youth enjoying nights out on the town, it is difficult to imagine such atrocities as last month's poison gas attack in Ghouta happen just a few minutes drive away. And it is just as hard to imagine the destructive effect a barrage of the West's cruise missiles could have in the event that the U.S. and its allies' threats are finally carried out.

"A tourist who joined in the search after a member of her bus party went missing was able to help track the woman down - when she realised it was herself they were looking forward. The woman was declared missing from a party touring the Eldgja volcanic region in south Iceland after getting off the party's bus to freshen up. She only hopped off the bus breifly, but had also changed her clothes - and her fellow travellers did not recognise her when she climbed back on again to continue the party's journey.

"Immigration authorities are reviewing the case of a U.S. Army veteran and Cuban native who recently discovered he is not an American citizen despite having lived in the country for more than half a century. Mario Hernandez, 58, served in the Army during the Vietnam War and worked for the federal government, using a Social Security number he received when he arrived in the country as a child fleeing Castro's Cuba. The Tallahassee man always believed he was a U.S. citizen, and ironically, only made the startling discovery when he sought a passport to take a cruise with his wife celebrating his retirement after 22 years working in the Federal Bureau of Prisons - an agency that requires citizenship and frequent background checks. Citizenship nightmare: Mario Hernandez, who has lived in the U.S. since he was a nine-year-old, only recently discovered he is not a citizen - or even a resident . That Caribbean cruise would have been his first venture out of the U.S. since coming here nearly a half century ago. Instead of a well-earned holiday, suddenly Hernandez was in limbo and under investigation by the U.S. government, unable to leave for fear that he may be denied re-entry to the country he's called home for almost his entire life. 'I feel like my heart's been ripped out of my chest, I really do,' he told CBS. 'It is difficult to even speak about it, it really it,' he said, choking back tears. Since the Cuban revolution, those who . leave the communist-run island generally get fast-tracked to U.S. residency, after which they can apply for citizenship. Hernandez arrived . in 1965 as a nine-year-old with his mother and always assumed she had filed immigration . papers. He married here, and had two children, one of whom is an Afghanistan war veteran. 'I served this . country,' Hernandez said. 'I've always tried to prove I'm a good . American citizen. I have always taught my children and grandchildren we . need to be good stewards of this country. My parents came for freedom. We owe a lot to this country.' American dream: Hernandez arrived as a refugee from Cuba and was issued a social security number and temporary paperwork, never realizing that his parents had not filed the relevant paperwork for him to become a permanent citizen . Serving his country: Hernandez served in the Vietnam war and worked for the federal government for 22 years - and no one ever questioned his citizenship . The New York Times points out that as a Cuban refugee and military veteran, Hernandez won't face deportation, but he can no longer vote, nor can he leave the country. He faces prison and fines for falsely claiming citizenship. 'I thought I was a citizen - I’ve always been proud of being a citizen,' Hernandez told The New York Times. 'This has really messed with my head.' U.S. Citizens and Immigration Services Spokesman Christopher Bentley said Thursday his agency is reviewing the case and will meet with Hernandez and his attorney, Elizabeth Ricci. Ricci said a meeting was scheduled for next week. 'When an error is discovered, either . through the appeals process or by other means, we work diligently to . review the case and take steps to correct the error and prevent similar . issues from occurring in the future,' he said in a statement. Ricci . said Hernandez's years of service in the military and his work guarding . criminals, including Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh, should be . rewarded not punished. In . recent months, however, she said officials have been asking detailed . questions about why Hernandez voted, suggesting they might be interested . in filing charges related to voter fraud. Retirement: It wasn't until Hernandez and his wife decided to take a cruise to celebrate his retirement after 22 years working for the Federal Bureau of Prisons  that a passport application revealed the secret . Bureaucracy: Now, instead of relaxing in the Caribbean, Hernandez may face prison and fines for voting when not a citizen . She described the bureaucratic process as 'inefficiency in the extreme.' Citing Hernandez's clean record, work history, tax payments and military service, she said, 'I'm hopeful and optimistic, but it's cautious optimism.' 'I think they are gravely embarrassed,' Ricci said of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, 'and are trying to shift the burden on him now to make him look like a criminal.' Elizabeth C. Pines, a Miami immigration lawyer told The New York Times that she had encountered similar cases but none as extreme as Hernandez's. 'It goes to show you how broken the system is for a federal and a state agency to have not even checked his background - his criminal background, yes, but not his immigration background,' she said. For Hernandez, his name being stripped from voting rolls was akin to having part of his identity removed. He broke down crying and couldn't tell friends about it. 'We should be enjoying this time in our life,' said Hernandez's wife Bonita. 'Not living in fear that something bad might happen to him.'","Mario Hernandez, 58, arrived in the U.S. as a refugee from Cuba when he was nine years old .

"Patti LaBelle, pictured in 2007, has agreed to the $100,000 settlement, according to Roseanna Monk's lawyer . Disco diva Patti LaBelle has paid a $100,000 settlement after a pregnant mother accused the singer launching a foul-mouthed tirade in front of her 18-month-old daughter because the toddler was playing in an apartment building lobby. The Grammy-winning singer allegedly lashed out at Roseanna Monk and little Genevieve at their New York home, calling the woman a 'c***' and drenching the woman with a water bottle. LaBelle, 68, had also been accused of screaming at the toddler and trying to punch her mother in a profanity-laden rampage so furious it that it is said to have caused Genevieve to vomit violently. During the alleged altercation, Ms Monk said she put down her . daughter to carry luggage out of the building. When Ms LaBelle walked in . and saw the child running around the lobby, she went ballistic, . according to the suit. 'What . are you doing letting your kid run around like that?' the Marmalade singer asked Ms . Monk, a kindergarten teacher who was pregnant at the time. When . Ms Monk picked Genevieve up, Ms LaBelle, herself a mother of five . children, admonished her for leaving her daughter by the door. Now following the alleged outburst in 2010 the singer has paid out a $100,000 settlement before the case was deposed. Ms Monk's lawyer told the New York Post the case has been settled between the mother and LaBelle. Ms Monk said all proceeds would be donated to the Hope and Heroes Children's Cancer Fund. She said: 'This is an opportunity for Patti LaBelle to help a lot of children, and I feel good about that.' The Monks said the incident they say took place in the lobby of their Upper West-side apartment building. Roseanna Monk, pictured with her daughter Genevieve, filed a lawsuit against Patti LaBelle after the singer's alleged foul-mouthed outburst in 2010 . Lady Marmalade singer LaBelle reportedly had to be dragged away by her entourage after the confrontation two years ago . Ms Monk told the New York Post she responded: 'I have no interest in what you say or think.' The diva, who was dressed in a fur coat and over-sized sunglasses, started hurling profanities at Ms Monk and her baby, according to the lawsuit. Ms LaBelle then threw water from a water bottle in the baby's face. When Genevieve started to cry, Ms Monk told her: 'Are you happy that this is what you have done to this baby?' That's when the singer, known for hit songs including I'll Be Your Friend, 'tries to take a swing' at Ms Monk, the couple's attorney Sam Davis told the New York Daily News. Ms. LaBelle's entourage restrained her and shuffled her off into a waiting car. The couple said they didn't want to sue. First, they asked the singer, who was staying at the New York apartment building while she worked on the Broadway show 'Fela!', for an apology. But they decided to file a lawsuit after reading about an incident in Houston where Ms LaBelle's bodyguards were arrested for beating a West Point cadet in March.","Lady Marmalade singer accused of swearing and throwing punch at mother with 18-month-old child .

"A Russian ship has been stopped by the British government off the Scottish coast over fears that it is carrying helicopters and missiles to Syria - as Russia announced it was sending troops to the region. The decision to halt the liner followed an intervention from the Government, who warned the ship’s insurers that covering the vessel could breach an EU arms embargo. British marine insurer Standard Club has withdrawn cover from the fleet of Russian company Femco who own the ship. Under EU sanctions, countries are banned from exporting arms to Syria and providing other services including insurance. Halted: Russian ship Alaed has been stopped off the Scottish coast over fears that it is carrying helicopters and missiles to Syria . Cargo: It is believed the ship is carrying a number of Mi25 helicopters, similar to the one pictured above, which have played an increasing role in Assad¿s attacks against rebel-held towns . It is believed that British Government officials informed the insurers that if they continued to cover the ship, they could be in breach of the sanctions. In a statement the company said: ‘We were made aware of the allegations that the Alaed was carrying munitions destined for Syria. ‘We have already informed the ship owner that their insurance cover ceased automatically in view of the nature of the voyage.’ The ship in question, the MV Alaed, has been the subject of an international row after US Secretary of State Hilary Clinton said the liner was carrying weapons destined for the Assad regime. It is believed the ship is carrying a number of Mi25 helicopters, which have played an increasing role in Assad’s attacks against rebel-held towns. The insurers’ move came as Russia - a key ally of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad - announced that it is preparing to send two warships and a team of elite marines to the war-torn country.

Russian air force chief, was quoted as saying last night. ‘We won’t abandon the Russians and will evacuate them from the conflict zone if necessary,’ he added.

"Renovation of a landmark Los Angeles restaurant has revealed a neon lamp that has been left on for around 77 years. The light, forgotten for decades, was discovered burning brightly behind a dusty wall in the woman’s restroom in Clifton’s Cafeteria. The surprising discovery was made as the building’s owner, Andrew Meieran, as he undertakes a multimillion renovation of the historic building. Scroll down for video . Flash of a neon light: Andrew Meieran, the new owner of Clifton's Cafeteria, examines a 77-year-old neon light  that was covered up behind a wall in the bottom floor women's bathroom . Enlightening discovery: A neon light panel was found in the women's toilets at the historic Clifton's Cafeteria . Leaving the lights on: The simple neon bulb has been lit for 77 years behind layers of plywood and plaster . Mr Meieran told the Los Angeles Times that the light was likely installed in 1935, after the building was bought and converted into a forest-themed dining establishment. Much of the restaurant featured translucent, hand-painted forest murals that were backlit by neon panels such as the one found. He told KTLA that it was nothing short of ‘staggering’ that the light has survived from the end of the Great Depression until now. ‘The fact it’s been tucked away and it’s so simple in its construction has kept it going all these years – it’s just neon gas and glass.’ He also hypothesised that the bulb generated more than $17,000 in electrical bills. The nook where the neon light was found was covered over in plastic and plywood when part of the restroom was partitioned off as a storage area. Los Angeles landmark: Clifton's Cafeteria fed many down-and-out Californians during the Great Depression . Woodland setting: A fake deer overlooks the main dining floor at Clifton's Cafeteria, pictured in 2008 . But for some reason, no one disconnected the electricity. California is also home to the world’s longest burning light bulb. Known as the Centennial Light, the bulb has been burning for 110 years strong. 'The fact it's been tucked away and it's . so simple in its construction has kept it going all these years – it's . just neon gas and glass.' -Building owner Andrew Meieran . The hand-blown bulb was first installed at the fire department on L Street, and survived several renovations. It hangs in the fire house in Livermore to this day. Neon experts agree that it is rare for a neon bulb to burn for more than 40 years and that this one – which has been burning nearly twice as long – could be the oldest working neon light in the world. Mr Meieran is currently renovating the 47,000-foot space, keeping a careful eye toward the building’s historic details. In fact, he’ll be using Clifford Clinton’s diary to make sure every aspect is correct. Clifton’s Cafeteria was an important building in the landscape of Los Angeles, offering hungry families the option to ‘pay what you can’ for dinner during the throes of the Depression. According to Blogs Downtown, Mr Meieran plans to keep the massive cafeteria open 24/7 once renovations are complete. The long-hidden neon will be on proud display, with a replica transparency over part of it.","Neon light from around 1935 found behind wall in bathroom at historic Clifton's Cafeteria in Los Angeles .

"It was a national tragedy that stunned the world - and for more than 50 years the exact whereabouts of a plane that crashed in Chile carrying a group of football stars remained a mystery. Now climbers in the Andes mountain range say they have found the wreckage of the LAN Chile Douglas DC-3 that went down April 3, 1961 with 24 people on board. The doomed aircraft's twisted remains were discovered high up in Maule, about 190 miles south of capital city Santiago by a group of mountaineers. Scroll down for video . Discovery: A group of climbers have discovered what they believe to be the wreckage of the LAN Chile Douglas DC-3 that went down April 3, 1961 with 24 people on board, including a number of footballers . Members of the top-division Chilean team Green Cross, several of whom died in the 1961 plane crash . Human bones were also found scattered in the area amid parts of the broken plane. Amazingly, pictures taken at the supposed crash site show pieces of the aircraft extraordinarily-well preserved after 54 years in the mountains. The expedition's leader, Leonardo Albornoz, said: 'The plane is more than 3,200 meters up the mountain. Quite a bit of the fuselage is still there, a lot of things scattered over the area including human bones. 'So this story is getting a rewrite since this is not where original accounts said.' Well-preserved: Among the pieces of twisted metal found in the mountains was the plane's propeller . The disappearance of the Douglas DC-3 carrying members of the top-division Chilean team Green Cross was one of the great unsolved mysteries in the South American country . Scattered remains: Climbers said that human bones were also found scattered in the area . Mr Albornoz told Chile's Channel 7 they're keeping the exact site secret to prevent looting. The disappearance of the Douglas DC-3 carrying members of the top-division Chilean team Green Cross  was one of the great unsolved mysteries in the South American country. The club had played an away match in Osorno in the Copa de Chile and was returning to Santiago after a 1-1 draw. The team and staff were spread over two flights and while one of the planes reached the Chilean capital and the other apparently vanished. High in the mountains: The remains of the aircraft were discovere in Maule, about 190 miles south of capital city Santiago - at an altitude of 3,200 metres . The best-known player to have died in the accident was Elisa Mourino (sketch above), who won 25 caps for Argentina and lifted the Copa America for his country in 1955 and 1959 . Teams of rescuers spent fruitless weeks searching for the missing flight and later funerals for the missing players were held - drawing huge crowds in Chile. Climber Mr Albornoz added: ''It was a breathtaking moment and we felt all kinds of sensations. One could feel the energy of the place and breathe the pain.' The disappearance of the Douglas DC-3 carrying members of the top-division Chilean team Green Cross on April 3, 1961 was one of the great unsolved mysteries in the South American country and at the time stunned the sporting world. The club had played an away match in Osorno in the Copa de Chile and was returning to Santiago. The team and staff were spread over two flights. One of the planes reached the Chilean capital and the other apparently vanished. After the crash, It was reported that most of the first team players had elected to fly on the fateful plane because it was more direct, and the alternative flight was scheduled to make several stops on the way back to Santiago. Despite losing virtually the entire first team in the disaster the club  fulfilled the second leg of the cup tie, which they lost 0-1 and were eliminated from the cup. But the accident had a major impact on the club for years to come as it struggled to recover from the heavy loss. The best-known player to have died in the accident was Elisa Mourino, who won 25 caps for Argentina and lifted the Copa America for his country in 1955 and 1959. Mourino was nearing the end of his career at Green Cross after eight seasons at Argentinian giants Boca Juniors. The club, which was one of the eight teams that founded the professional Chilean football league, sadly folded in 1984 after finishing 23rd in the Primera División. The accident is one of the worst tragedies in professional sport, and echoes the darkest day in Manchester United's history - February 6th, 1958.","Plane carrying Chilean top division team Green Cross crashed in 1961 .

"Wearing your pants too low in Wildwood, New Jersey, is about to get expensive. The popular shore town, which is a favorite for holidaymakers, has passed a law banning overly saggy pants with fines ranging from $25 to $200. The vote was unanimously agreed by the Wildwood Commissioners and Mayor Ernie Troiano, who passed the city ordinance in the name . of decency and safety. According to . the new law, when on Wildwood’s boardwalk: . -Shoes or flip-flops must be worn at all times. -A shirt must be on after 8 pm until 5am the next morning. -Pants, swim shorts, and skirts must not hang more than three inches past the person’s waist. Regulations: Visitors to the boardwalk in Wildwood, New Jersey, will be subjected to dress regulations, including pants no lower than three inches below the waistline . 'We’re not trying to set the world on . fire here. We’re just trying to give a little bit better appearance to . the public about what the city of Wildwood is,' said Troiano. The mayor maintains from emails to calls, the feedback so far has been mostly positive. Troiano explained, 'We just want you to take into consideration, if you . have family or elderly people or people who just don’t want to look at . your rear end, just have a little decency. Just pull your pants up.' But one local, Robert Henderson, who . calls Wildwood home and enjoys dressing how he likes, said: 'You should . have the freedom to do what you want on a beach.' The problem is what he considers his 'freedom', some find offensive. Reggie Byrne of Wildwood explained, 'There’s a big difference between freedom of expression and indecent exposure.' Mary Erceg, also of Wildwood added, 'What are you trying to say? It’s just not understandable, it just offends.' Anthony Kordich of Kingston, NY . questioned, 'How come they can tell you how to dress? It’s a public . place, I don’t understand that.' Coming to New York? A billboard is seen in Brooklyn, asking residents to raise their pants was seen in 2010 . Opponents don’t like what they’re hearing, neither does Henderson but he understands rules are rules. Henderson said, 'Yea I have to because if not, I don’t feel like going to the big house.' Police will first ask violators to . comply with the law. Barring that, they’ll be asked to leave the . boardwalk. Refuse – and tickets are issued. We’re told jail time is possible but the mayor says, it is his hope that it never gets that far. 'We don’t want anybody to be asked to . leave the boardwalk, we don’t want anybody to receive a ticket. If he . wants to be a thug and say, ‘Don’t tell me what to do’, then he will be . asked to leave and then it’s in his ballpark. 'You can become a real wise guy and wind up taking a trip to jail or you can get a ticket,' Troiano said. The proposed law would set fines of $25 to $100 for a first offense and $200 for subsequent offenses. Having to do community service is also a possibility. The law is set to go into effect during the 4th of July weekend. Mayor Troiano Jr said the shoe . requirement was a safety issue, while the clothing rules reflect the . town's values and the image it wants to project. 'I know the social climate's changed and what people think is decent is different than it was,' Troiano said. Commissioner Peter Byron said he supported the ordinance in its current form. 'I think it's obnoxious with these kids who wear their pants down around their knees,' Byron said, adding he sometimes receives complaints from people unhappy with the style of dress. Other towns such as Cape May and Ocean City have some regulation in place regarding clothing on their respective promenade and boardwalk. Meanwhile, laws similar to Wildwood's have been enacted in communities around the country, including Terrebone Parish, Louisiana, and Cocoa, Florida.","Ban prohibits visitors to Wildwood, New Jersey's boardwalk from wearing pants more than three inches below the waist .

"Sky News is being investigated by Britain's TV watchdog after one of its star reporters rifled through the possessions of people killed when MH17 was shot down over Ukraine. Ofcom has had 200 complaints since Colin Brazier inspected suitcases found where the Malaysian Airlines jet crashed, which included picking up a child's pink water flask, some keys and toiletries. The broadcaster and Mr Brazier have both apologised after the incident in eastern Ukraine where the journalist himself seemed to realise his mistake saying: 'I shouldn't really be doing this, I suppose.' Two days later he admitted 'a serious error of judgment' after being criticised by family members of a crash victim, who described his actions as 'sick' and David Cameron who called it 'completely inappropriate'. Scroll down for video . Row: Sky News is now being investigated by Ofcom after Colin Brazier's controversial report from the MH17 crash site sparked 200 complaints . Report: Brazier picked up item's from a victim's suitcase but later admitted 'a serious error of judgment' An Ofcom spokesman said: 'Ofcom received over 200 complaints about this news report. Having assessed these, there are grounds to investigate under our rule on potentially offensive material. As in all investigations, we will take relevant circumstances into account, including any action taken by the broadcaster, in reaching a decision.' The broadcast, on July 20, was met with an outpouring of outrage on Twitter with many viewers calling it 'shocking' and 'disgusting'. Speaking at the time, a Sky News spokeswoman said: 'Colin immediately recognised that this was inappropriate and said so on air. Both Colin and Sky News apologise profusely for any offence caused.' Brazier is described by Sky News as one of its 'most widely travelled' reporters who has previously been honoured for his reporting in Afghanistan. During his live to air piece at the scene he spotted a victim's pink drinking flask that was identical to one possessed by his six-year-old daughter. He then said he 'lost it' and broke out in tears while on air as he bent down to touch the victims' possessions. The brother of flight MH17 crash victim Richard Mayne (pictured right with his two brothers Thomas, left, and William, centre) has condemned Sky News reporter Colin Brazier . Tragedy: MH17 as it took off from Schiphol airport near Amsterdam hours before it crashed with more than 280 passengers on board . Leeds University student Richard Mayne was one of ten Britons to die when the Malaysia Airlines jet crashed last month. Speaking from the family home in Leicester, Richard Mayne’s older brother Thomas, 24, branded it 'sick' adding: 'I think it's totally out of order. It's not on.' Mr Mayne said: 'It’s sick and the worst example of news journalism which is sensationalising an appalling human tragedy. 'It's really hard for us at the moment. The magnitude of it all and the way it happened. You don't think this sort of stuff happens to you. Brazier later gave a moving account of coming across scores of human remains at the site. An Australian was also criticised for touching clothes and debris from the MH17 plane crash has defended his actions saying 'it's not as though it's a crime scene'. Phil Williams was shown handling victims' belongings in a report published on the ABC website.","Colin Brazier, reporting from the scene, rummaged through victim's suitcase .

"Meet Ben Byrne - the man sharing the bed of Perth identical twins Anna and Lucy DeCinque who spent more than $240,000 on surgeries to look more alike. The 31-year-old won the hearts of both girls after they added him on Facebook on the suggestion of mutual friends. At first, the electrical mechanic had trouble balancing the demands of two girlfriends, but very early on into their 18-month relationship he learned the attention he paid to one, had to be paid to the other. Scroll down for videos . Anna and Lucy DeCinque, from Perth, share everything - even their boyfriend Ben Byrne . The twins' boyfriend is a 31-year-old electrical mechanic and says at first he found it hard to balance two girlfriends . 'It's my first time with two girlfriends, and to be honest it's very difficult because it has to be 100 per cent even,' Mr Byrne told Woman's Day. 'Whatever I do for one I have to do for the other, so it's a fine balance. My mates reckon it's a cool problem to have.' This is the first time the health nut has spoken out about his unorthodox relationship with the 28-year-olds since he came to the attention of global media when Anna and Lucy's story came to light earlier this year. But after living with the twins and their mother, Jeanna, for 10 months, he now feels more comfortable to share. At first, the Perth fitness enthusiast was shy but now that he has lived with the girls for 10 months he's ready to share . Anna and Lucy DeCinque came to the attention of the media when it was revealed they had spent more than $240,000 to look more alike . Lucy said the question they got the most was: 'How does one guy keep up with two girls in the bedroom?' 'Put it this way, we're very active girls and he needs twice the energy,' she said. But Mr Byrne is probably more open than most men to having identical twins as girlfriends. Dubbed as 'The Chosen One' by the DeCinque girls, Mr Byrne himself is a twin. The trio live on the top of floor of a two-storey home with the girls' mother, Jeanna . And more importantly he has the seal of approval from Anna and Lucy's mother who said her girls' live-in boyfriend was 'a true gentleman'. Jeanna said she was happy as long as the girls were happy and had formed a strong bond with Mr Byrne as she found herself sticking up for him when he fought with the twins. Intimate details of Anna and Lucy DeCinque's relationship were revealed in Woman's Day . Mr Byrne told Woman's Day that was probably the worst part of his relationship because it was always 'two versus one'. 'But on the bright side I get double the love,' he said. The girls made world headlines when their story was revealed to media outlets. They have spent $240,800 on cosmetic procedures to look more alike - including lip fillers, breast implants, and fake eyebrows and eyelashes. But it's not just a boyfriend and looks, the pair have in common. Anna and Lucy also share a job, a car and a Facebook account - on which they first met their boyfriend. Mr Byrne said they talked for about six months before they met in person. Anna said they put off their first meeting as long as they could because they had 'trust issues', and wanted to make sure Mr Byrne was the real deal.","Ben Byrne is a 31-year-old electrical mechanic and loves to work out .

"Military option: Colonel Richard Kemp has warned that Britain risks being sucked into military action in Syria to prevent bloodshed spreading . Britain risks being sucked into military action in Syria to prevent bloodshed spreading, a former Army commander has warned. Colonel Richard Kemp, who led UK forces in Afghanistan, said the escalating civil war made it increasingly likely that the West would be forced to step in. But defence analysts warned that a force of at least 300,000 troops would be needed to carry out a full-scale intervention. Even then, this would face fierce resistance. At least 75,000 would be needed to secure Syria’s chemical weapons stockpiles. Although the weapons are thought to be safe, earlier this week the Assad regime said it would use them in the event of any invasion by foreign forces. Military chiefs in London are already drawing up contingency plans in case the UK decides to deploy troops to the volatile region. Former SAS soldiers are helping to train rebel fighters in Syria in military tactics from weapon handling, leadership and the use of communications systems to tackle Basher al-Assad’s brutal regime. Last week his teetering regime was rocked when the rebels succeeded in assassinating four top security advisers, including two defence ministers. But last night it was reported that the Assad regime had attempted to reassert control by using, for the first time, fighter jets on its own people. The air attacks were said to be concentrated on rebel-held neighbourhoods of Syria’s second city, Aleppo. If confirmed, would represent a dramatic escalation in the civil war. However, the scale of dealing with the conflict and its aftermath in Syria - let alone any military intervention - was spelled out in a 44-page report by experts at the Royal United Services Institute think-tank in London. The report, A Collision Course For Intervention, said that the task of dampening down the violence inside Syria was now less urgent than preventing spiralling sectarian clashes, trouble spilling over into neighbouring countries and heading off cross-border invasions.

Professor Michael Clarke, the director of RUSI, said: ‘However loathe western governments have been to embrace a creeping intervention in the Syria crisis, the events of recent days have created a step change in the situation that will make a hands-off approach increasingly difficult to maintain.’ Col Kemp said: ‘Whether or not Assad falls, the question of military intervention will remain a live issue. ‘Western political leaders may have no appetite for deeper intervention. But as history has shown, we do not always choose which wars to fight - sometimes wars choose us. ‘Military planners have a responsibility to prepare for intervention options in Syria for their political masters in case this conflict chooses them. ‘Preparation will be proceeding today in several Western capitals and on the ground in Syria and in Turkey. ‘Up to the point of Assad’s collapse, we are most likely to see a continuation or intensification of the under-the-radar options of financial support, arming and advising the rebels, clandestine operations and perhaps cyber warfare from the West. ‘After any collapse, however, the military options will be seen in a different light.’ Ready for action: Free Syrian Army soldiers pray in front of their weapons at the border crossing to Turkey .
