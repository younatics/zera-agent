"A 12-year-old schoolboy who was excluded from school hanged himself just hours later, an inquest heard today. Jordan Green,12, had hurled chairs round a room, sworn at staff and threatened them. At first he was excluded from school for one day and when his behaviour worsened the ban was increased to five days before eventually the principal banned him permanently. And when he told his mother Heidi of the ban he said: 'Have a nice life mum, I just feel like killing myself'. Hairdresser Heidi Green found her son Jordan in his bedroom hours after he had been excluded from school . Ms Green said she tried calling him . later, adding: 'He wouldn’t answer his phone and I thought ""he obviously . doesn’t want to speak to me"".' The hairdresser said she returned to their home in Harrogate, North Yorkshire, after 8pm and told the inquest: 'I assumed that he wasn’t home. 'I thought he was playing with his friends.' Medics believe he had been dead several hours when his body was found on June 27 last year. Today, an inquest in Knaresborough, North Yorkshire, heard how Jordan, whose mother was separated from his father, Kevin, had been disruptive even when he was at primary school. Jordan had become increasingly disruptive in lessons since his grandmother died and his parents separated, Mrs Green told the hearing. When he went to Harrogate High School, his behaviour became worse, causing him to be excluded from lessons on several occasions. Jordan, seen with his mother, had become increasingly disruptive in lessons since his grandmother died and his parents separated, an inquest heard . Vice principal Ann Francis said staff had had numerous meetings to decide how to help Jordan, who was academically adept but regularly disrupted classes and swore at teachers. On occasions he would just start running round the 800-student school and hide from staff who were looking for him. At one stage he was put in a special educational unit where his behaviour improved. But last June the decision was finally made to exclude him from the school for good. That morning he had left his home upset after he refused to get out of bed and go to school. When he did get there he was put in a 'chill room' to calm down before he returned to normal lessons. Miss Francis said he was allowed to use the computers in the room and was kept there because he seemed sleepy. But just over an hour later Jordan left the room without permission and a call went out to a special staff response team to find him. The schoolboy was permanently excluded from Harrogate High School on the day he died . Miss Francis said: 'He was seen in different parts of the school but would not stop or listen to anyone.' For around half an hour, she admitted staff did not know where Jordan was until he was seen in the cafeteria but when staff tried to talk to him he was abusive to them and ran away. Eventually he was persuaded back into the chill room and staff tried to calm him down but he was 'quite difficult and agitated,' said Miss Francis. It was then that the school principal Andrew Bayston decided to exclude Jordan for a day. But when Jordan realised staff were trying to contact his parents he started shouting 'mum is getting ill' and began throwing things around, including a board game and a chair. Miss Francis said: 'He was screaming and shouting abuse at staff who decided to leave him in the room to calm down.' At one stage another class of pupils were moved out of an adjoining room because they could see what was happening. And because of Jordan’s behaviour the school principal increased the ban to five days. When Ms Green was contacted she told the school she could not collect him because she was working - but gave permission for the school to let him return home. But then Jordan's behaviour deteriorated and two members of staff had to stand in front of a glass door as he tried to punch it and then threw himself at it. At one stage he picked up a chair and held it above his head, threatening to hit a member of staff with it. In an attempt to diffuse the situation Miss Francis ordered doors to be opened so that Jordan could leave school after she talked to him and he calmed down. Moments after leaving school, Jordan returned to pick up his scooter and minutes later returned again, asking for food and he was given some. But after another meeting between staff the principal decided that Jordan should be excluded from the school permanently. After that decision had been made, it would be up to the local authority to decide on Jordan’s future. Miss Francis said that suggestions that Jordan, who lived with his mother, had been bullied were wrong and Jordan had never reported that he had been bullied. The inquest continues.

"A multi-million pound penthouse flat near London's Regent's Park is at the centre of an acrimonious legal battle between a wealthy sheikh and the wife he married and divorced twice. The High Court in London heard that Sheikh Abdul Maksoud Khojah, 89, was 'outraged' when his ex-wife and mother of his two children, Melina Abuchian, 63, laid claim to the £20million flat in north London. The story of the ex-couple’s extraordinary life together emerged when a judge revealed that they had married in 1979, had two children, as well as homes in Jedda, London, Paris and Cannes, divorced, remarried - and were now divorced again. The 89-year-old sheikh and his 63-year-old wife are fighting over a flat in this block in Regents Park, London . The sheikh divorced Mrs Abuchian for a second time in an Islamic Talaq ceremony in May this year, the court heard, but the 63-year-old said she had now made her home in London and needed somewhere to live. Senior family judge Mr Justice Mostyn said Mrs Abuchian claimed to have moved permanently to London in September last year as her marriage collapsed. But her ex-husband, a successful property developer, disputes that the penthouse is really her home and has been trying to get his ex-wife out of the flat since March. Mrs Abuchian, however, has responded by winning a temporary injunction against him and his off-shore company, which owns the flat, preventing them from selling it from under her. The court was told that Sheikh Abdul was 'outraged' that she had resorted to the English courts, insisting that their divorce was a 'deeply, deeply' Saudi Arabian affair. Mr Justice Mostyn said Mrs Abuchian can continue her legal battle for the flat in the English courts . He bought the flat in the 1970s, it was revealed, but was now 'very anxious to get on and sell the property' for fear of the hyper-inflated central London property market collapsing. He asked Mr Justice Mostyn to block his ex-wife’s campaign, disputing the amount of time they had spent at the flat during their married life. However, Mrs Abuchian insisted that, although she liked her 'beautiful home' in Cannes, she now 'intended to live in London for the rest of my life'. She said she had made her 'permanent base' in Regents Park and she 'simply wished to live out the rest of my life in a safe and familiar environment'. In May, she had obtained an 'investor's visa', entitling her to stay in Britain for a five-year renewable period, the court was told. Mr Justice Mostyn said that, although the flat was formally owned by a Dutch Antilles company, Sheikh Abdul had stated it was really his. The judge ruled that Sheikh Abdul had 'come nowhere near' to landing 'a knock-out blow' to his ex-wife's case. His decision means that Mrs Abuchian can continue her fight in the English courts to keep the flat and for other financial provision from her ex-husband's fortune.","Sheikh Abdul Maksoud Khoja, 89, is divorced from Melina Abuchian, 63 .

"If you're planning a city break to London this autumn, you may want to avoid Soho. The trendy central London district - famed for its bustling nightlife and even a seedier strip club element - is the most expensive place to stay for tourists, according to new statistics. The survey compared 20 different London neighbourhoods and their cost of lodging - specifically, the price a visitor will have to spend to stay in the cheapest available double room during the  month of October. According to recent findings by CheapRooms.co.uk, Soho is the most expensive district to stay in . The average cost for a three-star hotel's double room is a whopping £219 per night . Soho Square - one of the area's famous landmarks - is close to Greek Street's many top restaurants and bars . Designer department store Liberty London can also be found in the Soho neighbourhood . To be considered, hotels must be rated at least three stars and have achieved a positive average client rating. In the Soho neighbourhood, which is bounded by shopping meccas Oxford Street and Regent Street, as well as Charing Cross Road and Shaftesbury Avenue, guests will pay an average of £219 per night for the cheapest double room. 1. Soho - £219.2 . 2. Knightsbridge - £216.3 . 3. Mayfair - £214.4 . 4. Chelsea - £194.5 . 5. Belgravia - £172.6 . 6. The City - £154.7 . 7. Westminster - £151.8 . 8. Notting Hill - £150.9 . 9.

"Luxury property sales in central London have plummeted by a third in the last year amid growing fears over the introduction of a mansion tax, according to property experts . Investors are said to be losing interest in Knightsbridge, Chelsea, Kensington and Belgravia after Labour announced plans for the owners of properties worth £2-3million to pay an extra £3,000 a year. Concerns that the market has become overblown have also contributed to the fact that luxury house sales have fallen by more than 50 per cent. Flats and apartment sales have also plummeted by 27 per cent, according to research carried out for the Financial Times by data firm Lonres and analysis company Dataloft. This Grade II listed Mayfair mansion, built in the  18th century, went up for auction last week with a guide price of £8.3million . The seven-bedroom property on Bolton Street is just a few minutes walks from The Ritz in the heart of Mayfair . Estate agency Foxtons warned profits would fall this year because of a marked slowdown in London's previously runaway property market, sending its shares tumbling by a fifth. Foxtons, which has become a symbol of the British capital's property boom, said sales volumes had fallen sharply and commissions were down in the third quarter. The growing political debate over new property taxes and other possible clampdowns on the internationally wealthy have meant that investors have backed off. Richard Donnell, director of research at data analysis company Hometrack, said: 'All this debate around tax is putting people off and they'll wait until after the election now. Former England star Sol Campbell put his Chelsea home on the market for £25million - a week after slamming the proposed mansion tax . Campbell branded the mansion tax as a 'cheap and easy way' to hit those who 'have done well' and warned of 'uproar' if it became law . 'More and more housing is being taken out of circulation by investors and people seeing it as a better way of investing their wealth than traditional investments.' Concerns over the strength of the pound on global currency markets and the introduction last year of a tax on homes held through companies have all contributed to the slowdown, according to those involved in trading properties. 'The summer was the quietest we've seen in some time,' said Roarie Scarisbrick, a buying agent at Property Vision. 'It had been a long bull run and markets do need a breather occasionally, but it was also the moment that sentiment changed slightly, so the brakes came on.' Lion Lodge is believed to be the first new mansion built in Belgravia in almost 70 years and is thought to be one of the most expensive new homes in Britain . The stunning seven-bedroom home, which features a leisure complex and pool, is on the market with a guide price of £40million . Investors are said to be losing interest in Knightsbridge (above) and other prime London locations amid concerns over new taxes . But many sellers have not yet caught up with the shift in sentiment, according to the agent. He added: 'There is a hell of a lot of new stock coming to the market . . . with [many sellers] trying to catch the coat-tails of the disappearing market.' Fresh data show UK growth slowing . Homeowners were estimated to be cutting prices by up to 15 per cent to achieve a sale, according to Douglas & Gordon estate agents. Classic white stucco villas in Chelsea are taking as long as a year to sell, with some properties worth around £4.5m dropping their prices by £1m, according to D&G. The plan by Labour leader Ed Miliband and Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls to levy an escalating one per cent tax on homeowners with properties worth more than £2million has been described as 'the politics of envy'. Senior Labour peer Charles Allen has downsized from his £50million home in Holland Park, West London, just months before Ed Miliband hopes to introduce his controversial mansion tax . Sales of luxury houses, such as this news house in Knightsbridge, have fallen by  more than 50 per cent in the past year .

"A man was forced to undergo radical surgery to have a live fish removed from his intestine. Graphic footage shows the man from Londrina, Brazil, having an operation to remove a South American lungfish from his body. In the horrific clip, a surgeon pulls out the eel-like fish, known to grow up to a length of 125 cm (4.10 ft), which had apparently burrowed into the man's body. Scroll down for video . A man was forced to have surgery to have a live South American lungfish removed from his intestines . It can be seen being taken from his abdomen and wrapped in a cloth. Miraculously, the fish was still very much alive when it was removed - and can be seen wriggling around. One report suggests it was 2ft long, although this has not been verified. The creature later had to be euthanised, according to the Brazilian news website esmeraldanoticias.com. The unidentified man, who has recovered from the operation, has since made a formal complaint after staff at Hospital Universitário (University Hospital) in Londrina filmed the surgery. The video of him and the fish, known locally as a piramboia, has become a viral sensation after it was posted on the website LiveLeak. During the operation, doctors can be heard laughing as the wriggling fish is surgically removed and one is heard to say: 'This one is for the history', while another adds: 'I have just sent the pic by mail.' Women can be heard laughing and cheering. The fish, which can grow up to 125 cm (4.10 ft) in length, was still very much alive when surgeons pulled it out . The South American Lungfish can apparently exist in areas with very little oxygen and its typical environment is swampland and slow-moving waters. It is native to the moving waters of the Amazon, Paraguay and lower Parana River basins in South America. Its other names include the American mudfish and scaly salamanderfish, though it is known more commonly in Portugese as piramboia. The young lungfish is spotted with gold on a black background, and this fades to a brown or grey colour when it grows to its adult size. The species has an elongated, almost eel-like body which can grow to a length of 125 cm (4.10 ft). News reports suggest Nádina Moreno, dean of the university, has now banned the use of cell phones inside the surgical centres as a result. In unusual and different cases, procedures are sometimes recorded without the patient being identifiable for educational purposes and for later discussion, but this should always be approved, she is reported to have said. An inquiry investigating those responsible for recording the operation without the patient's authorisation has been launched. Several people have were summoned to give explanations, including the physician responsible for the surgery. Allegedly, the punishment could be a warning, suspension or even immediate dismissal. The news comes after a man in China's southeastern Guangdong province also underwent surgery to remove a live eel from his intestines last year. A doctor at the Shunde People's Hospital posted a photo of a one kilogram eel that was surgically removed from a patient's guts. The eel was reportedly over 50cm long. The 39-year-old man, refused to elaborate on how an aquatic animal ended up swimming around inside him. The hospital launched an investigation after the operation was filmed and posted on the internet without the man's permission. People are seen laughing and cheering throughout the surgery .","Man had South American lungfish removed from his intestine .

"American Airlines have become the first and only US carrier to offer travellers first-class seats on domestic flights. Up until now, passengers have only had the choice between economy and business-class flights when flying between US destinations. However, anyone wanting to enjoy the benefits of American Airline's premium seats between Los Angeles and New York will have to shell out up to $8,000 (£4,895) for a return trip between the cities. American airline's 10 first class seats in their A321T planes include fully lie-flat beds and a 15.4-inch TV . In comparison, Delta Airlines were yesterday offering their business-class seats for a round trip between the two cities at $5,016 (£3,070). But for the extra money, passengers who want the first-class experience for the six-hour journey will have access to a host of extra facilities. They will be offered private berths, three-course meals boasting shrimp, scampi and even vented compartments that can house a customer's pets. The seats are 27.4 inches wide, compared with 19 inches business class and 17.7 in economy cabins . The airline's 10 first class seats in their A321T planes include fully lie-flat beds and a 15.4-inch touchscreen monitor. Travellers will be able to choose from 200 films, 180 TV programmes, 350 radio stations and 20 games in addition to having access to onboard Wi-Fi, powerpoints and USB ports. They will also be given top of the range Bose, Noise Cancelling headphones. The spacious seats are 27.4 inches wide, compared with 19 inches business class and 17.7 in economy cabins, while they will also feature additional legroom. Three course meals will also feature a menu of beef filet and butternut squash gnocchi and a selection of award-winning wines. By comparison, economy-class passengers are served £6 chicken sandwiches. The premium service has been introduced as part of a bid to return American Airlines to its role as an industry innovator in the 1970s and 1980s . They will also be given free travel bags filled with Akhassa beauty products. First-class pets are cosseted as well. The two berths at the front bulkhead each have a space with a vented door to hold a kennel or carrying case for takeoff and landing. It has already been dubbed the 'Paris Hilton compartment', in honour of the celebrity who often flies with her dogs. Privacy and extra workspace in the first-class berths attracted Matthew Bennett, who used frequent-flier miles to book one way on one of the airline's 17 A321T aircraft. 'The difference between business and first-class is akin to the difference between economy and business,' said Bennett, who is based in California, and publishes 'First Class Flyer,' an advice newsletter on redeeming loyalty awards and elite upgrades. 'It's pretty darn significant.' A321T flights began in January, and President Scott Kirby said the service generated an enthusiastic response at a recent investor conference near Los Angeles. Until now, passengers have only had the choice between economy and business-class flights when flying between US destinations . 'I bet I had at least six to eight people seek me out at the conference to tell me how great the product was,' he said. 'It's a huge hit with our customers and doing well.' The premium service has been introduced as part of a bid to return American Airlines to its role as an industry innovator in the 1970s and 1980s. Industry experts now say other US arlines could follow suit and add first-class cabins to their cross-country services. 'Once somebody disrupts a market with a product of that quality, the others are going to want to analyse it and see if they want to follow suit,' said John Beauvais, president-corporate brands for Flight Centre USA and Latin America. 'They certainly are not ignoring it.'","New first-class cabins expected to be popular with celebrities and lawyers .

"Jack Wall, left, threw himself in front of a train at Liphook railway station after arguing with his mother Tracy Wall, right, over household chores, the inquest heard . A teenager threw himself in front of a train after claiming he was 'broken' following a decade of psychological abuse from his mother, an inquest heard. Jack Wall made the revelation in a text message to a friend just before he died of multiple injuries after he was hit by a train, an inquest heard today. The 18-year-old, who suffered from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and was described as 'hyper-sensitive', had been told to sleep at a friend's house that night by his mother following a row about him not doing his household chores. He died after he was hit by the Portsmouth to London Waterloo service at Liphook railway station, Hampshire, on the evening of November 17 last year. The inquest at Alton heard he had fallen out with his mother, Tracy Wall, that day after he failed to complete his chores, including picking up her medication from the chemist. The hearing was told Mr Wall was born in the US but Mrs Wall had moved back to the UK with her son in 2004 when she divorced his father, Steve Wall. They lived in Salisbury, Wiltshire, before moving to Portsmouth and then Liphook. Mrs Wall told the hearing that she had told her son to sleep at a friend’s house that night as a punishment. Sobbing as she gave evidence, she said: 'I decided Jack could do without some creature comforts for one night and he could sleep on someone else’s sofa for the night. 'We had words but we didn’t shout. I said ""Get out, get out, you are just like him (his father)"". I went downstairs, Jack came down and said ""Say goodbye to your son"". 'I said ""Bye Jack"" and Jack left the house and that was the last I saw of him.' Mrs Wall said she contacted his friends to make sure he had a bed to sleep on that night and tried to call him but did not hear anything until the police informed her of his death. She added: 'Jack was a very loving person. I would describe our relationship as being a married couple without being a married couple. Jack was my world. Jack was a very loving, sensitive young man and he did get easily upset.' The inquest heard Mr Wall sent a message to his friend saying he was 'broken' after a 'decade of psychological abuse' by his mother . Friend Luke Mees, told the inquest he received a delayed message from Mr . Wall at 1.34am speaking of troubles he had been having with his mother . and saying he intended to take his own life. The message said: 'It took me a long time to finally make this decision. 'I . don’t even know where to start!!! Let’s start with saying I have . suffered almost a decade of psychological abuse from my mum and I’m . broken!! 'Years of being told ""You’re just like your father!/You’re a nobody!/I wish I had a better son!"" 'I . don’t want to continue living after all that has happened in my life . since coming to England. Watching your mum physically hurt herself and . blaming it on you! 'That’s . what destroyed me!! I chose to entrust you with this message because I . know you’re the one who has chosen to stick by me through all my . problems and I’m so sorry! Mrs Wall told the hearing she contacted her son's friends to make sure he had a bed to sleep on that night and tried to call him but did not hear anything until the police informed her of his death . 'I’m so sorry to the ones who care about me and more specifically you! I’m sorry for burdening you with everything and then just disappearing like this! I will look out for you from wherever people like me go. I have no more tears left to shed. If I did their ghosts would be falling. 'See ya whenever dude and try not to make too much of a fuss about it. People have their lives to get on with.' Mr Mees told the inquest: 'Jack was always a lovely, cheerful person. He said he was having problems at college but he said that was all right now.' Mr Wall’s grandmother Eileen McGrath said: 'Jack never said anything to me about having problems at home. 'I can’t believe it’s true, they were so close and loving all the time.' The inquest heard that Mr Wall had been taking the medication ritalin for his ADHD but had decided to stop taking this before starting his studies at Alton College. His mother said that he wanted to join the Royal Navy which she said required recruits to be drug-free for three years. She added: 'Prior to starting college he decided to stop taking his medication, he wanted to be himself and the medication took away his personality.' 'Jack was a very loving person. I would describe our relationship as being a married couple without being a married couple. Jack was my world. Jack was a very loving, sensitive young man and he did get easily upset' - Mr Wall's mother Tracy Wall . The inquest jury of six women and two men returned a verdict of suicide. North Hampshire Coroner Andrew Bradley expressed his condolences to the family. He said: 'Whether it (the message) is true or not perhaps is a reflection of what Jack was feeling at that time. 'One doesn’t have to distinguish whether it was right or wrong. For him, it was real at the time.' Speaking after the hearing, Mr Wall’s cousin Claire Sherwin said: 'We love Jack very much and we are sorry that we didn’t know he was having any troubles, he could have come to any of us. 'His death is very sad and he’s left the whole family very sad. It’s a very sad day and we miss him very much.' Jack Wall’s father today paid tribute to his late son. Speaking from his home in Florida, Steve Wall, 49, said: 'More than 150 friends came to his funeral and there were more than 400 Facebook messages left on his page. 'He left such a huge gap in the lives of so many of his friends and family. He touched so many lives in such a special way. I’m absolutely heartbroken. He was such a special boy. 'Everything in his life except his home life was really good and healthy. It’s a shame he kept everything inside of him. I don’t know why he didn’t tell anybody about problems at home. 'He didn’t tell me. If he had told me I would’ve come and changed things in a hurry. I wish he had confided in me, or a teacher or anybody. 'If anything good can come out of this, I hope it’s that it sends a message to teenagers to talk about their problems. There’s always a means to fix whatever is going on.'","Jack Wall threw himself in front of train following argument with mother .

"The United States bombed a Syrian terror group that was in the final stages of a plot to blow up American airliners with toothpaste tube bombs last night, the Pentagon has claimed. Alongside its strikes on the ISIS heartland, officials said US warplanes hit a previously unknown group of Al-Qaeda militants known as the Khorosan Group. The group of seasoned terrorists planned to 'imminently'  attack a US airliner or other target using a bomb without any metal parts, toothpaste tubes and clothes dipped in explosives, an unnamed US official told CNN. President Barack Obama ordered the strikes after intelligence reports discovered the plot this week, officials claimed.

Lieutenant General William Mayville, the Pentagon's director of operations, said Tomahawk cruise missiles fired from US warships in the region were used to hit the group's compounds, workshops and training grounds around the city of Aleppo. 'Intelligence reports indicated that the Khorasan Group was in the final stages of plans to execute attacks against Western targets and potentially the US homeland,' he said. Khorasan - which has been described as a collective of 'seasoned Al Qaeda veterans' - is understood to intercept Westerners travelling to fight for radical groups in Syria, including ISIS. As many of these would-be jihadists retain their passports and travelled to Syria without their home nation's knowledge, Khorasan trains them not for combat in the Middle East - but rather for future terror attacks back home in the West. The group is linked to the much better-known Al Nusra Front only through their shared links with Ayman al-Zawahiri led Al Qaeda - which acts as an umbrella organization for Salafist terror cells. Khorasan is one of several Al Qaeda affiliates in Syria and possibly one of the most secretive groups operating under the cover of Syria's civil war. But unlike the Al Nusra Front, Khorasan appears to have little interest in the outcome of the uprising against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Nor does it seem to harbour ambitions to control vast swaths of territory in the hope of establishing an independent state as ISIS does. Instead Khorasan exploits the chaos of the Syrian Civil War to recruit from the many thousands of young Western Muslims travelling to the region without prior connections to a specific militant group. Blast: Video emerged early this on Syrian Facebook pages showing what appears to be the US-led airstrikes in Syria against Islamic State targets in and around the city of Raqqa . Coalition: President Obama today met officials from the Arab countries that joined the coalition for the strikes. Included in the meeting are representatives from Jordan, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain and Iraq . The overnight missile strikes were followed by attacks by US warplanes and drones - backed by Arab allies - to hit ISIS - the main focus of the US action. The group's leader Muhsin al-Fadhli, 33, is thought to have been close to Osama bin Laden since around the time of September 11, 2001 terror attacks in the United States. Another senior figure within Khorasan is believed to be Yemeni bomb maker Ibrahim al-Asiri, who is also a senior member of another group known as Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. The overnight missile strikes in Syria were followed by attacks by US warplanes and drones backed by America's Arabian allies. Although Khorasan suffered eight targetted U.S. attacks the main focus of the action was against ISIS. Following the raids - the first carried out by the US against IS on Syrian territory - U.S. President Barack Obama has vowed 'to do what's necessary' to deal with the group. He said the backing of five Arab states - Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates - underlined the support he was building for international action to defeat ISIS - also referred to as ISIL (Islamic State of Iraq and Levant). Among the areas reportedly hit was the IS stronghold of Raqqa where it is thought a second British aid worker, Alan Henning, is being held. 'The strength of this coalition makes it clear to the world that this is not America's fight alone,' he said in a statement on the White House lawn. 'The overall effort will take time, there will be challenges ahead, but we are going to do what's necessary to take the fight to this terrorist group for the security of the country and the region and for the entire world.' Among the areas hit overnight was the ISIS stronghold of Raqqa where it is thought  British aid worker Alan Henning is currently being held. Since August, the US has carried out around 190 air strikes against IS in Iraq as part of Mr Obama's campaign to 'degrade and destroy' the militants. Britain has so far been helping supply arms to the Kurdish peshmergas fighting IS in northern Iraq, as well as offering support to the new Iraqi government led by Haider Abadi. It was also a driving force behind a UN Security Council presidential statement on Friday calling on the international community to help Iraq defeat the extremists.","Mysterious terror collective Khorasan Group were close to launching attack .

"In an apparent bid to redeem itself after recent controversy, Abercrombie & Fitch has launched its very first collection featuring the color black. The new items include a chic black leather jacket for $140, cuffed shorts for $35 and a $35 black-and-white floral skirt that falls to knee-length. The retailer's former ban on black was reportedly enforced by CEO Mike Jeffries, who even went so far as to tell employees they were not allowed to wear the color either, calling it too 'formal'. Making changes: Abercrombie & Fitch has launched its very first collection featuring the color black after CEO famously banned the color. Pictured: A $140 leather jacket from the new collection . The company said in a statement in 2013: 'Abercrombie & Fitch does not sell black clothing and discourages wearing it at our home office and in our stores, because we are a casual lifestyle brand and feel black clothing is formal. 'We have nothing against black clothing and feel it is perfectly appropriate for things like tuxedos.' The move seems to indicate that the company is trying to appeal to more customers, after earning something of a reputation for being elitist. Aside from banning black, Abercrombie is also known for not selling women's size XL or XXL, unlike most of its competitors including H&M and American Eagle. Dark side: The retailer formerly had a ban on black because CEO Mike Jeffries said it is too 'formal'.

(Left: A $24 crop top. Right: Abigail kimono, $68) In a 2006 interview with Salon, Mr Jeffries explained why the retailer caters to a very specific type of customer. 'Abercrombie's customer is changing, and we're ready to change with her and him' 'In every school there are the cool and popular kids, and then there are the not-so-cool kids,' he explained at the time. 'Candidly, we go after the cool kids. We go after the attractive all-American kid with a great attitude and a lot of friends. A lot of people don't belong [in our clothes], and they can't belong. Are we exclusionary? Absolutely.' Abercrombie's venture into black apparel is the latest in a series of changes to alter its image. Bold statement: Controversial CEO Mike Jeffries (pictured) has previously said: 'A lot of people don't belong [in our clothes], and they can't belong. Are we exclusionary? Absolutely' Transformation: Abercrombie's venture into black apparel is the latest in a series of changes to alter its image, including easing up on the perfume sprayed in stores and removing shutters that made the stores darker . In May, it was announced that the company would ease up on the fragrance that is sprayed throughout the stores. Another part of the overhaul saw the retailer get rid of the heavy, daylight-obscuring shutters on the windows in 240 stores around the U.S. Even the logos are being toned down and made less prominent. '[Abercrombie] is targeted to its customer, its customer is changing, and we're ready to change with her and him,' Mr Jeffries told Businessweek in May.","The retailer's former ban on black was enforced by CEO Mike Jeffries, who even went so far as to tell employees they couldn't wear the color to work ."
"Three days after being rescued from an Ebola-contaminated apartment in Dallas, Texas, Nina Pham's  dog Bentley is being monitored for the virus at a former Naval air field where animal services representatives say he is 'doing great'. On Tuesday, the city announced they have no plans to euthanize the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, as Spanish officials did last week to a Madrid nurse's dog when she contracted the virus - sparking outrage from animal rights activists and dog-lovers on social media. Instead, Bentley is receiving top-notch care at Hensley Field Services Center where he is checked on twice daily by  about two people, including a veterinarian, who feed him and make sure he remains healthy. Owner Nina Pham meanwhile, is being treated at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital, and was reported in good condition on Tuesday after receiving a blood transfusion from Ebola-survivor Dr Kent Brantly. Rescued: Ebola-patient Nina Pham's dog Bentley was taken out of her contaminated apartment on Saturday, a day after she reported to the hospital with a high fever - the first sign of the disease . Isolated: The Cavalier King Charles Spaniel is currently in a 21-day quarantine and an old Naval air field, where carers in full-hazamat clothing visit twice daily to feed the dog and check in on its condition. Above, another picture of the dog being taken out of Pham's apartment on Saturday . Dog-to-dog? Neighbors are worried that the dog may have left behind waste that could transmit the disease to their own pets. There are no documented cases of humans contracting the virus from dogs . Hope: Stephanie Wright and Erin Taylor, a members of the Sigma Kappa sorority,  speak to the media following a prayer vigil on the campus of TCU for  health care worker Nina Pham who contracted the Ebola virus last week . Lights: Allison Lanza, Associate Chaplin at TCU, talks with the media following a prayer vigil on the campus of TCU for  health care worker Nina Pham who contracted Ebola while treating patient Thomas Eric Duncan, who has since died . Together: Allison Lanza lights the candle of an attendee at a prayer vigil on the campus of TCU for  health care worker Nina Pham on Tuesday night in Dallas . A second nurse has since been diagnosed with the disease, as well. The city says Bentley is staying in a 'homelike environment' with comfortable bedding and plenty of toys to keep him entertained through the next three lonely weeks. Dallas Animal Services has even set up a wish list for the pup on Amazon, where members of the public can sponsor items like paper towels, a dog 'puzzle', and a ring-toss toy. Bentley is being treated just like a potential human patient under observation for the disease. He is being kept in isolation for 21 days, which is the maximum incubation period for the virus in human bodies. Animal services carers and a veterinarian in full-hazmat suiting visit Bentley twice daily to feed him and make sure he remains healthy. The view from quarantine: Dallas Animal Services posted this picture to their Facebook yesterday, showing the view from Bentley's temporary home . Outside his holding area, hazmat barrels are stationed to collect the dog's waste. 'Everyone who will be coming to contact with him will be in protective gear,' city spokesman Sana Syed told U.S. News and World Report. 'We’re being told to treat him like human case. We’re learning as we go.' There's still not enough research to determine whether dogs can spread the disease, as humans do person-to-person. However, there are no documented cases of dogs spreading Ebola. The World Health Organization says Ebola outbreaks occur when humans exchange bodily fluids with animals that act as reservoirs for the disease. It's believed that fruit bats, apes, monkeys, antelopes and porcupines can hold the disease, but not dogs. Controversial: There were protests across Spain after officials euthanized Excalibur, the dog belonging to Teresa Romero, a nurse who tested positive for the virus and is now being treated in Madrid . That uncertainly has Pham's neighbors worried however, wondering if the waste the dog left behind may lead to their own pets getting infected, and spreading the disease into the community. 'I know she's a responsible dog owner and always picks up after her dog should something be left behind; I don't know if that's how my dog could contract Ebola,' one neighbor told KHOU. Bentley was taken from Pham's home on Saturday, a day after she reported to the hospital when her temperature spiked. The 26-year-old nurse from Fort Worth contracted the virus while treating Thomas Eric Duncan, the Liberian  who became the first man diagnosed with the disease in the U.S. Duncan died from the disease last Wednesday, after spending 11 days in the hospital. When Pham's parents found out about her diagnoses, they pleaded with a judge to save the dog. Appeal: The 26-year-old's family made an emotional appeal to save Bentley as Pham is quarantined . County Judge Clay Jenkins agreed and ordered Dallas Animal Services to take the dog into quarantine for monitoring. 'When I met with her parents, they said: 'This dog is important to her, judge. Don't let anything happen to the dog,' Judge Jenkins told USA Today. 'If that dog has to be The Boy In The Plastic Bubble, we're going to take good care of that dog.' The Boy In The Plastic Bubble is a 1976 made-for-TV movie starring John Travolta, which tells the story of a boy who has to live out of an incubator because he has such a poor immune system. 'As our brave healthcare worker told us, this dog is a significant part of her life and we vowed to her family we would do everything in our power to care for her beloved pet,' Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings in a statement. 'I am thankful to the team who has made sure to take every precaution to protect the public health while transporting, monitoring and caring for this dog at a new, safe location. We will continue to monitor and care for this pet while following all guidance and protocols of the CDC.'","Dallas, Texas nurse Nina Pham was diagnosed with Ebola on Saturday, and her dog Bentley was ordered into the care of the city's animal services .

"From soggy bottoms to hot baps, innuendo has become as much a part of the Great British Bake Off as the cakes, bread and biscuits. But some viewers think it has gone a double entendre too far.They have complained to the BBC about ‘constant smutty remarks’, saying they make it embarrassing for families to watch together. The BBC has been keen to use the risqué subtext as a selling point for the show, with the official BBC1 Twitter account creating the #BakeOffInnuendo hashtag for fans to discuss the jokes and even naming their ‘Innuendo of the Week’ from each episode. Scroll down for video . Double act Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins (right) have come under fire for their saucy presenting style on the Great British Bake Off . Last week’s winner was judge Paul Hollywood’s explanation of why crimping – sealing the edge of a pie – is so important: ‘The crimp is critical… To stop any leakage from the meat.’ However, some audience members are less impressed and they turned to BBC programme Points of View to air their concerns. The show, which examines viewers’ opinions on BBC content, received this letter from Barbara and Robin Phelps: ‘[We are] tired of the constant smutty remarks of the two hosts, Sue Perkins (mostly) and Mel Giedroyc (sometimes). Please ask them to stop spoiling an otherwise delightful programme.’ Throughout the five series of the show, the comedy duo have come out with such lines as: ‘Stand away from your hot baps’, ‘You have got two hours to pop Mary’s cherry’ and ‘Stop touching your dough balls’. Sue laughed off complaints saying she was more worried about her Dutch accent impression . While some viewers like this aspect of the programme, those contacting Points of View said it makes them uncomfortable. Shirley Fooks complained: ‘They get smuttier and smuttier, and it’s totally unnecessary ... Mary Berry looked quite embarrassed on the first programme of this series, and so were we as a family.’ The programme’s companion show, An Extra Slice, which sees a panel of celebrity guests discuss the most recent episode with comedienne Jo Brand, also came in for criticism. 'We all know what makes a great drinks party. Keys in a bowl.' - Sue . 'OK bakers. You're halfway through. It's very much in the baking interval. Bring out the dancing girls with the segmented oranges. Half time.' - Sue . 'Wow. Derriere comme une peche.' (bottom like a peach) - Sue . 'Keep an eye on your jugs.' - Mel . 'Bakers are doing their best to get an extra inch.' - Mel . 'Time to slap those baps down.' - Sue . 'Get those ladyfingers soggy.' - Sue . 'There it is looking perfectly stiff.' - Mary Berry showing Paul Hollwood how to whisk his egg white . Points of View showed several controversial clips including one where Mel and Sue told the contestants they had to pop Mary Berry's (second left) cherry, also pictured with judge Paul Hollywood . Viewer Jean Harris said: ‘It seemed full of innuendo, it was lewd, it was mucky, why don’t we just call it the Jo Brand show and then just forget baking?’ Miss Perkins, 45, tweeted a response to the complaints: ‘Mel/Sue complaints on POV don’t bother me, it’s the European Parliament’s ruling on our “Dutch” accents I’m dreading...’ referring to an episode earlier this series when they put on mock-European accents. The BBC has received seven complaints regarding the show’s innuendo, compared to more than 800 about ‘bin-gate’ when a contestant was sent home after throwing away his melted baked Alaska. A spokesman for the Great British Bake Off declined to comment. BBC received seven complaints regarding the show’s innuendo, compared to more than 800 about ‘bin-gate’ Mel and Sue even made a kinky joke about being locked up in 'a love dungeon' with married Paul Hollywood . Gardening programmes are being forgotten as the BBC prioritises cookery shows, according to disgruntled viewers. Points of View compiled figures showing the Corporation broadcast 21 hours of cookery-related shows last week but only two and a half hours of horticulture. Viewers complained on POV that this ‘sends a message that gardening is second class’. Others criticised how often Gardeners’ World is rescheduled on BBC2 if it conflicts with sporting events and the fact that it has been moved to later in the evening schedule. However, a BBC spokesman said it had been responding to viewer feedback and more actually watched the show in a later slot.","Viewers complained about smutty innuendos on The Great British Bake Off .

The body of Rika Okada, 29, was sent 230 miles to a storage warehouse in Hachioji city, west of Tokyo. On the package the killer, believed to be a woman, had written 'handle with care, life-size replica human doll'. The company that transferred the package from Osaka to Tokyo said that the order was paid in Ms Okada's name.

"Overshoppers: The study found that Brits are 'simply buying too much food' Britain is a wasteful nation of overshoppers which throws away a staggering £15.1 billion worth of food every year, shock new figures have revealed. A study of supermarket spending habits in the UK found that the average household is buying too much food, meaning we bin over £500 worth of groceries each year. It was also claimed that nearly half of the country regularly throws away packets of food which are never opened. The research, which is supported by green campaigners Lover Food Hate Waste, aims stinging criticism at wasteful Brits and their inability to be economic with basic shopping. It said almost half of shoppers in the country do not fully understand how 'best before' dates work and 82 per cent of people don't know how to use their fridge compartments properly, meaning more food goes bad quickly. As well as being uneconomic buyers of food, Brits were also said to be wasteful in the kitchen. The study revealed that around 46 per cent of those who cook a home meal will throw food away because they've prepared too much. Researchers working on behalf of Samsung polled 2,000 UK consumers over the age of 18 who owned a fridge and contributed towards the food shopping in their households. In a revealing insight into British shopping habits, it was established that almost three quarters of Brits do a ‘big’ shop once a week, with 83 per cent of those admitting to topping up with fresh food between shops. The foods that Brits believe they throw away most regularly are ready meals, fresh meat, milk and fruit juices, home made meals and diary items like cheese and yoghurt. Waste: Three quarters of Brits do a weekly 'big shop' with a further 83 per cent of those buy more in the week . With a tiny proportion of those polled saying they measure food before they cook it, researchers sau that overbuying may not be as bad a problem if food were stored more efficiently. But the vast majority of respondents admitted that they don't use fridge compartments for any kind of coherent storage system and only eighteen per cent of those polled have a strict system of storing food in their fridge-freezer. Run down: The table, compiled by researchers at Samsung, shows Britain's most wasteful regions . The confusion over 'use by' and best before dates remains a problem, with almost half of people surveyed saying they don't know the difference. The results a questionnaire showed that 45 per cent of the sample shoppers are not guided by the 'use by' date, which is the definitive guide of when a food be thrown away. Instead, they get rid of groceries based on their ‘Best Before’ dates, even though food outside of these dates can often still be safe to eat if it they been stored properly. As well as laying bare the nation's wastefulness as a whole, the study established the worst regions for being economical with their food with the West Midlands being named 'waste capital'. The average household in the region estimates that they throw out £731.64 worth of food every year, almost 30% more than the national claimed average. Lana Sanleandro, Head of Marketing for Samsung Home Appliances, said: 'Food wastage is a huge issue in the UK and something that every household contributes to, which this study clearly shows. 'But it's also something that everyone can do something about, whether that be through better management of the weekly shop, more preparation when making meals and simply by learning about the best conditions to store different sorts of foods.' Emma Marsh, Head of Love Food Hate Waste added: 'There are simple steps we can all take to cut food waste, such as making better use of our fridges and freezers.' Cities of shame: Aberystwyth is named the UK's most wasteful city in the damning survey of 2,000 Brits .","Brits is branded a nation of 'overshoppers' by shocking new study .

"Thousands of patients are dying in hospital each year because of bad handwriting, errors in maths and poor monitoring by nursing, according to a study. The death rate at two hospitals fell by 15 per cent after nurses were given electronic devices in place of handwritten paper notes to record patients’ heart rates and breathing. Researchers calculated that 750 deaths were prevented in a year at the two hospitals, Queen Alexandria in Portsmouth and University Hospital in Coventry. At present, nurses are meant to measure patients’ heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen levels and take certain other readings and note them down on a board at the end of the bed: There is no suggestion that these nurses have illegible handwriting (File photo) Across the NHS, this means 37,000 deaths could be avoided if nurses were given the devices rather than relying on traditional handwritten notes from nurses. At present, nurses are meant to measure patients’ heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen levels and take certain other readings and note them down on a board at the end of the bed. Often these readings aren’t taken regularly enough and in some patients there are gaps of between eight and 12 hours between measures. In other cases, nurses handwriting is illegible or they don’t note down all the figures meaning it is not clear for their colleagues to monitor patients. To address the problem of poor handwriting, hand-held devices were given to nurses at Queen Alexandra hospital in Portsmouth (above) To address the problem, hand-held devices were given to nurses at Queen Alexandra hospital in Portsmouth in 2005 and at University Hospitals in Coventry in 2007. They were handed either iPhones or iPads – small computers – installed with an app that takes patients readings and reminds nurses when they are next needed. An alert flashes up on the screen if patients are deteriorating and in some cases they will urge nurses to summon a doctor. Researchers compared the death rates for every year from 2004 – before the devices were used – to 2010. They annual death rates fell by 397 at Portsmouth and by 372 deaths at University Hospitals Coventry in 2010 compared to 2004. Dr Paul Schmidt of Portsmouth Hospitals NHS Trust, one of the leaders of the project, said: ‘Observing patients and making accurate records provides a safety net to guard against their deterioration. ‘We believed traditional paper charts were not doing the job well enough so we designed an electronic system to support staff. This study shows its introduction was followed by a significant drop in deaths.” Dr Duncan Watson of University Hospital Coventry, who also worked on the project, said: ‘This technology improves the performance of routine but important tasks and frees up clinical staff to do what only human beings can do – care for patients.” Many of the deaths avoided would have occurred in the elderly who had developed pneumonia or infections which would otherwise have been spotted too late. Typically they cost around £500,000 to roll out across a medium-sized hospital trust and about 40 are now using them in at leat one department.","Researchers calculated 750 deaths prevented in a year at the hospitals .

"A healthy Italian woman paid a Swiss right-to-die clinic to take her life because she was 'unhappy about losing her looks'. Oriella Cazzanello, 85, travelled to a clinic in Basel, Switzerland, where she paid €10,000 for an assisted suicide. The elderly woman, who was in good mental and physical health, disappeared from her home in Arzignano, near Vicenza in northern Italy, without telling her relatives where she was going. Oriella Cazzanello , 85, who committed suicide using a Swiss euthanasia centre, because she was depressed about losing her looks. Her family only found out about her death ashes and a death certificate were posted to her lawyer in Italy . Building of the assisted suicide clinic, Dignitas in Pfaeffikon near Zurich, one of the major assisted suicide clinics that exist in Switzerland. Dignitas is the largest non-physician assisted suicide group in Switzerland, and is well known because of it's involvement in many British euthanasia cases . Her family, who had reported her to the police as missing, only learnt of her death after they received her ashes and death certificate from the clinic. Mrs Cazzanello chose to end her life because she was ‘weighed down by ageing and the inevitable loss of the looks of which she was proud’ the Italian news agency ANSA reported. The well-to-do pensioner was also suffering from loneliness. Her brother and other relatives had not heard from her since the end of January, but were not unduly concerned, as Mrs Cazzanello, was an ‘independent’ person who would often take herself on spa weekends. Assisted suicide amongst Britons and members of the EU has long been a controversial issue. In 2006, the Daily Mail reported the story of Anne Turner who ended her life to escape life with an incurable brain disease in a heartbreaking case which set the debate over assisted suicide raging . But as the days went passed they became worried and reported her as missing to the police. Earlier this week her lawyer received her ashes and death certificate by post and broke the devastating news. Assisted suicide is legal in Switzerland even if the person requesting it is not terminally ill. Although legal in Switzerland, assisted suicide is a criminal offence in the UK and carries a maximum prison sentence of 14 years. 16 per cent of those who travel to a suicide clinic had no serious health problem, but had become ‘weary of life’, a study by the University of Bern found this week. More than 200 Brits have died at Swiss suicide clinics in the past decade. Top orchestral conductor Sir Edward Downes, 85, and his 74-year-old wife Joan died at the Dignitas clinic in 2009. Lady Downes had terminal cancer while her husband was nearly blind and becoming increasingly deaf. Daniel James, 23, who was paralysed in a rugby accident, became the youngest Briton to die at the clinic in 2010. His parents Julie and Mark James said the ex-England under-16 rugby player had repeatedly said he wanted to die.","Oriella Caszzenello paid €10,000 for an assisted suicide in the Swiss clinic .

It is thought  around 6,000 German troops died in the explosions and the Ridge was quickly taken by General Sir Herbert Plumer's Second Army . A view over Gallipoli. At the height of the vicious fighting during the Gallipoli landings of April 25, 1915, the waters around the peninsula were stained red with blood. The British hoped the campaign would help them get to Constantinople and that they would link up with the Russians. The intention of this was to then knock Turkey out of the war - but it was a massive failure and resulted in huge losses . St Symphorien Cemetery just east of Mons.

He said: 'This collection represents a legacy which I hope will create a gateway to the battlefields themselves. 'I want to encourage people to visit these historic landscapes during the centennial period and create an awareness and understanding of the events and historical implications of the First World War.'

During the war the little village formed a part of the French lines . The German Cemetery Tetes des Faux is situated at 1208m on a peak to the south of Weiss Valley with extensive views of the surrounding region. It was the scene of bitter fighting, but despite repeated assaults it was held by Germans who built extensive bunkers, block houses and trench systems on the hillside, supplied by funicular railways from the valley below . This image shows Belleau Wood near the Marne River in France. The Battle of Belleau Wood  occurred during the German 1918 Spring Offensive and was one of the most important battles for the US forces.

"Downton Abbey chiefs have come under fire for running Kindle adverts that 'ruin the period drama's atmosphere'. The adverts show actors in 1920s costume using the devices on the set during breaks from filming the ITV show. Viewers of the opening episode on Sunday night used Twitter to complain about the promotional spots which 'ruined the illusion' and 'killed the magic' of the show. Scroll down for video . Viewers of the opening episode of the fifth series complained about the 'bumper' ads before, after and during the commercial breaks for the Amazon eReader which 'ruined the illusion' and 'killed the magic' of the show . Viewers took to Twitter to complain about the adverts which showed the actors holding Kindle's while still dressed in 1920s costume. Fans said the adverts did not fit in with the period drama's concept nor its plotline . Kate Vando said: 'The stupid Kindle advert is ruining the Downton Abbey magic for me. 'What sick ad agency came up with that idea?' Chris Wimpress said: 'What spectacularly awful Kindle bumpers on Downton – unravels the drama before it even starts.' And Henrietta Bird added: 'You don't want to see actors on a set – breaks the period drama spell.' The Kindle deal came in for the most criticism when the abbey went up in flames after Lady Edith threw her book into the fire – with viewers questioning whether they were witnessing some sort of subtle product placement. Downton Abbey character Jane Moorsum . Another Twitter user Barbara said: 'You know Downton is sponsored by a Kindle when a paperback sets fire to the house.' Fans also pointed out that the sponsorship deal did not fit with the plotline, which saw members of the household unable to deal with changes in modern technology. In 2011, the show was criticised for having one minute of advertising for every three minutes of drama. A former sponsor, Aviva, drew complaints after showing a motorcyclist getting knocked off his bike and sustaining serious injuries. The audience branded the ads 'depressing' and said they would put them off ever buying insurance policies from the company. An ITV spokesman said: 'We work closely with sponsors in an attempt to ensure that their idents and creative concepts are complementary to the shows that they appear in. 'We apologise to any viewers who felt this was not achieved in last night's Downton Abbey.' An average of 8.1million viewers tuned in to watch the start of the fifth series – one million fewer than last year's premiere. When the series launched in 2010, 7.7million watched the first episode. In comparison, series two and three attracted around 9million for their openers. The figures will fuel rumours that Downton creator Julian Fellowes will decide to end the show sooner than previously hinted.","Downton Abbey adverts accused of 'ruining period drama's atmosphere'

"A Florida police chief has come to the defense of his officers after a video surfaced on YouTube showing two white Boynton Beach cops dragging a black youth out of a car and threatening his friend with a gun during a traffic stop. The brief, often shaky cell phone video laced with profanities, which was recorded in February 2013, was uploaded online last month by the user TRAGEDYDAHOTBOY under the title, ‘1 of my encounters with Boynton beach pd…’ The clip begins with a mustachioed and bespectacled police sergeant having a barely audible exchange with the driver of the car and its other occupants, asking them where they live. Scroll down for video . Traffic stop: A passenger's cell phone camera was rolling in February 2013 when their car was stopped by police officers in Boynton Beach, Florida . Figure of authority: This unnamed police sergeant asked for the driver's ID because his car entered a 2-mile perimeter set up after an armed home invasion in the area . Bearing witness: An occupant of the car had his cell phone on hand to record their run-in with police . The officer encounters pushback from the driver, who demands to know why he needs to show his ID card. 'You're driving the car - that's why I need your ID,' replies the sergeant, then adding, 'I need everybody’s ID.' One of the occupants of the vehicle says that he is going to start recording the traffic stop. 'Turn that phone off right now,' the sergeant orders the young man sitting in the back. ‘No, I have rights. I’m not intimidated, I have right, sir. I'm recording your ass...b****, you're on camera,’ the passenger defiantly declares to the cop. One of the men then asks the bearded cop to provide his badge number and name, but the officer keeps mum, prompting the occupant of the vehicle to pull out his cell phone to try and take a photo of the officer's name tag. The situation quickly escalates when the sergeant slaps the phone out of the man’s hand, drags him out of the car and places him face-down on the grass. The passenger’s friends could be heard in the background crying out in disbelief. A moment later, the sergeant’s partner jumps into action, charging at the vehicle with his gun drawn. The cop thrusts his weapon inside the cabin, telling one of the men inside: ‘I’ll put a round in your a** so quick.’ Escalation: The sergeant slapped the phone from a young man's hands (left) for recording him and then dragged him out of the vehicle and put him face-down in the grass (right) Armed and dangerous: A second officer charged at the car with his service weapon drawn . On Tuesday, Boynton Beach Police Chief Jeffrey Katz posted a detailed comment in reaction to the YouTube video, defending the actions of the officer who was recorded pointing his service weapon inside a car occupied by several young men and threatening to shoot them for refusing to stop filming. Chief Katz wrote that he first watched the recording a year ago, and lamented that it continues to surface 'despite the fact nobody has made a complaint or provided helpful information from which we could put this incident in context or take corrective action if applicable.' According to the chief, his staff investigated the incident and determined that the traffic stop took place on February 4, 2013. Katz explained that the young men in the car were stopped by police because they were within a 2-mile perimeter the officers had set up after a home invasion where the perpetrators were armed with a machete. Aggressive action: The cop thrust his weapon inside the cabin, telling one of the men inside: ‘I’ll put a round in your a** so quick’ ‘The persons within the vehicle were – as you can see on the video – less than cooperative and, in some cases antagonistic toward the officers,' Katz wrote in reaction to the video. He added that the sergeant 'felt threatened' when he saw the driver reach out of the window holding a black object in his hand - which turned out to be his cell phone. Advocate: Boynton Beach Police Chief Jeffrey Katz has defended his officers, insisting that their actions were justifiable in light of the antagonism displayed by the young men in the car . Chief Katz proceeded to point a finger of blame at the occupants of the car, who allegedly acted with antagonism towards the officers during the traffic stop, and by doing so provoked the escalation of the cops’ 'stress response.’ ‘When I watch this video, I don’t see a car full of young men who are behaving in a manner consistent with fear of the police,’ Katz stated. ‘These young men are escalating this incident, being uncooperative with officers who are investigating a violent crime, and recording their interaction – presumably with the hopes of catching a “gotcha” moment on the part of our personnel. ‘I hate to disappoint them, but no gotcha moment exists here…which is why I suspect nobody ever came forward to make a complaint about this.’ This is not the first time that Boynton Beach police officers were accused of using excessive force and resorting to brutality. In May of this year, another cell phone video surfaced online showing officers apparently putting a sixth-grader in a choke-hold and kicking him to the ground. At the time, a police spokesman said that no formal complaint has been filed in connection to the incident, but one officer was placed on administrative leave. The video of the February 2013 police altercation comes at a time when law enforcement agencies around the nation are facing intense scrutiny, especially in their dealings with black youths, in light of Michael Brown's killing in Ferguson, Missouri.","A cell phone video of the confrontation was recorded February 4, 2013, in Boynton Beach, Florida .

"Some New Yorkers too caught up in the rat race to make breakfast at home grab it to go from Dunkin' Donuts, but they may want to rethink that bagel after watching these videos. Two videos uploaded to YouTube on Tuesday show rats crawling around a New York City Dunkin' Donuts location in the Garmnet District. In the first video, uploaded by user 'Pjayone', a rat is seen making its way from the top of a display rack, touching croissants, bagels and other baked goods in open tubs. Scroll down for video .

'At two-thirty [in the morning] every [day] the workers load the shelves with the morning's wares. Shortly thereafter like clockwork the rats come out and party.' 'My phone ran out of power, or I would've filmed the outright nine deep rat assault which followed the action above,' he added. 'The items in the video that are being besieged upon by the rats were to be sold for that mornings breakfast rush.' The location captured in the video has an 'A' rating from the city's health department, despite getting a citation for vermin-related issues in November 2013. The citation called the facility 'not vermin proof. Harboarge or conditions conductive to attracting vermin to the premises and/or allowed vermin to exist.'

"She is the real life Rapunzel with 55ft long dreadlocks that are longer than a bus. Despite being warned by doctors that her hair that weighs three stone could paralyse her, Asha Mandela said she will never cut them. The mother-of-one from Atlanta, Georgia, said: 'My hair has become part of me. It is my life. I will never cut it. Scroll down for video . Record Breaking: Asha Mandela started growing her hair 25 years ago following a 'spiritual calling' Rapunzel: Mrs Mandela's hair is over 19ft long but one dread lock is more than 55ft long . Dangerous: Doctors have warned Mrs Mandela that her three stone hair could paralyse her . 'Cutting it would be equivalent to suicide. It would be like being a zombie.' Mrs Mandela, 47, holds the Guinness World Record for the longest dreadlocks. She calls her hair 'her baby' and credits them with helping her overcome cancer, two strokes and two heart-attacks. Her incredible hair has also brought her fans across the world and she has launched her own secret hair formula on the back of her success. It takes two days to wash and dry her hair, which weighs the same as a reception-age child, and is even heavier when wet. It can also get easily trapped in doors or snag on bushes. She has to wind it up into a baby sling when she leaves the house which gives her a greater degree of freedom. But Mrs Mandela worries that 'someone with a hair fetish' will cut off a lock of her hair when she is not looking. Family affair: Asha Mandela's son Zion, 11, (second from right) holds up her dreadlocks alongside friends Alexis and Egypt Rose . Heavy: Medics said her hair has caused a curvature of the spine and for her neck to collapse at the back . Freedom: She carries her dreadlocks in a baby sling so it is easier for her to walk around . Helping hand: Friend Egypt Rose Crooks holds the dreadlocks as Mrs Mandela walks through a park . Doctors have also asked her to consider cutting her hair for health reasons, including the risk of bacterial infection. But their main concern is the weight. She said: 'The doctors seem to think I have a curvature of my spine and that it's the length and the weight of my hair that's making me curve. 'Some have said my neck has collapsed at the back and that I need to be careful because I could start having spasms in my spine and probably be paralysed.' Mrs Mandela, who has a 11-year-old son, Zion, with her second husband, said her hair has helped her love life. She said: 'My hair has never caused a problem with intimacy. I think it adds a little spice on top.' Mrs Mandela, who is happily married to her third husband, was born in Trinidad and Tobago. She began growing her hair 25 years ago following a 'spiritual calling'. Her baby: Despite the weight of the dreadlocks, Mrs Mandela said she would feel like a 'zombie' without them . On display: Mrs Mandela stands on a ladder (left) and at the top of the stairs (right) to show off her World Record-breaking dreadlocks . Part of her: Mrs Mandela credits her dreadlocks with helping her battle cancer . Her mother did not want her to because she thought it would make her daughter more likely to start smoking cannabis. She even carried on growing her hair while undergoing chemotherapy. Eventually a friend suggested she speak to Guinness and in 2009 they crowned her with the title of world's longest dreadlocks. They officially measured 19ft 6in but an unofficial measurement this week put one strand of her hair at an incredible 55ft 7in long - almost three times the official length.

"'All-nighter': Moritz Erhardt, 21, had been working gruelling hours as an intern at an investment bank . A young student has died in mysterious circumstances while employed as an intern at a top investment bank – amid claims he was asked to work punishingly long hours. The body of Moritz Erhardt was discovered on Thursday evening as he neared the end of a seven-week internship with the Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s investment bank division. The 21-year-old – understood to be from Germany but studying at the University of Michigan – had joined Merrill Lynch earlier in the summer hoping to forge a career with the firm. Paid interns at the bank normally earn £45,000 a year pro rata - around £2,700 a month. Yesterday it was claimed Mr Erhardt may have suffered a fit or seizure. However internet forum users said he may have been working ‘all-nighters’ during his stay with the company. Many banks are known to encourage their young students to work late into the night and in the past there have been claims those keen to impress have put in long hours with very little sleep. On one site, called wallstreetoasis.com, many posters insisted Mr Erhardt regularly worked long hours and added: ‘One of the best interns at BAML – three all-nighters, didn’t turn up, colleagues went to find him.’ Mr Erhardt had been living in the Claredale House student accommodation flats in Bethnal Green, East London. The apartments are rented out to hundreds of interns during the summer months. Another poster on the wallstreetoasis.com site added: ‘It is absolutely true – he was found dead in the shower by his flatmate. Intern at BAML who went home at 6am three days in a row.’ On Friday staff at the Claredale complex issued a statement to residents, part of which read: ‘Some of you might be aware that the emergency services were called to Claredale yesterday evening. ‘The reason for this is that we were made aware of an incident involving one of our residents. Sadly the resident concerned had passed away. ‘To avoid any rumours or misinformation, we would like to inform you all that there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding the death.’ Long hours: Mr Erhardt was near the end of his seven-week summer internship with Bank of America Merrill Lynch International in London when he died . In recent years interns have told of working long hours at investment banks. One 20-year-old told London’s Evening Standard in 2011 that ‘you work whatever hours you’re  asked to’. He added: ‘Every intern’s worst nightmare is what’s called “the Magic Roundabout” – which is when you get a taxi to drive you home at 7am and then it waits for you while you shower and change and then takes you back to the office.’ Another 24-year-old told the same newspaper: ‘About 100 hours a week was the minimum and the average was probably 110. I worked six-and-a-half days a week.’ A source at Bank of America Merrill Lynch said Mr Erhardt had completed previous internships at other investment banks but could not confirm or deny claims he had worked exceptionally long hours. Summer stay: Mr Erhardt, from Germany, had been staying at Claredale House in Bethnal Green, London, during his internship . However he insisted staff are given both ‘mentors’ and ‘buddies’ when they join the firm and are monitored by staff from the human resources department. The source added Mr Erhardt was very well-liked by members of staff and there will now be a post mortem examination and inquest into his death. A statement from BAML said: ‘We are deeply shocked and saddened by the news of Moritz Erhardt’s death. 'He was popular amongst his peers and was a highly diligent intern at our company with a promising future. ‘Our first thoughts are with his family and we send our condolences to them at this difficult time.’","Moritz Erhardt had been interning with investment bank Merrill Lynch .

The saucy Spanish teacher was fired late last week, according to the Dallas Observer, only days after her naughty past was in the media. Though she was not a Dallas Independent School District employee at the time the pictures were taken, administrators may have deemed her past inappropriate for a 21-year-old teaching students only a few years younger. Ms Deweese has not waged a public battle with the school, instead focusing on the students. 'I miss the kids, so I'm sad about that, but otherwise I'm doing fine,' she tweeted. After thanking someone for their support, she tweeted 'I'm just hoping they find a new teacher soon so it doesn't affect the students.' The former Playboy Coed of the Month (February 2011) looks to have moved on from being a teacher for the time being, based on a profile started on Model Mayhem. 'I've been modeling since I was 12, quit for a while to pursue teaching and now I'm back,' she wrote on the site. Cristy Nicole Deweese (pictured left) is now a Spanish teacher in Dallas, Texas. When she was 18, she posed as 'Coed of the month' for Playboy . Staying positive: Despite no longer being a teacher, Ms Deweese has remained positive and not hit out against the Dallas ISD - but she may have hired a lawyer . Though saying on Twitter she's unable to discuss her firing for now - perhaps a sign she's retained a lawyer, according to the Observer - she posted a picture on the social media site of herself before going 'on-camera. She then tweeted a picture of herself on TV that she says her mother took. It is not clear if that on-camera  appearance was a modeling audition or for another reason. Ms Deweese also tweeted that she signed a contract saying she can't do any media interviews until November 8. Miss Deweese's sexy shots are available for all to see online - including the teenage boys she currently teaches. Among her pictures are full-frontal naked shots, photos of her wearing 'winter bunny gear' and lingerie, a simulated lesbian sex scene and a 'Naked Outdoors' gallery. In a behind-the-scenes video clip from the photoshoot, when asked about her hobbies, the teenager says: 'Hunting, shooting... I shot me a buck last year.' Model behavior: Miss Deweese relaxes and eats beef jerky in between modeling for Playboy's 'coed of the month' in 2011 . She adds that she is majoring in Spanish and 'going to be a Spanish teacher'. One parent, who wished to remain anonymous, told the Dallas Morning News, . that although her Playboy past should not prevent Miss Deweese from . being a teacher, it did affect the way she is viewed by some students. 'Are her male 16- and 17-year-old students looking at her without picturing her nude?' Another added. 'And for the female students, is this someone they can respect as an educator, someone that they can look up to?' The Dallas school district would not comment on Miss Deweese's pictures, saying that it was a 'personnel matter'. She was not employed by the school district at the time the pictures were taken.","Cristy Nicole Deweese posed naked for the magazine when she was 18 as a 'coed of the month'

"Home Office Minister Norman Baker said Britain should consider introducing an Ebola screening programme for visitors arriving at UK airports as four major hospitals were put on standby in case the virus reaches the country. Mr Baker said the case for increased screening at UK airports should be examined in light of the 'very concerning' development in Madrid where a nurse has become the first person to contract the Ebola virus outside Africa. Chief medical officer, Dame Sally Davies, issued a 'high alert' to all NHS staff, warning they be vigilant. She urged all health professionals to take a full travel history from any patient who comes to see them complaining or showing signs of a fever. Meanwhile Prime Minister David Cameron is today chairing a meeting of the Government's emergency Cobra committee. Scroll down for video . Travellers entering the UK will not be routinely screened for the deadly Ebola virus, health officials said . Public Health England said while the risk of Ebola reaching British shores is low, the country has 'robust , well-developed and well-tested NHS systems for managing unusual infectious diseases' It comes as a Spanish nurse was diagnosed with the virus, in the first case where a person has contracted Ebola without having visited West Africa. An ambulance carrying the nurse arrived at Carlos III Hospital in Madrid yesterday . And it emerged the Royal Free Hospital in London, Liverpool University NHS Foundation Trust, Newcastle Upon Tyne Hospitals Foundation Trust and Sheffield Teaching Hospitals Foundation are on standby to take in Ebola patients if the virus reaches the UK. 'It is unlikely but not impossible that people infected in Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia could arrive in the UK while incubating the disease and develop symptoms after their return,' Dame Davies said. Earlier this week U.S. president Barack Obama indicated that Washington plans to screen incoming air passengers for signs of the virus. The UK has only two high-level containment beds – both at the Royal Free – with no isolation units available in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. But a contingency plan is in place to send protective equipment to the other three hospitals if necessary. Universities and schools have also been sent advice warning them to look out for pupils showing signs of fever who have come from West Africa. Last night, Mr Baker told The Independent: 'We need to consider whether existing controls are adequate.' Meanwhile the country's largest NHS trust has put patients on alert for signs they are infected with the virus. Barts Health, in London, has warning notices in its A&E departments at The Royal London, Whipps Cross and Newham hospitals, the Evening Standard reported. The posters urge people to tell staff if they have returned from West Africa and have a fever or high temperature. Isolation bays have been established at the hospitals, away from A&E units to minimise risk to other patients. Home Office Minister Norman Baker said Britain should consider introducing an Ebola screening programme . Following news of the case of the Spanish nurse, pictured leaving Alcorcon hospital in Madrid, the World Health Organisation said it is 'unavoidable' more cases will be diagnosed in Europe . Meanwhile, in Oslo medical teams received their country's first Ebola victim after a Doctors Without Borders worker flew home after testing positive for the virus . The notices state: 'Important notice: If you have travelled to any of the countries listed below - Sierra Leone, Nigeria, Guinea, Liberia - in the last 21 days and you have a fever/temperature, please let a member of staff know immediately.' Barts spokesman told the paper: 'It’s just common sense. If you look at our demographic, a lot of our patients travel to areas which have been affected.' Earlier this week, scientists at Boston's Northeastern University, calculated the odds of the virus spreading to Europe, based on flight patterns and said there was a 50-50 chance of it hitting Britain in 16 days - by October 24. Mr Cameron is chairing a meeting of the Government's emergency Cobra committee  today. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today Programme Dr David Heymann, chairman of Public Health England and a professor of Infectious Disease Epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said the meeting was the latest in a series of Ebola briefings. He said: 'Cobra has been meeting regularly and discussing it regularly – it is not the first meeting. ‘There is certainly not a crisis in the UK. The UK is prepared, having been prepared over many, many years to deal with this.’ The researchers at Northeastern University, in Boston, calculated the countries most at risk in the short term, are: . Ahead of the meeting, the PM spoke to the president of Sierra Leone Ernest Bai Koroma, who said the situation in his country continues to be 'very serious'. Mr Cameron assured him the UK will continue to do everything it can to support his administration's efforts to battle the disease. Britain has already provided aid totalling £125 million. Downing Street stressed that the meeting in Whitehall was one of a regular series of meetings and had been in the PM's diary for some time. A Number 10 spokesman said: 'As part of the Government's ongoing efforts to combat the outbreak of Ebola in West Africa, the Prime Minister will chair this week's Cobra meeting on Wednesday. 'This is part of an ongoing series of Cobra meetings to co-ordinate the UK response that started in late July and has been in the diary for some time. 'Ahead of the meeting, the Prime Minister called President Koroma of Sierra Leone on Tuesday evening to get the latest on the situation there and the help they need. 'The Prime Minister and President Koroma discussed how the £125 million in UK aid was helping efforts, including support for 700 extra beds in key treatment centres and training for medical staff. 'The President said the situation continued to be very serious and they were increasing their response, with a need to train more medical staff, have a better system for servicing treatment centres and improve the burial process. 'The Prime Minister said the UK would continue to do all it could to support their efforts.' A team of scientists at Northeastern University in Boston have used air travel information to predict where the deadly Ebola virus could reach in the next three weeks . More than 100 British army medical staff are preparing to deploy to Sierra Leone to set up a hospital to help treat other healthcare workers who have contracted the disease while treating victims . Personnel from the 22 Field Hospital in Hampshire have been in training, wearing protective gear, and treating simulated patients . Experts have warned that the UK is at risk because of Heathrow’s status as a major air hub and the flights it receives from western Africa where 7,200 people have been infected with 3,400 dying. Last night the World Health Organisation warned that the spread of Ebola across Europe is ‘unavoidable’. But European director Zsuzsanna Jakab said ‘the western part of the European region particularly is the best prepared in the world to respond to viral haemorrhagic fevers’. In Madrid, bosses of the Carlos III Hospital were trying to establish how nurse Teresa Romero Ramos, 44, contracted the virus. She was part of a medical team that cared for priest Manuel Garcia Viejo, 75, who died of Ebola last month after travelling back to Spain from Sierra Leone. Four other people, including the nurse’s husband Javier Limon Romero, have been placed in isolation. The couple’s pet dog, Excalibur, was seized in case it had been infected. Madrid’s regional government said it would put the dog down and incinerate its body. Hospital chiefs insisted that the correct measures had been followed and said they were investigating how the virus spread. But medical staff claimed they were given protective suits that lacked breathing apparatus and were not completely impermeable. More than 100 British Army medics are preparing to travel to Sierra Leone to help as back-up. The unprecedented Ebola outbreak this year has killed more than 3,400 people in West Africa, infecting around 7,500, causing concerns it could escalate to the rest of the world.","Prime Minister David Cameron is chairing a Cobra committee meeting today .

"The BBC was criticised yesterday for not describing the armed jihadists behind the Kenya shopping centre siege as terrorists. The corporation’s journalists have avoided using the words ‘terrorist’ and ‘terrorism’ in reports. Instead, they described the terrorists as ‘Islamist militants’ or ‘suspected Al Shabaab militants’ - and only used the word terrorist in when quoting someone else. Beating around the bush? BBC News coverage of the violence in Nairobi, Kenya, has repeatedly referred to the perpetrators as 'militants', rather than the using the word terrorists, leading to criticism from politicians . Critics said the BBC was guilty of . ‘covering’ for the jihadists. One senior backbench MP said the BBC was . ‘out of touch’ on the issue. Douglas Murray, associate director of . the Henry Jackson Society think-tank, said: ‘By not calling these . jihadists what they actually are, the BBC is effectively covering for . them. ‘No-one wants to say they are jihadis, which they are. No-one wants to say they are Islamic extremists, which they are. ‘Most . people know what these people are and it’s only certain sections of . government and the media which refuses to point the finger.’ Rob . Wilson, Conservative MP for Reading East, said: ‘Most members of the . British public would see the planned and systematic murder of dozens of . innocent people in Kenya as terrorism. BBC News presenter Ben Brown delivers the headlines: It is understood that BBC guidance issued to staff tells them to avoid using the term 'terrorist' without attribution, but politicians have reacted with anger . ‘Sadly, . the BBC looks like it has made a bad judgement call on this and is out . of touch with ordinary people on a very important issue.’ 'By not calling these jihadists what they actually are, the BBC is effectively covering for them' Douglas Murray, Henry Jackson Society .

"Transgender DJ: Billy-Joe Newington, 25, is set to have new genitalia made using the skin on his tattooed arm - leaving him with a tribal-print penis . A transgender DJ is set to have new genitalia made using the skin on his tattooed arm - leaving him with a tribal-print penis. Billy-Joe Newington, 25, from Cardiff, was born as a girl called Connie, but has been desperate to be a boy since the age of four. He started taking male hormones more than two years ago, quickly transforming him from a size-eight girl into a muscular man with stubble. He had a double mastectomy in January after years of binding his 32C breasts and is booked in for his first ‘lower-half’ taxpayer-funded NHS operation later this year. But the skin for his new penis will have to come from his left forearm, which is currently covered in a ten-inch black tribal tattoo with red stars. Skin is taken from the arm in such . operations because it is smooth and hairless. In Mr Newington's case, it will have to be taken . from his left forearm because the procedure can cause paralysis . and he is right-handed. Today, the DJ and his fiancée Celyn Phillips, 31, said his new patterned manhood would enable him to transform into the man they feel he was always meant to be. 'When I was a teenager I was living with double feelings - this is how I feel and this is how society wants me to be,' said Mr Newington. 'I tried to fight against it, I tried the whole make up thing, the long hair and the straighteners but it wasn’t me. Once I had the top half operation I instantly felt like I could finally be me. 'I’m looking forward to the lower half, but the closer it gets the more nervous I get. I’m already living the life of a man, but this will be the final step. 'The . most common place they take the skin from for the phalloplasty is the . forearm, but my whole left arm is covered in a tribal tattoo.' Scroll down for video . Tattoo: The skin for his new penis will have to come from his left forearm, which is covered in a tribal tattoo . 'I tried to fight it, but it wasn't me': Mr Newington was born as a girl called Connie, but has been desperate to be a boy since the age of four. Above, he is pictured aged 18 at home, the day before having his long hair cut off . Mr Newington said he realised he was different from 'other boys' at an early age. When he got to school, he hoped he would grow out of his feelings and even forced himself to dress more 'girly'. But after cutting off all his hair, when he was 15 he finally plucked up the courage to tell his doctor how he was feeling - who told him he was transgender. After his diagnosis, Mr Newington came out to his family, changed his name and started dressing as a man full-time . He was working as an openly-transgender DJ at a . club in Bristol when he met Miss Phillips, a lighting engineer, who . instantly accepted him for who he was. Operation: Mr Newington (pictured posing in hospital after having a double mastectomy in January after years of binding his 32C breasts) is booked in for his first 'lower-half' taxpayer-funded NHS operation later this year . Man made: The DJ said his new manhood would enable him to transform into the man he always felt he was . 'Things started to feel really odd when I was a teenager. I knew I was attracted to women, but what confused me the most was I looked at men and thought ‘they look pretty good,' said Mr Newington. 'It was working out the difference between envying men and fancying women that was confusing. 'When I met Celyn she knew straight away about me. I told her that I loved her pretty quickly, and she said to me ""I can't say that I love you just yet, but I know that I when I do I will love you for the person you are, not the gender"". 'Her saying that meant the world to me. To her, I am the man I know I am.' Keeping his spirit high: Another one of Mr Newington's tattoos reads: 'Don't let anyone knock you down' Teenage years: Mr Newington said he realised he was different from 'other boys' at an early age. Above, he is pictured at home, aged 17, having just been promoted to sergeant in Cadets (left) and posing aged 18 (right) Mr Newington started taking testosterone in January 2012 and two years later, had his breasts removed in a £6,000 NHS op at New Victoria Hospital in Surrey. During the three-hour operation, surgeons removed a cancerous lump, and after six weeks of being wrapped in bandages, Mr Newington was able to go topless for the first time. He had a pre-op appointment for his £12,000 lower half surgery on Wednesday and will have the first of three penis operations in the coming months. 'The first operation is to make the body . of the penis, then the second will be to make the head and have the . testicle implants, and the third will be a urethral lengthening and a . hysterectomy,' said Mr Newington. Couple: Mr Newington was working as an openly-transgender DJ at a club in Bristol when he met his fiancée Celyn Phillips, 29, a lighting engineer, who instantly accepted him for who he was. Above, the couple in 2012 . Happy: Mr Newington is seen DJ-ing at Bristol Pride in 2012 (right) and with Miss Phillips in Cardigan Bay (left) 'The first thing people ask is will you be able to ejaculate, and the answer to that is no. I will still be able to achieve orgasm. If I couldn’t, I would not be able to go through with it. It’s important, but not that important. 'I will be able to get an erection though, because there are things they can put in it. 'I could have one where they put a thing . that looks like a straw that you pump full of air with a pump in your . testicle. 'Or I could have a flexible iron rod that gets stiff when you . have a chemical injection. Looking to the future: Mr Newington (pictured at his home in Cardiff) said he and Miss Philips plan to get married after his first penis operation, and hope to have children in the future with the help of a sperm donor . He added: 'I’m a bit more nervous about this operation than the last one, because I thought it was going to be easy but it was actually emotionally draining, but Celyn is supporting me and keeping me calm.'

"Cyborgs are no longer just a part of 1970s science fiction plots about galaxies far, far away. The U.S. Food and Drug administration (FDA) has given its approval for one company to sell prosthetic arms that are controlled by electrical signals. The Deka Arm is nicknamed the ‘Luke’ arm as it was inspired by Luke Skywalker’s robotic arm in Star Wars. Scroll down for video . The force is strong with this one: The Deka robotic arm allows amputees like Fred Downs (pictured) to perform complex and delicate tasks like grasping a bottle (pictured) and has been approved for sale by the FDA, which means more people could benefit from the technology in future . The Deka arm can perform multiple, simultaneous powered movements controlled by electrical signals from electromyogram (EMG) electrodes connected to the wearer's muscles. Its electrodes are attached to the muscles of a wearer and detect electrical activity caused by the contraction of muscles close to where the prosthesis is attached. The electrodes transmit signals to a computer processor in the prosthesis, which translates these signals into 10 different types of movements. The arm contains a combination of mechanisms including switches, movement sensors, and force sensors that enables it to move. It can translate the electrical signals into 10 different types of movements, which enable wearers to perform more complex and delicate tasks. The character played by Mark Hamill was fitted with the mind-controlled prosthetic after Darth Vader cut his hand off with a lightsaber. The Deka arm can perform multiple, simultaneous powered movements controlled by electrical signals from electromyogram (EMG) electrodes connected to the wearer's muscles. And now the Manchester, New Hampshire-based company behind the innovation has got the go-ahead to sell its bionic arms to members of the public, although prices are not yet available. The arm is designed so that people can perform . delicate tasks like picking up eggs, which they would find incredibly . difficult with current prostheses. Its electrodes are attached to the muscles of a wearer and detect electrical activity caused by the contraction of muscles close to where the prosthesis is attached. Electrodes transmit signals to a . computer processor in the prosthesis, which translates them . into 10 different types of movements.

Like hr Sci-Fi arm, the Deka prosthesis allows its wearer a lot of dexterity and contains a combination of mechanisms including switches, movement sensors, and force sensors that enables it to move . Ms Foreman said: ‘This innovative prosthesis provides a new option for people with certain kinds of arm amputations.’ The FDA studied how the prosthesis coped with common household and self-care tasks and found that 90 per cent of users were able to perform jobs that they were unable to do with their current prosthesis, such as using keys and locks, preparing food, feeding themselves, using zips, and brushing hair. The company, which was founded by Dean Kamen, who was one of the inventors of the Segway, said that the Deka system can be adapted for people with limb loss at the shoulder, mid upper arm and mid lower arm, but at the moment it cannot be adapted for limb loss at the elbow or wrist.

"It was once just a treat for the weekend, but a new survey has found that the average Brit now forks out £110 per month on takeaway meals every month. The study found that an average of 12 takeaways is purchased per person per month- a staggering £1,320. Men have the biggest taste for fast food as they get through an extraordinary 151 takeaways a year, while the figure for women is 126. Classic: Traditional British fish and chips are no longer the favourite takeaway treat . Meanwhile, Chinese has replaced the English classic of fish and chips as Britain's favourite takeaway. The survey of 2,000 UK adults looked into the nation's eating habits and how age affects the amount of takeaways we consume. The biggest fast food consumers are 25 to 34-year-olds who spend as much as £2,626.92 a year on them. Forty nine per cent of this age group claim they rely on takeaways because they don't have the time or inclination to cook at home. In contrast, those aged 45 and over spend half - £1,272.78 every twelve months. The study by discount website vouchercodes.co.uk found those living in the capital are the biggest fast food addicts. Londoners spend more than double the national average - at £221.63 - on takeaways every month. Meanwhile, those living in . Chelmsford, Essex, are the thriftiest and spend just £43.19 on meals . they haven't prepared themselves each month. Nation's favourite: Chinese food was the favourite on then poll, with Indian food coming in a close second . Everyday expense: Takeaway's are a part of life for consumers who are too busy to cook . According to the research, sushi is the preferred takeaway choice for women, while fish and chips remains the favoured option for men. Nationally though, the classic English take-out of fish and chips slipped from the nation's favourite takeaway to third - overtaken by Chinese and Indian. Ben Hardings, 26, a sales assistant . from Portsmouth, Hants, said: 'After working a late shift it take a lot . of effort to prepare a meal when I get home. 'It is so much easier to pick up the phone and order an Indian or a kebab, and they taste really good too. 'I . probably can't boast the healthiest of diets and I do spend a lot of . money on takeaways, but it's quite a difficult habit to kick.' Duncan Jennings, co-founder of vouchercodes.co.uk, said: 'Takeaways are now a part of everyday life for busy consumers.

Five driving modes include comfort, normal, sport or 'eco'. I kept it mainly on sport and enjoyed plenty of power when needed, yet with a nimble, well-balanced ride on all types of road.
Excellent economy. It averaged 68.9mpg — 76.3mpg when cruising and 59.9mpg around town. CO2 emissions are a low 107g/ km. An even more frugal 78mpg BlueMotion version arrives in June.
A stop-start system helps keep fuel bills low. There's keyless entry, plus and heated seats and steering wheel for which, in this cold snap, I was very grateful.
Ample flexible interior space; slightly more than in the outgoing model, even though its exterior dimensions are slightly smaller. The three rear seats fold nearly flat for extra load lugging capability.
Smart but unfussy interior, with supportive seats that have plenty of reclining and setting options to ensure comfort for drivers and passengers of all shapes and sizes. Stylish cloth fabric on the seats with silver inserts also add to the business-like feel.
Easy to drive and intuitive to a degree that means you quickly become at home.
Five trim levels from launch: S, SE, SE Business (my vehicle), GT and R-Line. The latter two include a range topping two-litre bi-turbo TDi diesel engine with 240 bhp and four-wheel drive. From £22,215 for the saloon, but add on £1,530 for the estate.
Lots of electronic kit to keep you safe and stable on the road.
Easy-to-read dials, but VW plans an optional 12.3 in display to replace the conventional instrument cluster.
Rear cameras make reversing into the tightest of spaces much easier.
There may be a lot of technology on board but it's simply displayed on an uncluttered dashboard. The touchscreen is relatively easy to navigate.
For anyone keen on the great outdoors, a 'trailer-assist' feature helps to manoeuvre trailers more accurately.
Only diesel models are on sale at first. A frugal plug-in hybrid GTE version with a 1.4-litre TSi petrol and electric motor version is to follow in October, promising a combined range of more than 620 miles or 31 miles in pure electric mode. A beefed-up 4x4 version will hit the road in July.
Extras hiked the base price of the version I drove from £26,665 to £31,270. These included the winter pack of heated front seats, windscreen washer jets (£280), heated steering wheel (£135), heated windscreen (£150), and a whole lot more. The dynamic chassis control (£700), 18-inch anthracite alloys (£665), sound insulating glass (£310), climate control (£590), all-round cameras (£590), and a system that enables you to connect your smartphone to the car's information and entertainment system (£160)."
"A medical officer is being tested for Ebola in Kansas days after returning from west Africa where he was treating seriously ill people on a commercial ship. The man from Kansas City, believed to be in his 40s, admitted himself to The University of Kansas Hospital at 6am today suffering from diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and general fatigue - typical symptoms of the deadly virus. As recently as four days ago he was treating patients with similar symptoms in Africa. Tests: Dr Lee Norman reveals a man in his 40s at the University of Kansas Hospital is being tested for Ebola after returning from west Africa where he was treating seriously ill patients on board a commercial ship . It comes as Maine Medical Center puts a patient  under observation amid fears they have contracted Ebola. The Kansas patient told doctors he did not know of any cases of Ebola on the ship but he had no means of testing for the disease. He is now in isolation as doctors await the results of his blood test, which arrives at 5pm tomorrow. According to the hospital's chief medical officer, Dr Lee Norman, the patient was 'very weak' when he arrived this morning. Norman insists the man does not pose a health risk to other patients and staff, and claims doctors have been heartened by the fact that he shows no signs of hemorrhaging, which is typical in Ebola sufferers. The patient is being treated by six medics around the clock. Those health professionals will not treat other patients until he is diagnosed. In Portland, officials said the patient being tested for Ebola started showing symptoms two days to three weeks after contracting the virus, with a fever, sore throat, muscle pain and headaches. Earlier today, New York City's Bellevue Hospital cleared two patients of Ebola after they arrived in ER with symptoms similar to sufferers of the deadly disease. Bellevue Hospital spokesman Ian Michaels told MailOnline: 'There are no patients at Bellevue with Ebola. Two possible Ebola patients have been quarantined at New York City's Bellevue Hospital after falling ill following return from Africa trip, according to reports . Health care workers display protective gear, which hospital staff would wear to protect them from an Ebola virus infection, inside an isolation room as part of a tour of the emergency department of Bellevue Hospital . 'Two patients there this morning were evaluated and it was quickly determined they did not have the virus. 'Because of the heightened alert, hospitals will be using enhanced scrutiny and an abundance of caution when reviewing questionable cases, and are meticulously following all public health and CDC protocols.' He do not specify what the diagnosis of the pair was or what condition they were in. According to the New York Daily News, the pair are believed to have recently return from a trip to Africa where the latest outbreak has killed more than 4,000 people. It reported EMS crews who dealt with the patients have also been isolated as a precaution. A sign advising advising those who are showing possible Ebola symptoms is posted in a lobby of New York's Bellevue Hospital. The hospital told MailOnline that it is not treating any patients with suspected Ebola . Bellevue Hospital Center has been established as NYC's Ebola intake center. Over the past few weeks staff posing as ill patients have been presenting symptoms of the illness in the emergency room and are then isolated and observed. Staff are told at some point through the process that they are dealing with a training case. The city's flagship hospital is is kitted out with isolation units prepared to treat up to four patients and has the capacity to facilitate nine other patients if necessary. All such rooms will be secured and guarded by security. Technicians are assembling a lab to exclusively handle Ebola blood tests, keeping samples from contaminating other equipment. 'If we have a confirmed patient, than those patients will be transferred to Bellevue regardless of where they have presented,' said HHC chief medical officer, Dr. Ross Wilson told the New York Post. 'Hospitals in New York City are as prepared as they possibly can be for Ebola.' Bellevue Hospital has been established as NYC's Ebola intake center. It is kitted out with isolation units prepared to treat up to four patients and has the capacity to facilitate nine other patients if necessary. If the pair had tested positive for the virus, it would be the first case of the disease in New York. Last week a Brooklyn teenager was rushed to the hospital after showing symptoms consistent with Ebola. The 14-year-old boy had a fever and was feeling fluish according to officials. He was brought to Brookdale Hospital where he remains in isolation, although doctors say he does not have the virus. Yesterday a Dallas passenger was removed from an American Airlines flight at Nashville airport after vomiting on board. Passengers reported the person was being sick and possibly having a seizure as Flight 1676 arrived in Nashville at 11:29 p.m. Sunday. There were 140 passengers and five crew members on board - they were held on the runway until the sick passenger could be removed. The passenger was taken to Vanderbilt University Medical Center to be assessed, reports WSMV. Officials said they are not concerned about this person having Ebola. 'We have been advised that the person who had the medical issue had no history of contact with anyone with Ebola in Dallas and had no travel history to Africa,' said Brian Todd, public information officer for the Metro Public Health Department. 'There is no concern that this individual has Ebola and there is no risk to other passengers on the plane. A Dallas passenger has been removed from an American Airlines flight at Nashville airport after vomiting on board Sunday evening . A passenger on the plane tweeted this photo alongside the caption: Just in case any of you ever imagined being quarantined on a plane -- My current situation' 'A passenger on board was ill, so the Metropolitan Nashville Airport Authority Department of Public Safety, in coordination with Metropolitan Nashville Office of Emergency Management and Metro Department of Public Health, followed its standard operating procedures for Communicable Diseases,' said Emily Richard with the Metropolitan Nashville Airport Authority in a statement. The Tennessee emergency came just hours before two suspected Ebola cases, one male and one female, were reportedly taken to Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan on Monday morning, MailOnline has learned. The individuals, on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, had reportedly been to Africa and were showing Ebola symptoms. The New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation denied the reports on Monday morning. MailOnline was awaiting a response from Bellevue Hospital, The New York state health department and the CDC. Fears of an Ebola outbreak in the U.S. hit both coasts yesterday when health officials were dispatched to Los Angeles International Airport and a hospital in Boston to assess possible patients with the deadly virus. Harvard Vanguard Medical Center in Braintree, Massachusetts was evacuated yesterday afternoon when a man, recently returned from Liberia, showed up at the facility complaining of head and muscle aches.

The patient was subsequently taken to Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Boston. Above, a man collects and bags items near the entrance of the hospital after the patient arrived on Sunday . It was later revealed that the Massachusetts patient does not in fact appear to have the deadly disease, but the man has been kept in isolation. Just an hour later, a United Airlines flight that landed at LAX from New York's JFK airport was diverted to a far terminal because of a passenger who had vomited and displayed flu-like symptoms. Captain Jamie Moore of the Los Angeles Fire Department held a press conference shortly after the female passenger on flight that landed at LAX was assessed, and said there was 'no reason to believe' that she had been exposed to Ebola. A United Airlines flight that landed at LAX from New York's JFK airport was diverted to a far terminal because of a passenger who had vomited and displayed flu-like symptoms . He says the woman most likely had some sort of 'air illness'. In Nashville a woman with chest pains was taken to hospital after suffering symptoms were possibly consistent with Ebola. The woman was inside a convenience store when she started having chest pains and called 9-1-1. First responders arrived wearing protective clothing and were met at the hospital by nurses wearing gloves and special face shields. The patient was transported to Tristar Summit Medical Center for treatment. The woman does not have Ebola, but did indicate she may have had contact with someone who went there recently.","Male patient in his 40s admitted himself to The University of Kansas Hospital on Monday .

"Being on the TV doesn't stop you getting star-struck and right now I've got a serious girl crush on Cheryl Cole. Or should I say Cheryl Fernandez-Versini. Now that newly-wed C F-V is back on our celebrity radars, I've remembered how gorgeous and glossy she always looks, and being a fellow brunette, she's a great beauty inspiration for me. So this week I'm recreating one of Cheryl's signature looks - all sultry eyes, glowing skin and pale lips. Scroll down for video . Binky says that fellow brunette Cheryl Fernandez-Versini is her beauty inspiration . GET THE LOOK . THE BASE . Cheryl is lucky enough to have flawless skin, so for this look I've used DiorSkin Forever Foundation to create a smooth, even canvas for the rest of my make-up. I prefer to apply my foundation with my fingertips, but a sponge or foundation brush creates an equally professional finish. Now dust over your base with translucent powder to fix it in place - I've chosen the super-sheer Daniel Sandler Invisible Veil Powder, blending it in with a big, fluffy brush. THE EYES . I've already prepped my eyes with foundation and powder, so I'm not using an eye primer but going straight on to eye colour. First up I've chosen bareMinerals High Shine Eye Colour in Bronzed. This beautiful sparkly rose-gold eyeshadow comes in a tube with a handy sponge at the end, so it's easy to apply exactly where you want it. Binky uses bronze tones and dark black eyeliner to achieve Cheryl's sultry look . Draw the colour along your upper lash line then use your fingertips to blend over your entire eye socket. You can really pack on this shade to create a shimmering, starry finish.Cheryl loves dark black liner so I'm making that the focus of this look. Begin by drawing a black eyeliner pencil along your top and bottom lashes, getting as close to the lash line as possible. I've used Daniel Sandler's Black Velvet Eyeliner, which is waterproof so less likely to smudge. If you find it tricky to draw a single line, it may be easier to apply your liner in tiny strokes - the finished effect looks just as good. Now draw the liner along your waterline. Finish up with lashings of Guerlain Maxi Lash Mascara to recreate Cheryl's signature sooty lashes, wiggling the mascara brush right into the roots and along to the tips to ensure a really full coverage. Inspiration: Binky loves Cheryl's polished golden glow . To avoid looking OTT Binky has kept her lip palette nude and neutral . THE GLOW . Paparazzi flashes can really bleach out your skintone in photos, so Cheryl looks her best with a warm, glowing complexion. I'm recreating her sun-kissed look using Clarins Bronzing Duo compact. Simply swish a fluffy brush across the bronzing powder and swirl it over your cheekbones, neck, forehead and nose. I've added blusher into the mix to give my cheeks a soft, warm flush. Daniel Sandler's Watercolour Creme Rouge Blusher in Soft Pink is easy to apply with your fingers - just dab it onto the apples of your cheeks and gently blend it in. THE LIPS . Since this look is all about the eyes, I've kept to a simple, neutral lip by dabbing a touch of the same Daniel Sandler blusher onto my lips. Here are Binky's beauty picks for achieving Cheryl's look . Matching your cheeks and lips a great way of creating a naturally pretty look - it's easy to achieve, and this Watercolour Creme Rouge is soft and moisturising enough not to dry out your pout. THE BROWS . Cheryl knows strong brows really frame your face, so she always keeps hers well-groomed. I've used the brilliant Clarins Pro Palette Eyebrow Kit, starting with a brow wax to fix stray hairs in place. Next I've used the mid-brown brow colour to define my eyebrow shape. It's well worth the effort as your brows will look shapely and stunning. So there you have it: Binky does Cheryl! This really is an incredibly simple beauty look to do, but the effect is exceptionally glamorous. And if there's one thing Cheryl and I agree on, it's that glamour rules! Stay gorgeous .

"Nick Clegg was accused of 'riding roughshod' over the views of the religious last night after he was forced to withdraw comments in which he branded opponents of gay marriage 'bigots'. The former Archbishop of Canterbury, Lord Carey, described the Deputy Prime Minister as 'immature' over remarks he had issued ahead of a reception to mark the end of a consultation on same-sex weddings. The Liberal Democrat leader was due to describe opponents of the reform as 'bigots', according to a Cabinet Office press release. Nick Clegg speaking to the actor Simon Callow on the night he made a speech at a reception to celebrate the end of the Government's consultation on gay marriage . He was expected to say: 'Continued . trouble in the economy gives the bigots a stick to beat us with, as they . demand we “postpone” the equalities agenda in order to deal with “the . things people really care about”. 'As if pursuing greater equality and fixing the economy simply cannot happen at once.' But as the incendiary detail of his . remarks quickly began to circulate, it prompted a bitter row with MPs on . the Tory Right who oppose gay marriage, as well as church leaders. Ninety minutes after issuing the . offending statement, Mr Clegg's office mounted an extraordinary attempt . to 'recall' it. Five minutes later, a new version of the speech was . issued, with the reference to 'bigots' taken out and replaced with 'some . people'. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg was today forced to withdraw the statement which accused opponents of gay marriage of being 'bigots' Lord Carey Of Clifton (left), the former Archbishop of Canterbury, said many people would be 'highly offended' by Mr Clegg's remarks while Conservative MP Peter Bone (right) said the Deputy PM should resign . The episode was branded a 'shambles' last night and succeeded in angering both opponents of gay marriage, who . objected to the original remarks, and those in favour of the reform, . who were dismayed that Mr Clegg had not delivered them. Lord Carey said: 'There will be many . Christians and non-Christians who will be highly offended to be called . bigots. People who oppose same-sex marriages are doing so on the basis . of deeply-held beliefs and we should not be treated in such a way. 'These are important issues that . affect society and therefore it is paramount for the Government to give . serious attention to those who oppose the rush into gay marriage. I'm . totally for equality – that's not the issue. The issue is should we . redefine traditional marriage to include same-sex relationships.' Peter Tatchell, the political and gay rights campaigner in his Elephant and Castle, London, flat.  Mr Tatchell said: 'Homophobic bigotry does still exist in sections of our society, and we should not be afraid to say so.' Of Mr Clegg's attempt to withdraw the . remark, Lord Carey added: 'He must have realised that it would offend . people and it doesn't actually help the discussion. I think it is fairly . typical of the way that he and some other people in the Coalition have . tried to ride roughshod over people's deeply held views. This is not the . way to conduct mature discussions.' Right-wing Tory MP Peter Bone said Mr . Clegg should resign. 'This appears to be his real opinion,' he said. 'If . he is saying people who disagree with him on gay marriage because of . conscientious or religious grounds are bigots then he should not remain . Deputy Prime Minister. 'I would never go around accusing . somebody who disagreed with me of being a bigot, and I don't care if . it's a Liberal or a Conservative minister who's doing it now – they . should not remain in post.' The row had unhappy echoes of the . so-called 'Bigotgate' furore which engulfed Gordon Brown during the last . general election. The then prime minister was caught describing . pensioner Gillian Duffy as a 'bigoted woman' after she confronted him . over immigration. Colin Hart, of the Coalition for . Marriage campaign group, said: 'These intolerant remarks show that there . is nothing liberal about Nick Clegg. 'It also shows his contempt for the . millions of ordinary men and women in this country who oppose the . politically correct drive to rip up the centuries-old definition of . marriage. 'Perhaps Mr Clegg should stop attacking the British public and . concentrate on fixing the UK's broken economy, which he was actually . elected to do.' But gay rights campaigner Peter . Tatchell, among the guests at last night's reception in central London, . said: 'Quite clearly, some people who oppose same-sex marriage do so . because of personal prejudice and intolerance. 'Homophobic bigotry does . still exist in sections of our society, and we should not be afraid to . say so.' Adrian Trett, chairman of the LGBT . (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) Liberal Democrats group, . another attendee, tweeted ahead of the event: 'Hope Nick does use the . word ""bigot"" in his speech as he's absolutely right!' But Labour MP Thomas Docherty said Mr . Clegg's media operation was a 'shambles', adding: 'This is a government . so incompetent they cannot even put together a press release properly.' A spokesman for Mr Clegg insisted: . 'This was not something the Deputy Prime Minister has said. It's not . something he was ever going to say because it's not something he . believes. It was removed from the draft copy, that should never have . been sent out, for that very reason.' Mr Clegg revealed last night that the . Government has received 228,000 responses to the consultation on equal . marriage, more than any other issue under the Coalition government. At the reception later, he said: 'I am . a little bit surprised to see cameras outside the gates for the . slightly obscure reason that they expect me to use a word about . opponents of gay marriage that I had no intention of using, would never . use. It is not the kind of word that I would use.' A Downing Street source said: 'The . Prime Minister is committed to this reform and has said we are going to . do it before 2015. 'There will be MPs on all sides of the House who . disagree with it, who he does not regard as bigots, who will want to . vote against. Conservative MPs will have a free vote but we expect it to . command sufficient support to become law.'","Lib Dem leader releases speech attacking people who say same sex marriage should not be a priority .

"A man locked in a battle with his energy supplier has gone without gas or electricity for three years because he refuses to pay for his meter to be fixed. Chris Guest, 50, has refused to pay Eon £70 to fix the device, which they installed in 2010, and has been left without power ever since. Mr Guest has been forced to read by torchlight, go without heating and hot water, and survives on corned beef sandwiches because he is unable to cook. In the dark: Chris Guest has been without electricity or gas for three years following a row with his energy firm . The former advert writer, who cannot work because he has gout, has also resorted to using his mother's washing machine and charging his phone at other people's houses. After three years living in miserable conditions, he has finally decided to speak out having reached the end of his tether. He said: 'I can't cook, I have a mobile phone I charge at other people's houses just so I can listen to the radio and at night it's pitch black. 'My mum didn't even know. She's 84 and I didn't want her to worry.' Mr Guest fell out with Eon over a bill in 2010. To resolve the problem, the firm entered his house while he was out and installed a prepayment meter using legal powers granted by the Warrant of Entry Act. Out in the cold: Mr Guest's landlord has urged him to work with Eon to resolve the matter . Warrant: In 2010 Mr Guest received a letter from Eon (left) informing him the firm had entered his house to install a meter. A month later he received another letter (right) querying why he had not topped his meter up . Blasted: Mr Guest has branded  energy company Eon 'greedy' after he was hit with the bill . Mr Guest claims they reached a stalemate around Christmas 2010, after he finally paid off an outstanding £500 bill. He claims he then found that the meter was not working and Eon wanted another £70 to repair it, which he refused to pay. Jobless: Mr Guest does not currently work because he suffers from gout . Eon decline to comment on the dispute, but confirmed that Mr Guest has not used any electricity for three years. The company says they have tried to resolve the issue with. A spokesman said: 'With regard to Mr Guest's case, a prepayment meter was installed in May 2010 due to a considerable balance which had built up on the account. 'His last payment was made in 2005 for £1.97 and Mr Guest has been provided with a prepayment key to use to top up his electricity meter with credit. 'We have tried many times since then to resolve this matter, however energy used needs to be energy that is paid for.' Mr Guest's landlord, Green Vale Homes, . confirmed that he was unable to use his boiler without an electricity . supply and has urged him to come to an agreement with Eon. Frances Clarke, head of Green Vale Homes, which is responsible for maintaining Mr Guest's boiler said: 'We are aware Mr Guest has had a dispute with his energy suppliers. 'We would urge him to resolve these disputes as soon as possible so we can carry out a full check on his heating system. 'The boiler won't work without an electricity supply and an inactive system is more prone to leaks, especially in cold weather as the pipes expand and contract, so we hope we can avoid this. Hot topic: Mr Guest has been without heat or hot water and has to take his washing to his mother's house .

"Prison-bound former Congressman Jesse Jackson Jr. plans to sell his $2.5 million home in Washington D.C. to help pay $750,000 in penalties stemming from his sentence for illegally spending campaign funds on personal items. The ex-Illinois congressman's lawyers and prosecutors mentioned the plan in a joint filing today in U.S. District Court in Washington. The 2,936 square foot, four bedroom home was bought by the couple in 2008 and they have listed it for $2.5 million, according to celebhomes.net. Former Illinois Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. and his wife, Sandra, seen arriving at federal court in Washington, Wednesday, Aug. 14, 2013 . Jesse Jackson Jr. will sell his Washington town house (pictured) to help pay a $750,000 forfeiture he owes . They asked the judge to give Jackson more time to come up with the money. They also noted one effort to raise cash fell through. An online auction to sell celebrity . memorabilia owned by Jackson was cancelled after the authenticity of a . guitar supposedly signed by Michael Jackson and Eddie Van Halen was . questioned. The filing says no memorabilia will now be sold. The 48-year-old Chicago Democrat is expected to begin serving a 2 1/2-year prison term within weeks. Jackson . Jr. was sentenced to two and a half years in prison in August for . illegally spending $750,000 in campaign funds on personal items, the . judge scolding the son of the famed civil rights leader for using the . money as a 'piggy bank' and sentencing his wife to a year as well. However, . Jackson, who emotionally apologized to his father, mother, . congressional colleagues and others, was given significantly less prison . time than federal guidelines recommend, recognized by the judge as a . 'complex person' who has done both good and bad. Sandi Jackson, a former Chicago alderman, was sentenced for filing false joint federal income tax returns. The one-time power couple misused $750,000 in campaign money on everything from a gold-plated Rolex watch and mink capes to vacations and mounted elk heads . After prison, the former congressman . is to spend three years on supervised release and complete 500 hours of . community service. If he earns credit for good behavior in prison, he . could end up serving closer to two years. He agreed to repay the . $750,000 when he pleaded guilty earlier this year. According . to court documents, the Jacksons had spent campaign money on TV's, . restaurant dinners, an expensive watch and other costly personal items. Jackson, . 48, had been a Democratic congressman from Illinois from 1995 until he . resigned in November 2012. In an emotional speech to the judge, he choked . up and used tissues to blow his nose. He apologized and said he wanted . to 'take responsibility for my actions.' 'I . misled the American people. I misled the House of Representatives. I . misled the Federal Election Commission,' he said. 'I was wrong.' 'I also want to apologize to my dad and to my mother,' Jackson added, stopping to compose himself. The . elder Jackson, who sat in the front row during the proceedings, told a . crush of reporters outside the courthouse later: 'This has been an . extraordinarily difficult time for our family.' In . court, U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson recognized Jackson Jr.'s . public service on issues such as public education and clean water. 'That's what makes this situation so tragic,' she said.","Former Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr's lawyers asked for more time to come up with the money .

"Comedienne and author Sarah Silverman has fronted a new National Women's Law Center campaign to raise awareness concerning the U.S. gender wage gap, in which she attends a staged sex change consultation. 'Every year the average woman loses around $11,000 to the wage gap,' Miss Silverman, 43, explains from a doctor's office, flinging around a selection of prosthetic penises. 'Over the course of her working life, that's almost $500,000. That's a $500,000 vagina tax... that's why I'm becoming a dude.' Scroll down for video . Time for a sex change: Sarah Silverman has fronted a new campaign to raise awareness concerning the gender wage gap (pictured) and claims almost $30 trillion is owed to U.S. working women . As the video unfolds, titled Sarah Silverman Closes Her Gap, Miss Silverman peruses a wide selection of hilariously realistic prosthetic penises in a bid to become a man, and thus enjoy better pay standards. 'In the grand scheme of things, it's way less expensive than the money I'll lose having a p***y,' she reasons, admiring penises dubbed 'The Gentleman,' 'The Frat Boy,' and 'The Seinfeld.' Casey Rand, creative director of Droga5, which masterminded the campaign, told Adweek: 'Equal pay may not be a sexy issue, but it's an important one. 'And it is absurd. Young women need to know what's at stake. And we knew that to get them to engage, we'd need to play up that absurdity.' Penis shopping: Miss Silverman claims, 'Over the course of her working life, [women lose] almost $500,000. That's a $500,000 vagina tax... that's why I'm becoming a dude' 'Oh my god I've got boots that would look amazing with this. I'll take it!' Miss Silverman exclaims upon being matched with her ideal penis. 'Can you give me two really big balls? I feel like I'm gonna be a ball guy. Or make it three. It's gonna take a lot of balls to tell women that the wage gap is fair.' And she has a point. According to the campaign, dubbed the Equal Payback Project, women make up almost half the working population, yet typically earn just .76c - or .69c if they are mothers - for every dollar a man makes, in almost every profession. As the campaign points out, these figures mean that society owes working women nearly $30 trillion. Found it! Miss Silverman peruses a wide range of very realistic-looking prosthetic penises before deciding on the one she wants . The National Women's Law Center argues that this issue isn't been talked about enough. Indeed, around 60per cent of private sector workers are discouraged or actively prohibited from talking about wages at work. 'The wage gap is stubborn, it's persistent and it's outrageous,' says the organization's co-president Marcia D. Greenberger. 'We're thrilled that Sarah Silverman is bringing her prodigious talents and brand of irreverent humor to bear on a very serious issue for women and their families. 'We hope she opens hearts and minds - and a few pocketbooks - to provide the resources to close the wage gap once and for all.' Mind the gap! According to the Equal Payback Project, run by the National Women's Law Center, women from chefs to surgeons and CEOs make significantly less than their male counterparts . Fair? Professions dominated by men see employees also rake in higher weekly incomes on average than professions made up of mostly women . The campaign is calling for donations to reach $30 trillion - the collective dollar total lost to the 69 million-strong female workforce over the course of their careers because of the gender pay gap. Of course, this goal is nigh impossible, and set more to make a point. If it is reached, every working woman in the U.S. will receive a check for $435,049 - the total amount she will lose to the gender pay gap. Hot topic:  Emma Watson (pictured) recently made a UN speech regarding gender equality . If not, all funds will go to the National Women's Law Center, where it will be used to push new legislation, promote flexible work hours, and keep employers accountable for existing legislation. 'They're very good at what they do,' Miss Silverman assures us. 'You know, for a bunch of girls.' Miss Silverman has been fighting for a wide range of social causes for much of her career. A vegan since she was ten years old, the comedienne and author of The Bedwetter, is currently in a relationship with Welsh actor Michael Scheen, but has stated that she won't get married until same-same couples are legally permitted to do so.

"The story of controversial congressman Jesse Jackson Jr has become even stranger as his penchant for nude martial arts and the belief he's a reincarnated chariot driver have been revealed. Jackson, 47, has rarely been seen in public since he took a leave of absence from Congress in June. He faces an FBI criminal probe amid claims that he misused campaign funds to decorate his own home and he may be indicted before he comes up for re-election next month. Strange behaviour: Ex-staffers claim Jesse Jackson Jr believed he was a chariot driver in a former life, and practiced martial arts while naked at a Turkish bath he frequented . But as Jackson comes under the microscope, former staffers are revealing some kooky behaviour exhibited by the Democrat. Frank Coconate, a former Jackson aide who helped him explore the possibility of running for Chicago mayor in 2006, told the Washington Post: 'I really thought he had a problem with reality. 'He'd get in his own little world.' Coconate, who is no longer on speaking terms with Jackson, told the paper that the congressman bragged that he had been a chariot driver in his former life. Attorney and political adviser Frank Avila Jr added that Jackson would practice martial arts routines while naked at the Turkish bath he frequented. Jackson, the son of civil rights leader Rev. Jesse Jackson, was previously involved in an FBI investigation into attempts by governor Rod Blagojevich to sell Barack Obama's Senate seat after he was elected president 2008. Family: The Illinois congressman embraces his civil-rights leader father during the 2000 Democratic convention . He took a medical leave of absence from his congressional duties on June 10 to combat depression. He spent time at a clinic in Arizona, then moved to the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, which issued a statement revealing that Jackson was being treated for bipolar disorder. Although he returned to his Washington home last month, he has not been actively involved in his own re-election campaign. His wife Sandi recently suggested that he would not return to work until after the election, depending on medical advice. Yesterday, The Daily caught up with Jackson, who said he is 'not well' and sees doctors twice a day at a nearby hospital. Home: It is unclear which house Jackson was allegedly redecorating, but this home in Washington DC is the congressman's primary residence . For sale: The house was briefly listed by estate agents, leading to speculation over Jackson's future . Controversial: Jackson has been faced with a number of alleged scandals over the past few years . Health: The congressman is still on leave as he attempts to recover from depression . It was revealed on Sunday that a new investigation into Jackson is centered around allegations that the congressman used campaign funds to redecorate his home, according to insider sources. Jackson's lawyer apparently asked officials from the FBI and the U.S. Attorney's office to guarantee that no charges would be filed before the election on November 6, but the authorities would not make that promise. Jackson is almost certainly to be . re-elected in the heavily Democratic district in south Chicago which he . has represented for 17 years, despite his illness and the new campaign . finance probe. The congressman's spokesman refused to comment on the FBI investigation. The . overwhelming power of the Democratic Party in Chicago has led to . multiple allegations of corruption levelled against local politicians . over several decades.","Ex-staffers speaking out on behaviour of congressman, who's currently on medical leave .

"No workplace, coffee shop or even school playground is complete without them. But Apple’s ubiquitous gadgets, the iPad and iPhone, have been making headlines recently for some — literally — shocking reasons. This week, a father told how his daughter’s iPad charger exploded in his hand giving him a massive electric shock. Tim Gillooley, 34, said he was thrown across the room and left with blackened fingers when he reached down to unplug the device at his mother’s house in Widnes, Cheshire. He believes his eight-year-old daughter Chloe would have been killed had she touched it. Shocking: The Apple iPad and recharger plug, which exploded at the socket, burning Tim Gillooley''s fingers and sending him flying across the room . It’s the latest in a line of incidents where iPhone and iPad chargers have been blamed for putting lives at risk. So are your Apple chargers really dangerous? Or is it all down to the cheaper imitation chargers which flood the market? Yes. The incident in Cheshire comes after two in China, leaving one person dead and another in a coma. Chinese air stewardess Ma Ailun, 23, was reportedly killed by an electric shock in July when she answered a call on her iPhone 5 while it was recharging. Earlier this year in New York, a woman claimed her iPhone 4S spontaneously melted, oozing acid that destroyed the handset. Then in February this year, fire crews in Oregon blamed an apartment blaze on an overheated MacBook battery which had been placed on a mattress. In 2011, two iPhone 4s on opposite sides of the world caught fire and self-combusted. The first happened on a plane over Australia and the second in Brazil when its owner was awakened by the smoking device on his bedside table. Lethal: Tim believes his eight-year-old daughter Chloe could have been killed in the explosion . It's highly likely that some of the dangerous incidents have been the fault of chargers. Indeed, Miss Ma’s death was blamed on an imitation charger. So why do people buy them? It’s simple — the price. You can get them for under a fiver from Amazon sellers, for example, whereas the official one is at least £15. But it’s a saving that could come at a high price. ‘There are plenty of reputable companies that make accessories for Apple products, and as long as you go with one of them, you should be fine,’ says David Price, online editor at macworld.co.uk. ‘I’d never buy an ‘official iPad charger’ from a bloke on the street and I’d advise others not to do the same.’ There are over 600 million Apple devices including iPhones and iPads being used around the world and only a handful of reported incidents. The chances are you’re very safe. But counterfeit cheap chargers appear to raise the risks significantly. ‘Any genuine products from a well-known manufacturer such as Apple are rigorously tested and should be safe,’ says Dr Kevin Curran, a senior member of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers and a reader in computer science at the University of Ulster. ‘But you may experience problems with non-proprietary products — those that may fit your iPhone or iPad but come from a different company. ‘I can understand why people would buy cheaper chargers but a few years ago I had one that exploded so I wouldn’t go near one now.’ So big is the problem that Apple have decided to help customers tell the genuine articles from the fake —although, ironically, their detailed online guides to spotting the difference may well help counterfeiters imitate the visual design of Apple products more closely. For details about how to detect a genuine Apple charger see: www.apple.com/uk/power-adapters/. Any item connected to mains could lead to a shock but this is exceptionally rare. ‘To tell people not to speak while a phone is charging is akin to telling people to disconnect a microwave before opening the door to remove food,’ says Dr Curran. ‘If the report about the Chinese lady being electrocuted when she answered her phone is accurate, then it is fair to say that the phone or charger was defective. The current flowing into a charging phone is typically not enough to kill a person.’ While it should be safe, you shouldn’t do this if you want your battery to last. Most modern smartphones and tablets have a device that stops the charge from trickling out once it’s full, but if you have too many apps open or your Wi-Fi is left on, a small amount of charge will leak out — even when it’s plugged in. The result? It will just keep on re-charging. ‘The problem with that is that batteries can only be recharged a finite number of times,’ says Dr Curran. Action: Apple says it is running a worldwide programme to replace fake chargers . ‘It varies from battery to battery and can be anything from 10,000 times to 40,000 times. That means that if it’s plugged in overnight, your phone or tablet might lose, say, one per cent of its charge as it searches for Wi-Fi or one of the apps becomes active and then it will recharge itself. ‘That means your battery will recharge itself 30 or 40 times a night which will affect its lifespan.’ To combat this, Dr Curran advises putting your phone/tablet on a socket that is controlled by a timer and only charging it for a few hours a night. You could even use the timer to switch it on and off a couple of times during the night. ‘I used to put mine on charge until about 5am and then it would switch off,’ he says. If you’re using the charger that came with the phone or tablet, it shouldn’t take as long as if you’re using a non-proprietary model. A recent test by Techhive.com found that an iPad 4 took five hours and nine minutes to charge fully, but an incredible 19 hours and 13 minutes with an alien charger. Victim: Ma Ailun, a 23-year-old air stewrdess with China Southern Airlines, who died when she picked up her phone as it was charging . Meanwhile, the iPhone 5 took two hours 16 minutes to charge with the Apple charger, but two hours 57 minutes with the alien charger. And ensure you have ten or 15 hours to spare if you’re ever tempted to use your iPhone charger to charge up your iPad. Phones have no problems drawing charge from tablets, but tablets take much longer to draw juice from phone chargers. In tests, the Apple iPad 4 took ten hours and five minutes to charge using the iPhone charger. Prompted by the Chinese incident, Apple has now begun a worldwide programme that will run until October 18 to replace third-party and counterfeit USB chargers. ‘Recent reports have suggested that some counterfeit and third-party adaptors may not be designed properly and could result in safety issues,’ says Apple. ‘While not all third-party adaptors have an issue, we are announcing a USB Power Adapter Takeback Programme to enable customers to acquire properly designed adaptors.’ Consumers with any concerns about their adapters should drop them off at an Apple store or an authorised service provider, Apple says, where they will be disposed of in an environmentally friendly way. They will replace it with a genuine adaptor for the reduced price of £8. More details of this scheme can be found at: apple.com/uk.","Cheap chargers go for £5 online compared with official £15 .

"Take a look at these pictures and consider for a moment what these rather brutal looking metal contraptions might be. Are they power tools? Medieval torture devices? The world's first hairdryers? Archaic egg whisks? Nope, these are actually Victorian vibrators, a collection of vintage self-massagers currently on display at . Littledean Jail in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire, a former house of correction, . police station and courthouse-turned-visitor attraction. And exhibits include Dr Macaura's Pulsocon Hand Crank Vibrator, which dates back to 1890 and resembles an old-fashioned egg whisk. This may look like an early hair dryer with different attachments, but it is actually a vintage 'self-massager', used by women as a vibrator in the late 19th and early 20th centuries . Dr. Macaura's Pulsocon Hand Crank (1890) Vibrator, which resembles an archaic egg whisk, is now on display at Littledean Jail, Forest of Dean, . According to Philip Larkin, sex began in 1963, between the end of the Lady Chatterley ban and the Beatles' first LP. But this collection of Victorian vibrators shows self-pleasuring has been going on for a whole lot longer than that. Littledean Jail owner and curator Andy Jones, 51, described the assortment of sex toys as 'a fascinating insight into women's pleasure during Victorian times'. The 'ACME' hand-held vibrator shows self-pleasuring has been going on for a whole lot longer than we originally believed . When compared to today's vibrators such as the pink plastic rampant rabbit, the ACME is certainly a lot less... girly . But despite its pleasurable connotations, the modern-style vibrator was actually invented by respectable Victorian doctors. 'Pelvic massage' was a common treatment for female hysteria during the Victorian era. However, doctors found the process of administering the massage by hand tiring and time-consuming, and so devised a device to do the job for them. Dr Joseph Mortimer Granville patented an electromechanical vibrator around 1880, a story told in the 2011 film Hysteria, featuring Maggie Gyllenhaal. Despite its pleasurable connotations, the modern-style vibrator was actually invented by respectable Victorian doctors . 'If you plug them in, the force is incredible. They're loud and some of them look like hairdryers' The vibrators come packed neatly in cases with a number of different attachments, and resembles an old-fashioned drill and its bits . While some of these contraptions now look like they belong more in a torture chamber than beneath the sheets, they serve as testament to the ingenuity of Victorian inventors. The sex toys also offer a fascinating insight into the supposedly 'prim and proper' Victorian world, in which some families would supposedly cover up table legs since they were seen as suggestive and risque. 'If you plug them in, the force is incredible,' Jones said. 'They're loud and some of them look like hairdryers. 'I would imagine it would have been quite a painful exercise, judging by what I've seen of them, like having a kango hammer pressed against your body.'","Late 19th, early 20th century self-vibrators on display in Gloucestershire .

'We . believe there was a burglary going on in the home,' Indian Head Park . police Chief Frank Alonzo said at a news conference yesterday. 'They . confronted her, and, sadly, they killed her.' 'We're going to work our hardest to bring this person to justice,' Mr Alonzo added. 'We're giving it everything we have. 'Our sympathy goes out to the family. This is a tragedy for a young person to walk into their home and have this happen.' Investigators . were able to draw up a sketch based on a description from a witness. Mr . Alonzo said there had been six or seven burglaries in the town about a . month ago, but that those cases have been closed with three arrests. One . burglar, 33 year-old Samuel Watson, told police how he Googled . 'Expensive homes along highways' and then used 'Street View' to plan the . break-ins.

Her death at the $500,000 property . owned by parents John and Brenda is being investigated as homicide, . said Orland Park Police Chief Tim McCarthy, chairman of the South . Suburban Major Crimes Task Force, which is heading up the investigation. Investigators have only been letting residents with identification into the . area around 6309 Keokuk Road in Indian Head Park, the address where Miss O'Laughlin . was killed. Police have cordoned off the block and brought in a K-9 unit. Lyons . Township High School District 204 Superintendent Thomas Kilrea sent an . email to parents, which read: 'It is with deep regret that I must inform you of the tragic loss of an LTHS freshman student.' More than 500 friends, fellow students and members of the community came out for candlelight vigil at the school last night. Soon after news of Kelli's death emerged thousands of friends and fellow pupils took to Facebook to express their sadness at her death. Others went to the house and tied white ribbons and plastic bags around lampposts and and trees. Mr Alonzo's remarks yesterday were the first extended public comments from police about the case and some neighbouring parents had earlier told of their upset at the lack of information. Donna Yelnick, 44, who has a daughter at Lyons Township High School, told the Chicago Tribune: 'We're starting to get a little upset that police aren't telling us what's going on. It's got to be hard for kids to process.' 'We have the right to know what's happening in our neighbourhood,' 45-year-old Carmen Lopez, who lives two blocks from the O'Laughlins, told the Tribune. Pat Sector, 45, told the paper her 11-year-old daughter 'went to school in tears this morning.' A nearby neighbour, Kate Brodlo, who has four children aged seven to 13, said there had been 'fear here for a while,' after eight burglaries since March. Investigation: The South Suburban Major Crimes Task Force have cordoned off the area and are only allowing in residents with ID .

'(She and her friends) were . talking about life and how you could do anything you want with it, how . you could be anything you wanted to be growing up, and she died that . day.' Online groups titled 'R.I.P Kelli . O'Laughlin. You will always be deeply in our hearts.' and 'Kelli . O'Laughlin~~~You Will Be Missed' have been created, describing the girl . as an 'angel' who always 'knew right from wrong'.

"A racism row has forced Adidas to scrap its plans for a pair of trainers with ‘shackles’. Critics had compared the 'JS Roundhouse Mids', to be released in August, to the chains worn by black slaves in the 19th century. Now the sportswear giant has cancelled the launch of the Jeremy Scott-designed footwear and apologised for causing any offence. Outrage: Adidas has sparked anger and been accused of 'promoting slavery' by creating a new pair of trainers which have bright orange 'shackles' that fit around the wearer's ankles . Controversial: Many have said the shoes have connotations of the slave trade (left) and prisoners (right) The firm said: 'The trainer is . nothing more than the designer Jeremy Scott's outrageous and unique take . on fashion and has nothing to do with slavery. 'Since the shoe debuted on our . Facebook page ahead of its market release in August, adidas has received . both favourable and critical feedback. 'We apologise if people are offended by the design and we are withdrawing our plans to make them available in the marketplace.' The firm had unveiled the trainers on . its Facebook page. They feature plastic orange ‘shackles’ attached to . the ankles by chains in the same colour. They . sparked an angry debate online. More than 2,000 Facebook users have . commented, with many calling the design ‘offensive’ and ‘ignorant’, . saying the firm has ‘sunk to new lows’ with its ‘slavewear’ product. One, ‘Kay Tee’, said: ‘It’s offensive . and inappropriate in many ways… How would a Jewish person feel if they . decided to have a shoe with a swastika on it and tried to claim it was . OK in the name of fashion?’ Anger: More than 2,000 people have labelled the design 'offensive' and 'ignorant' and say the firm has 'sunk to new lows' in its 'slavewear' product . Dr Boyce Watkins, writing for Your . Black World,  said: 'Shackles. The stuff that our ancestors wore for 400 . years while experiencing the most horrific atrocities imaginable. 'Most . of which were never documented in the history books and kept away from . you in the educational system, all so you'd be willing to put shackles . on your ankles today and not be so sensitive about it.' The Professor at Syracuse University said he accepted some people would accuse him of overreacting. But he added: 'There is always a group of negroes who are more than happy to resubmit themselves to slavery. 'I'm offended by these shoes as there is nothing funny about the prison industrial complex, which is the most genocidal thing to happen to the black family since slavery itself.' Others have likened the shoes' orange 'bracelets' to the shackles worn by prisoners across the America, or said the firm is 'promoting slavery'. Controversial: Nike has provoked outrage by launching a new Black and Tan line of trainers for St Patrick's Day . Kay Tee added: 'Regardless if the . company was saying the shoes are so hot you have to chain them to you, . or they were capitalising on the whole prison style popularity. 'But . corporate business has a social responsibility above all to consider . these perceptions before releasing a product like this. It seems Adidas did not want to be outdone by fierce competitor Nike in the controversial shoe design stakes. In March, Nike was accused of 'huge insensitivity' for launching a £70 'beer-themed' trainer called 'The Black and Tan' in time for St Patrick's Day. The firm apologised, saying it was an innocent name designed to chime with the often boozy celebrations for Ireland's patron saint. To others, however, it was a historical affront reviving bitter memories of a British unit sent to Ireland to suppress revolt in the 1920s. Crackdown: British police, known as Black and Tans for their mix-and-match military outfits of dark wool and khaki, hold a suspected Sinn Fein member at gunpoint and search him for weapons . That is because the Black and Tans was the nickname given to the Royal Irish Constabulary Reserve Force, which became notorious for a brutal crackdown during the independence war. One outraged Irish American claimed it was the equivalent of calling a shoe ‘the Al Qaeda’. The trainer is officially called the Nike SB Dunk Low, but has been nicknamed The Black and Tan for its colourings. An advertisement for the shoe says: ‘Tis the season for Irish beer and why not celebrate with Nike. ‘The Black and Tan sneaker takes inspiration for the fine balancing act of a stout on top a pale ale in a pint glass.’ Others Irish Americans criticised Nike for being ‘oblivious’ to the historical connotation. Six years ago ice cream firm Ben & Jerry’s caused a furore when it launched a Black and Tan flavour. The product was quickly withdrawn. Athough only deployed from 1920 to 1922, nationalist Ireland still associates the Black and Tans with murder, brutality, massacre and indiscipline in the years leading to southern Ireland's independence . Historians say there is no dispute that 'the Tans' killed and destroyed on a large scale, and recorded that when a Tan was killed in Cork, they burnt down more than 300 buildings. The Catholic cardinal of the day called them 'a horde of savages, some of them simply brigands, burglars and thieves'.","JS Roundhouse Mids have bright 'shackles' that fit around wearer's ankles .

"Trying to work out your true feelings can sometimes be tricky business. But now a Japanese lingerie company has created a concept bra, which it claims is be able to sense when a woman is in love. Ravijour has engineered a concept bra that only undoes when ‘true love’ is detected using a built-in heart monitor and works with a smartphone app. Scroll down for video . Japanese lingerie firm Ravijour has engineered a concept bra that only undoes when 'true love' is detected using a built-in heart monitor and works with a smartphone app . The product designer explained that an built-in sensor reads the woman's heart rate and sends it to an app via Bluetooth for analysis. The app calculates the True Love Rate based on changes in heart rate over time. When the true love rate exceeds a certain value, the bra hook is unlocked automatically. The firm said the device is ‘a revolutionary bra that knows how women feel’. The bra is not currently on sale and there is no indication as to whether it will be made, but the prototype has a front clasp with a sensor and a light that glows pink if the wearer is in love with a person nearby. In a promotional video, the sensor monitors the smart bra wearer’s heart rate and transmits the data in realtime to an iPhone app using a Bluetooth connection. The bra is not currently on sale and there is no indication as to whether it will be made, but the prototype has a front clasp with a sensor and light that glows pink (pictured) if the wearer is in love with a person nearby . An app seemingly processes the data – measuring heart rate elevation using a specially built algorithm as well as pre-set data - and only when a woman’s heart rate is suitably elevated and she is in love does the bra catch open, Geekologie reported. While some would-be wearers might worry that any excitement might cause their underwear to ping off, the creators of the bra say that the catch will only be released when a woman is in love so that her Adrenal Medulla (part of the adrenal gland) secretes the hormone Catecholamine, which increases her heart rate. n a promotional video, the sensor monitors the wearer's heart rate and transmits the data in realtime to an iPhone app using a Bluetooth connection (pictured) The app calculates the 'true love rate,' (illustrated) according to the firm based on the data gleaned from the sensor on the bra, which will only open when a woman is in love so that her Adrenal Medulla (part of the adrenal gland) secretes the hormone Catecholamine, which increases her heart rate . The change is detected by the sensor, transmitted to the iPhone app and the bra unhooks, according to the company. The sex expert in Ravijour’s video said: ‘Until now the bra was a piece of clothing to remove, but now it is an instrument to test true love. ‘I believe this bra will become a friend of women around the world.' While the bra is designed to ward off creeps that try and unhook women’s underwear, according to the video, some people have questioned how the wearer might be released from the smart bra is she is not in love, or indeed if she does not feel she needs to be in love to get close to a man.

"Arsenal fans added insult to crushing defeat for Manuel Pellegrini's side by pinching Manchester City fans' Poznan celebration and mocking them with it after Olivier Giroud scored the Gunners' final goal in their 3-0 win. Arsene Wenger's team cruised to a comfortable victory at Wembley to win the Community Shield, thanks to goals from Giroud, Santi Cazorla and Aaron Ramsey.

Chuuk Lagoon is a sheltered body of water in the central Pacific north-east of New Guinea - it is part of Chuuk State within the Federated States of Micronesia. It provided Japan with a perfect natural harbour to protect its large ships and they moved their military across and fortified the islands.

"While some dogs spend their time chasing their tails, jumping for balls or even getting confused at their own reflection, Denzil has a different obsession. For the young Miniature Pinscher cross appears to think he is a meerkat. Denzil spends his days walking on his hind legs, trying to get a better view of the world from his tiny stature. Denzil (left), the dog who seems to think he is a meerkat (right) as he inquisitively walks around on his small hind legs . The one-year-old dog was rescued earlier this year and has been dubbed Meerkat by workers at Mayhew Animal Home, in North West London. His enthusiasm for walking on his hind legs, as well as stretching his neck to impossible heights has also earned the animal the nickname ET. He is able to walk on his hind legs for around 30 seconds and appears to particularly favour the walk when crossing roads - drawing the attention of many members of the public. Denzil's new owner Stephan Grothgar said: 'Denzil was a true rescue dog having been found in Denzil Road last May. Denzil, pictured with his owner Stephan Grothgar, seems to like walking like a meerkat so he can see more . Stephan Grothgar adopted Denzil from Mayhew Animal Home in West London whorescued the inquisitive dog . 'Despite being short of stature Denzil is very inquisitive and likes to get up with the action. 'We have dubbed him 'The Meerkat' because of the way he walks. 'He can get onto his hind legs and stretch to what seems double his length. Even his neck seems to triple in length almost a bit like E.T. as well.' Denzil is known for his being nosey, which sees him walking around on his hind legs when the mood takes him . The one year old dog has been adopted by Stephan Grothgar who says Denzil is a 'true rescue dog' Raffy Hamid, from the Mayhew Animal Home, said Denzil's antics had made him very popular. She said: 'He seems to do it whenever the mood takes him, I saw him do it for about 30 secs when he crossed the road. 'He is pint sized. He walks on his hind legs to get a better look at the world and when he wants to see something because he is so small.' Denzil was found last May and taken in by the rescue centre. He has now been adopted by Mr Grothgar, an artist and actor.","Denzil can walk on his hind legs for up to 30 seconds as he tries to see more .

"Paris may be at risk of losing its reputation as the city of love after installing glass and wooden panels on a historic bridge where tourists from around the world have famously attached tens of thousands of ‘love locks’. Glass panels have replaced the traditional railings and wire fencing on part of Pont des Arts to prevent amorous couples from attaching padlocks inscribed with their names, initials or messages of affection. There are plans to add a third see-through panel and expand the experiment to other bridges as the French capital cracks down on ‘visual pollution’ and attempts to make the blighted bridges safer following a dangerous incident earlier this year. Scroll down for video . Love lockdown: Paris has installed glass and wooden panels to prevent visitors from attaching 'love locks' Killing the romance: Glass panels have replaced traditional railings and wire fencing on part of Pont des Arts . Tradition: Tourists attach padlocks inscribed with names, initials or messages and toss the keys into the Seine . Pont des Arts, a little footbridge over the River Seine, is one of the city’s best-known symbols of romance thanks to the ‘love locks’, but it is at risk of losing its identity if its metal fencing is replaced with glass panels. That would satisfy Paris officials and residents, who have long bemoaned the tradition of attaching a padlock as a symbol of undying love and tossing the key in the river. Paris Deputy Mayor Bruno Julliard told Le Parisien: ‘Paris is the capital of love, we are all very proud of that, but there are more beautiful ways of showing that love than by putting padlocks on a bridge.’ He said the locks are a costly hazard because they are damaging the city’s bridges and jeopardising visitors’ safety due to the added weight. Hazard: Paris officials say the locks' added weight is damaging the bridges and putting safety at risk . Part of the footbridge's railing collapsed under the weight of the locks in June . Losing its identity? Pont des Arts is a symbol of romance in Paris thanks to the 'love locks' In June, part of Pont des Arts’ railing collapsed under the weight of the locks, forcing police to close the iconic structure while repairs were made. Earlier this year, two American students who live in Paris launched a ‘No Love Locks’ campaign . The metal bridge was originally completed in 1804 but it had to be rebuilt in the 1980s due to damage caused by aerial bombings during the First and Second World Wars.","Two glass panels have been installed as part of a pilot project .

"Millions of English holidaymakers could face passport checks at Berwick if Scotland votes for independence. Families would be forced to undergo Calais-style identity checks as they returned to England by car on roads such as the A1, A68 and M74. Rail passengers would also need to prove they had a right to enter the country before boarding a train destined for England, in a similar regime to Eurostar journeys from France. Families would be forced to undergo Calais-style identity checks as they returned to England by car on roads such as the A1, A68 and M74 . Papers published by the Westminster government today show that, if checks are introduced, they could apply to tens of millions of journeys. There are an estimated 23 million vehicle crossings per year in both directions between Scotland and England and seven million rail passenger journeys. It would be a huge logistical exercise, with the land border between Scotland and the rest of the UK extending for 95 miles from Lamberton on the east coast to the Solway Firth in the west. The border is crossed by 21 roads and two railway lines. Officials are considering how Westminster will respond if the Scottish public vote Yes to ending the three centuries-old union on September 18. There are an estimated 23 million vehicle crossings per year in both directions between Scotland and England . They are concerned that, without the imposition of border checks, the country will become a ‘back door’ to England for migrants who would not otherwise gain entry. The UK government has imposed a strict-points based system for workers from outside the EU, which makes it very hard for low-skilled migrants to gain entry. But SNP leader Alex Salmond, the Scottish first minister, has promised to introduce a far more lenient policy which has lower requirements for qualifications and the sum of money a migrant needs for ‘maintenance’. Officials are concerned these workers, having been granted a visa by Mr Salmond, would simply cross the border to England. There are also concerns over whether Scotland would be forced to join the so-called Schengen area - which allows for entirely free movement within the borders of the EU. Mr Salmond has insisted he would be able to negotiate an opt-out for Scotland in the event of independence . Currently the UK has an opt-out of the regime, which effectively means there are no checks on a person moving from one country to another inside the Union. Mr Salmond has insisted he would be able to negotiate an opt-out for Scotland in the event of independence. But Westminster officials say the rules drawn-up by Brussels clearly state that any country joining the EU as a new member would automatically be expected to join Schengen. The immigration checks would cause massive disruption on both sides of the border. They could also harm tourism, as many of the millions of visitors given permission to enter the UK each year visit both countries. Scotland would also have to find money to fund its own borders regime - which currently costs Westminster around £2billion a year. In a paper on immigration and citizenship published by the UK government today, the Scottish public are warned what they stand to lose. The document says: ‘While the UK’s external border is proactively managed and protected, the movement of people and goods between Scotland and other parts of the UK is currently unhindered. ‘Travel around the UK does not require identification documents. There are neither customs inspections nor administration associated with the movement of goods. ‘The entire UK currently benefits from unhindered movement between Scotland and England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Scotland’s borders with other parts of the UK are busy; both in terms of people and freight movement. ‘Travel and the movement of freight between Scotland and other parts of the UK are no more difficult than travel within Scotland. ‘There is no requirement to carry a passport and there are no customs inspections or other administrative requirements.‘ . Officials at Westminster deny they are engaged in political games or scaremongering. They insist that a country’s rules on borders and citizenship are vital for security and national identity.In particular, they highlight the major difference between Westminster’s stance on immigration and that of Mr Salmond. The SNP’s White Paper on independence states: ‘We plan to lower the current financial maintenance thresholds and minimum salary levels for entry, to better align them with Scottish average wages and cost of living.’ The UK Government said ‘if a separate Scotland chose to pursue a significantly different immigration policy from the UK, then that could result in border controls between the two states.’","Families would be forced to undergo Calais-style identity checks as they returned to England by car on roads such as the A1, A68 and M74 .

"Unison general secretary Dave Prentis said they are working with NHS employers to minimise the impact on patients if a planned four-hour strike goes ahead . NHS staff in England have voted to strike for four hours next month in a row over pay, in what will be the first walkout by health workers in 32 years. Unions are in dispute over the Government's refusal to accept a recommended one per cent pay rise for NHS workers. Unison, which represents 300,000 NHS staff in England, announced today their members have voted in favour of action. Several other unions are balloting  health staff - including midwives - for industrial action, with more expected to join in on October 13 from 7am to 11am. It is thought up to 500,000 NHS staff represented by nine unions could take part in the planned walk out. Unison members have also voted in favour of four days of industrial action from October 14 to October 17 - when staff will be called on to take their breaks. An industrial action ballot saw 68 per cent of members vote in favour of strike action, and 88 per cent opting for action short of a strike. Unison general secretary Dave Prentis said: 'NHS members don't take action often or lightly. 'For many of our members, this will be the first time they walk out as the last action over pay was 32 years ago. 'The NHS runs on the goodwill of its workers, but this Government has shown utter contempt for them. 'We are working with NHS employers to minimise the impact on patients. 'But it's not too late for Jeremy Hunt  to act to avoid this and we repeat our offer to the Government to negotiate with us, despite him refusing to meet with health unions about pay.' The Department of Health said they are 'disappointed' Unison has rejected proposals to give NHS staff at least one per cent extra pay this year and at least a further one per cent next year. A spokesman said they are keen to speak with union representatives to work to make the NHS pay system 'fairer and more affordable'. The action will lead up to the Trades Union Congress (TUC) and Scottish Trades Union Congress (STUC) demonstrations in London and Glasgow on October 18. Unison is demanding proper funding for the NHS, to ensure the health service has enough staff who are well motivated and fairly paid. They are calling for an immediate payment of one per cent consolidated sum to every member of NHS staff, as recommended by the NHS Pay Review Body. Union bosses also want to see the living wage of £7.65-an-hour for low paid staff, an above inflation pay rise for the next financial year and a committment to future pay rises that will restore the value of NHS pay. Unison's head of health Christina McAnea, added: 'We know health workers don't take strike action lightly or often. Unison members have voted to walkout on October 13, followed by four days of industrial action. Union bosses have called on the health secretary Jeremy Hunt to accept a recommended one per cent pay rise for NHS staff . As well as a four-hour strike on October 13, Unison, which represents 300,000 NHS staff in England, said its members will take action from October 14 to 17 - ensuring all staff take their regular breaks (File picture) 'The last action over pay was 32 years ago. 'But we also know a demoralised and demotivated workforce isn't good for patients.' In addition to the strike action on October 13, members in the Ambulance Service will be called on to work no overtime from October 14 to 17. Other unions are in the process of balloting their members on the same issues and should make their results clear in the next two weeks, Unison said. Unison members in Wales will ballot in a separate dispute between September 30 and October 20. A Department of Health spokesman said: 'We are disappointed that Unison is planning industrial action and has rejected our proposals to give NHS staff at least one per cent additional pay this year and at least a further one per cent next year. 'NHS staff are our greatest asset and we know they are working extremely hard. 'This is why despite tough financial times, we've protected the NHS budget and now have 13,500 more clinical staff than in 2010. 'We want to protect these increases and cannot afford incremental pay increases - which disproportionately reward the highest earners - on top of a general pay rise without risking frontline NHS jobs. 'We remain keen to meet with the unions to discuss how we can work together to make the NHS pay system fairer and more affordable.' If the planned strike goes ahead it will be the first time NHS staff have walked out in 32 years. Pictured are staff outside Hammersmith Hospital during the Health Service Strike of 1982 . Striking hospital workers standing on the picket line outside Westminster Hospital 32 years ago . The action comes as the Government faces a series of strikes by public sector workers, following an announcement that civil servants are to stage a walkout next month. Members of the Public and Commercial Services (PCS) union will take industrial action on October 15 in a long-running row over jobs, pay and conditions, while council workers will strike the previous day. The three days of disruption will be followed by a national protest in London organised by the TUC on October 18 under the slogan, Britain Needs A Pay Rise. The PCS said that since 2010, taking into account pay cuts, the increase in monthly pension contributions and inflation, many civil servants have suffered a 20 per cent cut in their incomes. The strike by up to a quarter of a million PCS members will include employees of Westminster government departments and agencies, and the Wales assembly, but not those who work in bodies under the jurisdiction of the Scottish government. At the Labour Party conference yesterday, the union launched a new report by tax expert Richard Murphy that claimed tax evasion deprives public finances of £80 billion a year. Collecting a fraction of these 'stolen billions' would change the debate about public spending overnight, the union said. PCS general secretary Mark Serwotka said: 'These strikes show we are serious about bringing an end to pay cuts that have slashed the living standards of public servants while the super rich have been rewarded with tax cuts. 'Until we chase down the tax dodgers and invest properly in our communities and public services, the so-called economic recovery will only ever benefit millionaires, while the millions pay the price.'","68% of balloted Unison members  voted in favour of strike on October 13 .

"An ex-NYPD officer dubbed 'cannibal cop' walked free from court today after a federal judge overturned his conviction for a plot to kidnap, kill and eat young women. Judge Paul Gardephe ruled late on Monday that there was insufficient evidence to support the conviction of Gilberto Valle. Valle, who could have faced life in prison, was acquitted of kidnapping conspiracy charges, the most serious count he faced.

Speaking to MailOnline, Valle's mother, Elizabeth said, 'I'm so happy and overwhelmed with joy. My boy is finally home.' She said the family planned a restful week in which they would take time to enjoy each other's company. She added, 'I want to cater to his every need.' His lawyer Julia Gatto told the New York Post that Valle’s mom 'is very anxious to cook a meal for him, to sit at the table with him, to hug him'. He . was convicted in March 2013 and had not yet been sentenced. The former . cop was being held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan where he had served 21 months. A jury concluded he wasn't just . fantasizing when he conversed online with others he had never met about . killing and cooking his wife and others in a cannibalism plot. 'The . evidentiary record is such that it is more likely than not the case . that all of Valle's Internet communications about kidnapping are fantasy . role-play,' Gardephe said in his 118-page opinion. Valle has been in jailed since his arrest in 2012.

Valle's own wife, Kathleen Mangan, right, turned him in to police when she found a drove of his writings about cannibalism. She divorced him last July . Valle defense lawyer Robert Baum had said that the conviction set 'a dangerous precedent'. The larger principle at stake in the trial was that 'people can be prosecuted for their thoughts,' he said. Valle's defense attorneys had vowed to appeal the verdict and said they would appeal to Gardephe to throw out the verdict. Valle, . a patrolman for the NYPD, was arrested in October 2012 after his wife, . Kathleen Mangan, found disturbing pictures on his computer that he had . downloaded from the site DarkFetishNet.com.

They also found a transcript of an online chat in which he said he planned to take his 'girlfriend' Kathleen to Pakistan, where he and another man would murder her and cannibalize her body. Valle maintains that his extensive writings were nothing more than fantasy - never meant to be acted on or carried out. Mangan, who testified against her husband at trial, was granted a divorce in July.

"Experts have had a good old chuckle at false reports of a 1500 year-old lost city near one of Australia's biggest tourist attractions – Uluru. The supposed ancient human civilisation was said to have been discovered by Australian National University archaeologists on satellite pictures using a newly developed ground-penetrating radar back in October 2013. Many Centralians had believed the lost city was a legitimate discovery before an ANU spokesman exposed the hoax that had been published on a satirical website. Experts have laughed off false reports of a 1500 year-old lost city near Uluru (pictured) 'The first we knew about it was when we read about it,' the spokesman told NT News. 'I contacted our on-site archeology unit straight away and we all had a good laugh.' 'It was on a satirical website and is definitely untrue.' The World News Daily Report website reported that a team of ANU archaeologists, who were heading to an excavation near the sandstone red rock formation of Uluru, when they ‘unearthed the ruins of a large precolonial city dating back to more than 1500 years ago’. ‘The important number of tombs and artefacts already discovered on the site suggests that it could have been the capital of an ancient empire, completely unknown to historians until now,’ the site stated. ‘Over the last few months, many structures have been unearthed including what looks like a royal palace, a few temples, large rainwater reservoirs, workshops and dozens of houses.’ The site even quoted a ‘Professor Walter Reese’ who apparently suggests that the city was occupied between 20,000 and 30,000 inhabitants for 400 to 500 years, from approximately 470-80 AD, up until the 9th Century making it ‘the most important centre of civilization in the Southern Pacific at the time’. However, the news and political satire web publication carries a disclaimer of reporting ‘presumably fake news’ which ‘may or may not use real names, often in semi-real or mostly fictitious ways.'

"A boy from Sierra Leone has been banned from attending a British primary school because ‘hysterical’ parents are worried about ebola, his mother said yesterday. Kofi Mason-Sesay, nine, was due to spend several days at St Simon’s Catholic Primary School in Stockport, Greater Manchester, as part of an annual visit. But despite being tested for ebola and given the all-clear on his arrival in Britain last week, parents mounted a campaign to have Kofi’s trip cancelled, saying they feared he could pass on the deadly virus to their children. Scroll down for video . Kofi Mason-Sesay with his mother Miriam, pictured at home yesterday after Kofi was banned from school . Public Health England have confirmed there is no risk in Kofi (right) or Mrs Mason-Sesay (left) attending the 168 pupil school, but parent power led to the initiative being cancelled by governors . Arrival: A British school has banned nine-year-old Kofi Mason-Sesay, pictured arriving at Heathrow Airport from from Sierra Leone last week, because parents feared the boy could give his classmates Ebola . School: Kofi, who has joint British and Sierra Leonean nationality, was due to spend several weeks at St Simon's Catholic Primary School in Stockport (pictured) Kofi’s mother, Miriam Mason-Sesay, 48, who is English, branded the parents ‘ignorant’ after headmistress Elizabeth Inman bowed to the pressure and refused to allow the schoolboy, who has joint Sierra Leone and British citizenship, to attend classes. Mrs Mason-Sesay, who moved to Sierra Leone from London to set up an education charity 14 years ago, said: ‘We are being treated like lepers and it’s very sad. ‘The school and its governors have been extremely supportive, but I’m afraid they’ve been put under undue pressure by an aggressive minority spreading panic and ignorance about this virus. ‘I am a reasonable citizen and mother – there is no way I would be wandering around with my nine-year-old if he had ebola. We have had one case in Britain, but just one, because we contain it. Anger: Parents campaigned against Kofi or his British mother Miriam (right) going to the school, fearing they could pass on the disease which has killed at least 678 people in Sierra Leone . Plan: The pair flew into Heathrow last Tuesday, where Kofi is pictured, and it had been planned that Kofi would attend classes at St Simon's while he and his mother stayed with family friends in Greater Manchester . ‘It is a difficult disease to catch but that point has not been taken on by these ignorant parents. We have absolutely no contact with sick people – we’re an education charity.’ Mrs Mason-Sesay set up EducAid, an organisation which aims to educate vulnerable children in Sierra Leone, with her brother in 2000. It teaches 3,000 youngsters across nine boarding schools, mostly in rural locations. In 2003, she married a local tailor, Alhassan Sesay, and Kofi was born in London in 2005, but the family moved back to Sierra Leone four weeks later. Mr Sesay died in 2009, aged just 35, of an infection which Mrs Mason-Sesay believes he would have survived if treated in the UK. After his death, the charity worker decided she never wanted to travel without her son. Education: Kofi was due to join St Simon's on a placement while Mrs Mason-Sesay carries out fundraising visits to other schools as part of her work with charity EducAid Sierra Leone . Missing out: Mrs Mason-Sesay said she and her son had been met with 'leper-type attitudes' from people 'over-reacting' since their arrival in the UK . Student:  Kofi has been going to classes at St Simon's  since he was three and he has friends there . Model pupil: Kofi with some of his certificates heralding his progress in maths . Mrs Mason-Sesay returns to Britain twice a year to give talks to schools about the charity’s work in Africa, so Kofi always accompanies her. Once he reached school age, Kofi was offered an annual placement at St Simon’s during his mother’s visits and would attend classes for up to a month each year. In a letter to parents, Mrs Inman said it was with a ‘heavy heart’ that she and the school governors had decided to cancel Kofi’s visit because of ‘misguided hysteria’ of some parents. She wrote: ‘A significant number of parents have been in touch with me to express their fears. 'There are many parents who believe that the visit should have gone ahead and that we are contributing to misunderstandings by cancelling it. Work: Mrs Mason-Sesay's charity has been trying to raise much needed funds to help children who have been orphaned by Ebola or other diseases . Reassuring: In a newsletter sent out last month, the school reassured parents with advice from Public Health England that symptomless people travelling from Africa, like Kofi, are not infectious . Visiting: Kofi attends the school when he visits the UK with his British mother to see family and friends . ‘In this instance, it has been very hard to juggle justice to Miriam and the views of parents. No risk: Last month the school tried to reassure parents via a newsletter that the visit posed no risk . ‘It is with great sadness that we decided to cancel the visit; the misguided hysteria emerging is extremely disappointing, distracting us from our core purpose of educating your children and is not an environment that I would wish a visitor to experience.’ Parents yesterday defended their stance. Richard Chamberlain, 36, said he had considered removing his two sons from the school if Kofi joined their classes. He added: ‘All the information we get in the media is that this disease has an incubation over 21 days, as far as we are concerned he could be ill by day 20 – who knows? 'The risk is not worth taking. I absolutely would be worried if he was here.’ Serenity McCann, 40, said the school were right to cancel Kofi’s visit. She added: ‘You can’t risk anything with children. Even if they tested negative, the next day they could be positive. ‘I would be worried if they had let him come here. It hasn’t been a major panic, just some parents emailing the head.’ But Peter Broom, whose two grandchildren are at the school, said: ‘I think the school were over-reacting but they have got to listen to parents. 'If they are clear of the disease, I don’t see the problem.’ Pupil: Kofi last visited the school in July, and tends to take classes there two or three times a year . Safety: Mrs Mason-Sesay said many schools in Sierra Leone have been closed due to Ebola, and children there, like Kofi, know to avoid physical contact . 'Heartbreaking': Mrs Mason-Sesay said there had been 'so much pressure from an ignorant parent body that the school had to act' Family: Kofi pictured as a toddler with his mother Miriam, and father, tailor Alhassan Sesay - who died from an infection in 2009 . Donation: Headteacher Elizabeth Inman suggested to parents that a sizeable donation should be made instead to EducAid to recognise its work in a country 'which has received more than its share of setbacks' Concern: Richard Chamberlain, 36, who has two sons at school said he felt that the school had made the right choice, but that he felt sorry for Kofi . Mothers:  Heather Rafferty, 33, (left) said parents had threatened to remove their children from the school if Kofi had been allowed into lessons, while Serenity McCann, 40, (right) who has one daughter at school said the school had made the right choice, given the risk involved . 'Overreaction': Peter Broom, whose two grandchildren go to the school, said staff had overreacted . Predictions: A team of scientists at Northeastern University in Boston have used air travel information to predict where the deadly Ebola virus could reach in the next three weeks . Aid and charity workers providing care under the UKAid programme will have their risk assessed when they return to the UK, and if they are well, will be placed into one of three monitoring groups. Mrs Mason-Sesay and Kofi need not need to be tested, but did so of their own volition. Category 1 . A person who has visited an Ebola affected area, but had no direct contact with an Ebola case (or body fluids) while they were there. There are no restrictions on the activities of people in this category - they can return to their usual activities and there is no requirement for them to be monitored. Kofi and his mother fall into this category. Category 2 . A person who has had direct or close contact with Ebola cases (or body fluids) while they were in the affected area, but wore appropriate protective equipment or clothing and had no breaches of this. They can return to live at home with ordinary family and social contact, return to work with some restrictions (only certain types of clinical work if a healthcare worker), travel by public transport and carry out other daily activities. They are required to check their own temperature twice daily for 21 days after return, and to report any raised temperature of over 38°C or other relevant symptoms to a named health protection team at Public Health England (PHE). Category 3 . A person who had direct or close contact with Ebola cases (or body fluids) while they were in the affected area, wore appropriate protective equipment or clothing, but are concerned that they may have had a breach in these protective measures or have had direct contact with an Ebola patient’s blood, urine or secretions without being protected. They can return to live in their own/ usual home with ordinary family and social contact, attend office-based work only (not patient care areas), and can take agreed UK transport (as discussed with their monitoring team at PHE). They are required to check their own temperature twice daily for 21 days after return, and to report daily to a named health protection team at PHE, even if they don’t have a raised temperature over 38°C or other suspicious symptoms.

"Smog in China has become a threat to national security because surveillance cameras guarding sensitive sites can’t film through the thick haze, experts claim. The smog that blankets the country for much of the year is getting worse and now the central government fears terrorists may choose a smoggy day to launch attacks. Concerns were voiced as it was reported that an  eight-year-old girl had become the youngest person in China . to contract lung cancer which doctors claim was caused by the country's . horrendous air pollution. Before: A view of the Chinese city of Nanjing shrouded in smog which is having a devastating affect on people's health . A breath of fresh: An image showing the very same shot of Nanjing on a clear day . Terrible legacy of industrialisation: An eight-year-old girl has reportedly become the youngest person in China to contract lung cancer which doctors in Nanjing (above) claim was caused by horrendous air pollution . Time to change: The same view in the previous picture looks beautiful on a smog-free day . The . girl, who has not been named, lives nears a busy road in the eastern . province of Jiangsu, according to AFP which cited Xinhuanet, the website . of China's official news agency. The . report quoted a doctor at Jiangsu Cancer Hospital in Nanjing who said . the girl had been exposed to harmful particles and dust for an extended . period. Referring to the effect on CCTV cameras, Kong Zilong, a . senior project engineer and an expert in video surveillance technology, . said: 'As the visibility drops below three metres, even the best camera . cannot see beyond a dozen metres.' The security fears come just days . after suicide bombers protesting against oppression in the western . Muslim province of Xinjiang drove a car into a crowd of tourists in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square - the site of . the 1989 massacre of pro-democracy protesters by government troops and . tanks. The car exploded . into a fireball, killing the three occupants and two tourists and . injuring 40. Five people have been arrested in connection with the attack.

The . particles are so dense, they block light almost as effectively as a . brick wall but ‘the security devices that could function in heavy smog . had yet to be invented’ Mr Kong said. Like Britain, Beijing has invested . heavily to build up a nationwide surveillance network that lets police . watch every major street and corner in main cities. The government has now turned to scientists to come up with a solution. The . National Natural Science Foundation of China funded two teams, one . civilian and one military, to study the issue and has told the . scientists involved to find solutions within four years. Fireball: The security fears come days after alleged suicide bombers drove a car into a crowd of tourists in Beijing's Tiananmen Square (above), killing its three occupants and two pedestrians as well injuring 40 others . What did they pick up? A police officer seen walking past CCTV cameras (top right) near to the site of the attack days before experts revealed their fears that smog is hampering the country's war on terror . Professor Yang Aiping, an expert in digital imaging, said she was facing tremendous pressure because of the enormous technological challenges. It comes as China's top negotiator at international climate talks said on Tuesday that air pollution in his own country - the world's biggest carbon emitter - is harming its citizens. 'China indeed is suffering from severe air pollution,' said Xie Zhenhua, vice chairman of the National Development and Reform Commission, the top economic planning body. Smoggy conditions have 'now become the norm which has severely affected the mental and physical health of the Chinese people', he added - but voiced hope for improvement in the next decade. Xie, speaking to reporters before global climate talks in Poland next week, attributed China's air problems to the country's 'obsolete development model', its 'unreasonable industrial and energy structure"" and discharge of pollutants by some companies 'in a very extensive way'. The root cause, he added, is the 'use of fossil fuels'. Blanketed: Buildings are seen through thick smog in Beijing in 2007. Experts say air pollution has got even worse since to the point where CCTV cameras are struggling pick up images even a few metres away . Damning: Recent Nasa satellite images reveal the terrifying extent of China's air pollution. The thick haze of smog is clearly visible in murky grey . Pollution is becoming a major source . of public anger in China and authorities vowed in September to reduce . levels of atmospheric pollutants in Beijing and other major cities by as . much as 25 per cent by 2017 to try to improve their dire air quality. The government said pollution levels . would be cut by slowing the growth of coal consumption so that its share . of China's energy sources fell to 65 percent by 2017. Last month, choking smog forced Chinese authorities to shut down one of the country's largest cities.The . dense pollution in Harbin - a city of more than 10 million people – . meant that visibility was reduced to less than 10 metres. The . smog forced schools to suspend classes, caused snarling traffic and . closed the airport, in what was the country's first major air pollution . crisis of the winter. The cold weather typically brings the worst air . pollution to northern China because of a combination of weather . conditions and an increase in the burning of coal for homes and . municipal heating systems. China is the world's biggest coal consumer and is forecast to account for more than half of global demand next year.","Security cameras cannot pick up anything beyond 12 metres, experts claim .

"The alleged founder of drug trafficking site Silk Road paid an undercover federal agent $80,000 to have a former employee tortured and killed, federal prosecutors charged today. Ross William Ulbricht, a 29-year-old software engineer, is also accused of ordering another murder - this one for $150,000. The FBI shut down the site on Wednesday after infiltrating it. The so-called Deep Web or Dark Web site allegedly worked as an eBay for the black market - selling cocaine and marijuana, drugs, credit card numbers, instructions on how to hack an ATM and other illegal goods. Criminal network: Ross William Ulbricht, 29, has been arrested in San Francisco over the alleged drug-dealing activities of his website Silk Road . The Baltimore Sun reports that a federal indictment says a Maryland,-based federal agent infiltrated Silk Road, posing as a major drug distributor who was looking for high end customers. After selling a kilogram a fake cocaine to one of Ulbricht's co-workers using untraceable BitCoin currency, Ulbricht later confided in the agent that the employee had run off with his money. He allegedly struck a deal with the agent - who he believed with a major drug distributor - to have the employee tortured so that he would return the money and learn a lesson. Later, after the former employee was arrested, Ulbricht allegedly send the undercover agent another message: 'can you change the order to execute rather than torture?' He explained the employee 'was on the inside for a while, and now he's been arrested, I'm afraid he'll give up info.' The feds say Ulbricht wired $80,000 to the agent. In exchange, federal investigators staged a torture scene for the employee and made it look like he had been beaten and then killed. After receiving 'proof of death' from the undercover agent, Ulbricht responded he was 'a little disturbed, but I'm OK.' Ulbricht, who holds an advanced degree in chemical engineering, appeared in federal court on Wednesday and a bail hearing was set for Friday. His lawyer Brandon LeBlanc, a public defender, declined to comment. A Google+ account for Ulbricht had this post on April 9 last year: 'Anybody know someone that works for UPS, FedEX, or DHL?' Federal prosecutors in New York charged Ulbricht with one count each of narcotics trafficking conspiracy, computer hacking conspiracy and money laundering conspiracy, the filing said. 'Silk Road has emerged as the most sophisticated and extensive criminal marketplace on the Internet today,' FBI agent Christopher Tarbell said in the criminal complaint. The site was used by 'several thousand drug dealers' to sell 'hundreds of kilograms of illegal drugs,' he said. The site, which has operated since early 2011, also offered tutorials on hacking ATM machines, contact lists for black market connections and counterfeiters, and guns and hit men for sale, according to the charges. More than 900,000 registered users of the site bought and sold drugs using the digital currency Bitcoin. Time's up: The FBI has shut down Silk Road, an anonymous Internet marketplace for illegal drugs like heroin and cocaine and criminal activities such as murder for hire . In recent media reports about the growing popularity of Bitcoin, the Silk Road website has emerged as part of a darker side to the use of digital currencies. Through the site, according to the charges, users could buy drugs and have them shipped to an address. Investigators, posing as regular users on Silk Road, made more than 100 purchases of drugs, which were shipped to the New York area. According to the complaint, Ulbricht, who shortened his alias from Dread Pirate Roberts to DPR when posting on Silk Road's forums, operated the site from San Francisco. It's a piece of data locked in an internet-based network by a complex equation. Once released it can be traded and used like money online and can be purchased with real cash. Many websites are now taking Bitcoins as a form of currency. As well as digital currency, Bitcoin miners enjoy the competitive nature of unlocking the coins. Famous fans include the Winklevoss twins - famous rivals of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg - who own around 1 per cent of Bitcoins - currently worth around $11million. It has been dismissed by some as a Ponzi Scheme and touted by others as the future of money. It is not centrally controlled and it's unique and complex set up means the market cannot be altered or hacked, according to the developers. There are 21 million coins predicted to last until 2140 and their finite nature means they perform more like a commodity, such as gold. The coins first emerged in 2008 and launched as a network in 2009. They were introduced by an obscure hacker whose identity is a mystery but is known as Satoshi Nakamoto, which is thought to be a pseudonym. Users choose a virtual wallet from one of the various providers which enables them to receive, give and trade coins from other users.Bitcoins can be bought from specialist currency exchanges and online marketplaces such as eBay. At times, he used computers at Internet cafes to access the servers running the website, which employed several technological tools to mask the location of its servers and the identities of its administrators and users. The complaint described other aspects of Ulbricht's online presence: In a Google+ profile, he described himself as a fan of libertarian economic philosophy and posted videos from the Ludwig von Mises Institute, an Auburn, Alabama-based economics institute. Reached by phone in Austin, Texas, Ubricht's parents said they had not known what their son was doing in San Francisco. 'He is a really stellar, good person and very idealistic,' said Ulbricht's mother, Lyn Lacava. 'I know he never meant to hurt anyone.' Ulbricht's father Kirk confirmed his son had received a master's in material sciences from Pennsylvania State University. His thesis was titled: Growth of EuO Thin Films by Molecular Beam Epitaxy. 'He did amazing research on crystals and exotic materials they hoped would have some use for humans, Ulbricht said. 'But it was very theoretical stuff.' The complaint against Ulbricht describes a darker side. During one correspondence with a Silk Road user, Ulbricht tried to call out a hit on another user with whom he had a dispute. That user, known online as FriendlyChemist, was threatening to expose the identities of thousands of Silk Road users unless Ulbricht sent him money. 'I wouldn't mind if he was executed,' Ulbricht wrote, offering personal details about his foe, including the fact that he was a married father of three, and the names of the city and province where he lived. In a later post, Ulbricht wrote: 'He is threatening to expose the identities of thousands of my clients.' 'This kind of behavior is unforgivable to me. Especially here on Silk Road, anonymity is sacrosanct.' During the raid, authorities seized $3.6 million worth of bitcoin, which was used instead of cash or credit cards to complete transactions on Silk Road. Facing charges: Ulbricht, 29, is due in court on Friday. He has an advanced chemisty degree and 'very idealistic', according to his parents . The charges against Ulbricht said his website generated sales of more than 9.5 million bitcoin, roughly equivalent to $1.2 billion. Authorities seized the currency by taking control of the digital 'wallets' Silk Road used to store bitcoin. In a corresponding civil asset forfeiture action, prosecutors claimed Silk Road and Ulbricht were liable to the government for the value of all transactions involving drug tracking and computer hacking, as well as for money laundering penalties, and a final amount would be determined at trial. The raid on Wednesday was not the first time the U.S. government has made arrests related to Silk Road. Earlier this year, authorities in South Carolina arrested Eric Daniel Hughes, known on Silk Road as 'Casey Jones', and charged him in state court with drug possession. The Drug Enforcement Agency seized units of bitcoin, which Hughes allegedly used to purchase drugs from the online market. Bitcoin, which has been around since 2008, first came under scrutiny by law enforcement officials in mid-2011 after media reports surfaced linking the digital currency to Silk Road.","Silk Road owner, Ross William Ulbricht, 29, known online as 'Dread Pirate Roberts,' was arrested in San Francisco on Tuesday .

"Support: Sarah Palin last night said that if she lived in South Carolina she would vote for Newt Gingrich as Republican presidential candidate . Former Alaska governor Sarah Palin threw her support behind presidential candidate Newt Gingrich last night. But she drew short of backing him, saying that if she lived in South Carolina she would vote for Gingrich to prevent Mitt Romney becoming the Republican nominee. Palin said she wants to see the Republican primary continue. Should frontrunner Romney win Saturday's primary vote in South Carolina then he will stand against President Barack Obama for election later this year. At this stage, Palin said she wants to keep the Republican nomination open as the GOP candidates are improving as the contest continues. She told Fox News: 'If I . were a South Carolinian... I would want to see this thing continue because iron . sharpens iron, steel sharpens steel. These guys are getting better in . their debates. 'If I had to vote in South Carolina, in order to keep . this thing going, I'd vote for Newt. And I would want things to . continue. More debates, more vetting of candidates.' Palin, the Republican vice presidential candidate in 2008, considered entering the presidential race last year but ultimately decided not to. She still holds sway among tea party activists. As Saturday's South Carolina primary vote approaches, Gingrich yesterday levelled a forceful new attack on Romney, calling the frontrunner's former private equity firm 'exploitive'. Gingrich had attacked Bain Capital before, but his comments before a gathering of business leaders in Columbia contained some of his harshest rhetoric yet. After lagging behind in the Iowa causes . and the New Hampshire primary, Gingrich is hoping a strong showing in . the nation's first Southern primary will re-energise his White House . bid. Scroll down for video . Campaign trail: Newt Gingrich speaks in Columbia, South Carolina, yesterday.

Where eagle dares: Gingrich speaks to supporters alongside his wife Callista at the Art Trails Gallery in Florence, South Carolina, yesterday . As Saturday's South Carolina showdown approaches, a poll yesterday showed that Mitt Romney now enjoys the backing of 37 per cent of Republicans across the U.S. The Gallup poll followed Monday night's hotly contested GOP presidential candidate debate in Myrtle Beach. Romney's nearest rivals, Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum, both polled at 14 per cent each. He held little back in his criticism of Romney, saying that, in at least some instances, the Bain model has meant 'leverage the game, borrow the money, leave the debt behind and walk off with all the profits. 'Now, I'll let you decide if that's really good capitalism. I think it's exploitive. I think it's not defensible.' Gingrich continued that what Romney engaged in 'is not venture capital'. 'Venture capital is when you go in and put in your capital and you stick it out,' he said. Gingrich has faced rebuke in some quarters as attacking the GOP bedrock of free enterprise in his criticism of Romney and Bain. Lining up: Rick Santorum, Mitt Romney and Gingrich pose for a photo at the start of the South Carolina Republican presidential candidate debate in Myrtle Beach on Monday . Candidates: (From left) Rick Perry, Santorum, Romney, Gingrich and Ron Paul take part in Monday's debate at the Myrtle Beach Convention Center . But he argued yesterday that raising questions about Romney's track record at Bain should not be confused with an attack on capitalism. He said: 'I'm proud of real capitalists. I'm proud of guys who say to their workers I'm in it with you. If I lose money and you lose a job we lost together because we both tried.' Earlier in the day, Gingrich said at a town hall meeting in West Columbia that a Muslim-American seeking office in the U.S. would have to publicly renounce Islamic law to receive his backing. When asked if he could support a Muslim for office, the former House speaker replied that it 'would depend entirely on whether the person would commit in public to give up sharia,' or Islamic law. Gingrich said he is totally opposed to Islamic law and supports a federal law that would pre-empt it. 'A truly modern person who worshipped Allah would not be a threat,' he said.","Former Alaska governor wants Republican primary to continue .

"A girl of 15 had to cope with a screaming heckler at the Labour Party conference yesterday after she spoke in praise of her academy school. Resurrecting Old Labour’s views on education, the heckler sought to shout down Joan al-Assam, a Year 11 pupil from Paddington Academy in West London – even though the school  was a flagship creation of the last Labour government. Joan, a star pupil at the academy which opened in 2006, sought asylum in Britain at the age of six from Iraq with just the clothes on her back. Scroll down to watch the heckling . Joan al-Assam was giving a speech at the Labour Party Conference when she was heckled about attending the Paddington Academy . Delegates were quick to condemn the outburst from one member of the audience in the Manchester conference hall . But when she made an emotional speech about how the school has helped her, she faced yobbish abuse from a woman believed to be a member of one of the teaching unions. The heckler shouted support for comprehensive schools as Joan told the conference how she and her fellow pupils benefited from an arts education. The teenager, an A-grade student who was recently chosen to conduct an interview with Cherie Blair when she visited the school, continued unfazed. Education Secretary Michael Gove last night condemned the ‘disgraceful’ incident and demanded that the heckler be kicked out of the Labour Party. The intervention was an embarrassment for Ed Miliband and a reminder of the  left-wingers who oppose even the last Labour government’s education reforms. Headteacher Oli Tomlinson with students at the Paddington Academy in west London . When the Paddington Academy was set up in September 2006 to replace a failing school, just one in four pupils achieved five GCSEs including English and Maths graded A* to C, the main benchmark for success at age 16. The . academies programme (Paddington Academy, above) was first established . under Tony Blair's Labour government to boost standards in poorer areas. In . 2010, under the new coalition Government, Education Secretary Michael . Gove opened up the scheme to allow all schools to apply for academy . status. Academies . are semi-independent state schools, free from local authority control, . that receive their funding directly and have more freedom over areas . such as the curriculum and staff pay and conditions. As of January this year, there were 1,529 academies in England, compared with 200 in May 2010 when the Coalition came to power. The . previous Labour government introduced academies as a secondary-only . programme but the Coalition has extended the freedoms to primaries. Ministers . can also use powers under the Academies Act 2010 to require schools to . convert to academies if they are consistently failing. Last year that figure had soared to 69 per cent, even though three out of four pupils do not speak English as a first language. In 2011 the school also sent its first pupil to Cambridge University. Teachers turned round the school with a focus on solid academic subjects such as maths, with every pupil measured against personal targets every six weeks, with the results published to encourage competitive improvement. It also enforces a strict uniform policy and a code that ‘the street stops at the gate’. The mood turned ugly  yesterday when Joan talked about arts programmes at the school. ‘Some of us explore our creativity through thousands of hours of brushstrokes and hundreds of hours of art. To many of you this may seem extraordinary that an inner city school offers so much, but to us at Paddington this is nothing but normal.’ At this point, the furious heckler yelled: ‘They do that at comprehensives too you know.’ There was a murmur of support from some seated with the heckler, but others booed the interruption and a woman shouted: ‘Leave her alone.’ The reaction to her coming under fire was instant on Twitter, where one viewer, Richard Angell said: ‘Appalled that a #Lab12 delegate heckled a pupil who came to UK as a political asylum seeker 4 championing the Paddington Academy she attends.’ Another called Lefty Lisa said: ‘Bad form. Delegate actually just heckled a year 11 student.’ The first three academies – state-funded schools independent of town hall control – were opened by Labour in 2002. A further 200 had opened by the time the party left office in 2010, mainly replacing under-performing comprehensives. The Coalition expanded the programme and allowed existing schools to gain the status as well. There are now more than 2,300. Ministers attribute their good  results to greater freedoms enjoyed by heads, including over staff pay, the curriculum and the school calendar. A Labour spokesman said: ‘No one should be heckled at a party conference, least of all a teenage girl making her first speech.’","Year 11 student is shouted down during debate on education policy .

"A 27-year-old woman in Broward County, Florida has filmed herself berating Dunkin' Donuts employees in an apparent attempt to exact some kind of consumer justice. Taylor Chapman, however, only succeeds in appearing rude, ignorant and racist in the video, which she posted on her Facebook page. The imagined slight occurred the night prior, when a Dunkin' Donuts employee apparently forgot to print Chapman's receipt. In what Chapman seems to have construed as a mortal insult, the employee offered Chapman her entire order free the next time she entered the store to make up for the oversight. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Viral: Before making her obscene Dunkin' Donuts video, Chapman's YouTube channel was devoted to marketing videos, including this one for Happy Wok . Poor worker: This Dunkin' Donuts employee gracefully puts up with Chapman's demands and insults . This more than generous offer apparently boiled Chapman's blood, and she entered the fast food outlet the next day armed with a camera phone and a bad attitude. To the credit of Dunkin' Donuts staff, they are unfailingly polite to Chapman, despite the insults, swearing and racial slurs spat at them. In between orders of bacon and cheese croissants (bacon extra crispy), iced coffee with extra cream and extra sugar and a Strawberry Coolatta, which Chapman mistakenly thinks the workers have forgotten. The eight minute and nine second ordeal begins with Chapman warning the male employee who serves her, 'This is all being under video surveillance, OK?' She then tells him her complaint: That a female employee the night before forgot to print out her receipt and then 'turned into a complete rude b*tch'. She neglects to explain exactly how the employee did her wrong though. 'She told me, OK, you can get your order free next time. So you know what I told her? I want the whole f****n' menu, b***h. Twice.' Butter wouldn't melt: From the way Chapman interviews business owners on her YouTube channel, you'd never guess she'd racially abuse fast food workers because of a forgotten receipt . According to Chapman, her lawyer is 'already on it' and she says she'd spoken to someone from the store earlier that day who told her she could have her order free. The employee explains that he doesn't know what happened the night before but reassures Chapman he's happy to give her what she wants. She begins to order, asking for the Strawberry Coolatta, which she admits was not one of the items she ordered the day before. Chapman tells a fellow customer, 'I just want my bacon crispy and my people nice, you know?' 'Cos I literally thought this was the best one in the city, and I gave you guys so many good, like, remarks online because I have a business degree and, like, I really did until that b***h just completely p****d me off,' she explains, reasonably. Chapman attempts to engage her fellow customers in the video, but they aren't forthcoming. 'That's your issue,' says one man. 'I've got my own issues.' A receipt ain't one, though, as he tells Chapman that he is always given his receipt at Dunkin' Donuts. First world problems: 'This is what you have to do in life, it f*****g sucks. Blow my brains out,' says Chapman to the camera as she receives free food and racially abuses the people serving her . 'I'm from Indiana in Kentucky,' Chapman tells the man, 'And up there this s**t doesn't happen,' she says, but goes on to mention that 'One time they p*ssed in my fries where I'm from at home. Literally I could smell the p*ss.' 'So I know they're probably sh*ttin' and p*ssin in it, because they really don't give a sh*t,' she says loudly. 'That's why I'm not eating this food, I'm giving it to my boyfriend.' The worst is yet to come, though, when Chapman spies the woman she believed was rude to her the night before. 'Well, guess what? This s**t’s about to go live, b***h. Right on Facebook,' she rants. 'Cause I already posted what your dumb ass did last night. So I hope you’re happy with your little f****g sand n****r self. Cause I’m about to nuke your whole f****g planet from Mars. You think ya’ll are tough big fat Arabs bombin’ the Trade Center? I’ll show you tough,' she yells to the woman, who calmly goes about her business behind the counter. Chapman's LinkedIn profile says she's currently the marketing manager for Comfort Care Medical Equipment, but according to The Smoking Gun the company says she hasn't worked there for more than a year. Chapman, whose LinkedIn profile says she went to Nova Southeastern University in Orlando, also has a YouTube channel on which she has posted numerous marketing videos of low production quality. Expressing her excitement at posting the . video, she says, 'Hi Facebook, this is what you have to do in life, it . f*****g sucks. Blow my brains out,' a sentiment shared by many who have . seen the video. Craig11152 commented, 'I think she is mentally ill.' Jack Silver describes her as 'a disgusting piece of gutter slime' and writes: . 'Clearly you are not employed with that level of ignorance. The best part about this is once it's on the internet, it's there FOR EVER. I hope any prospective employer/boyfriend/in-laws gets a good look at what a piece of trash you really are.' Daraymann wrote, 'And now everybody knows what﻿ kind of a human being you are. God bless the internet.' Chapman has removed her Facebook page, but the video of which she was so proud remains on YouTube, where its comment section is growing ever longer.","Florida woman Taylor Chapman made a 'surveillance video' of herself berating employees of her local Dunkin' Donuts store because she did not receive a receipt the last time she was there .

"A man is attempting to walk across the Irish Sea - in a human hamster wheel. Chris Todd, 35, will zig-zag 66 miles across open water for two days non-stop. He will power his metal wheel - which he calls a Tredalo - by walking on wire mesh, with two floats either side to act as stabilisers. Scroll down to watch how it works... Chris Todd walks on water with the help of his self built 'tredalo'. He attempted to walk across the Irish Sea in the contraption . The charity stunt will see him burn a huge 36,000 calories - almost three weeks worth - during the endurance feat. He will consume a whopping 30 litres of water and munch the equivalent of 60 Mars bars to keep energy levels up. Engineer Chris, from Bromham, Wiltshire, said: 'It will be like running 10 back-to-back marathons. 'The Irish Sea crossing is on the very edge of what I believe is possible. 'But I am looking forward to a cold Guinness on arrival.' Chris hand-crafted the human hamster wheel in his garden with help from his wife and friends. The idea came to him while rowing across a lake - and he spent 11 months painstakingly piecing it together. He originally planned to use it to cross the English Channel, but red-tape and high costs curtailed his bid, forcing him to turn to the Irish Sea. Chris added: 'I’ve tested it on lakes and in the sea but that has only been for a couple of hours, which is totally different to a couple of days.

'The only way we are going know if it will stand up to the battering from the waves is to actually do it. 'It is going to be one of the toughest things I’ve ever done. 'Imagine spending 48-hours on a stepping machine in the gym without getting any sleep. 'I’m not looking forward to night time in case I end up in the way of a ship and unlike endurance races on land the horizon is going to be bleak and featureless. 'So it will be mentally challenging as well as physically.' Chris’s long suffering wife Joy has her reservations about his latest hair-raising stunt for charity. James and Thomas Mahoney helps Chris Todd to assemble his DIY  'tredalo', which he hopes to use to walk across the Irish Sea . Finishing touches: The craft also includes boxes for food and drink, and a stand for a map . He added: 'It took me 11 months to build because if I  spent any more time tinkering with it I’d be divorced. 'She isn’t over the moon that I am doing it and rejected the idea of accompanying me in the safety boat, but she is very supportive. 'She has become quite used to my endurance feats and I’ve been very thorough with all the risk assessments.' Chris hopes to raise £20,000 and will split the money between two charities - Royal National Lifeboat Institution and Wiltshire Blind Association.

"In a paper published this week, Ian Low, Joseph Lykken and Gabe Shaughnessy of Cornell have cast doubt on what exactly was detected within the Hadron Collider . Signals detected from the Large Hadron Collider were hailed as conclusive proof that the 'God particle' - the Higgs boson - had been found after a quest spanning nearly five decades. A week after the discovery of a particle, believed to be the elusive particle, scientists at Cornell University have said they are not so sure. In a paper published this week, Ian Low, Joseph Lykken and Gabe Shaughnessy of Cornell have cast doubt on what exactly was detected within the Hadron Collider. 'The new resonance discovered by the ATLAS and CMS experiments at the CERNLarge Hadron Collider (LHC) could be the long-sought Higgs boson of the Standard Model,' say the scientists. But the researchers point out that it's far from certain that the particle is the 'standard model Higgs' which scientists have sought for decades to fill in the 'gaps' in the model of physics we currently use to explain the universe. 'We show that current LHC data already strongly disfavor both the dilatonic and non-dilatonic singlet imposters. 'On the other hand, a generic Higgs doublet and a triplet imposter give equally good fits to the measured event rates of the newly observed scalar resonance.' The researchers advise caution - and say that 'currently the uncertainties in these quantities are too large' to make a definitive statement. Scientists at CERN are also analysing the data further to see if their discovery corresponds to the 'standard model' Higgs boson - or to something more mysterious. One of the reasons for the caution at . Cern is that while the new particle has so far behaved liked the . elusive Higgs boson it is lighter than expected. This opens up the possibility of . there being more than one Higgs boson and could lead to a new . understanding of dark matter, the mysterious substance thought to make . up a quarter of the universe. Professor Higgs, 83, wiped a tear from his eye as the findings were announced, and later said: 'It's really an incredible thing that it's happened in my lifetime.' Professor Tejinder Virdee, of . Imperial College London, who helped lead one of the two teams of . scientists behind the discovery, said: 'This breaks the way to looking . at a new vista in physics. It is a very exciting moment.' Inside: The giant project is the most enormous piece of scientific apparatus ever constructed, and is buried 100m beneath the ground . Professor Peter Higgs appeared to wipe away a tear after scientists at the Large Hadron Collider claimed to have discovered a particle believed to be the Higgs boson . An aerial view of the Swiss-French border, indicating the route of the Large Hadron Collider . The Higgs was proposed in 1964 - it . is the last missing piece of the Standard Model, the theory that . describes the basic building blocks of the universe. The other 11 . particles predicted by the model have been found - the Higgs is the last . jigsaw piece.If the particle was shown not to exist, it would have meant tearing up the Standard Model and going back to the drawing board. One of the reasons for the caution at . Cern is that while the new particle has so far behaved liked the . elusive Higgs boson it is lighter than expected. This opens up the possibility of . there being more than one Higgs boson and could lead to a new . understanding of dark matter, the mysterious substance thought to make . up a large portion of the mass of the universe. The Higgs boson's role is to give the . particles that make up atoms their mass. Without this mass, they would . zip around the cosmos, unable to bind together to form the atoms that . make stars and planets – and people. Despite its fabled properties, the particle has eluded previous searches and not all scientists believed in its existence. To try to pin it down, scientists at the . Large Hadron Collider near Geneva smashed together beams of protons – . the 'hearts of atoms' – at close to the speed of light, recreating . conditions that existed a fraction of a second after the Big Bang.

This . field permeates the cosmos and is made up of countless numbers of tiny . particles – or Higgs bosons.As other particles pass through it, they . pick up mass. In December last year scientists at . the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) - the 'Big Bang' particle accelerator . which recreates conditions a billionth of a second after the birth of . the universe - revealed they had caught a first tantalising glimpse of . the Higgs.

"More than 160 doctors, nurses, paramedics and other NHS staff have volunteered to go to ebola- ravaged West Africa. They will spend six weeks trying to stem the worst ever outbreak of the disease, which has claimed more than 2,800 lives. The number of cases will ‘climb exponentially’, with more than 20,000 people infected by the start of November, unless urgent action is taken, the World Health Organisation has forecast. Survivor: The disease has taken a high toll on healthcare workers, including British nurse William Pooley, who caught ebola while working in blood-spattered wards in Sierra Leone . At the weekend, the Government’s chief medical officer Dame Sally Davies asked British healthcare staff to volunteer. By Monday night, 164 had come forward. They will be given training before they go on how to prevent the virus spreading in hospitals – and how to protect themselves against infection. The disease has taken a high toll on healthcare workers, including British nurse William Pooley, who caught ebola while working in blood-spattered wards in Sierra Leone. Doctors attending Spanish doctor Manuel Garcia Viejo, infected with Ebola, as he arrives at the Torrejon de Ardoz Air Base in Madrid, Spain, on Monday . The 29-year-old, who was the first Briton to contract ebola, has since made a full recovery. Yesterday, experts warned that the disease might be here to stay – and become a part of life like flu, HIV or TB. They said that rather than causing large but short outbreaks, it could mutate so it passes more easily between people. If it does become endemic in West Africa, this would raise the odds of it coming to Britain, said Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust. A £3.2million grant from the trust, one of the world’s biggest medical charities, will be used to test much-needed ebola drugs in Africa, with the first doses given in November.","The volunteers will spend six weeks battling spread of deadly disease .

"Victory: Labour's Alex Rowley benefited from a big swing away from the SNP . Labour has delivered a humiliating blow to the Scottish National Party with a resounding by-election victory in Gordon Brown’s backyard. Jubilant Labour supporters said Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond had received a ‘gubbing’ at the hands of voters, following an 11 per cent swing. The result is a further set-back for Mr Salmond’s SNP ahead of this year’s referendum on Scottish independence, which polls suggest he is on course to lose. The by-election for the Cowdenbeath seat in the Scottish Parliament was held following the death of Labour MSP Helen Eadie in November, just days after it emerged she was being treated for cancer. Cowdenbeath in Fife, to the north of Edinburgh, is part of Gordon Brown’s seat at Westminster. The former Prime Minister remains a very popular figure in this part of Scotland, and he repeatedly took to the streets with his wife Sarah during the campaign. Fife Council leader Alex Rowley, a former election agent for Mr Brown, was defending a Labour majority of just over 1,200. The seat was one of only 15 that Labour held in the Scottish Parliament election of 2011 when the SNP stormed to power with a landslide victory. But Labour won yesterday’s battle with a majority of 5,488 and a huge 55.8 per cent share of the vote, up 9.3 percentage points since 2011. The SNP trailed in second place with just 28.4 per cent, which was down 13.2 points. The Tories increased their share of the vote to 9.4 per cent, with UKIP in a distant fourth place on just 3 per cent. But the most humiliating result was for the LibDems, whose popularity in Scotland has plummeted after joining the Conservatives in coalition at Westminster. They received just 425 votes, or 2.1 per cent of the total – and lost their deposit. Turnout in the contest was only 34.81 per cent, and was as low as 11 per cent in one part of the constituency. Defeat: The result signalled a major swing away from Alex Salmond's Scottish National Party . Alex Rowley said: “I'm delighted and humbled that the people of Cowdenbeath have put their faith in me to be their next MSP. ""We fought this campaign on the issues and concerns of hard working Fifers. Jobs, skills, training and opportunities for our young will be my priority and must be for the Scottish Government.” Scottish Labour Leader Johann Lamont MSP added: “For Scottish Labour, we are encouraged that the people of Scotland are responding our positive message of reality and change and we are determined to build on this emphatic result as we enter a crucial period in our country's future."" 'The people of Scotland are responding to our positive message': Labour leader Johann Lamont . Labour’s victory comes after the party gained the neighbouring Dunfermline seat with a majority of 2,783 over the SNP in October, which was the first time a seat had changed hands in a Scottish Parliament by-election for 13 years. That victory came despite a widespread feeling that Labour had a much weaker candidate than the SNP, and ran a dismal campaign. This time around, Mr Rowley proved an effective operator and was boosted by high-profile appearances from Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls, as well as Mr Brown and his wife Sarah. Charity worker Natalie McGarry, a rising star in the SNP, was the main challenger to Mr Rowley. A regular television pundit, she is very well liked in the party and beyond, and is expected to be an elected member at some point in the future. SNP business convener Derek Mackay said: “The SNP fought a strong campaign with an excellent candidate in Natalie McGarry, and we made the issues of the by-election the issues that matter to the people - the council tax freeze, free school meals and extending childcare. ""The share of the vote we achieved was the same as our performance in 2007 - when we won a national election across Scotland for the very first time - and therefore is an extremely creditable performance. “This was the only seat in Fife we didn't win at the high water mark of 2011, it has remained a Labour seat in the by-election, and we wish Alex Rowley well in representing the people of Cowdenbeath constituency. ""However, the swing Labour achieved in Cowdenbeath is only around half the swings the SNP achieved in by-elections when Labour were in government, such as in Hamilton South and Glasgow East, which indicates the underlying strength of the SNP after nearly seven years in office.”","Party scores victory in Scottish Parliament by-election in Cowdenbeath .

"A neo-Nazi dad who named his son Adolf Hitler has said he'll continue to have kids if child welfare services keep taking his - after another child, Eva Braun, was taken two days after she was born. Heath Campbell, 40, a father-of-nine who first hit headlines after a bakery refused to ice his son's Nazi-inspired name on a birthday cake, has demanded welfare services hand back his daughter. Campbell's fiance, 22-year-old Bethanie Zito, gave birth to the little girl in a Pennsylvania hospital on November 11 and the couple named her after Hitler's long-term companion. After two days, the baby was taken into care by child services. Demands: Heath Campbell, with his fiancee Stephanie Zito, said he will continue to have children if child welfare services continue to take his away. The couple's daughter was taken from them in November . Battle: The couple, pictured at their engagement in June, named their baby Eva Braun. The little girl was taken away 2 days after her birth - but Zito's lawyer said it was because her first child had been taken too . 'I'm not allowed to have children because . I’m a Nazi,' Campbell, from New Jersey, explained to the New York Daily News. 'That's what . they're saying. Well, I'll stop making them when they stop taking them.' Zito explained that she was getting ready to leave hospital when nurses took away the little girl and workers from the Franklin County Children and Youth Service announced they were taking her. 'I started screaming,' she said. 'I got hysterical. I had just been checked out. I was breast-feeding my . daughter for two days straight. I changed her. I had clothes on her.' Campbell, who lives off government assistance, had not yet seen his new daughter because he was miles away in New Jersey and had been unable to afford to travel to see her. Namesake: The baby girl was named Eva Braun after Hitler's longterm girlfriend, pictured left and right . 'They kidnapped her,' he said. 'Because I'm not going to mix with the . opposite races and I'm not going to let my children mix, that gives them . the right to steal my child?' But Zito's lawyer said the couple's Nazi views were not the reason the child was taken. Instead, it was because Zito's first child, a son, had also previously been taken in to state custody. A court hearing in the custody cases is scheduled for Monday. Campbell, who has swastika tattoos across his body, including prominently on his neck, has frequented headlines since the birthday cake incident in 2008. He has fathered nine children with five different women but doesn't have custody of any of them. When he appeared in court earlier this year to fight for custody of his two-year-old son, Heinrich Hons, Campbell was photographed wearing a full Nazi uniform, with his devoted fiancee at his side. In court: Campbell and Zito arrived at family court in Flemington, New Jersey earlier this year in Nazi uniform . History: Campbell first hit headlines after it emerged he had named his son, center, Adolf Hitler. He had four children with his former wife, Deborah, and all have Nazi-inspired names . Heinrich Hons was the fourth child - all with Nazi-inspired names - that Campbell had with his last wife Deborah. He was removed from his parents just hours after being born in November 2011. The New Jersey Division of Youth and Family Services said they took the boy because violence in the home. They had already placed the couple's other three children – Adolf Hitler Campbell, JoyceLynn Aryan Nation Campbell and Honzlynn Jeannie Campbell – in foster care because of the alleged violence in the family's Holland Township, New Jersey home. The couple said they never abused their children and argued they were being targeted for the names they chose for their kids. Authorities insisted putting the children into care had nothing to do with their names.","White Supremacist Heath Campbell, 40, hit headlines in 2008 when a bakery refused to ice a cake with the name of his son, Adolf Hitler .

Italy: McDonald's worked with Gualtiero Marchesi, the country's only three-star chef, to create three new recipes: two sandwiches called Adagio and Vivace. The fast-food chain said it has similar plans to work in partnership in Germany and Austria. In France, McCafés already are serving slices of baguette for breakfast, as well as macarons, sweet meringue-based confections that are riding a popularity wave of their own during the day. It will replace the fast-food chain's . current special menu in the country, which is three limited-edition burgers featuring . locally produced cheeses, reports the Wall Street Journal.

"The father of Sandy Hook victim Emilie Parker broke down in tears on Thursday night as friends, relatives and strangers paid tribute to his blonde-haired, blue-eyed daughter in his Utah hometown. Robbie Parker held a public memorial for his six-year-old daughter at Ben Lomond High School in Ogden, sensing the community wished to give the grieving father and his family their support. Hundreds of mourners filled the school, with girls wearing pink tops and men in pink ties in a nod to Emilie's favourite colour. Others wore green, the colour uniting those mourning for Sandy Hook. But one person was notably missing: Friends said Emilie's mother Alissa was still too fragile to appear in public and chose to forego the service to spend time with her two other daughters. Struggle: Robbie Parker puts his head in his hands after speaking about his daughter at a memorial service . Heartbreak: Robbie sheds a tear at the memorial for his daughter at her memorial service in Ogden, Utah . Just six days earlier, Robbie and Alissa were pictured leaving Sandy Hook Elementary School - Alissa's face creased in pain, Robbie's mouth open in disbelief - after learning that their eldest daughter had been shot dead along with 19 other students and six teachers. They have now returned with her body to Ogden and a funeral will take place on Saturday. The couple were high school sweethearts in the Utah town before moving to Newtown, Connecticut. Robbie Parker struggled to control his emotions throughout the memorial service, where a slideshow of Emilie's life was shown and relatives spoke about the young girl, the Salt Lake Tribune reported. 'Even though this was a very personal and internal thing for us, I could see it touched everybody,' Robbie told the crowd. 'All of us feel connected to children.' Loss: Emilie Parker, left and right with her father, lost her life at Sandy Hook Elementary School last week . Happier times: Emilie, right, smiles alongside her parents, Robbie and Allissa, and her two little sisters. Her mother did not attend the memorial as she is still too fragile, friends said . Relatives recalled a girl full of love, compassion, charity and enthusiasm. Her father said she loved to pick flowers - 'like a goat'. He finally told her to limit the picking to dandelions. 'Emilie always wanted to help people feel better,' the family said in an obituary. 'Her compassion and . charity was exemplified with her hugs, the cards she would make, and her . statement that, ""I wish everybody could just be happy"".' Robbie said he was overwhelmed with support from the town and the crowd - many of whom were strangers. He explained how he took one of his daughters on a drive to see pink ribbons in the town. A father's love: Mr Parker spoke about his daughter's love for her family and her positive, caring attitude . Thankful: He kisses the forehead of a mourner during the memorial vigil at Ben Lomond High School . A community in mourning: Relatives and friends look on during the memorial service on Thursday . 'I pulled over to show her this one spot . that I thought was really pretty,' he said. 'I closed my eyes and I . thought about how many people it took to do that. I thought about . each hand tying each ribbon.' Ogden Mayor Mike Caldwell added to the . family: 'We want to give you the nicest, safest space to put her to . rest, and for you to return and know this love here will not die.' After the speeches, the crowd crowd . moved outside to the football field to light and launch lanterns in . remembrance of each Sandy Hook victim as 'Amazing Grace' wailed on . bagpipes.

"A controversial way to inhale alcohol has been released in a new home version. The vapshot machine boasts it can turn any alcohol into a vapour, which is then inhaled with a straw. 'It hits you instantly and kick starts your buzz!' the firm boasts of its $700 Vapshot mini machine. Scroll down for video . Vapshot boasts it can turn any alcohol into a vapour, which is then inhaled with a straw. The Vapshot machine is capable of injecting a fine mist of spirits into the serving container under pressure. When served, the patron twists open the cap whereby it will 'pop' similar to uncorking a bottle of champagne and then a portion of the spirits will instantly vaporize, which can be consumed through a straw. The remaining drink still in liquid form can be enjoyed as if it was served in a traditional manner. Users can create a vapor only shot, a shot of liquor with a vapor shot, or even a full mix drink with a vapor shot. However, health experts have warned the machine , and 'inhaled' alcohols in general, are far riskier than traditional drinks. Bypassing the digestive system, the technique causes alcohol to be ingested directly to the bloodstream through the lungs, potentially causing dangerous levels of intoxication - especially if abused. 'It is ill advised for experimentation among those under 21,' said Dr. Thomas Greenfield, Center Director at the National Alcohol Research Center in Emeryville, California. 'There could be inexperienced people at parties under peer pressure who may find themselves using this method of alcohol consumption. 'It might not be possible to self-regulate their consumption and teenagers just like adults can be drunk drivers too.' The makers of the new gadget proclaim: 'What if there was a brand new way to enjoy your favorite alcoholic beverages that’ll get the party started faster and won’t slow you down? Something new, trendy and sciency…yeah, we just made up that word.' They also play on the notoriety that inhaled alcohol has attracted. 'You’ve probably heard about it all over the news and now you can enjoy vaporized alcohol anytime at home or at one of your awesome parties. 'Vapshot mini is designed to vaporize alcohol, which you can inhale with a straw. It hits you instantly and kick starts your buzz!' The new $700 machine is designed to be used at home . However, the firm does address the safety concerns on its site, saying 'Because Vapshot is served in a regulated per serving size, it is possible to quantify the levels of intoxication and levels of acceptable ethyl alcohol in the lungs, which are both significantly lower than consumption of a traditional liquid shot or mixed drink.' It does, however, also admit the effects can be felt more quickly. The vapshot mini machine can vapourise alcohol at home . 'Vapshot introduces the alcohol directly into the blood stream through the lungs, which is very efficient. 'Normally when you take a drink, it has to go into your mouth, down your throat, into your stomach, then intestines and finally into your bloodstream to your lungs and brain. 'That takes a long time and a whole lot more alcohol to have the same effect.' ​Constructed of the highest quality materials, Vapshot mini comes in two finishes, white and stainless steel. No matter which you choose, Vapshot mini is bound to be the hit at all your parties!Vapshot is the only laboratory tested product for vaporizing alcohol. Using information published by OSHA, one of the most respected agencies for safety, Vapshot is well within the acceptable levels for inhaling alcohol.Vapshot mini is small and portable so it’s is ready to hit the road when you are. Use it by your pool, on your boat or even when you’re camping. Vapshot mini will get your party started anytime, anywhere… instantly, so check out the future of adult beverages today.

'Earls of Ashwood deli serving fine cheeses and The Storytellers pub serving fine and real ales from around the world - both of which are absolutely thriving - prove it.' Early start: Punters will be able to make the best of the deal from 8am, when the venue's doors open . But Mike Wardell, a director at Here for Your Hospitality Ltd which owns the premises, insisted the pub would take part in responsible drinking campaigns, including challenging anyone who looked under 25 for identity. He added that anyone drunk would not be served and pointed out that supermarkets are able to sell their own value beers at 40p a can - something which is not monitored by councils. Mr Wardell said the PoundPub is aimed at the kind of person who would have frequented Working Men's Clubs in a previous generation and not the night-time market. He said: 'It is an eye-catching logo and, I suppose it's a bit cheesy, but the phrase we're going for is ""get more round for your pound"". 'At a time when 12 pubs a week are closing across the country we have to think outside the box a bit.' Hike: The average price of a pint of beer is £3.03, a five per cent increase since 2012 . The average price for a pint of beer in the UK is £3.20, but it varies depending on where you are in the country. According to the Good Pub Guide, the average prices of a pint in different places are: . London: £3.60 . Scotland: £3.24 . Wales: £3.15 . Manchester: £3.00 . Leeds: £2.40 . Surrey: £3.52 .

"Unwanted pregnancy: 17 out of 1,000 of child bearing age in the UK had an abortion in 2008 . Nearly one in three of pregnancies in Europe are terminated, according to an international group of scientists. The startling statistic came to light as Dr Gilda Sedgh from the Guttmacher Institute in the U.S, revealed the data from the latest global abortion study. According to the research, the long-term decline in the rates of abortion worldwide has stalled while . the proportion of unsafe terminations that put women's lives at . risk is rising. Between 1995 and 2003, the abortion rate per 1,000 women of childbearing . age (15 to 44 years) worldwide dropped from 35 to 29. However, by 2008 the global abortion rate was virtually unchanged at 28. In Europe, around 30 per cent of pregnancies end in abortion. However, the team said the rate was far higher in Eastern Europe. In Western Europe there were 12 abortions per 1,000 women in 2008, while in Eastern Europe at the same time there were 43. However, Northern Europe (which includes the UK and Scandinavia) fared worse than the western region with 17 abortions per 1,000 women, which is on par with North America. The researchers, whose study was published in the Lancet medical journal, said a major cause for concern is the growing proportion of unsafe abortions occurring in developing countries. 'This plateau coincides with a slowdown in contraceptive uptake,' Dr Sedgh said. 'And without greater investment in quality family planning services, we can expect this trend to persist.' Alarmingly, Dr Sedgh said, the proportion of abortions characterized as unsafe rose from 44 per cent in 1995 to 49 per cent in 2008. Unsafe abortion is defined as a procedure for terminating a pregnancy carried out by someone who does not have the necessary skills, or in an environment that does not meet minimal medical standards. Despite the decline in the abortion rate, there were 2.2 million more abortions in 2008, when 43.8 million were carried out, than in 2003 when there were 41.6 million. This is due to the increasing global population, the researchers said. Of all the world's regions, Latin America has the highest rate, with 32 per 1,000 women in 2008. Africa and Asia follow close behind with rates of 29 and 28 per 1,000 women respectively. Dr Sedgh said the study's findings showed strong correlations between abortion rates and access to effective contraceptives, and between abortion rates and the law. 'The abortion rates is clearly lower in places were abortion laws are more liberal,' she said, pointing to Africa and Latin America where rates are high. Dr Sedgh said family planning services . around the world appeared to be failing to keep up with rising demand . for effective contraception driven by the desire for small families and . better control over the timing of births. 'There are still 215 million women in developing countries who have an unmet need for contraceptives,' she said. However, John Smeaton, Director of the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children, contested this, saying: 'The truth is that countries with strict laws against abortion have lower maternal death rates than countries which allow abortion widely. 'Ireland, where abortion is banned, has one of the world's best maternal health records. Legalised abortion does nothing to improve medical care.'",Northern Europe and the U.S fare have a higher abortion rate than western Europe .
"The ancient people who built Stonehenge chose the site in modern-day Wiltshire because of its solar significance, archaeologists claim. In what is described as a ‘missing piece in the jigsaw’ in our understanding of England’s greatest prehistoric site, excavations confirm the theory that its ancient processional route was built along an ice-age landform which was naturally on the solstice axis, according to Professor Mike Parker Pearson, a leading expert on Stonehenge. The monument’s original purpose still remains shrouded in mystery, but this is a dramatic clue, he said. The ancient people who built Stonehenge chose the site in modern-day Wiltshire because of its solar significance, archaeologists claim. In what is described as a 'missing piece in the jigsaw', excavations confirm the theory that its ancient processional route was built along an ice-age landform . The route, known as the Avenue, extended 1.5 miles from the standing stones’ north-eastern entrance to West Amesbury. It has been likened to The Mall leading to Buckingham Palace. After the closure of the A344 road, which bisected the route, archaeologists have been able to excavate there for the first time. The excavations were conducted by Wessex Archaeology for English Heritage. Just below the modern road’s surface, they unearthed ditches dug by prehistoric builders. Professor Parker Pearson identified naturally-occurring fissures that once lay between ridges which follow the route of the Avenue. The route, known as the Avenue, extended 1.5 miles from the standing stones north-eastern entrance. After the closure of the A344 (pictured), archaeologists have been able to excavate there for the first time. Professor Parker Pearson identified naturally-occurring fissures that once lay between ridges which follow the route . Stonehenge Avenue is an ancient avenue marked as a UNESCO World Heritage Site built between 2600 to 1700 BCE. It has been likened to The Mall leading to Buckingham Palace. Discovered in the 18th century, it measures nearly 3 kilometres and connects Stonehenge with the River Avon. The avenue is aligned with the sunrise of the summer solstice, suggesting a time of most frequent use. At the end of the Avenue, a similar ring of bluestones, Bluestonehenge, was discovered in 2009. Mike Parker Pearson of the Stonehenge Riverside Project believes the Avenue was inspired by and built over top of a natural glacial formation with an existing astronomical alignment. The ridges were created by Ice Age meltwater and naturally point directly at the mid-winter sunset in one direction and the mid-summer sunrise in the other. Professer Parker Pearson is excited by the evidence, which he describes as ‘hugely significant’. ‘It tells us a lot about why Stonehenge was located where it is and why they were so interested in the solstices,’ he said. ‘It’s not to do with worshipping the sun, some kind of calendar or astronomical observatory. ‘It’s about how this place was special to prehistoric people. This natural landform happens to be on the solstice axis, which brings heaven and earth into one.’ He explained that Stonehenge is ‘all about the solstices’ and our ancestors could see this in the land. The excavations support theories that first emerged in 2008 with an exploration of a narrow trench across the Avenue. The ridges were created by Ice Age meltwater and naturally point directly at the mid-winter sunset in one direction and the mid-summer sunrise in the other . On the central area of the site there are the stone settings (in blue), with the inner circle consisting of a 'sarsen horseshoe'. The outermost element of the site is the Avenue which consists of twin banks about 12m apart with internal ditches. The red lines signify how sunrise aligns with the Avenue . Professor Parker Pearson said: ‘It’s being able to see the big picture.’ Dr Heather Sebire, English Heritage’s Stonehenge curator, said: ‘The part of the Avenue that was cut through by the road has obviously been destroyed forever, but we were hopeful that archaeology below the road would survive. ‘And here we have it – the missing piece in the jigsaw. It is very exciting to find a piece of physical evidence that officially makes the connection which we were hoping for.’ She expects the latest findings to spark vigorous academic debate, and English Heritage has not expressed an opinion on the naturally-formed ridges, their interpretation being confined to the ditches. The original A344 road is to be grassed over next year as part of English Heritage’s £27m transformation of the World Heritage Site, which draws more than one million annual visitors. A new visitor centre will be opened, 1.5 miles away out of sight, to allow Stonehenge to reconnect with the surrounding landscape. Stonehenge's original purpose still remains shrouded in mystery, but the findings of the natural land formation is a dramatic clue behind why it was located in this area . The latest study has also identified three holes where missing stones would have stood on the outer sarsen circle – evidence, it is believed, that the circle was indeed once complete. Astonishingly, at least to the layman, even the most sophisticated surveys failed to spot them. Two eagle-eyed members of staff happened to notice dry surface areas of grass, or parchmarks. Professor Parker Pearson said: ‘The problem is we’ve not had a decent dry summer in many years. ‘Stonehenge is always regularly watered - and the only reason these have shown up is because - for some reason this year - their hose was too short… So we’re very lucky.’ Susan Greaney, an English Heritage historian, added: ‘The discovery… has certainly strengthened the case for [the monument] being a full circle.’","Excavations confirm that Stonehenge was built on an Ice Age landform .

"The prospect of an epic train journey from London to New York might seem like a distant dream for those seeking the ultimate railway holiday. But booking a ticket from St Pancras to Grand Central station could be a step closer after Russia gave the green light for plans for a 65-mile tunnel under the Bering Strait. The Kremlin this week gave its support for a £60billion scheme that would link Asia and North America and allow for a potential once-in-a-lifetime train journey. Trip of a lifetime: The Kremlin has given the green light for a £60billion tunnel linking Siberia to Alaska through the Bering Strait . The views would be breathtaking: A snowmobile makes its away across the frozen tundra in Alaska . Better wrap up warm: If the tunnel was ever built, the train journey would probably take the best part of three weeks in sub zero temperatures . The proposed tunnel would pass underneath the Big Diomede and Little Diomede islands and straddle the international dateline to link East and West. Engineers have said there is no technical reason the tunnel could not be completed and it could provide a cheaper way of shipping freight around the world. The idea was first raised by Tsar Nicholas II in 1905, but was this week endorsed by Aleksandr Levinthal - deputy federal representative for the Russian Far East - at a conference on developing infrastructure in the country's remote north-east. A dream too far? The plans would see a 65-mile tunnel, twice that of the Channel Tunnel, bored through the international date line in the Bering Strait (pictured) Rejuvenation: Russia will open a £900million extension to the Trans-Siberian railway to Yakutsk and could link to the north-eastern tip of Siberia by 2030 . An East to West train route would require both Russia and the U.S. to construct railway lines in Siberia and Alaska. Currently, . train services extend as far east as Chita or Vladivostock in Russia, . while you would need to take a ferry between Bellingham and Anchorage to . get anywhere near the Bering Strait on the U.S. side. At present it would take just over two weeks to get as far along the route as physically possible. Here's how: . London - Brussels - Cologne - Moscow: 18hrs 30mins . Moscow - Chita: 106 hours . Train route from Chita to Anchorage . Bellingham - Anchorage: 7 days - by ferry . Seattle - Bellingham: 2 hours . New York - Philadelphia - Pittsburgh - Chicago - Seattle: 64hrs 30mins . Total journey time: 14 days 23 hours . The three-day conference, held in the eastern city of Yakutsk, brought delegates from the U.S., China and Britain and was aimed at capturing the economic potential of the resource-rich region. Mr Levinthal told The Times: 'We should see advanced development of road and rail infrastructure here [in the Russian Far East] and improvement in the investment climate in Russia as a key aim.' A 500-mile railway line stemming from the existing Trans-Siberian line to Yakutsk - costing £900million and due for completion in 2013 - is part of Kremlin plans to extend rail lines 2,360 miles to the north-eastern tip of Siberia by 2030. That could open up the way for the construction of a tunnel - which could take up to another 15 years to complete. The route would be twice the length of the Channel Tunnel, in a sparsely populated area miles from large population centres. It would also require U.S. engineers to create through train lines in Alaska, linking it with cities in Canada and onwards. Currently, travellers would have to get a ferry to Anchorage, Alaska, from the U.S. west coast and train services in Russia would only take you as far as Chita or Vladivostock, before they move down into China and Mongolia. It remains to be seen whether Russia could finance such an ambitious project, but it opens up the possibility of a breathtaking train journey through picturesque Siberia and Alaska.","Trip of a lifetime would take the best part of three weeks through picturesque Alaska and Siberia .

"Nazi plans to build a bridge linking the Crimean region of Ukraine to Russia look set to be revived after Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev created a company to take on the project. The proposed bridge would span the the Strait of Kerch between the Chushka Spit in Russia and the Kerch Peninsula in Ukraine, giving Russia one of only three major entrance points to the strategic Crimean peninsula - the others being the M17 and M18 motorways from mainland Ukraine. The idea for a bridge linking the countries was originally conceived by German architect Albert Speer during the Second World War in the hope it would aid the German invasion of the North Caucasus. Not finished: A retreating Nazi army left behind an incomplete 2.8 mile stretch of bridge (pictured in background) over the Strait of Kerch in 1943. Within two years it had started to crumble . Past: The idea for a bridge linking Russia to the Ukraine was originally conceived by German architect Albert Speer (pictured left with Adolf Hitler). Dmitry Medvedev has now created a company to take on the project . Medvedev said plans signed by Russia and Ukraine in 2010 to build the bridge are still binding, despite increased tensions between the countries following Russia's decision to send troops into the Crimean region following the ousting of Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych last week. Russia has refused to recognise the new 'unconstitutional' government in Kiev which, it said, is run by militants and ultra-nationalists. It claims to have entered Crimea in order to protect Russian-speakers who make up the majority of the population in the southern and regions of Ukraine. During a meeting with his deputies on Monday, Medvedev demanded practical work on the bridge begin immediately, saying: 'Ukraine has always been and will remain an important trade and economic partner to us, and the government should work on these issues. 'We are following the developments closely,' he added. Idea: Adolf Hitler personally commissioned a three-mile rail and road bridge based on Speer's plans (pictured) in 1943 in the hope it would help him conquer the Soviet Union . Plans: The proposed bridge would link the Crimean peninsula to the Russian region of Krasondar Krai . The Kerch Strait Bridge has a long history, little of which Medvedev will want to be associated with. Adolf Hitler personally commissioned a three-mile rail and road bridge based on Speer's plans in 1943 in the hope it would help him conquer the Soviet Union. The iron and concrete structure was to replace a rope bridge that had been built to support the retreat the German Organisation Todt the previous year. Speer was given just six months to build the new bridge, and in his memoirs raised doubts over how realistic the project was given how quickly the Soviet army were approaching. 'Even at that time it was clear that the bridge would never be completed,' Speer wrote. Soviet troops arrive at the half-built bridge after German forces abandoned the area in November 1943 . A destroyed Lenin monument is pictured in front of ruins in Sevastopol on the Crimean Peninsula following a battle between Nazis and Soviet troops . Left behind: Soviets arrive in Kerch after German forces abandoned the area and retreated towards Berlin . As Soviet troops began their push towards Berlin later in 1943, the retreating German army left behind an incomplete 2.8 mile stretch of bridge that began to crumble within two years. By the 1960s the remains of the Nazi bridge, much of which was now under the sea, became so dangerous to passing ships that they were cleared completely. Since the Second World War, various projects to span the strait have been proposed or attempted. The idea of a Kerch Strait bridge . once again resurfaced after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, but in 1994 the . Russian and Ukrainian sides failed to finalise the project and it appeared to have finally been scrapped. In 2010, however, Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych and . Russian President Dmitry Medvedev signed a new agreement to build a bridge . across the Kerch Strait. In late January this year, the Ukrainian and Russian governments decided that a new pan-national company would be commissioned to handle the construction of the bridge, while the Russian state enterprise Russian Highways would become responsible for it long term. Medvedev's signing of a decree on Monday stated his intention to see the project through, despite the Ukrainian government being ousted, and increasing tensions between the countries.","Bridge was originally designed by Nazis to aid invasion of Soviet Union .

"Face of a princess? A 3D computer model of the face of Arsinoe made from remains discovered in Ephesus which archaeologists believe were hers . An archaeologist who claimed to have found the bones of Cleopatra's murdered half-sister says they are pinning their hopes on new forensic techniques to conclusively identify the remains. It was claimed that the remains of Princess Arsinöe IV, who was murdered more than 2,000 years ago on the orders of Egypt's queen Cleopatra, were the first relics of the Ptolemaic dynasty to be identified. But rival experts have since said the evidence linking the bones to the princess is largely circumstantial, and even the researcher who found them admits they have been handled too many times to get a reliable DNA test result. Nevertheless, Dr Hilke Thuer, from the . Austrian Academy of Science, who made the discovery, remains convinced . that they belonged to the Classical-era Egyptian royal. Princess Arsinoe's purported remains . were found in a tomb in Ephesus, a large and important ancient Greek . city on the coast of Asia Minor, in what is now modern-day western . Turkey. She was Cleopatra's . younger sister or half-sister. It is believed both were fathered by . Ptolemy XII Auletes, but whether they shared a mother is unclear. Still, however closely they were related by blood, there was no love lost between Arsinoe and her powerful sister. A . power struggle between Cleopatra and her brother Ptolemy XIII, in which . the legendary seductress enlisted the help of Julius Caesar, saw the . younger sister join the Egyptian army to resist Rome's legions, LiveScience reported. After . Cleopatra's victory with Rome's help, Arsinoe was taken captive and . allowed to live in exile in Ephesus. But, it is believed, the Egyptian . queen continued to see her younger sister as a threat. After Caesar's assassination, she persuaded her new lover, Mark Antony, to have Arsinoe murdered in 41BC. Two-thousand years later, in 1904, archaeologists excavating Ephesus found a ruined structure which they dubbed the Octagon after its unusual shape. Further digs in 1926 revealed a grave chamber within the Octagon, inside of which were found the bones of a woman judged to be about 20 years old. Dr Thuer, who is an expert in ancient architecture, told the Charlotte Observer: 'When I was working with the architecture of The Octagon and the building next to it, it wasn’t known whose skeleton was inside. 'Then I found some ancient writers telling us that in the year 41 B.C., Arsinoe IV – the half-sister of Cleopatra – was murdered in Ephesus by Cleopatra and her Roman lover, Marc Antony. 'Because the building is dated by its type and decoration to the second half of the first century B.C., this fits quite well.' That clue combined with the fact that in ancient times only special people were buried within cities themselves, the octagonal shape which resembles the Lighthouse of Alexandria, and the fact the bones are female, left her convinced the bones were those of the Egyptian princess. Tourists visit the ruins of Ephesus: After Cleopatra's victory with Rome's help, Arsinoe was taken captive and allowed to live in exile in the city until her murder apparently on the orders of Mark Anthony in 41BC . The initial opening to the burial chamber was small, and the Austrian team which first excavated took away only the skull, which was lost in Germany during the Second World War. But then, in 1985, the back side of the chamber became accessible and Dr Thuer rediscovered the rest of the skeleton. Unfortunately for Dr Thuer, the discovery led to the first major blow to her theory. Forensic analysis of the bones showed they belonged to a girl no older than 15 or 16 - which seems young for a woman said to have played a big role in ancient geo-politics. The discovery of shoes deliberately hidden in an ancient Egyptian temple has left archaeologists baffled, not least because they include design features thought to have been invented in Medieval Europe. Two pairs of tiny children's shoes were among the seven found concealed in a jar placed into a cavity between two mudbrick walls in a temple in Luxor, site of the ancient city of Thebes. Oddly, they were tied together using palm fibre string and placed within a single adult shoe. A third pair that had been worn by an adult was found alongside them. But there is no clue as to why the shoes, which would have been costly and unusual footwear for the era, were never retrieved after they were left in the temple just over 2,000 years ago when Egypt was ruled by a dynasty of Greek descent. Research has shown that at least one of them includes structural elements that historians had previously believed were not invented until the Medieval era, which began in Europe some 500 years later. At the time the shoes were concealed, most Egyptians would normally have worn sandals. A BBC documentary in 2009 nevertheless trumpeted Dr Thuer's claims that the bones belonged to Arsinoe, and used measurements taken before the skull was lost to reconstruct her face. She told the Sunday Times at the time: 'The results of the forensic examination and the fact that the facial reconstruction shows that Arsinoe had an African mother is a real sensation.' Presenter and archaeologist Neil Oliver was equally gushing, saying at the time: 'Cleopatra, Julius Caesar, Mark Antony... they are all iconic figures from history. 'It's almost impossible to remember they were real people and not the semi-mythical figures portrayed by Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor. 'It was like a splash of cold water in the face to be confronted by them as human beings. 'When I stood in the lab and handled the bones of Cleopatra's blood sister - knowing that in her lifetime she touched Cleopatra and perhaps Julius Caesar and Mark Antony as well - I felt the hairs go up on the back of my neck. 'Suddenly these giant figures from history were flesh and blood.' But despite a string of excitable headlines reporting the findings, other researchers were sceptical about the judgements of the woman's ethnicity and, indeed, her true identity. 'We get this skull business and having Arsinoe's ethnicity actually being determined from a reconstructed skull based on measurements taken in the 1920s?' wrote David Meadows, a Canadian classicist and teacher, on his blog rogueclassicism. Dr Thuer admits that DNA tests she and her colleagues tried to carry out on the remains were less than satisfactory. She told the Charlotte Observer: 'They tried to make a DNA test, but testing didn’t work well because the skeleton had been moved and the bones had been held by a lot of people. It didn’t bring the results we hoped to find. 'I don’t know if there are possibilities to do more of this testing. Forensic material is not my field. 'One of my colleagues on the project told me two years ago there currently is no other method to really determine more. But he thinks there may be new methods developing. There is hope.'","Bones have been handled too many times for a conclusive DNA test .
But the researcher who found them maintains that they are those of Egyptian princess Arsinoe .
They were found in 1985 in a ruined temple in the ancient Greek city of Ephesus, in what is now western Turkey ."
"Researchers have discovered the largest fresh meteor-impact crater ever spotted on Mars. The before-and-after images were captured by NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. The huge crater spans half the length of a football field and first appeared in March 2012. Scroll down for video . Before and after: This pair of images taken one day apart by the Mars Color Imager (MARCI) weather camera on NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter reveals when an asteroid impact made the scar seen in the right-hand image. The left image was taken during Martian afternoon on March 27, 2012; the right one on the afternoon of March 28, 2012. The largest crater associated with a March 2012 impact on Mars has many smaller craters around it, revealed in this image from the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) camera on NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. The largest crater is slightly elongated and spans 159 by 143 feet (48.5 by 43.5 meters). Experts estimate the impact object measured about 10 to 18 feet (3 to 5 meters) long, which is less than a third the estimated length of the asteroid that hit Earth's atmosphere near Chelyabinsk. Because Mars has much less atmosphere than Earth, space rocks of comparable size are more likely to penetrate to the surface of Mars and cause larger craters. The impact that created it likely was preceded by an explosion in the Martian sky caused by intense friction between an incoming asteroid and the planet's atmosphere. 'This series of events can be likened to the meteor blast that shattered windows in Chelyabinsk, Russia, last year,' the researchers say. 'The air burst and ground impact darkened an area of the Martian surface about 5 miles (8 kilometers) across.' The darkened spot appears in images taken by the orbiter's weather-monitoring camera, the Mars Color Imager (MARCI). Since the orbiter began its systematic observation of Mars in 2006, scientist Bruce Cantor has examined MARCI's daily global coverage, looking for evidence of dust storms and other observable weather events in the images. About two months ago, Cantor noticed an inconspicuous dark dot near the equator in one of the images. 'It wasn't what I was looking for,' Cantor said. 'I was doing my usual weather monitoring and something caught my eye. These images from the Context Camera (CTX) on NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter were taken before (left) and after (right) an apparent impact scar appeared in the area in March 2012 and was detected in images from the orbiter's Mars Color Imager (MARCI). Comparing the Jan. 16, 2012, image on the left with the April 6, 2014, image on the right confirms that two adjacent fresh craters appeared during that interval. 'It looked usual, with rays emanating from a central spot.' He began examining earlier images, skipping back a month or more at a time. The images revealed that the dark spot was present a year ago, but not five years ago. He homed in further, checking images from about 40 different dates, and pinned down the date the impact event occurred; the spot was not there up through March 27, 2012, and then appeared before the daily imaging on March 28, 2012. Once the dark spot was verified as new, it was targeted last month by CTX and the orbiter's sharpest-sighted camera, the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE). This April 6, 2014, image from the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) camera on NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter shows numerous landslides in the vicinity of where an impact crater was excavated in March 2012. Of the approximately 400 fresh crater-causing impacts on Mars that have been documented with before-and-after images, this is the only one discovered using a MARCI image, rather than an image from a higher-resolution camera. 'The biggest crater is unusual, quite shallow compared to other fresh craters we have observed,' said HiRISE Principal Investigator Alfred McEwen of the University of Arizona, Tucson. The largest crater is slightly elongated and spans 159 by 143 feet (48.5 by 43.5 meters). McEwen estimates the impact object measured about 10 to 18 feet (3 to 5 meters) long, which is less than a third the estimated length of the asteroid that hit Earth's atmosphere near Chelyabinsk. Because Mars has much less atmosphere than Earth, space rocks of comparable size are more likely to penetrate to the surface of Mars and cause larger craters.","The images were captured by NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter .

"Tyler Blackett has signed a new Manchester United deal until 2017, with the option of a further year. The highly-rated youngster is the last of three priorities from the club's academy to sign a contract extension after Jesse Lingard and Patrick McNair. United have reached an agreement with the Manchester-born 20-year-old which will see his weekly wage rocket from £2,000 to £20,000. Tyler Blackett is set to pen a new long-term deal at Manchester United worth £20,000-a-week . The 20-year-old defender says he is 'thrilled' to have signed a new deal at his boyhood club . 'I'm thrilled to have signed my new contract. I have supported United all my life and have been here since I was eight years old,' Blackett told the club's official website on Thursday. 'To come through the Academy and make my debut this season was a dream come true. I want to keep improving within the first-team squad with the help of the manager, coaches and the players around me.' United boss Louis van Gaal added: 'I am delighted that Tyler has signed a new contract. He is another young player that has risen through the Academy system to break into the first-team squad this season. 'Tyler has great potential and I believe he is at the right club to continue his development and progression to become a great defender.' Before the extension was confirmed a United source told Sportsmail: 'Lingard and McNair have extended their deals but Blackett was always the top priority.' Defender Blackett has made 10 appearances this season although his last came on January 11 when United lost 1-0 to Southampton at Old Trafford. Blackett (left) has made 10 appearances for United this season - with his last coming against Southampton . He started the campaign in the team after impressing Van Gaal in the summer and played in the first five Premier League matches but was sent off in the 5-3 defeat at Leicester City. Blackett was again red-carded in his last appearance for the Under 21s, a 1-1 draw with Sunderland. Reece James also extended his contract with Manchester United on Thursday. The versatile left-back, who can also perform in midfield, scored twice against LA Galaxy on last summer's first-team tour and made his competitive debut in the Capital One Cup against Milton Keynes Dons. After being on the bench for the opening three Barclays Premier League games of the season, he joined Rotherham United on loan in November to obtain more experience. Following his return to Old Trafford, he has been a mainstay in Warren Joyce's Under-21 side and helped the team earn a 1-1 draw with 10 men at Sunderland on Monday. James has been rewarded for his progress with fresh terms, on the same day that colleague Tyler Blackett's new contract has also been confirmed.

"Novak Djokovic admits he does not know how impending fatherhood will impact on his performance at the US Open. The world number one and new wife Jelena are expecting their first child in October. They married in Montenegro a few days after Djokovic defeated Roger Federer to win Wimbledon, and initial indications suggest the Serbian will struggle to play his best tennis. He was a shadow of the player that won his seventh grand slam title on Centre Court last month as he suffered early defeats in the Masters tournaments in Toronto and Cincinnati. Father figure: Novak Djokovic admits that he's unsure how fatherhood will have an impact on tennis . Djokovic has been seeking advice from coach Boris Becker about how to cope with the competing responsibilities in his life as he prepares to begin his Flushing Meadows campaign against Argentina's Diego Schwartzman. The 27-year-old said: 'A lot of things happened in the last two months, and it was a very emotional period. I just felt a bit flat on the court. I wasn't managing to find that intensity and the perfect mindset. 'But it's all normal. It's something that I'm experiencing for the first time. So I'm trying to talk as much as I can to first of all my coach that has been through similar experiences in his life more than one time. I'm trying to get as much information as I can. Champion: Djokovic kissing the Wimbledon trophy after his five-set victory over Roger Federer . 'I have only positive and joyful feelings (about) approaching fatherhood, and hopefully it's going to happen in less than two months. Then I'm going to enjoy it and try to take as much energy as I can, positive energy to the tennis court. 'But without a doubt, life changes. Priorities change. My priorities are my family, my wife, my future kid. Tennis is definitely not number one any more.' Djokovic has reached the US Open final in each of the last four years, beating Rafael Nadal in 2011 but losing to the Spaniard last year and in 2010, and also to Andy Murray two years ago. Hungry: Novak Djokovic goes into the US Open as the favourite for the tournament after Nadal pulled out . With Nadal missing as he nurses a wrist injury, Djokovic goes into the tournament as favourite, and his expectations remain high. He said: 'I'm feeling better and better as the days go by. It's something that is encouraging me for this year's US Open campaign. 'Obviously I want to peak with my form at the US Open. Yes, I wanted to do better in Canada and Cincinnati. Unfortunately I wasn't even close to my best. Friendly: Novak Djokovic laughing with John McEnroe at the Johnny Mac Tennis Project Benefit . 'I have high expectations for myself. I always have. Especially at this stage of my career where I feel like now is the time that I'm at my peak physical strength. I want to use this time of my career as much as I can to win as many matches as possible. 'Obviously I know I'm not the only one that has this kind of optimistic mindset. There are many players who are fighting for the same trophy. This is the last Grand Slam of the year, and this is where you want to play your best.' The absence of Nadal coupled with doubts over the form of Djokovic and Murray makes this potentially the most open grand slam in years, although Federer is in ominous form. Grigor Dimitrov and Milos Raonic are leading the next generation's push to break into the grand slam winners' circle, and both will fancy their chances here. 'When Rafa is not around it changes because he always has been a favourite in every grand slam for the last seven, eight, 10 years,' said Djokovic. 'Definitely the tournament and tennis is losing when they don't have Rafa in the tournament. 'I know that there is one thing for sure: everybody is starting from scratch. Everybody starts from Monday.' VIDEO Djokovic cruises through in New York .","Novak Djokovic and new wife Jelena are expecting their first child in October .

"Cardinal Keith O'Brien has resigned as Archbishop of St Andrew's and Edinburgh over the allegations. One of his accusers says the church would 'crush' him, given the opportunity . A former priest who reported Cardinal Keith O'Brien to the Vatican over allegations of 'inappropriate' behaviour has attacked the church's response to the complaints. The Cardinal, who was Britain's most senior Catholic cleric, stepped down from his post as Archbishop of St Andrews and Edinburgh a day after the allegations by three priests and a former priest stretching back 30 years were published last Sunday. The Cardinal is contesting the allegations and is taking legal advice. The 74-year-old cleric tendered his resignation to Pope Benedict in November, citing age and 'indifferent health'. He had been widely expected to step down next month when he turns 75. His resignation was accepted by the pope on February 18 but it was announced on Monday that it was taking place with immediate effect. In the Observer, which first reported the story last week, the former priest, who remains anonymous, today said he had been 'disappointed' by the church's reaction. He said: 'There have been two sensations for me this week. One is feeling the hot breath of the media on the back of my neck and the other is sensing the cold disapproval of the church hierarchy for daring to break ranks. 'I feel like if they could crush me, they would. 'The vacuum the church has created has allowed whimsy and speculation to distort the truth, and the only support I have been offered is a cursory email with a couple of telephone numbers of counsellors hundreds of miles away from me.' Cardinal O'Brien is now Archbishop Emeritus of St Andrews and Edinburgh and has no role in the governance of the diocese. He has not travelled to Rome for the conclave to elect the next pope meaning the church in Britain has no vote in the process. Scroll down for video . Staying away: Cardinal O'Brien, pictured with the Duke of Edinburgh and the Pope, will no longer attend the election to choose Benedict XVI's successor . The Scottish Catholic Media Office made no comment today, but last week its director Peter Kearney said the Cardinal's resignation had not been accelerated because of the allegations. He said: 'The timing is very unfortunate and it does appear as if one has followed the other, which in terms of chronology one has followed the other, but that's not the same as saying one caused the other. 'When it comes to responding to the allegations I think what he will do is act on his legal advice, and the legal advice at the moment would be to not publicly engage with the detail as it stands of the allegations.' Another priest has called for the Catholic Church in Scotland to be more open in dealing with complaints. Father John Robinson said: 'If the Catholic Church in Scotland is to heal itself, we need transparency and understanding. 'We need to learn lessons from the mistakes we have made in the past and move on to become a more loving and understanding church which does not condemn victims or even abusers.' Cardinal Keith O’Brien said sorry as it was revealed that he must resign now rather than wait until his 75th birthday, which falls this month. In a statement the Cardinal said: ‘Looking back over my years of ministry: for any good I have been able to do, I thank God. For any failures, I apologise to all whom I have offended.’ Cardinal O’Brien’s apology follows growing controversy over his leadership in recent weeks. The vehemence of his public stand against same-sex marriage led to condemnation by the gay lobby. However, in a surprise move just a day . before the sex scandal broke, he upset traditionalists by calling for . priests to be given the right to marry. Position: The archbishop was the head of the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland and the UK's senior priest . Senior church figures are expected to . go at 75, but the Vatican often allows leeway of a year or two. Following news of the sex scandal over the weekend, the Pope gave . Cardinal O’Brien no choice. ‘The Holy Father has now decided that . my resignation will take effect today, 25 February 2013, and that he . will appoint an Apostolic Administrator to govern the Archdiocese in my . place until my successor is appointed,’ Cardinal O’Brien said. The Cardinal said in his statement: ‘I . thank Pope Benedict XVI for his kindness and courtesy to me and…I wish . him a long and happy retirement. ‘I also ask God’s blessing on my . brother Cardinals who will soon gather in Rome to elect his successor. I . will not join them for this conclave. I do not wish media attention in .

"The grieving 45-year-old father of murdered schoolgirl Sarah Payne died alone in his armchair after being driven to drink and despair by the death of his daughter. Michael Payne struggled with alcoholism after the abduction of his eight-year-old daughter in July 2000, and was found dead at home in Maidstone, Kent, by police on Monday. His brother Alan, 47, believes 'he was in a downward spiral since it all happened with Sarah' and their father Terrance, 72, says his son was tortured by 'the fact he wasn't there to protect her'. Kent Police  broke down the door of his flat because his family had been unable to contact him and MailOnline understands his body had been there for several days. Broken man: Michael Payne, who died at 45, was tortured by the murder of his daughter Sarah and his life spiralled into chaos and alcoholism, his family said today . Tragedy: Mr Payne was found in his first dead in an armchair of his first floor flat in Maidstone, pictured . Forced entry: Kent Police confirmed to MailOnline that they had to break in to the flat where they found Mr Payne dead. The entrance has been boarded up . Michael's schoolgirl daughter was snatched by paedophile Roy Whiting from a field near her grandparents' home in West Sussex, where she was playing with older brothers Luke and Lee and younger sister Charlotte. Mr Payne spoke of his battle with depression in the aftermath of the ordeal, when he suffered recurring nightmares and used alcohol to cope with her death. He and wife Sara ended their 18-year marriage three years after the disappearance and both blamed the 'overwhelming' strains of coping with their tragic loss. After the divorce Mike, as he was known to his family and friends, moved from West Sussex to Maidstone to be near his family, especially his mother Cynthia and brother Alan. Alan, 47, said: 'We are all in a state of shock. Michael has been in a downward spiral since it all happened with Sarah. 'When he split up with Sara and moved back here he was already a drinker. 'But I suppose then it got a lot worse. We still haven't identified the body and my mum is too devastated to see him. 'I hadn't seen Michael for a few months so I didn't know he was sick. My mum is in pieces because it is one tragedy after the other. First Michael loses his daughter and now my mum loses a son. 'No one should be alive to see their child die. It is a nightmare.' Cruel: Sarah's death tore eventually led to their end of her parents' marriage, pictured here at her funeral . Sarah and Michael hug after their daughter's murder. Mr Payne's father Terrance, Sarah's grandfather, left, is seen here supporting them at Littlehampton Police Station. He says his son was overwhelmed by guilt . Michael's father Terrance said: 'He turned to drink because of what happened, for the fact he wasn't there to protect her. 'After the incident we all went downhill a bit, but we managed to pull ourselves together whereas Michael really struggled. We all knew Mike had demons but it's sad it has come to this. He added: 'I hadn't spoken to him since the last Friday of September. I had agreed to speak to him the next week but there was no answer. 'I kept calling and leaving answerphone messages but never heard anything. 'Eventually the phone was cut off, so we knew something was wrong and we called the police. 'The police broke their way into his flat, and found him sitting there in his chair. We don't know exactly what he died of, but we think it was drink-related'. Terrance, who lives with second wife Lesley in Gunnislake, Cornwall, added the family felt bitter that Michael had died while jailed Whiting, 55, would one day walk free. He said: 'It's terrible that Whiting will one day see the outside of a prison, when he has left so much destruction in his wake. 'Paedophiles never get cured, Whiting had done this once before and was left to walk free'. Michael Payne and his then wife  made a series of heart-rending appeals for her safe return, but her body was discovered 16 days later in a shallow grave just a few miles away. Sara and Michael pictured together at their Surrey home. Mr Payne has died following a long battle with alcoholism . Message: Sara Payne spoke through her friend Shy Keenan and thanked people for their support after the death of her ex-husband . His daughter Charlotte Payne posted this heartfelt tribute to her father on Facebook . Charlotte Payne's tribute to her father on social media states he will 'always be my daddy' Neighbour Ivy Holohan, 82,  said: 'When the police knocked on my door they said there was a bit of a problem I said what's that and they said it was about Michael. 'I wondered what was happening but they boarded the doors up now. It was a shock, a shame really.' Another neighbour who asked not to be named said: 'You didn't see him out anywhere. 'He used to drive a mini-bus for an OAP community scheme, I think. People knew who he was and his terrible past. We all felt so sorry for him bit he didn't mix with any of us in the block to be honest. 'It's an absolute tragedy. He clearly never got over what happened – who would? Roy Whiting was convicted of murdering schoolgirl Sarah Payne in 2000. 'It's awful for it to end that way. It's the rest of his children you feel sorry for now.' Whiting, who had served a previous prison sentence for assaulting a young girl, was given a life sentence for her murder in 2001. Messages of support poured in for the family, who have spoken publicly about the devastating consequences of Sarah's murder at the hands of paedophile Roy Whiting. A senior police officer who worked on the initial investigation into Sarah's disappearance said Mr Payne was 'a good man who battled with demons'. Martyn Underhill, now the Police and Crime Commissioner for Dorset, said: 'I was honoured to have known him. 'But all he ever wanted to do was to see his daughter again. When Sarah went, it destroyed Michael as well.' Referring to the turmoil her family suffered, Sarah's sister Charlotte, now 19, said on Facebook: 'I'm sorry I couldn't save you dad. I hope you have finally found your peace and happiness. 'Heartbroken to say the least. No matter what happened and how many mistakes we all made. You will always be my daddy.' Her older brother Lee, 27, a personal trainer, wrote: 'Dad, you had your demons and troubles but you had a good heart ... I hope now you have found peace at last. You will be missed. We are all heartbroken.' Speaking in 2003, Mrs Payne said: 'We know we're not the same people we once were – and everyone knows the awful reason why.' Mr Payne said: 'I've a lot of anger and bitterness inside me. I'm full of guilt and rage that I wasn't there to protect my little girl.' The former airport worker later admitted the couple had violent rows after he turned to drink as a way of coping. He was given a community order by magistrates after he admitted punching his estranged wife during an alcohol-fuelled row in 2005. And he was jailed for 16 months in 2011 after pleading guilty to glassing his brother Stephen following a session of heavy drinking when they both consumed several litres of cider. The court heard he was tormented by losing his daughter. Sarah's mother, 45, went on to campaign for a change in legislation to allow parents to know if convicted child sex offenders live nearby, known as Sarah's Law. She has been awarded an MBE and an honorary doctorate for her work and told recently how it had given her 'much-needed focus' amid the grief and her severe post-traumatic stress disorder. Mrs Payne also suffered a stroke in 2009 which has left her walking with the assistance of a stick. Yesterday her fellow campaigner Shy Keenan said Mrs Payne was grateful for the public's support, adding: 'Sara thanks you all (more than she can say right now) for your love, kindness and understanding at this very painful time in their lives. 'Sara wants to be left alone to care for her grief-stricken family.' Kent Police are not treating Mr Payne's death at his flat in Maidstone as suspicious. An inquest is expected to be opened next week. Sara and Michael Payne pictured outside Lewes Crown Court following the conviction of Whiting . In December 2001, Roy Whiting was sentenced to life in prison with a recommendation that he never be released after a jury found him guilty of the abduction and murder of Sarah Payne. After his conviction was entered, the court heard he had a previous conviction for the kidnap and indecent assault of a nine-year-old girl. The jury, who had been unaware of the previous sex conviction, were told Whiting had been sentenced to four years in jail for the sex attack in June 1995. Revelations Whiting already had a history of child abuse prior to the killing of Sarah prompted a national debate about how paedophiles are dealt with in the justice system. Mr and Mrs Payne began actively campaigning for a law change, piling pressure on ministers to allow people to know about convicted paedophiles living in their area. In the wake of Whiting's sentencing, Mrs Payne said: 'The Government only can make this decision. Right now, we have got a lot of work to do and it doesn't stop here. It just begins. You know what change I want, Sarah's Law.' The rule, eventually introduced in 2011, allows concerned parents or grandparents to contact police to find out if a new boyfriend, or a neighbour, who has contact with a child, has a history of child sex offending. The scheme is a watered-down version of similar laws in the U.S. under which details of where convicted paedophiles live are actively publicised. In 2008, Mrs Payne was awarded an MBE for her tireless campaigning on the issue.","Michael Payne, 45, was found dead by police at his home in Maidstone, Kent .

"In a play on the old adage 'if walls could talk', a mural has been discovered that could be the world's earliest warning sign. The 9,000-year-old painting, found on a wall buried in the ancient Turkish settlement of Catalhoyuk, shows a village in front of an erupting volcano. Researchers now believe, through the use of mineral dating and geochemical tests, that the volcano shown in the painting is the nearby Mount Hasan, found 70 miles from the settlement site. A mural, pictured, found on a wall in the Turkish settlement of Catalhoyuk depicts a village in front of a volcano. The painting is thought to be a warning about the danger of nearby stratovolcano Mount Hasan, located 70 miles northeast from where the mural was found . Çatalhoyuk is Turkish for 'fork' and 'mound'. It was a Neolithic settlement from 5700BC to 7500 BC, and last year it was added as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. In 1993 Ian Hodder from the . University of Cambridge began extensive excavations on the site and . discovered a series of domestic buildings, as well as artefacts and . murals. It is believed up to 10,000 people would have lived in the region, in mud-brick houses arranged in a maze. Mount Hasan, also known as Hasan Dağ, . is a stratovolcano situated around 70 miles northeast of Catalhoyuk in . the Turkish province of Aksaray. Its summit reaches 10,672 ft and it is the second highest mountain of central Anatolia. It is thought the mural was painted to warn about the dangers of this stratovolcano, yet it may also have been the first landscape painting or even the first news report. The reddish-brown mural was painted using a natural earth pigment called ochre onto an adobe wall, made from sand, clay and water. It was unearthed during excavations that began in 1993 on the site of the ancient settlement in the Turkish province of Konya. Volcanologist Axel Schmitt from the University of California told Discovery News that his team took volcanic rock from Mount Hasan and used mineral dating to establish when the volcano may have historically erupted. These tests determined that there was an explosive eruption around 9,000 years ago. This coincided with carbon-14 dating of the artefacts, and the wall on which the mural was painted, found at Catalhoyuk - give or take 1,000 years. Catalhoyuk and Mount Hasan . Schmitt and his team carried out the test to establish whether or not the volcano had ever been active. Previous theories suggested it was but there was little evidence proving these theories, or confirming when the eruptions took place. The painting is considered locally to be a warning sign about Mount Hasan and this latest research adds weight to these claims. Schmitt's research will be discussed at the Geological Society of America in Denver on Thursday. Çatalhoyuk is Turkish for 'fork' and 'mound'. This is how Mount Hasan looks today. Volcanologist Axel Schmitt took rock from this volcano and used mineral dating to establish when the volcano may have historically erupted. Tests determined there was an eruption 9,000 years ago and this coincides with when the mural is thought to have been painted . It was a Neolithic settlement from 5700BC to 7500 BC and last year it was added as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. In 1993 Ian Hodder from the . University of Cambridge began extensive excavations on the site and discovered a series of domestic buildings, as well as artefacts and murals. It is believed up to 10,000 people would have lived in the region, in mud-brick houses arranged in a maze. Mount Hasan, also known as Hasan Dağ, is a stratovolcano situated around 70 miles northeast of Catalhoyuk in the Turkish province of Aksaray. Its summit reaches 10,672 ft and it is the second highest mountain of central Anatolia.","Mural was found on a wall in the ancient Turkish settlement of Catalhoyuk .

"A Libyan security officer has claimed that he warned American diplomats about the possibility of violent unrest three days before the attack on the U.S. consulate which left the ambassador dead along with three others. The country's president also says that the deadly raid in Benghazi was 'pre-planned' by Al Qaeda and other 'foreigners'. However, the U.S. has hit back at that suggestion, with a top diplomat insisting the attack was 'a spontaneous - not a premeditated - response' to violence elsewhere. Scroll down for video .

Brimming anger: Afghan demonstrators prepare to torch a U.S. flag during protest in Herat . Jamal Mabrouk, of the February 17th Brigade, told CNN . that he and a battalion commander sat down with U.S. envoys to discuss . the economy and security in the country, which has been going through a . turbulent transition since the fall of Moammar Gaddafi last year. According to Mabrouk, they told the . diplomats that the precarious security situation was not beneficial for . international business. ‘The situation is frightening, it scares us,’ Mabrouk said they told the U.S. officials. He would not say how they responded. Mabrouk added that it was not the . first time he has alerted foreigners to safety concerns in the face of . the growing presence of armed jihadist groups in the Benghazi area. Libyan President Mohammed el-Megarif, . meanwhile, has said he believes the attackers are connected to Al Qaeda . and used the protests at the consulate as a cover to attack on the . anniversary of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. In an interview with NPR, . Megarif said foreigners have been infiltrating his country over the . past few months, which has been undergoing major changes since the . uprising against the late dictator Muammar al-Qaddafi. 'We firmly believe that this was a . precalculated, preplanned attack that was carried out specifically to . attack the U.S. Consulate,' Megarif told NPR.

On CBS' Face the Nation, . Megarif said that 'a few' of those who joined in the attack were . foreigners, who had entered Libya 'from different directions, some of . them definitely from Mali and Algeria.' 'The others are affiliates and maybe sympathizers,' he added. But Susan Rice, America's ambassador . to the United Nations, told ABC's This Week she believed the assault was . the result of ad-hoc protests and had not been planned in advance. 'Our current best assessment, based . on the information that we have at present, is that, in fact, what this . began as, it was a spontaneous – not a premeditated – response to what . had transpired in Cairo,' she said. Ms Rice added that protests in Egypt against an American-made anti-Muslim video provided the catalyst for the violence in Libya. 'We believe that folks in Benghazi, a . small number of people came to... the consulate to replicate the sort . of challenge that was posed in Cairo,' she said. 'And then as that unfolded, it seems . to have been hijacked by some individual clusters of extremists who came . with heavier weapons... And it then evolved from there.' The disagreement between the U.S. and . Libya over the origins of the brutal raid could add to the tensions . between the West and the Muslim world in the wake of the ongoing . protests around the globe. Denial: Susan Rice, U.S. ambassador to the UN, insisted that the attack was entirely spontaneous . Libyan President Mohammed el-Megarif said he believes Al Qaeda is behind the attack on the U.S. embassy that killed four Americans, including Ambassador Chris Stevens . U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other embassy employees were killed after a barrage of small arms, rocket-propelled grenades and mortars tore into the consulate buildings in Benghazi on Tuesday, the 11th anniversary of the September 11 attacks. The room where the body of the ambassador was found was protected by a large door with steel bars; the windows had steel bars, CNN reported. Stevens’ body was later recovered after looters broke into the room. It appears his security detail left him in the room while they clashed with the attackers. The State Department has not released . details about how Stevens died, although numerous media reports have . said the ambassador was taken from the consulate to the Benghazi medical . center by locals.

Seething masses: People shout and hold slogans in front of the U.S. embassy during a protest in Cairo September 11, 2012 . Terrible prelude: A vehicle set on fire during the violent assault on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi on Tuesday . He arrived at the hospital, according to the reports, unresponsive and covered in soot from the fire. A doctor was unable to revive him and declared him dead, the reports said. It has been reported that the assault on the American embassy that ended in the death of the envoy and thee other officials began simultaneously from three directions. Slain: U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens was killed by protesters angry over a film that ridiculed Islam's Prophet Muhammad . According to an embassy guard, heavy machine guns and rocket -propelled grenades were used by masked men who then threatened to kill him 'protecting the infidels.’ The February 17th Brigade -- a militia formed in the first days of the uprising against Gaddafi which has since become affiliated with Libya’s military - was closely involved in the rescue of the American staff trapped after the attack Tuesday night. After the consulate was sacked, several Americans escaped to a safe-house in another part of Benghazi, but that location too came under attack. Mabrouk said he received a call from an official in Tripoli who said he had been called by a ‘terrified’ American hiding at the safe house. Mabrouk said the Brigade asked the Americans if they required assistance, but were told that while the situation was precarious, it was under control. A few hours later, Mabrouk said he received another call from Tripoli about the arrival of a U.S. team at Benghazi airport that needed transport into the city. He met the seven heavily armed Americans dressed in civilian clothing and conducted them to the safe house with an armed escort. Upon the arrival of the newcomers in the city, they came under intense fire before their assailants fled. Mabrouk’s statements come just days . after the U.S. State Department has angrily denied claims that it had . intelligence warning its consulate in Libya would be attacked 48 hours . in advance. Earlier . this week, a spokesman has dismissed claims that the attacks were the . result of a 'continuing security breach' and diplomats should have been . warned before the attacks as 'completely wrong.' Bloody sacking: Glass, debris and overturned furniture are strewn inside a room in the gutted U.S. consulate in Benghazi after the attack that killed four Americans . Devastation: People inspect the damage at the U.S. consulate, one day after armed men stormed the place during a protest . New claims: A member of a Libyan security force said he had met with American diplomats three days before the deadly assault to warn them about the deteriorating situation in the country . The official told Politico: 'This is absolutely wrong. We are not aware of any actionable intelligence indicating that an attack on the U.S. Mission in Benghazi was planned or imminent.' The violent assault on the consulate in Benghazi started out as a demonstration against the film Innocence of Muslims, which reportedly was made in California by a filmmaker whose identity was not known at the time. The Mail on Sunday has since exclusively revealed that Nakoiula Basseley Nakoula, an Egyptian-born Coptic Christian, has been named by the FBI as the director of the controversial film which ridicules the Prophet Mohammed. The release of the film online set . off a firestorm in the Middle East, with Muslims throughout the region . taking to the streets and staging violent protests against the U.S. On . Sunday, demonstrators in Afghanistan torched a U.S. flag and were heard . shouting slogans denouncing America during a protest in the city of . Herat.

Meanwhile, in Karachi, police were forced to use tear gas and aerial firing to disperse a protest rally by the Islamist party Majlis Wahdat-e-Muslimeen outside the U.S. consulate. The U.S. has ordered diplomats' families and non-essential staff to leave its embassies in Sudan and Tunisia following revelations by the Libyan government that Al Qaeda might have been responsible for the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi. In a statement, the terrorist network has urged Muslims around the world to step up their protests and kill more diplomats in Islamic countries.

"Facebook has revealed a massive boost in its mobile ad revenue - but revealed the whatsApp service it recently bought is losing money. The social network grew its advertising revenue by 64 percent in the third quarter, helped by a boost in mobile ads. Advertising revenue at the company totaled $2.96 billion. Advertising revenue at the company totaled $2.96 billion, and mobile ad revenue, a closely watched figure, was $1.95 billion, or 66 percent of Facebook's total advertising revenue for the quarter. The Menlo Park, California-based company's stock slid 96 cents in extended trading. 'This has been a good quarter for Facebook and we have achieved strong results across the board,' Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a conference call with analysts. Mobile ad revenue, a closely watched figure, was $1.95 billion, or 66 percent of Facebook's total advertising revenue for the quarter. That's up from 62 percent in the second quarter and 59 percent in the first three months of the year. The 10-year-old company began offering mobile ads in 2012. Now, Facebook is expanding into highly lucrative video ads, and earlier this year re-launched Atlas, a tool for marketers to better target people across 'devices, platforms and publishers' and to measure how well the ads work. The Atlas move and the acquisition of LiveRail, an online video advertising platform signal that an 'important shift is under way at Facebook,' says Debra Aho Williamson, an analyst at research firm eMarketer. Facebook is 'becoming much more ambitious in offering digital services far beyond what the company was initially created to do as a social network.' The company has been on a roll lately, and its stock hit an all-time high of $81.16 on Tuesday before the results came out. That's more than double its initial public offering price of $38. Both the troubled IPO and the company's lagging stock price seem like a distant memory. However, according to the SEC documents, WhatsApp reported just over $10 million in revenue in 2013, and a total net loss of $138 million for the year. Mobile ad revenue, a closely watched figure, was $1.95 billion, or 66 percent of Facebook's total advertising revenue for the quarter.That's up from 62 percent in the second quarter and 59 percent in the first three months of the year. WhatsApp does not currently show ads on its service and Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg has said the company will not rush to monetize the service. Macquarie's Schachter said investors understand that WhatsApp is a 'long-term play,' and that what's most important right now is for the app to continue to grow its base of users. The world's No.1 online social network said its total number of monthly users reached 1.35 billion in the third quarter, with 864 million users accessing the service every day. Still, Facebook has had to be vigilant in attracting new users, especially outside the U.S., and ensuring that existing members return day after day. Facebook had 1.35 billion average monthly users as of Sept. 30, an increase of 14 percent from a year earlier. Daily users totaled 864 million, up 19 percent. Mobile monthly active users, meanwhile, were 1.12 billion, up 29 percent from a year earlier. While Facebook has been growing its share of the worldwide digital advertising market, it's still a long way from catching up to rival Google Inc. In 2013, Facebook had a nearly 6 percent share of the market compared with Google's 32 percent, according to eMarketer. This year, Facebook is expected to grow its slice to nearly 8 percent, while Google's should decline slightly, to just below 32 percent. Overall, Facebook earned $802 million after paying preferred dividends, or 30 cents per share, on revenue of $3.2 billion. Adjusted earnings and revenue both beat Wall Street's estimates.

"Motorists make a compensation claim for pothole damage to their vehicles every 11 minutes, figures reveal. Nearly 50,000 drivers made claims against councils costing millions of pounds in the last financial year, according to a report by the RAC Foundation. But it highlights a postcode lottery in which the number, success rate and size of claims can vary enormously from area to area. Nearly 50,000 drivers made claims against councils costing millions of pounds in the last financial year, according to a report by the RAC Foundation . The motoring group questioned how the Government could be spending £50billion on the controversial HS2 high-speed rail project when councils face a £12billion backlog of road repairs. The 200, out of a total of 207, local highways authorities in England, Scotland and Wales who responded to Freedom of Information requests by the RAC Foundation dealt with 48,664 compensation claims in 2013/14. This is the equivalent of roughly one claim being submitted every 11 minutes day and night, 365 days a year. It is also an increase on the 2012/13 figure of 46,139 claims. However cash-strapped councils refused the majority of claims, agreeing to pay out in less than a quarter – 23 per cent – of cases. The total value of successful claims was £3.2million. And the average payout for a successful claim in 2013/14 was £286, down from £357 the year before. The average administration cost of each claim – successful or not – was £147. Surrey tops the league for the highest overall number of pothole claims at 3,912. It also has the highest compensation bill – £250,289 – despite only one in five (21.5 per cent) of claims being paid out in 2013/14. In second place is Essex with 2,548 claims of which 98 (3.8 per cent) were paid out at a cost of £156,008. The 200, out of a total of 207, local highways authorities in England, Scotland and Wales who responded to Freedom of Information requests by the RAC Foundation dealt with 48,664 compensation claims in 2013/14 . One claim regarding potholes is being submitted every 11 minutes day and night, 365 days a year . Professor Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC Foundation, said: 'These figures are likely to be the tip of the iceberg. Many drivers will be put off by the time involved in claiming against a council, and many councils do their best to deter claimants coming forward. 'But the fundamental problem lies not at the doors of our town halls but with central government. Despite occasional one-off grants related to periods of harsh weather, they are simply not giving councils enough money to keep their road networks up to scratch.' Last month Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin announced a record £6billion boost to help remove the 'menace' of 18million potholes from local roads over the next six years. He said the £1billion a year share-out to town halls will help English local authorities tackle potholes and improve local roads between 2015 and 2021 while giving them time to plan ahead. The Local Government Association's transport spokesman Peter Box said: 'We need long-term funding to tackle the ever-growing £12billion roads repair backlog facing the nation. 'Our fear is that another harsh winter could be the tipping point for our roads.' As many as one in six (16 per cent) of drivers have been left with damage to their vehicle in the past 12 months, according to a recent survey from LV Road Rescue.

"Hovering high above the mountains these unusual, saucer-like white masses resemble a creature or vehicle from another world - but they are in fact clouds. The natural phenomenon, known as a lenticular clouds, tend to form at high altitudes, such as above mountains. Scroll down for video . Russian photographer Denis Bukhov captured the rare phenomenon of lenticular clouds over the Kamchatka Peninsula in Russia. Resembling flying saucers, they form when the air temperature drops and moisture droplets are pushed up a steep slope by high winds . The lens-shaped formations are scientifically known as 'altocumulus lenticularis' and are the result of moist air that has condensed at a high altitude. They are formed when the air temperature drops and moisture droplets are pushed up a steep slope by high winds. This unique atmospheric condition creates the interesting lens-shaped form that defines a lenticular cloud. Mountains act as natural barriers forcing clouds to condense quickly as they are pushed to cooler altitudes. This is why a large or particularly tall mountain range will experience a moist climate on one side but an arid one on the other. Denis said that it is possible to walk to the top of a volcano, find the Pacific Ocean by following the mountain rivers and see the first sunrise over all of Russia . The lenticular cloud pattern depends upon wind speed and the shape of the mountains. A constant wind may produce clouds which are stable and remain virtually stationary, as if hovering, in the sky for hours . Lenticular clouds form when a tall geographic feature, such as the the top of a mountain, interrupts a strong upward-flowing wind. The blocked airflow creates a 'wind wave' pattern in the atmosphere on the downwind side of the mountain. Just as a rock in a stream will form ripples downstream, a similar effect occurs in the air – with the clouds forming at the peaks of the waves. The impressive series of pictures taken . by photographer, Denis Budkov, 33, show formations over Klyuchevskaya . Sopka, the highest mountain of the Kamchatka Peninsula in Russia. As a keen photographer, Denis said he loved nothing more than to capture the natural beauty of his home land of Kamchatka. He said: 'These clouds are very special as they do not move, they stay in one place and it's only their shape that changes. 'There needs to be at least two factors for these clouds to appear, a very strong wind and a very high object, so Klyuchevskaya Sopka is a perfect place to find lenticular clouds. 'Kamchatka is a very special and . beautiful land. 'With every new day I seem to discover more areas of . natural beauty that I didn't even know existed. 'I . was born and raised in Kamchatka, the so called 'land of fire breathing . mountains' and there is nowhere else like it on Earth. You can walk to . the top of a volcano, find the Pacific Ocean by following the mountain . rivers and see the first sunrise over all of Russia.' As a keen photographer, Denis said he loved nothing more than to capture the natural beauty of his home land of Kamchatka.

This adds to the disturbing atmosphere evoked by the oddly shaped clouds .","Russian photographer Denis Budkov, 33, captured formations the over the Kamchatka Peninsula in Russia .

"After reported lost for nearly 50 years, Pablo Picasso's masterpiece Seated Woman with Red Hat has been unearthed in the storage of an Indiana museum. Described as sparkling 'like a jewel,' the long-lost piece was discovered after an auction house in New York inquired about the art work's gifting to the Evansville Museum in 1963. At the time of its donation it was not believed to have been an actual work by Picasso, despite its signature, and so never saw the museum's walls. Found: Pablo Picasso's Seated Woman with Red Hat has been unearthed from the Evansville Museum in Indiana after reported lost for nearly 50 years . 'When the Evansville Museum received the gift, associated documentation indicated that the piece was created by an artist named “Gemmaux”,' the museum said in a release this week. 'Gemmaux,' the plural of 'gemmail,' they explained, is an artist's technique of layering glass while adding a clear liquid enamel across before firing it up. This technique was rare for Picasso who only produced 50 or more during his study at a studio in France, the Evansville museum said. Upon researching Picasso's previous gemmaux pieces earlier this year, auction house Guernsey's in New York inquired upon the museum's while seeing it labelled as such after its gift from international designer Raymond Loewy. It was that inquisitive Guernsy's member who recognized the astonishing value in their Evansville museum’s masterpiece. 'It was undoubtedly a unique set of circumstances that uncovered this treasure within our museum,' said the museum's executive director John Streetman in a release. Missed chance: The artwork was gifted to the museum, pictured, in 1963 but misidentified in their catalog by the donor causing it to never hang once on their walls . He described it as 'extraordinary,' and said 'it sparkles like a jewel.' The museum noted at the time that Picasso’s signature does appear on the artwork's top right-hand corner, placing its mention in its cataloguing. Despite such a legendary find stashed right beneath their nose, the museum announced on Monday their plans, with heavy hearts, to take it to auction. 'Now that we have a full understanding of the requirements and additional expenses to display, secure, preserve and insure the piece, it is clear those additional costs would place a prohibitive financial burden on the museum,' said R Steven Krohn, president of the museum's board of trustees in a statement. 'It is in the best interest of the Evansville Museum to sell this work of art.' Guernsey’s  will conduct a private selling of the art work with the auction house not releasing an estimation of its upcoming sale. Still one of the world’s reigning top artists, Picasso's Garcon a la Pipe, painted when he was aged 24, is one of the most expensive works of art having been sold for $104 million (£58 million) in 2004. In 2006 his Dora Maar au Chat sold for $95.2 million, the second-highest amount ever paid for a painting at auction, auction house Sotheby's said at the time.","Picasso artwork was mislabeled when gifted to museum in 1963 causing it to never see the museum's walls .

"Ulrika the mother: With daughter Bo, 13, last year . Trying to discipline your children is a challenge for any parent…especially if your spouse then undermines all your hard work by spoiling them with gifts. But when you have four offspring by four different fathers like Ulrika Jonsson, it seems that agreeing on some basic parenting ground rules becomes virtually impossible. The presenter, 47, has spoken of the ‘nightmare’ of controlling her children’s internet access when her ex-lovers shower them with hi-tech gadgets and smartphones that allow them to go online whenever they like. Jonsson revealed that her oldest daughter Bo, 13, has a mobile phone ‘much against my better judgment’, while her youngest Martha was given an iPod by her father at the tender age of ten. And she said she was ‘utterly horrified’ when her eldest son Cameron, 19, from her first marriage to cameraman John Turnbull, admitted he had watched online porn when he was just 14. The Swedish-born star said she now feels incapable of protecting them from graphic and sexually explicit material on her own because it is so easy for them to access the Internet. She told Hello!: ‘In my household things have changed greatly over the last few years. My oldest son, who’s nearing 20, is capable of regulating himself. ‘My oldest daughter, who is about 14, has had, much against my better judgment, an iPod since she was 11 and a mobile phone since she was 12. ‘At first her mobile wasn’t a smartphone but times have moved on and so, it appears, has she. ‘My ten-year-old daughter was given an iPod by her father last Christmas, and my six-year-old boy can access the family iPad.’ Jonsson married her third husband, advertising executive Brian Monet, in 2008. He is father to her youngest son Malcolm. Martha was born to her second husband Lance Gerrard-Wright, whom she divorced in 2006. Jonsson never married Bo’s father, German hotel manager Marcus Kempen, and they split shortly after her birth. The presenter said she welcomed a new Government pilot scheme which will see music videos on YouTube and music platform Vevo classified by the British Board of Film Certification for age suitability. But she admitted she wished she had started worrying about the issue many years ago. She said: ‘Four years ago, none of the nightmares of policing my children’ s access existed. But they should have done because my 19-year-old confessed to me last year that he had viewed porn on the Internet when he was about 14. The presenter, 49, said she feels incapable of protecting her children from graphic and sexually explicit material online (File photo) ‘I was utterly horrified and felt a fool for being too trusting and not savvy enough.’ Jonsson said the only influence she has over her children is to inform them about the risks of the Internet, but said she was unable to stop Bo setting up a Facebook account of her own accord. She said: ‘When we found out, she was made to understand in no uncertain terms why she couldn’t have one and why we need to know what she does on the Internet.’ Jonsson added: ‘I, alone, cannot protect them from everything, including the content they have at their fingertips and which they absorb unwittingly. What they view on the Internet enters their psyches and I would do them a grave injustice if I didn’t alert them to the fact that not all of it is good.’","The presenter, 47, says it is a 'nightmare' controlling children's web access .

"A shopper shared her disgust when she saw a magpie that appeared to be nibbling on pre-packed meat at a Tesco supermarket. Raquel Burchell spotted the bird perched on the edge of a shelf full of pre-packaged raw meat at a Tesco store in Havant, Hampshire, and took a photo as it seemed to start pecking at the food. Ms Burchell posted a picture of the 'horrible' incident of the magpie perched on the beef mince section of the supermarket, on her Twitter account. Raquel Burchell saw a magpie that appeared to eat raw pre-packaged meat in a Tesco store in Havant . 'It was disgusting. Its beak was in the packets eating raw meat,' she told the BBC. 'It was horrible.' Ms Burchell posted the offended pictures earlier today with the message: 'Magpie at Tesco eating the food contaminating the food discontinuing.' [sic] . All items the bird came into contact with have now been removed from the shop floor and from sale. The supermarket giant responded to Ms Burchell and said they maintained high levels of hygiene in their shops. In a statement Tesco said: 'Hi Raquel, rest assured, our goal is always to release any birds which have found their way into our stores. 'We also ensure we maintain our high standards of hygiene at all times.' Tesco said the bird was released after being discovered and it maintained hygiene standards in all stores . Ms Burchell posted the comment on Twitter today, claiming the magpie was eating the pre packed meat . A spokesman for Tesco said: 'We are pleased to confirm that the bird was safely released from the store this morning.' Magpies are natural scavengers, predators and destroyers of pests, and will often nest close to towns and cities because they are warmer. The RSPB estimates there are more than a million of the birds in the UK.","Shopper Raquel Burchell spotted a magpie sitting on a meat aisle in Tesco .

"A university drop-out posed as a surrogate mother and robbed a childless couple of their savings in a ‘cruel and hurtful’ fraud, a court heard yesterday. Samantha Cookes, 23, preyed on the couple’s vulnerability after they had suffered the heartache of miscarriages  and three failed IVF cycles by falsely promising to help them start a family. But instead she disappeared with their money, leaving the husband and wife deeply traumatised. Samantha Cookes preyed on the couple's vulnerability after they had suffered the heartache of miscarriages and three failed IVF cycles . She told them she was a court-approved social worker and claimed to have been a surrogate mother for a wealthy family who were prepared to vouch for her, the hearing was told. Cookes, a former York University student, then created a Facebook account in the name of the fictitious woman and exchanged messages with the couple about the ‘wonderful’ experience. By the time the couple realised they had been duped, they had paid Cookes £1,200 for ‘contracts, legal fees and insemination kits’, and had already started planning for their longed-for family. Despite her cruel deception, Cookes was yesterday spared jail after the court heard that she had suffered undiagnosed psychiatric problems since losing her four-month-old daughter to cot death in 2008. Last night her devastated victims, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said: ‘We are annoyed she did not get a harsher punishment – it’s just a slap on the wrist after all the hurt she has caused. She’s put us through hell. We cannot believe that anyone can be so callous.’ Cookes began the deception in February last year after contacting the couple through an internet forum for surrogacy. The couple, from Northallerton, North Yorkshire, told her about their failed IVF attempts, the miscarriages and their desire to adopt or foster. They were desperate to start a family and saw surrogacy as a last resort. Cookes told them she had been a surrogate already, for a family from the West Midlands, who would be happy to provide them with references vouching for her. Teesside Crown Court where Cookes was spared jail after the court heard that she had suffered undiagnosed psychiatric problems since losing her daughter to cot death . She then created the fake Facebook account, using the name Claudia Bronwyn. In one message to the couple she wrote: ‘I’m extremely grateful to Samantha – she has an incredible heart. She has given us a wonderful gift.’ Cookes also gave them fake documents showing she had been a surrogate and even urged them to decide quickly because she had others on a waiting list. She then demanded payment  for expenses – including travelling to see the couple at their home – and for her solicitor to draw up  the contract. The couple used all their savings as well as money from the wife’s business as they chased their dream of becoming parents. But after handing over the cash, they grew suspicious, Teesside Crown Court was told. Cookes began avoiding telephone calls and text messages and persuaded them not to travel to her house. She claimed the hold-ups were due to ‘tiny’ problems with the contract. The couple, fearing they had been duped by a fraudster, contacted police who arrested Cookes at her home in Shropshire. Kieran Rainey, mitigating, said: ‘The whole case is one steeped in sadness. There is the couple’s difficulty in having their own child and the false hope Miss Cookes gave them, and also the tragedy of her own loss in 2008. ‘Even today, when she looks back, she doesn’t see offering surrogacy as a bad thing, but she immediately became involved in a deception which she now truly regrets.’ Cookes, of Ferndale Drive, Telford, admitted fraud by false representation, and in a letter read out to the court apologised for the  hurt she caused. ‘I truly am sorry,’ she wrote. ‘Now I am in intensive therapy, I can see that I never dealt with my grief after my daughter’s sudden death and I am sorry this caused me to hurt other people. ‘I hope to resolve my mental illness…this will never erase my mistake, though. Never again will I get myself into trouble…I never want to hurt anyone else again.’ Cookes was given a nine-month prison sentence, suspended for two years, and ordered to pay the couple £1,890 in compensation. The Judge, Recorder Ben Nolan QC, told her: ‘You have pleaded guilty to a very cruel and hurtful fraud…There was a great deal of sophistication and deliberation about that deception.’ He added: ‘Your victims were particularly vulnerable because their natural and unfulfilled desire was to have children. ‘They resorted to what, to some extent, was a last resort. It is little wonder to me that [the wife], in particular, having realised that she was misled in such a cruel way,  has suffered quite serious psychological consequences.’","Avoids jail after judge hears she lost her own baby to cot death .

"The shell casing of a bullet was found in a car rented by former New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez on the day he is accused of murdering Odin Lloyd. Keelia Smyth, former manager of an Enterprise rental car branch in North Attleborough, Boston, told the court on Wednesday that Hernandez returned a damaged Nissan Altima on the afternoon of June 17, 2013. In it, she says, was something she believed to be a bullet stuck to a piece of chewed blue gum and a child's drawing. Hernandez had offered her a piece of blue gum before he left, she said. The testimony came as police were questioned over their handling of evidence, which has been a crucial element of the trial. Accused: Aaron Hernandez allegedly left the casing of a bullet in his rental car after the death of Odin Lloyd . Enterprise worker Keelia Smyth told Bristol County Superior Court on Wednesday about her alleged finding . 'Evidence': This is a picture shown to the court on Wednesday of the casing police recovered on June 20 . Smyth told the court Hernandez made no attempt to conceal his identity when he returned the car on June 18, asking for an SUV instead. When she cleaned the car, she said, there was a 'bullet' stuck to a piece of blue chewing gum, and a child's drawing. Before Hernandez left, she says, he offered her a piece of blue gum, which she declined. She threw it all in the trash but when she heard of Hernandez's arrest, called police describing her alleged discovery, the Boston Globe reported. Officers said they found a .45-caliber shell casing, chewing gum, and a child's drawing in the dumpster on June 20. Smyth told the court Hernandez made no attempt to conceal his identity when he returned the car on June 18 . The court also heard from Hernandez's uncle who said the player was upset about losing his endorsements . Hernandez is charged with the June 17, 2013, killing of Lloyd, who was dating the sister of his fiancee . Gum: Smyth claims Hernandez offered her a piece of blue gum before she found the casing stuck to gum . The items were placed in the bed of a State Police pick-up truck - a move which both the prosecution and defense teams have criticized. 'It was just a dirty old pickup truck, right?' defense lawyer James Sultan asked police detective Michael Elliott. 'Has anyone ever taught you to collect evidence that way, sir?' 'No,' Elliott said. Hernandez is charged with the June 17, 2013, killing of Odin Lloyd, who was dating the sister of Hernandez's fiancee. Odin Lloyd's bullet-riddled body was found in an industrial park in June 2013. Requested an SUV: She said Hernandez returned the car asking for an SUV on June 18, 2013 . Resuming the murder trial on Wednesday, prosecution first heard from Ms Smyth, who said Hernandez first rented the Nissan Altima on June 10, 2013. She said he requested an SUV when he returned it on June 18. Smyth claims she offered him a Kia Soul, as no SUVs were available, but Hernandez replied that 'he couldn't be seen dead in that'. He took a Chrysler 300. Hernandez, 25, had a $41 million contract with the New England Patriots when he was arrested on murder and firearms charges. The team cut him hours later. Police have yet to find the gun in question, which is proving to be a major set back for both defense and prosecution. In a blow to prosecution, Bristol Superior Court Judge Susan Garsh ruled on Wednesday that Hernandez's friend Robert Paradis could not testify that he knew about the gun. He took to the stand in absence of the jury to clarify that police had overstretched his comments in their report, and that he couldn't be sure of Hernandez's connection to a .45 caliber gun. It was believed Hernandez had told Paradis he owned a .45 caliber gun. Paradis admitted that he cannot recall if it was specifically .45 caliber, and that he never saw the gun in question.","Enterprise worker claims she found 'bullet' when cleaning the car .

"For thousands of years, 17 giant slabs of stone formed a bridge across a river in Exmoor. The Tarr Steps were even said to have been built by the devil so he could sunbathe, according to legend - but that didn't stop them getting washed away in floods last year. Today, engineers began the painstaking task of rebuilding the 180ft-long crossing, which some believe dates back to 1000 BC. Situated on the River Barle in Somerset, it collapsed after being struck by a 10ft wall of flood water on December 22. Scroll down for video . Engineers began to rebuild the Tarr Steps in Exmoor today after the ancient bridge was washed away by floods last December . A construction crew has already moved some of the two-tonne slabs - each measuring up to 8ft - out of the water with heavy lifting machinery . Each step had previously been numbered in the event that the Grade I-listed structure was ever damaged, so the teams will carefully slot them back together in the coming days . The bridge as it looked before the floodwater caused it to collapse . Legend has it that the devil built the bridge at Tarr Steps and had rights over sunbathing on the stones. Anyone who tried to cross the bridge, it was said, did so at the risk that they would be killed by the devil, who swore an oath to crush anyone who passed from one side to the other. It is claimed that locals once sent a cat across the bridge to test the myth – and the animal was vaporised. Only after confrontation with the local parson is the devil supposed to have withdrawn the threat. A construction crew has already moved some of the two-tonne slabs - each measuring up to 8ft - out of the water with heavy lifting machinery. Each step had previously been numbered in the event that the Grade I-listed structure was ever damaged, so the teams will carefully slot them back together in the coming days. The bridge, which links the Somerset villages of Withypool and Dulverton, was also washed away in 1952 and had to be rebuilt by the Army. Following further damage in 1982, two thick 'hawser' cables were strung across the river to protect it - but both snapped during December's floods. At the time, local resident Martin Hesp told the Daily Mail: ‘I have lived in the area for over 50 years and I have never seen anything like this before. ‘It must have been some mighty trees which were carried downstream and smashed through them.’ Following damage in 1982, two thick cables were strung across the river to protect it - but both snapped during December's floods . Contractors working for Somerset County Council are in charge of the rebuild . The Tarr Steps is one of Britain's best preserved examples of a clapper bridge, derived from the Latin 'claperius', meaning 'pile of stones' The bridge was constructed out of stone slabs supported on stone piers, which stick three feet out of the water when the river is at its normal level . Contractors working for Somerset County Council are in charge of the latest rebuild which started this afternoon. Rob Wilson-North, conservation manager for the Exmoor National Park Authority, was there when the swollen Barle washed away the historic stones. He said: 'It was the speed of the water - it was absolutely terrifying, it was moving so fast. 'I've worked on Exmoor for 20 years and I've never seen it like that. For me, it was absolutely shocking.' The bridge, which links the Somerset villages of Withypool and Dulverton, was also washed away in 1952 and had to be rebuilt by the Army .

"A mother was kicked out of a pizzeria for changing her baby's diaper at her table. But mother Miranda Sowers says she was forced into the situation since the restaurant doesn't provide changing tables in their restroom. The incident happened at Brother's Pizza Express in Spring, Texas, where Sowers took her three daughters for a meal. Scroll down for video . Asked to leave: Texas mother Miranda Sowers (left) was kicked out of a pizzeria when she changed her 4-month-old daughter's diaper at a table in the restaurant. She says she was forced into the situation since there was no changing table in the restroom and she was alone with her other two daughters . She went to the bathroom to change 4-month-old daughter Reagan, but discovered they didn't have a changing table. Since she was alone with the children, including 4-year-old daughter Lauren and 8-year-old daughter Katelyn, Sowers says she didn't want to take them all back outside to the car. So she changed her baby at her table and believes no customers saw her. 'I thought you know what I've got my own changing pad, she's tiny, she fits right here on the chair,' Sowers told KHOU. 'So I laid her down quickly and quietly changed her diaper.' The incident happened at this pizzeria in Spring, Texas. The restaurant owners have stood by their decision to ask Sowers to leave . But manager Donny Lala, whose family owns the restaurant, says customers started complaining. 'As soon as you start opening the diaper, people start complaining about the smell of the diaper,' Lala manager. 'Last thing I want is a customer throwing up.' So Sowers' order was brought out in to-go packaging and she was asked to leave. Sowers has since filed a complaint with the better business bureau. While the owners of Brothers Pizza Express stand by their decision, they say they are looking into investing in changing tables. According to federal law, restaurants and stores do not need to provide changing tables - or even restrooms for that matter.","Miranda Sowers brought her three daughters to Brother's Pizza Express but found the restaurant had no changing tables in their bathroom .

"Verdict: Michelle George, a mother-of-two was given a suspended 18-week sentence . A mother-of two who was left feeling 'disfigured' after breast cancer, sent obscene notes to two teenage couples on her street because she was ‘jealous’ of them. Michelle George, who is in her late forties, also bombarded the youngsters with constant phone-calls. Teesside Magistrates’ Court heard that George had suffered a breakdown and was also coming to terms with her husband and mother being diagnosed with cancer. Alongside this she was still struggling with her own illness and her father dying from leukaemia. George, from Guisborough, Cleveland, was spared jail on Monday after magistrates gave her a suspended 18-week sentence. Lyn Roberts, prosecuting, said George had started harassing her neighbour, 18-year-old James Morgan, and his younger girlfriend. She had sent notes purporting to be from a girl called ‘Chloe’, accusing the victim of cheating on his partner. Then, in September last year, she started making phonecalls and sending letters to 19-year-old Hannah Draboczy, who lived nearby, and her boyfriend Benjamin Linsley, also 19. When Miss Draboczy asked who was calling, she replied: 'Chloe'. George also sent explicit letters to Miss Draboczy’s mother and her partner. Disturbing: George sent obscene notes to two teenage couples on her street in  Guisborough, Cleveland (pictured) because she was 'jealous' of them . In a victim statement to the court, both Miss Draboczy and Mr Linsley said they felt as though they were being watched constantly because the letters described what they were wearing on certain days and even what gifts they received at Christmas. All the victims felt suspicious of everyone around them and one was receiving medical treatment for panic attacks and stress. Ms Roberts said: 'When Mrs George was questioned by police, she said she had been through a rough time and saw Hannah and Ben one day and the fact they seemed so happy made her jealous.' Rachel Mason, mitigating, said: 'She is recovering from breast cancer and considered herself disfigured and it had a massive effect on her emotional wellbeing.' Trial: Teesside Magistrates' Court heard that George had suffered a breakdown and was coming to terms with her husband and mother being diagnosed with cancer . Miss Mason denied George had been stalking her victims, saying she got her information from social networking sites. 'Speaking to Mrs George’s doctor, he says she has had an emotional breakdown.' George had previously admitted four counts of harassment. She was ordered to pay £400 compensation to her victims and £85 towards court costs. She is also under a supervision order. After the case, Miss Draboczy said: 'Michelle George put Ben and I and our families through hell for seven months and even now we can’t fully understand why she targeted us in this way. 'Not knowing who was behind this campaign was very difficult and we found ourselves suspecting everyone, even those close to us.'","The mother-of-two was given a suspended 18-week sentence at Teesside Magistrates’ Court .

"A husband and wife who were born on the same day and celebrated their 75th wedding anniversary last year have died just a day apart. The couple's son Les Brown Jr said that 94-year-old Helen Brown died on July 16 and 94-year-old Les Brown died on July 17 in southern California. Mrs Brown had stomach cancer while Mr Brown had battled Parkinson's disease. Lifetime of love: Helen and Les Brown whose marriage lasted for 75 years died just a day apart in southern California . The Browns were born on New Year's Eve in 1918. They met in high school and became teenage sweethearts before eloping in 1937 at the age 18. The couple eloped because their parents thought the marriage between a wealthy man and a working-class woman would never last. Last September they celebrated their 75th anniversary. Their eldest son Les Jr told the Long Beach Press-Telegram: 'It was a real love match, wasn't it. They were together every day for 75 years.' Their youngest son Daniel also told the newspaper: 'My mom often said she didn't want to see my father die, and he didn't want to live without her.' The couple moved to Long Beach in 1963. Mr Brown pursued a career as a photographer while Mrs Brown sold real estate. There will be a joint memorial service for the soul-mates on Saturday. Teenage dreams: Helen and Les met in high school and eloped after their parents disapproved of them getting married.

"American hospitals have increased Ebola training sessions as health workers are placed on high alert for potential cases of the deadly virus in the U.S. At the University of Chicago Hospital on Monday, doctors practiced pulling on bulky white suits and helmets that make them look more like astronauts than doctors preparing to fight a deadly disease. However training sessions on Ebola preparedness for U.S. medics and health workers heading to Africa can make the reality sink in - learning how to safely put on and take off the medical armor is crucial. 'When you're in the real deal, remember to take your time,' biosafety expert John Bivona told doctors during a course this week in Chicago. Suits splashed with patients' vomit or blood must be removed carefully, he explained. Scroll down for video . Dr. Michael O'Connor, left, and Dr Mark Nunnally, learn how to use personal protective gear during Ebola preparedness training at the University of Chicago on Monday. U.S. hospitals are preparing for possible Ebola patients; the only one diagnosed so far in this country is being treated in Texas, while the outbreak in Africa has killed more than 3,400 people. Sharon Roy, of the CDC, left, and licensed clinician Dennis Salter, right, deliver simulation contaminated bags to a biohazard bin on Monday in  Alabama. The CDC has developed an introductory training course to make sure doctors who may provide medical care to patients with Ebola have sufficient knowledge of the disease . 'As much as possible, grab from the inside' to avoid touching contaminated parts of the suits, he said. 'Be liberal with disinfectant.' Looking stoic after this week's training, Dr Mark Nunnally said he's 'not overly worried, but I think there's a legitimate concern' that someone with Ebola may arrive at the hospital's door. An anesthesiologist, he's among about 35 doctors and nurses who've volunteered to treat any Ebola patients who may show up at the Chicago hospital. Nunnally said he volunteered because 'somebody has to do it, and I think it's important to give care where there's a need'. The University of Chicago medical staffers get several hours of Ebola training, plus refresher courses and videos in putting on and taking off protective gear. Meanwhile, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) this week started training volunteer health workers heading to Africa to help fight the epidemic. Dr. David Sugerman, an Emory University emergency room doctor heading soon to Sierra Leone, was among students in a CDC training session Monday in Anniston, Alabama. Sugerman, who also works for the CDC, said breaches in health workers' protective gear in West Africa have contributed to Ebola's spread. The CDC has increased Ebola training courses across the U.S. for doctors working in American hospitals and those who will soon be traveling to West Africa . 'You realize going through these exercises how easy that is,' he said. 'In Sierra Leone or Liberia or Guinea it's going to be quite hot and humid. And you start sweating. And some of the procedures, like placing an IV, you get pretty nervous with a patient that you know has a high viral load,' he said. 'Then you get fogged up and you get anxious and you could start pulling at your' equipment, which could be contaminated with virus. 'So you have to mentally go through this a number of times and become well-versed. So it becomes a routine.' For U.S. hospitals, the CDC has issued guidance on how to spot suspicious cases and isolate them if necessary, with an emphasis on the importance of asking patients about recent travel to the outbreak region, where more than 3,400 people have died from the disease. The lone Ebola patient diagnosed in the United States had traveled from Liberia but was treated and released the first time he sought care. At first, the Dallas hospital he went to said it didn't know about his travel; it later said that information was provided and available to the medical staff caring for him. 'It's so easy to forget to ask about travel,' said Dr. Emily Landon, director of a University of Chicago infection control program. 'That's our one vulnerability.' Dr Mark Abe, left, and Dr Neethi Pinto learn how to perform a medical procedure on a patient mannequin while wearing protective gear during Ebola preparedness training at the University of Chicago on Monday . Emergency room staffers are trained to focus on the most critical problem, like providing fast treatment for a heart attack or broken leg, she explained. If the same patient also has a fever and headache - common problems but also Ebola symptoms - 'it's hard to break that autopilot and say, ''Oh, by the way, did you travel recently?'', Landon said. 'We have to get them to break that autopilot every time.' Across town, at Rush University Medical Center, doctors got a frightening test run this past weekend when a man coughing up blood said he had been in contact with someone from Nigeria, one of the countries in West Africa where Ebola spread. ER staffers donned protective gear and immediately escorted him to a nearby isolation room, but tests showed he had bronchitis, not Ebola, said Dr. Dino Rumoro, Rush's emergency medicine chief. Rumoro said he's worked through similar scary disease threats - AIDS, SARS, swine flu and smallpox after 9/11 - that were in some ways more worrisome because they can spread invisibly through the air. Ebola is transmitted through direct contact with blood, vomit and other body fluids, or contact with needles, syringes or other objects contaminated by the virus. 'At least with Ebola we have a fighting chance,' Rumoro said, 'because I know that it is coming from body fluid and I know if I wear my (protective) suit I'm safe and I know if I don't stick myself with a needle or cut myself with a scalpel I'm safe.' 'There's always going to be a little bit of fear in your head,' Rumoro said. 'But that's OK. That's what keeps us safe.'

"A besotted nurse tricked a man into thinking he had fathered a baby with her during a one-night stand. Charmaine Wilson, 25, forged a birth certificate and faked a DNA test to convince Liam Griffiths of her deception in a ‘lie that snowballed out of control’. Mr Griffiths, 31 was taken in by the lie and grew to love the boy he believed he had fathered her child during the one-off drunken encounter. Charmaine Wilson said the lies 'snowballed out of control' and that she 'did not know how to stop it' He was even planning to build a home in his parents’ garden to support Wilson and the baby. In fact, the two-year-old toddler belonged to one of Wilson’s friends – who also had no idea what she had been up to. Mr Griffiths told the Daily Mirror: ‘The only word I can use to describe Charmaine and what she has done is mental and I cannot believe she would deceive me in this way.’ Wilson has now been jailed for four months after admitting two counts of fraud. Web of lies: The nurse even convinced Mr Griffiths' parents that the toddler was their grandchild . The pack of lies – which went on for six months between December and May - were only exposed when a friend of Mr Griffiths, who knew the boy’s real parents, saw a photograph of the child with him on Facebook. Mr Griffiths said: ‘I am devastated and heartbroken to have lost a child that I thought was my son and had bonded with this child. ‘We fell in love with him from the start and I am heartbroken to have lost him.’ Wilson, from Bridgend, south Wales, abused her position as a nurse at The Princess of Wales Hospital to forge documents when Mr Griffith raised doubts he was the dad. She even convinced his parents the toddler was their grandchild and the family showered her with gifts – including a car to help her get to and from work. Wilson, from Bridgend, south Wales, has been suspended by The Princess of Wales Hospital . Wilson, who has also been suspended by The Princess of Wales Hospital, was sentenced at Bridgend Magistrates’ Court yesterday. The court heard how she met her victim on a night out in 2012 and they had sex after sharing a taxi home. But Mr Griffiths did not want to see her again after the one-night-stand. Yet Wilson became obsessed and first lied to him that she had become pregnant but had had an abortion. She stalked him on social media until he blocked her and he even had to change his telephone number. But they did not meet again until Mr Griffiths was at The Princess of Wales Hospital last year to visit his dying grandfather. Wilson took the baby to him and announced it was his. Mr Griffiths’ mum Catherine Thomas, 54, said: ‘I cannot think of words to say about how awful it is that a human being could deceive another in this way and cause the hurt and upset it has done to our family. Wilson was jailed for four months after admitting two counts of fraud at Bridgend Magistrates' Court (pictured) ‘We have spent an awful lot of money in accepting that he was our flesh and blood and this was given in good faith in us believing he was our grandson.’ She added: ‘I also think Wilson got lucky with her sentence if you ask me but at least she cannot hurt anyone where she is going, we all have a lot of healing to do.’ Steven Jones, defending Wilson in court, said she had told police she could not control the lies. She told officers: ‘It was a lie that snowballed out of control and I did not know how to stop it.’ Wilson was also given a restraining order preventing her from approaching Liam Griffiths or his family in future.","Charmaine Wilson, 25, tricked Liam Griffiths into thinking the baby was his .

"A two-year-old girl is fighting for her life in an artificial coma  after her father threw her into a scalding hot shower to 'discipline her', leaving the toddler with  organ failure. Father Alexander Sztasek, 26, initially claimed he did not realise the water was so hot when he placed his daughter Leonie under the shower at their home in Vienna, Austria. He also said that he did not know she had been burned until the blisters started appearing hours later, according to local media. Two-year-old Leonie Suvic (not pictured) suffered organ failure after she was thrown in hot shower . But when questioned by police he admitted he had put the toddler in the shower to 'discipline her' and said he had also done this with freezing cold water in the past. Medics said due to the severity of the burns the man would have realised what had happened. The father also admitted that he did not immediately take the child to hospital and instead left her crying  for a day before finally deciding to take her for treatment. She was put in the intensive care ward at the Vienna Sozialmedizinisches Zentrum hospital because of the severity of the burns on her back. She was put in the intensive care ward at the Vienna Sozialmedizinisches Zentrum hospital because of the severity of the burns on her back . The extent of the child's injuries prompted medics to raise the alarm and alert social services. An SMZ Ost hospital spokesman said: 'The condition of the little girl has worsened dramatically. She is now fighting for her life. 'She is suffering from severe necrosis which is a consequence of the severe burns on her back. 'A substantial portion of the skin has been quite simply destroyed and as a result it appears that her organs are also failing together with the skin.' The father was  released on police bail on the condition he did not return to the family home or have any contact with his wife and two other children while the investigation continues. His two young sons have been left with the 25-year-old mother Romana Suvic after an examination showed that neither appeared to have any signs of abuse. Social worker Herta Staffa said: 'They are not seen to be at risk in her care. We will remain in contact with the mother to see whether she could imagine living with her partner again and to put in place a support network if he does return to the family.' The family was  previously investigated by the youth welfare office in 2012, but according to Ms Staffa, everything was found to be adequate.

The man has admitted eating endangered gopher tortoises for a snack, and he was apparently found with a container with 11 more creatures that were alive . Officer Tom Reid told ABC Action News that the find was highly suspicious. He said: ‘I don’t think anybody would hide tortoises out in the woods if they thought they weren’t doing anything wrong.’ A man driving a truck then turned up and began placing the tortoises belly-up in the back, so that they couldn’t escape.

"A seven-year autumn has begun on the south pole of Saturn's largest moon, scientists believe. An ice cloud made from an unknown material taking shape over Titan’s south pole has led experts to deem that an important pattern of global air circulation on the moon has reversed direction. The same type of cloud has been hanging over Titan's north pole, but it is now fading and spring has arrived there, according to observations made by an infrared spectrometer on NASA's Cassini craft. Vortext: An ice cloud made from an unknown material taking shape over Titan's south pole has led experts to deem that an important pattern of global air circulation on the moon has reversed direction . ‘We associate this particular kind of ice cloud with winter weather on Titan, and this is the first time we have detected it anywhere but the north pole,’ NASA spokesman Donald Jennings said. Cassini first observed the circulation pattern when warm air from the south was rising high in the atmosphere and getting transported to the cold north, where it cooled down and formed ice clouds. Experts had long expected a reversal of this circulation when Titan's north pole began to get hotter and its south pole started to cool down. The official transition in the north happened in August 2009. But with each season on the moon lasting around seven-and-a-half earth years, researchers were still unsure when the reversal would happen and how long it would take. Montage: This image shows Dione in the forefront, Saturn rising behind, Tethys and Mimas fading in the distance to the right, Enceladus and Rhea off Saturn's rings to the left, and Titan in its distant orbit at the top . However the first signs of a reversal appeared in data early last year, which showed the southern autumn was beginning and a swirling polar vortex could be seen at the south pole. Despite this new activity the southern ice cloud was yet to appear, but it was eventually spotted in July 2012, according to a study published in Astrophysical Journal Letters in December last year. 'We associate this particular kind of ice cloud with winter weather on Titan, and this is the first time we have detected it anywhere but the north pole' NASA spokesman Donald Jennings . Cassini participating scientist Carrie Anderson said: ‘This lag makes sense, because first the new circulation pattern has to bring loads and loads of gases to the south pole. 'Then the air has to sink. The ices have to condense. And the pole has to be under enough shadow to protect the vapors that condense to form those ices.’ F. Michael Flasar of NASA added: ‘What's happening at Titan's poles has some analogy to Earth and to our ozone holes. And on Earth, the ices in the high polar clouds aren't just window dressing. ‘They play a role in releasing the chlorine that destroys ozone. How this affects Titan chemistry is still unknown. So it's important to learn as much as we can about this phenomenon, wherever we find it.’","Ice cloud from unknown material taking shape over Titan's south pole .

"Veteran BBC broadcaster Paul Gambaccini last night admitted he is the latest celebrity to be arrested by detectives investigating the Jimmy Savile scandal. The 64-year-old radio and TV presenter – who last year described Savile as ‘not all good, not all bad’ – broke his silence three days after he was held on suspicion of sexual offences by officers working on Scotland Yard’s Operation Yewtree. He issued a statement denying the ‘historic’ allegations of sexual abuse after frenzied speculation about the identity of the high-profile suspect arrested earlier this week. The awards came two days after it was revealed broadcaster Paul Gambaccini, pictured, had been arrested on suspicion of sexual offences under Operation Yewtree. He issued a statement denying the 'historic' allegations . Both the BBC and Scotland Yard had . repeatedly refused to confirm that Gambaccini had been detained at his . home in the South Bank area of London early on Tuesday. Gambaccini . said last night: ‘On Monday night, 28 October, I attended an excellent . production of the Kander and Ebb  musical, the Scottsboro Boys, at the . Young Vic theatre. ‘It . concerned a group of black men in Alabama in the 1930s who were falsely . accused of sexual offences. Within hours, I was arrested by Operation . Yewtree. Nothing had changed, except this time there was no music.’ A . spokesman for the gay presenter said: ‘Mr Gambaccini was interviewed by . Operation Yewtree officers about historic allegations. He answered . their questions and was co-operative. He denied all allegations.’ Paul Gambaccini was questioned by detectives for several hours before being released late on Tuesday . The . star’s regular show due to air at 8pm tonight on Radio 2 was last night . hurriedly cancelled, and replaced by a repeat of ‘Johnnie Walker Meets . Art Garfunkel’. A BBC . spokesperson said: ‘Paul Gambaccini has decided that, in light of . today’s media attention, he would rather not be on-air at present and we . respect that decision. ‘Therefore, . Paul will not be presenting on BBC Radio in [the] coming weeks and . replacement programmes for the period will be announced soon.’ Operation . Yewtree is the national investigation prompted after claims were made . against disgraced TV presenter Jimmy Savile. Scotland Yard has led the . probe, and separated its inquiries into those involving Savile, those . involving Savile and others, and those involving others. Paul Gambaccini, pictured in 1980 boxing with a kangaroo at Eastbourne circus, has had a long and varied career . Detectives . did not disclose details of the allegations facing Gambaccini. But it . indicated in a statement that he is not suspected of committing offences . with paedophile Savile. Radio . 2 DJ Gambaccini, dubbed the ‘Professor of Pop’ because of his extensive . knowledge of music, was questioned by detectives for several hours . before being released late on Tuesday. Following . his arrest, the normally media-friendly DJ was holed up at his . £1.3million penthouse flat near Waterloo Bridge for three days, . declining to return calls or reply to email requests for a statement . from journalists. The BBC initially referred all questions about his arrest to Scotland Yard, saying it ‘would not be commenting on speculation’. Gambaccini’s . silence was in sharp contrast to when the Savile scandal erupted last . autumn. Then, the popular pundit happily gave a series of interviews . about the disgraced Jim’ll Fix It star. Paul Gambaccini, seen with David Hamilton & Mike Read on Top Of The Pops, was dubbed the 'Professor of Pop' because of his encyclopaedic knowledge of music . Oxford-educated . Gambaccini, who has been at the BBC for 40 years, was criticised when . he revealed he knew about sexual abuse by Savile but failed to report . it. At the time, he said: . ‘So what, I a junior DJ am supposed to get up there and say my senior is . a perv? They are going to laugh at me. It never occurred to me.’ He . added: ‘Jimmy Savile had an imperial personality in showbusiness. You . just didn’t mess with Jim – you let him have his turf.’ Gambaccini . was the 15th suspect to be arrested under Operation Yewtree. Police . confirmed another man, aged 74, was arrested as part of the . investigation. His identity was not clear last night. Both men have been bailed to a date in early January. He was nicknamed ‘Professor of Pop’ thanks to his encyclopaedic knowledge of music. And Paul Gambaccini has become a major figure at  the BBC despite, according  to him, homophobic discrimination. Earlier this year the American claimed in a newspaper interview that his personnel file at the corporation was marked with a drawing of a Christmas tree to indicate he was ‘as camp as Christmas’.

From left to right, DJs Peter Powell, Jimmy Savile, Travis, Edmonds, Paul Gambaccini, Simon Bates, David 'Kid' Jenson, Tony Blackburn are there to mark his departure. Gambaccini is now a Radio 2 DJ . He said managers feared he would be a ‘security risk’ because of his sexuality. Born in New York, he gained British citizenship in 2005, and now has dual US-British nationality. He began his career at the BBC in 1973 as a reporter on John Peel’s Radio 1 show, Rockspeak.Gambaccini went on to be a Radio 1 presenter for 16 years and hosts Radio 4 music quiz Counterpoint. He has been a film critic  on breakfast TV, presented on Classic FM and written 15 books. Alongside his work in music radio, he has contributed regularly to BBC Radio 4’s long-running arts programme Kaleidoscope. Gambaccini’s long career in broadcasting was recognised when he was inducted into the Radio Academy Hall of Fame in 2005. The presenter entered into a civil partnership with his actor and model boyfriend Christopher Sherwood last year. Gambaccini was renowned for his broad knowledge of rock history. But he was also unusually well educated for a pop DJ, having read Politics, Philosophy and Economics at Oxford University, as well as studying at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire, in the US. He was spotted by the BBC in the 1970s when he was working as Rolling Stone music magazine’s UK correspondent and produced an impressive interview with Elton John. Gambaccini has said that his proudest achievements are the length of his career, and having co-hosted Live Aid. Aside from his love of music, the presenter is also a comic book fan and once co-owned a shop, Top 10 Comics, with fellow presenter Jonathan Ross. It is now closed.

"After private attempts by Bobbi Kristina’s boyfriend Nick Gordon to visit her in hospital have been stonewalled by Bobby Brown and the Houston family, he has taken the desperate step of issuing a public plea through his lawyer. In a statement released on Wednesday, Gordon’s lawyer Randall Kessler said his client ‘desperately wants to be with the one he loves.’ Gordon's efforts to see Bobbi Kristina have been blocked by the family claims Kessler, with relatives of Bobby Brown threatening to lay ‘hands on him’ if he shows up. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Sole visit: Nick Gordon at the hospital where Bobbi Kristina was initially treated. He has made a desperate plea to be allowed to see her after being banned by her family . Kessler said, ‘[Nick] has respected the family's wishes and for that reason alone has not returned to the hospital and risked a public confrontation… He continues to hope that his request will be granted.' Gordon reportedly made an attempt to visit his girlfriend after she had been first hospitalized earlier this month, but instead he got into a physical confrontation with her relatives. He sent a defiant message to Bobby Brown and the Houston family just days ago when he had the ailing heiress's name tattooed across his arm in huge letters. He posted the picture on his Facebook page after being barred from visiting her bedside. His frustration was revealed by Daily Mail.com last week when it was disclosed he had told friends of his intense love for her and his hope that she would recover and clear his name which is at the center of a police investigation. Some members of the Houston family have said they expect him to be charged in connection with her hospitalization. Couple: Bobbi Kristina with Nick Gordon in 2012. She said she had married him although, after her drowning, that was denied by her father. They had been brought up together since he was taken in by Whitney Houston . Show of commitment: Nick Gordon has posted this picture of an apparently new tattoo . Gordon's decision to have her name etched onto his left arm is the clearest sign yet that he intends to fight for her if she recovers. But it comes at the same time as a picture of Bobbi Kristina's 'husband' is at the center of an increasingly dirty war between him and her father. The image was published this weekend on a website devoted to portraying Nick Gordon as a danger to 21-year-old Bobbi Kristina. The website called 'Is Nick Gordon Guilty in what happened with Bobbi Kristina?' also claims the critically-ill daughter of Brown and the late Whitney Houston was about to split up with Gordon. It features details of bitter rows between Gordon, 25, and Bobbi Kristina who has been unconscious and on life support since January 31 after being found face down in her bathtub. But it is the picture of Gordon holding a gun while driving behind the wheel of a car which is certain to fuel Bobby Brown's determination to keep him away from his daughter. Other side: This image from 2012 has surfaced also showing Nick Gordon with a gun. It had been deleted and published on Straightfromthea.com - then reproduced this weekend on an anti-Gordon website . Menace: Another picture from Nick Gordon's social media which is being highlighted by the website which suggests he represented a danger to her . It was first apparently tweeted by Gordon himself in 2012 and then deleted. The Atlanta website 'Straight from the A' published it at the time and claimed it had increased fears for Bobbi Kristina's safety over her relationship with him. But this weekend it was republished on the anti-Gordon website. It is certain to inflame anger against Gordon, who was brought up by Whitney Houston from the age of 12 and became Kristina's boyfriend. He has been accused of abusing the kindness of the Houston family and threatening Bobbi Kristina's matrnal aunt, Marion Houston. She has successfully sought an order of protection against Gordon, accusing him of stalking her and sending her threatening messages, which reportedly included photos of guns. The restraining order expires in April. Gordon is also at the center of a police investigation into how his girlfriend, who he claims to have married, came to have facial bruising at the time of her near drowning. Abusive: This was the letter Bobbi Kristina and Nick Gordon sent to a neighbor after they were thrown out of their apartment in a well-off part of Atlanta for 'partying and fighting' Gun image: Another picture from Nick Gordon's Twitter feed showing his interest in guns . The wedding claim has been denied by Bobby Brown who is said to be 'praying hard and singing hymns' at his daughter's bedside in a bid to aid her recovery. Gordon is also persona non grata with the Houston family who, with her father,have banned him from visiting Kristina, whose organs are said to be failing. Friends of Kristina accuse Gordon of being a bad influence on her and leading her into trouble with rumors of drug abuse. The couple were thrown out of their luxury apartment at Amli North Point after complaints by residents of their 'fighting and partying'. One neighbor told Daily Mail.com: 'They were a couple of spoilt brats and the police were called several times to attend their home. 'Most of us thought Kristina was a young and impressionable young woman who hung on her boyfriend's every word. 'When they were finally kicked out,they wrote an insulting letter to the couple they thought had been most behind getting rid of them. But we were all relieved to see them go. They were a nuisance and their letter proved that.' Division: Bob Brown, pictured at the weekend after visiting his daughter, has issued a public denial that Nick Gordon was married to his daughter . Gordon has denied harming Bobbi Kristina and told a friend: 'I didn't do anything to my baby. 'I just hope she wakes up and tells 'em what they all need to know. 'People are just jumping on my back cos she loves me. There's a load of nonsense being said about us. I love her, but I can't get anywhere near her.' But senior members of the Houston family claim Gordon is a bad influence on a vulnerable and motherless young woman, who stands to inherit $12 million from her mother's estate when she turns 30 . A third person, Bobbi Kristina's cousin Jerod, has also been dragged into the fallout of the recriminations against Gordon with Bobby Brown marginalizing him and urging people to 'disregard' him. Jerod, a musician who gave TV interviews and spoke up on behalf of Gordon, was left reeling by Bobby Brown's public statement against him . In a Facebook posting at the weekend he pleaded: ' How about you all reach out to every staton I ever did an interview with. 'Ask how much I got for any interview….$000,000.' He added: 'My reward is seeing Bobbi Kristina walk out of that hospital. Thanks for those who continue to pray for Kristina. I LOVE YOU COUSIN.'","Nick Gordon has made a public plea to Bobby Brown and the Houston family in a desperate bid to see Bobbi Kristina .

"A Swedish artist has proved his art is as good as a photo after he managed to get away with using his self-portrait on his drivers licence. Fredrik Säker painted his self-portrait, took a photo of it and sent it to the local authorities when the time came to renew his licence. The 29-year-old tricked staff at the Swedish Transport Agency when he sent in the photo of the painting and it was given the official seal of approval. Artist's impression: Fredrik Saker used this self-portrait when it was time for him to renew his driving licence . ‘I purposely chose a bad picture. It . felt more realistic, I don’t know anyone who holds up their drivers . licence and says “look what a nice picture”,’ the artist told newspaper Dagens Nyheter. Mr Säker says he had faith in his stunt, but was pleased when he was able to pick up his new drivers licence. ‘I . thought it would go through, that’s how happy I was with the original . painting. But you never know and I was a bit nervous whilst I waited. 'But at the same time it was a photo and I though it fulfilled all their . criterias.'

After the licence was issued Swedish . newspaper Dagens Nyheter contacted the STA who were stunned to find that . they had been conned. Final result: Mr Saker's driving licence which used a photograph of his self-portrait good enough to fool authorities into thinking it was a picture . Although . they say would ‘definitely not recommend’ the public using photographed . portraits, they said they have no issues with Mr Säker’s licence and . defend the approval saying they had no reason to believe the photo was a . portrait. ‘I can imagine you would be able to spot defects on a larger image. The details are impossible to see on such a small picture, said STA spokesperson Peter Ranki. Mr Säker added: ‘This picture is a milestone. It's a sign that my painting is getting better.' Despite the STA’s comments Mr Säker has not been deterred from his latest project which involves painting ten portraits of Swedes looking to renew their licence.","Artist painted a self-portrait, took a picture of it and sent it in for his licence .

"Ricky Burns hopes his move up to the light-welterweight division can breathe fresh life into his career after back-to-back defeats. The Scot will make his debut at the 10st weight limit on Saturday night at the Leeds Arena against Alexandre Lepelley, who is a late replacement for Esteban Gonzalez.

He then lost his WBO lightweight crown to Terence Crawford and any hopes of another world title tilt were dealt a blow when he was outpointed by unbeaten Montenegrin Dejan Zlaticanin. While there were calls for him to end his career, Burns said he felt drained attempting to boil down to 135lbs and that moving up to the next weight division could be a huge boost. 'The Zlaticanin fight was a more crushing defeat than actually losing my world title,' said Burns, who has also won a world title in the super-featherweight division. 'I should have been punching holes in him. When I look back at it, I was really, really struggling to get the weight off, it just wasn't budging and it did affect my performance.

"Calls for more racially diverse emojis – cartoon-like pictograms used in text messages and apps - have been going on for over a year. And now the Unicode Consortium, which sets the standards for emojis, is considering adding five new skin colours to its library of icons. Users will be able to choose an emoji's skin colour that best reflects their own at the touch of a smartphone button, if the plans go ahead.

The default emoji face was designed to be generic, but is Caucasian, rather than an unrealistic shade such as bright yellow, leading people, including Miley Cyrus, to call for changes to better reflect global diversity. The proposal is still under review but could lead to changes for millions of users as many operating systems are based on Unicode standards. 'People all over the world want to have emoji that reflect more human diversity, especially for skin tone,' according to the organisation's report. A proposal to expand the skin color options for emojis (pictuerd) may get the thumbs up from those calling for more diversity in the icons. The default emoji face was designed to be generic, but is Caucasian, rather than an unrealistic shade such as bright yellow . A study in April found that the top trending word of the year, so far, is emoji. Emojis are the small digital images used to express an idea or emotion in electronic communication - which are continuing to spread like wildfire online. The words and phrases were plucked from among millions used online in social media, blogs and global media. Other terms to make the list include 'futebol’, and 'ghost plane' - relating to the missing Malaysia Airlines plane. The proposed update reveals that users will be able to press and hold a button down on their smartphone to choose an emoji’s skin colour. It says: ‘Unicode Version 8.0 is adding five symbol modifier characters that provide for a range of skin tones for human emoji. ‘These characters are based on the six tones of the Fitzpatrick scale, a recognised standard for dermatology. The exact shades may vary between implementations.’ If the proposal goes through, people who can’t see colour on their screens, will be able to see the intended colour of an emoji.

The Coatbridge fighter has failed to win any of his last three fights at 135lbs - including the loss to American Terence Crawford in March which cost him his WBO world lightweight title. He was also involved in a controversial draw with Raymundo Beltran 12 months ago but Burns admits it was his split decision loss to Dejan Zlaticanin in June which convinced him it was time to move up a division. Ricky Burns will move up to light welterweight for his next bout against Leonardo Esteban Gonzalez . Now the former two-weight world champion will set about resurrecting his career against Gonzalez, 32, over 10 rounds at the First Direct Arena in Leeds on October 4. Burns claimed his first world crown four years ago when he beat Roman Martinez to win the WBO Super Featherweight title and the 31-year-old believes he can bring back those glory days up after moving up to 140lbs. Burns (left) has failed to win his last three bouts - including a defeat to Terrence Crwaford (right) in March . 'I believe that the move up in weight will really benefit me,' said Burns, 'The Lightweight limit was proving tougher to make in my last few fights so that's now behind me and I can concentrate on working on my boxing in the gym with Tony Sims. 'It has been a tough year following the Raymundo Beltran fight but I'm feeling great in the gym and the fire and desire is still there to achieve big things. 'I'm looking to show in Leeds that I've still got the goods to challenge for major belts and ultimately, win another world title.'

"One cold night in February 1949 a supper party was held in Erith, Kent, to introduce the newly-selected Conservative party candidate for Dartford to some of the local bourgeoisie. The Tory candidate was the soft-cheeked, hawk-nosed Margaret Roberts. Perfect political spouse: Sir Denis and Baroness Thatcher in 2003 a few months before Denis passed away . Among the guests was the managing director of the Atlas Preservative Company, which had diversified out of weedkiller and sheep-dip and was now making good money manufacturing paint. The man from Atlas, bespectacled, balding, rich and raffish, was the war hero, amateur rugby referee and divorcé Denis Thatcher. He had seen Miss Roberts in full flow at the selection meeting and he was impressed, in more than one way. So, it turned out, was she. They married in 1951, at Wesley’s Chapel in City Road, London. Denis, who would remain her steadfast, cheerful, shrewd companion until his death in June 2003, proved the perfect political husband. That is to say he had no political ambition of his own and managed never to cause her problems. At the end of each long, lonely day she served as Prime Minister he would hand her a whisky and offer a friendly ear to the wife he fondly addressed as ‘old girl’. ‘When I’m in a state,’ she said, ‘I have no one to turn to except Denis. He puts his arm round me and says “Darling, you sound just like Harold Wilson”. And then I always laugh.’ For more than half a century he was at Margaret’s side, from the day she entered Downing Street (photographs caught him standing, smart white hanky in his top pocket, in the doorway to No 10 while she gave her St Francis of Assisi spiel to the TV cameras) to the day she left in tears, Denis next to her in the back of the official Daimler. When Margaret flew to international summits, Denis would usually be somewhere in the background, bringing a touch of the Surrey golf club bar to whatever exotic destination they’d flown to. Snapshots normally caught him standing at a slight angle, snaggle teeth and spectacles reflecting the glare of the camera flashbulbs. Denis saw her through good (the election victories) and bad (the Brighton bomb — not to mention all those times when it seemed that the whole British political Establishment was plotting to unseat her). He was the constant element in a turbulent premiership, never complaining, frequently cheering her up with some pungent put-down of a hated rival. Oh, to know what he made of Geoffrey Howe! And oh, to have been a fly on the wall when he and that other remarkable consort, the Duke of Edinburgh, neither versed in political correctness, got together at Balmoral while their wives were seeing to matters of state. When they had first met in 1949, Denis was arguably a cut or two above his new wife in rank, having come into money. Long-lasting marriage: Denis and Margaret Thatcher on their wedding day in 1951 . The courtship was conducted at some of London’s better restaurants — the Ecu de France in Jermyn Street and the White Tower just north of Oxford Street. He drove her around town in a Jaguar. On Christmas Day 1949, he gave her an expensive present of a crystal powder bowl with a silver top. She treasured it for ever. Maybe Denis’s smartish background helped to stiffen Margaret’s resolve in 1981 when she stood up to the drawling, sneering snoots of her first Cabinet. Denis was not one to be browbeaten by hair-oiled humbugs from the old-boys’ club. He knew their type, not least from the rugby clubs, and he would have told Margaret firmly to remember that she was the boss. She duly sacked several of her Cabinet enemies, replacing them with truer believers in her politics of aspiration and merit. ‘For 40 years,’ he said in 1991, ‘I have been married to the greatest woman the world has ever produced. All I could produce — small as it may be — was love and loyalty.’ Denis brought normality, humour and non-negotiable love to her years in high office. He gave her financial stability and emotional resilience. He provided the domestic guy ropes without which her whole tent might have collapsed. And he did it with such humour. One of his favourite expressions, when describing some political character, was to say that so-and-so was ‘as much use as a one-legged man in an arse-kicking contest’. With such turns of phrase, he was able to shake his wife out of her darkest moods. ‘Better keep your mouth shut and be thought a fool rather than open it and remove all doubt,’ Denis reportedly said another time. He knew that as the husband of such a controversial figure he could cause her political trouble, and so he created for himself the image of a bumbling boozer. Supportive: Margaret Thatcher getting a kiss from Denis after she had come out on top in the first round of the election for the Conservative party leadership . Margaret certainly never saw him as this chumpish caricature. You only have to read her account of the 1949 Denis — ‘he had a penchant for fast cars and he simply knew more about the world than I did’ — to see that she always looked up to him. It is sometimes said that sensible women look for a husband like their father. Margaret’s father had been the stalwart alderman Alfred Roberts, grocer and mayor of Grantham. Denis, being ten years older than Margaret and already experienced in the world (with all that entailed), was certainly a father figure in some ways. And was there not something selflessly parental in the way he devoted himself to her during those years of astonishing political service? Presented with the question ‘who wears the trousers in your marriage?’, Denis replied happily: ‘I do. I also wash them and iron them.’ His wife’s political duties came first. End of story. Asked what the role of a political spouse was, Denis replied that it was to be ‘always present, never there’. He perfectly understood the need for omnipresent discretion. Was Sir Denis disconsolate at having lost the keys to Downing Street? Was he heck. A reporter asked if he would miss being garlanded at the next Tory party conference. He practically exploded with laughter. ‘Thank goodness I don’t have to go to the bloody thing,’ he said. ‘I have a business to run. I still have to make a living.’ And when, at the age of 77, he received treatment for cancer, some ‘reptile’ (as he called members of the Press) approached him at Heathrow. How was Sir Denis proposing to recuperate, asked the newshound. Sir Denis lifted his bag of Duty Free purchases and replied: ‘Gin and cigarettes!’ Perhaps we can comfort ourselves that in Heaven last night, as Margaret Thatcher walked through St Peter’s pearly gates, she’ll have been met by a familiar, snaggle-toothed smile and a hug from her beloved husband with the words: ‘There you are, old girl. Whatever kept you? Now, how about a good, strong whisky?’","Her husband Denis was the constant element in a turbulent premiership .

Clarke Carlisle will return to radio on Saturday evening for the first time since his horror collision with a Lorry . Carlisle was released from hospital last month, six weeks after sustaining life-threatening injuries . Carlisle was released from hospital last month after sustaining life-threatening injuries in what the former Burnley defender has admitted was a failed suicide attempt. Carlisle has since told how he made the decision that he 'had to die' after being charged with a drink-driving offence, and later jumped into the path of an oncoming lorry. In an interview with the Sun last week, the former Professional Footballers' Association chairman revealed that he felt taking his own life would be 'the perfect answer' to a series of problems he was facing. The news that he was to lose his job as a pundit on ITV, three years after he was released by Burnley, caused Carlisle to go on a gambling spree and hours later he was charged with a drink-driving offence of failing to provide a sample.

The 35-year-old former footballer played for QPR (left) and Burnley (right) during his playing days . He told the Sun: 'I had to die. This wasn't escaping or running away.

"Norwegian wonderkid Martin Odegaard was handed his Real Madrid B competitive debut on Sunday, playing the last 20 minutes in their 2-2 draw with Athletic Bilbao's second string. Odegaard was wanted by a host of top European clubs including Manchester United and Bayern Munich, before eventually signing for Real, but could not prevent the B-team from dropping two valuable points in their promotion push from Spanish football's third division. The result, which came after Castilla had led 2-1, sees them sit second in the table, one point behind league leaders Real Union de Irun. Martin Odegaard has made his competitive debut for Real Madrid B against Athletic Bilbao's second string . He played 20 minutes in Castilla's 2-2 draw after replacing team-mate Alvaro Medran in the 70th minute . The 16-year-old joined Real Madrid from Norwegian side Stromsgodset for £2.3m last month . Prior to Sunday's outing, Odegaard had trained with Real Madrid's first-team and starred in a behind-closed doors friendly with Chinese outfit Beijing Guoan, contributing two assists in a 3-3 thriller. Odegaard's bow in a competitive fixture, was not quite as fruitful but still saw plenty of positives. The 16-year-old, on for Alvaro Medran in the 70th minute, did create chances, even if his team-mates were unable to convert them. Floating effortlessly between the central and wide positions, there were certainly signs to suggest that the Norwegian could go on to become a very important player for the Real Madrid senior squad in the future. For now, though, he will continue his development in the Castilla set-up, under the tutelage of head coach Zinedine Zidane, who himself was a world-class midfielder during his playing days.

"Jose Mourinho has declared his 'pride' at Chelsea's transfer business as he prepares to unveil Loic Remy as the 'perfect' addition to his attacking trio. Remy could make his debut against Swansea on Saturday after a £10.5million move from Queens Park Rangers, which was completed once Fernando Torres had joined AC Milan on loan for the final two years of his contract. The deal was the last step in Mourinho's overhaul of his strike options with Remy, Diego Costa and Didier Drogba replacing Torres, Demba Ba and Samuel Eto'o, who scored just 19 Barclays Premier League goals between them last season. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Jose Mourinho: Diego Costa has a chance against Swansea . Summer signing Loic Remy, pictured in training, could make his Chelsea debut against Swansea on Saturday . Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho, pictured on the touchline against Everton, is happy with his new-look attack . Fernando Torres was shipped out on loan to AC Milan to make space for Loic Remy in the Chelsea squad . 'Remy has just arrived and it is a new life for him,' said Mourinho. 'For Fernando, it would be the same life he'd had for previous years. His career here was not super successful but in important moments he was there many times and gave an important contribution to this club. 'We like him a lot but Remy was one of the players we had in our objectives. He was one of the players we were ready to try to get if a space opened. The club was ready to give us a striker we like and one perfect to be one of our three.' The Chelsea boss has no fears about Remy despite reports that he failed a medical at Liverpool. This triggered concerns about a heart condition, first noticed when he joined Marseille from Nice in 2010. 'We don't have Liverpool's report,' said Mourinho. 'In this club, medical responsibilities start with Dr (Paco) Biosca. He did his job, not on his own, surrounded by opinions from top specialists in different areas, and the conclusion was the same as France's medical department had before the World Cup, that the player has no problem.' After criticising his strikers last season, the Chelsea manager is pleased with the balance up front. 'We have a guy in Didier who is a penalty-box expert, the best of the three in the air,' he said. 'Remy is fast, attacks spaces and can play from the sides. Diego is a player we were chasing for a year because he is a player for the style we want. We changed three for three and we believe these three give us more.' Didier Drogba, pictured reacting to a missed chance at Burnley, has returned to Chelsea on a one-year deal .

'We did our job in a good way, something that is fundamental for us,' he said. 'It's not just a legal question. It's also a pride question and that's FFP. It is something Mr Abramovich is proud of. My club did it in a magnificent way with the income and the players we bought.' Costa, named on Friday as the Premier League's Player of the Month for August, is back in training after a hamstring injury picked up on international duty with Spain but may be given extra time to rest ahead of Wednesday's Champions League opener against Schalke.

'Last season some of them really deserved it and never got it and, this month, if it wasn't Diego or Fabregas or Matic, I would be more disappointed.

"Clarke Carlisle has admitted he threw himself in front of a lorry in an attempt to take his own life in December. Speaking for the first time since the incident that left him in hospital for six weeks, the 35-year-old former Premier League footballer and chairman of the PFA said he had been battling serious depression for 18 months. Sportsmail revealed that Carlisle had been critically injured when he was struck by a lorry near his home on the morning of December 22 on the A64, near York. The married father of two had to be airlifted to Leeds General Infirmary, with North Yorkshire Police confirming that an investigation was under way after a collision that ‘involved a male pedestrian and a lorry’. Clarke Carlisle was pictured for the first time since leaving hospital after a collision with a lorry . Carlisle finally returned home from hospital last Friday and, speaking to The Sun newspaper, said his life spiralled out of control after being told by ITV he was losing his £100,000-a-year Champions League pundit role. He says he went straight to a casino and blew in one night what money he and his wife had before, only hours later on December 20, being charged with drink-driving. ‘I had to die,’ he said. ‘This wasn’t escaping or running away. This was the perfect answer. It made everyone happy and it ticked every box.’ He said he had sat in the police cell and concluded that he could not let his children ‘have a criminal father’. He said he walked out of the police station having decided he ‘had to die’. Carlisle says he then vanished for 40 hours, sleeping rough while planning his suicide. Having found a spot on the A64, he then stepped over a barrier and jumped towards an oncoming lorry ‘like a shoulder charge’. Carlisle admitted in an interview with The Sun that he tried to kill himself by jumping in front of a lorry . He claims to have also contemplated drowning, falling under a bus, diving under a train; even hanging himself at York City, where he had once played. ‘Nothing could be left to chance,’ he said. At one stage he found himself standing on railway tracks staring at an oncoming train. ‘I thought, “That’s not going quick enough — you’re not going to die this way and it has to be definitive”. At the last second I threw myself out of the way.’ Only after that did he walk to the A64. ‘Throwing yourself in front of a truck is a very difficult thing to do,’ he said. ‘I saw the big truck. There was no rush. I walked up to the barrier, stepped over it casually. The lorry was about 20 yards away. ‘I thought “You’re the one”. I took two steps into the road and then jumped into the truck, like a full shoulder charge. I can remember that impact. Bang. Then lights out. I don’t know how long had passed.

"Pope Francis today baptised the child of an unmarried couple during a ceremony in the Sistine Chapel, in Rome. The unnamed parents and their child took part in the traditional Baptism Of The Lord mass with 31 others, commemorating the day St John baptised Jesus. The Pope has previously spoken out to encourage priests to baptise the children of unmarried women in order to pass on the Christian faith, calling those who refuse 'hypocrites'. Pope Francis today baptised the child of an unmarried couple (not pictured) during a ceremony in the Sistine Chapel in Rome . According to the Vatican Network, he said: 'You parents have the baby boy or girl to be baptised, but in a few years it will be they who will have a baby to be baptised, or a grandchild... And so goes the chain of faith. 'What does this mean? I would just tell you this: you are the ones that transmit the faith, the transmitters, you have a duty to pass on the faith to these children. It 's the most beautiful legacy that you leave to them: the faith.' Speaking in the relaxed manner that has become his trademark, Francis broke with the tradition of delivering a long and formal speech, instead reading a short script he had written himself. The Baptism of the Lord mass is a traditional feature of the Vatican calendar and marks the anniversary of St John the Baptist washing Jesus in the river of Jordan . During the mass Pope Francis baptised 32 children in the same room in which he was elected in March last year . The mass took place under the famous fresco painted by Michelangelo, the same room in which Francis was elected on March 13 as the first non-European pope in 1,600 years. In September the pontiff telephoned an Italian woman to tell her he would personally baptise her child after she became pregnant by a man who was already married. Shop worker Anna Romano, 35, was on holiday when she received the call from the Argentinian Pope. Pope Francis has previously spoken out to criticise priests who refuse to baptise the babies of unmarried women, calling them 'hypocrites' and emphasising the duty parents have to pass on faith to their children . At the time she said: 'I addressed the letter simply to Pope Francis, the Vatican and put it in the post. I didn't even send it recorded delivery. I didn't really expect to get a reply but then out of the blue when I was on holiday I had a phone call from him. 'The number was from Rome, with a 06 dial code, and as soon as he started speaking I recognised the voice as his. 'I was just so surprised that he had telephoned me. He said that he had read my letter and he wanted to speak to me personally about it and reassure me that someone was worried about me.","Pope Francis was conducting Baptism Of The Lord mass today .

"The last British man other than Andy Murray to win a Grand Slam singles match outside Wimbledon was to be found in Sheffield on Tuesday, playing at a humble Futures level event. Dan Evans reached the third round of the 2013 US Open and looked like making the top 100. The 24-year-old made his comeback this week after a lengthy lay-off with knee problems, but lost his first round match on Tuesday. Meanwhile, barring unexpected setbacks to her rehabilitation from wrist surgery, it looks increasingly likely that Laura Robson will start playing next month in some lower-tier events in America before returning to the main WTA Tour in March. Dan Evans is set to make his comeback in the Australian Open this week . The 24-year-old is making his a long-awaited return this week after a lengthy injury lay-off . These were the kind of scraps of consolation being looked for at Melbourne Park on Monday as the weekend feelgood factor for British tennis was quickly cut away like a broken racket string at the Australian Open. The relatively bumper representation of three players on the second day were all eliminated, although there was a strain of sorrow and misfortune running through their defeats. Heather Watson, coming in from her weekend triumph in Hobart, was unwell and resolved to discuss with the doctor the sporadic onset of viral-type symptoms. 2005: The last time Britain had two men in the second round of the Australian Open — Tim Henman and Greg Rusedski. Both were knocked out before the fourth round. James Ward gave a decent showing against Fernando Verdasco but could not win and is now flying home for the funeral of his grandmother, who passed away last week. Kyle Edmund had done well to qualify but against America’s world No 38 Steve Johnson he was overmatched and went out in straight sets. The results are a reminder that unearthing a critical mass of British players with international class remains an elusive thing. Australian Bob Brett, brought in to try to invigorate the Lawn Tennis Association’s hapless attempts at producing the necessary quality, is here but he will have known the task already. He might cast an envious eye on the situation of his home country, now coming up with a host of exciting prospects. Heather Watson lost in the first round of the Australian Open after feeling unwell . Watson was the only player facing lower-ranked opposition but went down 6-4, 6-0 to Bulgaria’s Tsvetana Pironkova, calling on the trainer and doctor when 2-5 down. She had felt unwell the previous day and talked of having sporadic viral-type symptoms. Her 2013 season was wrecked by glandular fever, although she stated that she did not feel it was related to that. ‘I have one or two days when I feel like this. 'I’m going to see the doctor but I think it’s just the way my body works,’ she said. ‘It’s very frustrating, especially as this is one of those times I want all my energy. It sucks.’ Watson still plans to play in the doubles event before heading home to prepare to represent Great Britain in the Fed Cup early next month in Hungary. After playing well for long spells in a 2-6, 6-0, 7-6, 6-3 defeat to a high-quality opponent in Verdasco Ward said he would be heading straight home to his family in Euston. Kyle Edmund was overpowered by Steve Johnson from the USA in the opening round . James Ward put in a good performance against Fernando Verdasco - but ultimately fell to defeat . ‘My grandmother passed away five days ago. I’ve lived with her a lot and it’s been tough as we are a close family. I am going home for the funeral next week, at the moment that is the priority,’ he said. ‘I don’t know what I will do (tennis-wise) the next couple of weeks.’ On the court he showed how much he has improved in areas such as his speed and court coverage, but the golden rule in beating players of Verdasco’s calibre is to take your chances when they come. He led 4-2 in the third set and had a set point at 6-5 in the tiebreak, before the Spaniard stepped it up. ‘He produced at the big moments,’ reflected Ward correctly. It is tempting to think that if the likes of Edmund, Ward, Liam Broady, Evans, Watson, Robson and Jo Konta were all fit and played to their potential (not to mention wannabe Brit Aljaz Bedene) then there might be the makings of a nucleus to support Murray. But it is a very big ‘if’ indeed.","Heather Watson, James Ward and Kyle Edmund all faltered at the first stage of the Australian Open .

"A quick search of Instagram reveals there are, on average, more than 11 million photos of rainbows on the image sharing site at any one time. But one airline passenger appears to have captured the impossible by taking a shot that looks as if it’s taken over a rainbow. Flying through, or above a rainbow, isn’t possible because it is optical trick caused by light reflected and refracted in water droplets - but the effect these images create are still stunning. The colourful shots (pictured) were taken by Melissa Rensen, 51, as she flew over the Caribbean Sea. But Ms Rensen, from London in Ontario, Canada said she didn’t realise she’s captured the kaleidoscope of colours until she viewed the images later in the day . The three shots were taken by Melissa Rensen, 51, as she flew over the Caribbean Sea. But Ms Rensen, from London in Ontario, Canada said she didn’t realise she’d captured the kaleidoscope of colours until she viewed the images later in the day. Ms Rensen was travelling from North America to Hounduras and spotted an interesting cloud formation below. ‘I was passing time on our long flight and looked out the window to see hundreds of these little cotton-like clouds,’ explained Ms Rensen. A rainbow forms when light is reflected and refracted in water droplets in the sky, or in other liquids or surfaces. They appear as multi-coloured arcs, and are caused when sunlight hits water droplets in a section of sky directly opposite the sun. In one of Ms Rensen’s images, the sun is seen behind the wing of the plane, opposite where the rainbow colours appear. Rainbows can be full circles, too, but people typically only seen them as arcs. Because they are formed by droplets above the ground, centred on a line from the sun to the viewer’s eye, this means they are visible from a distance. This perspective can change depending on where the viewer is stood. This means it is not possible to ‘fly through’ a rainbow. ‘I noticed how shadows were cast on the Caribbean Sea and thought it was such a beautiful scene I had to snap some shots. ‘When I saw the ""rainbow"" in the shot I was stunned - I'd never experienced anything like it and I doubt I ever will again. ‘Having not seen the rainbow with my naked eye, it wasn't until I reviewed the images later that I saw [it].’ ‘At first I thought maybe it was caused by jet fuel vapour, or perhaps from the polarised window on the plane, but then another photographer friend of mine pointed out that the [colours] were beneath the clouds. ‘All my uncertainty faded and I knew I'd captured something special.’ A rainbow forms when light is reflected and refracted in water droplets in the sky, or in other liquids or surfaces.

They are typically full circles, but only an arc is visible. The sun is shown behind the wing of Ms Rensen's flight (pictured) with the kaleidoscope of colours below . This means it is not possible to ‘fly through’ a rainbow. Photography expert Gary Bown from Portsmouth University told MailOnline that Ms Rensen’s images were  not a rainbow, and were caused by the polarisation of the airplane’s window. The light from the sky illuminates the landscape and travels through the window, at which point it is partially polarised. The extent of polarisation depends on the angle from the sun, and is greatest at 90°. Airplane windows additionally have at least one layer of thick plastic, explained Atmosphere Optics. A rainbow forms when light is reflected and refracted in water droplets in the sky. White light separates into different wavelengths, when they enter the drop, as red light is refracted by a lesser angle than blue. On leaving the drop, the red rays turn through a smaller angle than blue, producing a rainbow . The production process, or strains within the window, makes the plastic slightly anisotropic, meaning its properties differ in different directions. Optically, the window is what's known as birefringent or double refracting. Put simply, this means the window splits the light entering it into two rays, which are polarised and refracted at different angles. This causes the colours, or wavelengths, within the light to split.","Shots were taken by Melissa Rensen, 51, as she flew over the Caribbean Sea .

"Astronomers are developing a system to use reflected starlight to create maps of alien planets that show oceans, land and even clouds. Developed by planetary scientist Nicolas Cowan and presented this month at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Long Beach, California, it is inspired by a technique originally developed to distinguish between natural surfaces – such as forests – and unnatural ones like military bunkers in satellite images of Earth. The software can take a point of . reflected starlight from an exoplanet, and analyse it to extract the unique signals . required to form a rough map. Distant jewel: This EPOXI mission image shows what an Earth-like exoplanet might look like from afar . Because there is currently no telescope powerful enough to directly photograph a faraway rocky planet, Dr Cowan tested the software on images of Earth taken from a distant vantage point in space by Nasa's Deep Impact spacecraft as part of the EPOXI mission. 'The object of this experiment was to see whether we could identify the colours of surfaces on Earth, [and tell] how many major surfaces are there, and what they look like,' said Dr Cowan, who works at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. Dr Cowan's technique – called 'rotational unmixing' – analyses the changing colour of starlight reflecting off a distant, spinning exoplanet to calculate the mix of planetary features – such as land or ocean – that might combine to create a specific hue. The technique is similar to being in an otherwise dark room with a muted television and analysing the light reflected on the opposite wall to figure what is playing on the TV. 'You're not seeing the picture, but you're seeing the reflection of the picture and learning something about what's going on there,' said Eric Ford, an astronomer at the University of Florida in Gainesville, who was not involved in the study. When Dr Cowan's software was applied to EPOXI images of Earth, it was able to extract reflectance signatures corresponding to three major surface types. 'The analysis told us there were three important features,' Dr Cowan said, 'and their spectra look an awful lot like land, ocean, and clouds.' Artist's impression of the newly discovered planet orbiting Alpha Centauri B: In the future scientists could use special software to build maps of distant planets from the way they reflect the light of their stars . Moons like the one depicted in the film Avatar may be among the most common places to find alien life, scientists believe. Astronomers came to the conclusion after identifying up to 15 new planets orbiting the life-friendly 'habitable zones' of stars. All are giant gaseous worlds similar in size to Jupiter or Neptune. While such planets would not themselves be suitable for Earth-like life, they could be circled by moons on which there are forests, oceans and living creatures, researchers now believe. Pandora, the fictional moon in Avatar, is just such a world. So far only one of the 15 newly discovered objects has been confirmed as an exoplanet with 99.9% certainty. The rest still fall into the category of 'candidate' planets while further evidence is collected. The confirmed planet, known as PH2 b, orbits a sun-like star in the constellation Cygnus several hundred light years away. Astronomer Dr Chris Lintott, from Oxford University, a member of the international team behind the discovery, said: 'There's an obsession with finding Earth-like planets but what we are discovering with planets such as PH2 b is far stranger. 'Jupiter has several large water-rich moons. Imaging dragging that system into the comfortably warm region where the Earth is. 'If such a planet had Earth-size moons, we'd see not Europa and Callisto but worlds with rivers, lakes and all sorts of habitats: a surprising scenario that might just be common. 'It may be that the most common habitable worlds are moons around Jupiter and Neptune-size planets rather than rocky planets as in our own solar system.' Lisa Kaltenegger, an exoplanet . researcher at the Max-Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg, . Germany, said Dr Cowan's technique was very interesting – but with a few . caveats. For example, the . exoplanet must have highly contrasting surfaces, such as ocean and land, . or ocean and clouds, for this technique to work well. 'If you have an ocean planet or a planet that is all land, it would be very challenging because you don't have different surfaces,' said Dr Kaltenegger, who also did not participate in the study. Another challenge would be distinguishing between clouds and ice on a planet's surface, according to Aomawa Shields, an astrobiologist at the University of Washington in Seattle who was not involved in the study. 'Being able to tell whether a planet is simply undergoing significant cloud cover, or is in the midst of a global glaciation is important from the standpoint of habitability,' Ms Shields said. If the right planet could be found, however, the rotational unmixing technique could give astronomers a rough idea of the ocean-to-land ratio of an exoplanet, or provide a sense of what the climate is like by analysing cloud cover and cloud movement. The resulting picture would not be a map in the traditional sense.  'It's not like a map that you can use to land a spacecraft on a planet ... but it's better than nothing,' Dr Cowan said. Before astronomers can apply the technique to a real exoplanet, they will first need a telescope with a lens that is not only big enough to resolve the pinprick of reflected light from a distant world, but powerful enough to extract meaningful data from short-period observations lasting only hours – the time it takes for an Earth-like planet to make a complete turn. 'You need a next-gen telescope,' Dr Cowan said. 'We're talking like early 2020s realistically.' The task could be simplified if a target exoplanet rotated slower than Earth, or if it was located relatively close to us, so that it appeared bigger than it would otherwise. Fortunately, recent discoveries by Nasa's Kepler mission suggest the galaxy is teeming with planets. Astronomers estimate the Milky Way contains at least 100billion planets, and that at least one-in-17 sunlike stars have Earth-sized, rocky worlds circling around them. 'The good news is it's not like we're going to have to look halfway across the galaxy to find some cool planets to study,' Dr Ford said.","New software inspired by technique used to spot hidden military bunkers in satellite photos of Earth .

"Federal Treasurer Joe Hockey declared the 'age of entitlement is over' while slashing family payments and medical benefits in the Federal Budget on Tuesday. But less than a week later it has been revealed he submitted an expenses claim for $50,000 after hiring a celebrity chef to cater an event in Washington D.C. where he wined and dined G20 executives. Chef Shane Delia's services were paid for with Australian taxpayer dollars at the April 10 event, where up to 60 finance ministers and central bank governors from G20 nations sat down to a top-shelf menu of barramundi, Victorian Wagyu beef and WA truffles, the Sunday Telegraph reported. The Treasury department even paid for Mr Delia to fly business class and covered the cost of transporting truffles from Australia to Washington D.C. A 'eucalyptus ice' dessert was also served at the event. Scroll down for video . A spokesman for Federal Treasurer Joe Hockey, pictured here delivering his first budget in Parliament on Tuesday, described the $50,000 dinner as 'excellent value for money' But Mr Hockey denies the $50,000 tender to 'provide professional chef for Washington event' was a slap in the face to taxpayers, with a spokesman from his office saying the event proved to be 'excellent value for money'. 'Shane Delia was engaged by the Treasury to deliver a working dinner for the finance ministers and central bank governors at the April Washington G20 meeting,' the spokesman told the newspaper. 'His contract included costs of the dinner, travel to Washington and accommodation. 'We believe Shane's involvement in the Washington meeting provided excellent value for money, given he created a long-lasting impression in the minds of a group of global economic leaders.' Delia runs Maha, a Middle Eastern restaurant on Bond St in Melbourne's CBD, and hosts his own cooking show, Shane Delia's Spice Journey, on SBS.

"Google has revealed an ambitious project to develop a pill that would test for cancer and other illnesses. It would contain microscopic particles - nanoparticles - which can travel through the bloodstream and search for early signs of disease. The tech giant hopes the system will one day allow cancer, heart disease and other diseases to be diagnosed and treated far earlier than they are today. Scroll down for video . Google has revealed an ambitious project to develop a pill that would test for cancer and other illnesses. It says that nanoparticles could be combined with a wearable sensor to 'sniff' out and attach themselves to diseased cells - which could then be monitored using a handheld sensor . Nanoparticles could be ingested in a pill to enter the bloodstream. They would be designed to bind to a particular type of cell – like a cancer tumor cell. This would be done by 'painting' them with a substance that could interact with the surface of cells. They'd then travel together as a unit through the bloodstream. The core of the nanoparticles would be magnetic, so a wearable device that creates a magnetic field could draw the particles – with their target cells in tow – toward it, where they could be detected and counted. Experts at Google are studying various non-invasive techniques, like light and radio waves, for detecting and counting the particles. The technology is being developed at Google's X Lab, where work is also underway on smart contact lenses to monitor diabetes and special cutlery to eliminate the tremors of patients. 'Much of the improvement in cancer survival rates over the last 30 years is due to earlier detection, like skin cancer screening and Pap smears,' Google said. 'Yet for many serious diseases, there still aren't good enough diagnostics to help doctors catch them in their earliest stages, when they're most treatable. 'Pancreatic cancer is famously elusive, with only three per cent of cases found in the first, most curable stage. And some lung cancer tumours are so aggressive that they even kill people who go for annual CT screening, growing deadly in less than 12 months.' Google's engineers hope to harness the chemical signals given off by cells as they become diseased. 'We wondered: could continuous measurement of subtle changes in the chemistry of the blood be a way to detect a disease very early, when it's most treatable?' The idea is that a patient would swallow a pill containing the microscopic particles, which travel through their bloodstream, searching for malignant cells. The particles would then report their findings to a sensor device that is worn on the body. Google said the microscopic particles could be magnetised and coated with antibodies that bind with specific proteins or cells associated with various diseases. A wearable sensor would track the particles' magnetic fields. Google said: 'Although we're still in the early stages of scientific exploration, we can imagine many different applications of this technology. 'Maybe there could be a test for the enzymes given off by arterial plaques that are about to rupture and cause a heart attack or stroke. A Google smart contact lens that can monitor the glucose levels in the eye is being developed in a partnership with Swiss pharmaceutical company Novartis. It  works using tiny sensors and microchips fitted into contact lenses that can then measure and read the amount of glucose in tears, before sending the information to a mobile device so diabetics can manage their condition. 'Perhaps someone could develop a diagnostic for post-surgery or post-chemo cancer patients – that's a lot of anxious people right there. Google said it has already started work on the project, and plans to license the technology to medical firms to develop the finished tests. The project was inspired by a Google engineer. Two years ago, Google software engineer Tom Stanis was hit by a car while riding his bicycle. 'He has no memory of the accident, but he'll never forget this: in the hospital emergency room, a doctor told him that his medical scans, intended to check for internal bleeding, had revealed a tumor in his kidney,' the firm said. Renal cancer typically has few if any symptoms until it's too late. Thanks to this unlikely early diagnosis, Tom had surgery to remove the tumor and is now cancer free. He's now a member of the Google X Life Sciences team and inspired them to pursue this project. 'We've run many promising experiments around four core components of a nanodiagnostics platform – designing nanoparticles, binding them to target cells, detecting them with a non-invasive device, and counting them. 'It could take years to reveal the potential of this technology – nature is a formidable foe – but we hope it's less than a decade, given what's at stake.'","Google's X Lab is developing a pill to test for anver and other diseases .

"The private household of King Herod has been laid bare in a new exhibition being held at a museum in Israel. Herod the Great: The King's Final Journey at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem features exhibits that offer an intriguing glimpse into the home life of the divisive figure, including his bath and the decorations that adorned his palace. The 250 artifacts were excavated over a period of 40 years at Herodium, the builder-king's excavated palace on an arid hilltop a short drive from Jerusalem. Scroll down for video .

Visitors look at a large marble and plaster basin excavated from Herodium, King Herod's palace . Museum staff have recreated sections of the palace to house the exhibits, including a mock-up of the tomb where King Herod was laid to rest and contains what experts believe is his excavated sarcophagus. There are also numerous busts and statues, as well as a one-piece stone bath excavated from the hot bath house at the site. They come from the period when the Romans occupied the Holy Land and appointed Herod the monarch of Judea. Final resting place: This sarcophagus is believed to have held Herod's body . The sarcophagus is housed in a reconstruction of the tomb of King Herod. He ruled in what is now Israel and the West Bank for over 30 years and died in the year 4 BCE . Herod, who ruled in what is now Israel and the West Bank for over 30 years and died in the year 4 BCE, was known for elaborate palaces and fortresses. He is branded a baby-killer in the Christian tradition but remembered by many in Israel for rebuilding the Jewish Temple two millennia ago. However, the opening of the exhibit has provoked a modern-day row between Israel and the Palestinians over who has the right to dig up his artifacts. Palestinians have complained many of the exhibits were taken from the occupied West Bank, land Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war and which Palestinians seek as part of a future state. Palestinians said the artefacts were removed without their consent. The Palestinian minister of tourism and antiquities, Rula Ma'ayah, said all Israeli archaeological activities in the West Bank were illegal.

All the work at digs in the occupied territories are against the law, but Israel carries them out and even if they don't dig themselves they don't allow us to do so,' he said. Israel Museum director James Snyder said archaeological digs on West Bank land were carried out according to international conventions and protocols laid down in interim Israeli-Palestinian peace accords. Snyder said he was unaware of any discussions with Palestinian archaeological officials over the exhibit and there had been no way to study the artefacts properly on site at Herodium. The relics, he said, would eventually be returned to Herodium once proper facilities to house them were in place. Monarch: A stone sculpture of Cleopatra, one of 250 finds being exhibited . Echoes of history: A reconstructed model of Herodium (left), located south of Jerusalem. A stone sculpture of Roman Emperor Augustus (right). Herod was appointed as monarch of Judea by the Romans . In the Christian story, Herod ordered his men to kill all baby boys in and around Jesus' birthplace Bethlehem, fearing one would grow up to become 'King of the Jews' and challenge his rule. According The Gospel of Matthew, Jesus and his family escaped the slaughter by fleeing to Egypt. Historians said Herod ruled Judea from about 37 BC until his death in 4 BC - four years before Jesus' official birth day, though that date is also contested. King Herod has been called as 'the greatest builder of human history,' but was also responsible for killing his wife and three of his children over alleged treasons. He rebuilt the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem and was also renowned for other grandiose construction projects, such as the fortress at Masada.","Artifacts from King Herod's palace go on display in Israel .

"Ultimo has created a range of party-ready bras and who better to model them that lingerie-loving Abbey Clancy? The  mother-of-one showcases her toned physique as she models the new range of bras. The new collection features three problem-solving products, including the low back body, the low back bra and the strapless 'wear 5 ways' multi-way, all of which Abbey models to perfection as the face of the brand. Scroll down for video . She's back! Abbey Clancy has been unveiled as the face of Ultimo's party lingerie range and models the problem-solving bras to perfection in the campaign shoot . Michelle Mone OBE, founder of Ultimo, said: 'Getting your foundation right is just important as the dress itself. 'The new Ultimo collection offers women the chance to perfect their party look, whilst also boosting their cleavage and confidence.' Ironically, Abbey confessed to Grazia recently that she never wore a bra until she was 16. She said: 'I only got my first bra when I was about 16 - I was still in thermal vests up until then, I was completely flat chested. Then all of a sudden I grew these humongous breasts. 'I've got a long relationship with underwear - I'd go so far as to say I've got a lingerie fetish. I think it's the first thing - the key thing - to make you feel good.' Toned frame: Abbey, who has been modelling for years, proves her worth in the sultry shoot in a French style boudoir . Success: Abbey has seen her star rise this year and even turned her hand to designing as she unveiled a clothing range for Matalan . This isn't the model's only coup this month - Abbey, 27, was unveiled as the new face of Avon fragrance and invited her 53-year-old mother to star alongside her. The mother-daughter-duo look more like sisters in the new promotional images for the fragrance, Cherish, which launches just in time for Mother's Day. The mother and daughter campaign stars are firm friends and Abbey often invites Karen to accompany her at showbiz parties. Referring to Karen shortly after the birth of her own daughter in 2011, Abbey said: 'I weigh less than I weighed before I had the baby and I'm really happy with my figure. 'I'm lucky to be blessed with good genes. My mum is 51 and hasn't had any work done, but still looks like she could be my sister. She's a goddess.' What's her secret? Abbey is a big fitness fan and is often seen leaving the gym where she clearly works hard to keep her body in shape . Lingerie lover: The star recently explained that she's got a long relationship with underwear and admitted she has  a lingerie fetish . Clearly feeling the love for her family this month, Abbey last week expressed her devotion to her husband Peter Crouch by sharing a heart-warming picture on Instagram of him cuddling their three-year-old daughter Sophia on Sunday evening. The sweet black-and-white snap shows the Stoke City striker lying on their wooden floor with their little girl lying on top of him and laughing. The 28-year-old model proudly added the caption, 'My world', alongside the Instagram picture when she shared it with her 335k Twitter followers. The Avon and Ultimo campaigns are the latest in a string of successes for the model and WAG, who also designs a range for Matalan and was unveiled as the face of Veet and Scholl earlier this year.

"Geri Halliwell today described herself as 'spineless' and 'weak' for deleting a tweet that paid tribute to Baroness Thatcher when she died. The Spice Girl angered fans on Monday by writing: 'Thinking of our 1st Lady of girl power, Margaret Thatcher, a grocer’s daughter who taught me anything is possible…x’. A backlash caused her to delete the message and apologise, but today Ms Halliwell said she regretted it and should have shown the courage the Iron Lady had in her political career. U-turn: Geri Halliwell tweeted her sadness at the death of Baroness Thatcher but swiftly deleted the post on Monday - but today she said she was 'spineless' to do it and still admired the Iron Lady . Blog: Geri wrote today on her website under the title 'weak under fire', and said that she had thought about what she did for three days and felt compelled to put it right . 'I realise that I do admire a woman, whether she is right or wrong, regardless of her opinions. She had the courage to stand by her . convictions. Not like me. I look at my behaviour, which exposed how weak I . was under fire, not like Margaret Thatcher. Rest in peace,' she wrote on her blog. 'I was so afraid of upsetting people, and not being liked for saying something that was not to everyone’s taste. 'When I’m scared, my natural state is to hide and run for cover'. Geri was attacked online this week, with one . disgruntled Twitter user writing: 'So Geri Halliwell tweeted about the . 'first Lady of girl power' and then deleted it after getting some stick? Girl power indeed. #thatcher.' The 40-year-old then deleted the tweet, and wrote: 'I'm sorry if I offended u. X' Changing her mind: The Spice Girl tweeted that Thatcher was the 1st Lady of girl power, but removed the tweet after receiving criticism . Apology: Geri was quick to delete the post and apologised to fans . Explaining her decision she wrote today: 'I was so confused and overwhelmed by some of the feedback I received that I took my tweet down and for that I was called spineless. 'I realised the best thing to do was to shut up and really get honest with myself. What I hated the most was that I took a tweet down. I had wavered and was full of self-doubt. 'I suddenly thought given the adverse reaction, did I even really know . enough about Margaret Thatcher?  Was I just trying to be relevant? She . had obviously upset a lot of people.' Geri has involved herself in politics ever since her rise to fame. Before Tony Blair swept to power in 1997 she said: 'I saw a lot of what Mrs Thatcher did. She was definitely the original Spice Girl rising from the greengrocer's daughter to Prime Minister.' A year earlier she said Blair was 'not a safe pair of hands for the economy'. DJ and presenter Lauren Laverne later called her 'Tory scum', but the Spice Girl maintained that Thatcher was an inspiration. But in 2001 she switched to New Labour and even appeared in one of the party's election broadcasts. Weak under fire . (please forgive grammar & spelling!) When I’m scared, my natural state is to hide and run for cover. I was 7 years old when my father told me about the greengrocer’s daughter who had become the first female Prime Minister in our history. I was enchanted by this… my father who was always hiding behind the broadsheets spoke about her my whole childhood. Fast forward to 1996… It was widely covered in the media, when I casually mentioned that I admired Margaret Thatcher in an interview for a political magazine. Monday 8th April 2013 – Margaret Thatcher had died… I felt compelled to tweet my thoughts for a female leader, in a world governed by men. I was so confused and overwhelmed by some of the feedback I received that I took my tweet down and for that I was called spineless. I questioned myself? Did I really mean what I said? Can I stand tall? Do I even know what I was talking about? I realised the best thing to do was to shut up and really get honest with myself. What I hated the most was that I took a tweet down. I had wavered and was full of self-doubt. I so I asked myself over the last 3 days – why I did I do it? Why did I take that tweet down? These are my conclusions… . I. I was so afraid of upsetting people, and not being liked for saying something that was not to everyone’s taste. 2. Also, I suddenly thought given the adverse reaction, did I even really know enough about Margaret Thatcher?  Was I just trying to be relevant? She had obviously upset a lot of people. 3. But now I realise that I do admire a woman, whether she is right or wrong, regardless of her opinions. She had the courage to stand by her convictions. Not like me.

"Once associated with extreme fussy eaters and devoted animal rights activists, veganism is now becoming cool thanks to a number of celebrities embracing the diet. Jennifer Lopez credits veganism with helping her stay svelte and looking decades younger than her 45-years. Health guru Gwyneth Paltrow is of course another advocate of the plant-based diet and shared her passion for it in her book It's All Good. Scroll down for video . Converts: Beyonce and her husband Jay-Z went on a 22-day vegan diet earlier this year and the pair have continued to eat less animal products as a result . Long-term fans: Gwyneth Paltrow, left, and Jennifer Lopez credit a vegan diet for their healthy appearances . Meanwhile, Beyonce and her husband Jay-Z went on a 22-day vegan diet earlier this year and the pair have continued to eat less animal products as a result. The stars credit the eating plan, which involves avoiding all animal foods such as meat, dairy and eggs, for helping them look and feel better. Lily Simpson, founder of London based healthy food delivery company, The Detox Kitchen, says that limiting the amount of animal products in your diet, even for just a few days – will help your digestive system restore. ‘Protein is very hard to digest, by allowing your digestive system to rest through an animal protein detox, your body will feel light and cleansed,’ she said. It seems like Lily, many people are becoming converted to a part-time vegan lifestyle. The Detox Kitchen, which also has a deli at Harvey Nichols and in Kingly Street, has found that more and more people are choosing their vegan option from their five-detox packages. Model Lara Stone relied on healthy food deliveries from company to help her get back into shape after she gave birth. The Vegan Society estimates that there are 150,000 vegans in the UK and sales of vegan products are on the up. Many people have converted to veganism following studies which have concluded that red meat like steak and burgers can raise the risk of developing heart disease and cancer because it's high in saturated fat. However some nutritionists argue that veganism isn't necessarily the answer for a long, healthy life as it may lead to followers being deficient in protein, iron and other vitamins and minerals. Milk, cheese, chicken and fish are high in protein - which is essential for many of the body's biological processes including building and repairing muscle. Part-time vegan: Lily Simpson said her skin has improved thanks to eating vegan every other week . Meanwhile, red meat is one of the best sources of iron - which helps make red blood cells to carry carry oxygen around the body - and a number of essential B vitamins. An iron deficiency can lead to feeling constantly tired and low in energy. Lily agrees that nutrient deficiency can lead to fatigue and even illnesses, however vegans do not necessarily need to experience this. ‘As long as you are replacing the calcium and protein in your diet with the correct foods, you shouldn’t see any negative effects on your energy levels,' she explains. 'The most important thing when going vegan is ensuring that you replace the protein, it is really important to have at least 50g protein per day. 'You can get this from eating a varied diet full of pulses and grains - quinoa is great. You can also add spirulina and flaxseed into your juices for an extra nutrient boost’. According to Lily, moving towards a vegan diet doesn't have to mean restricting yourself indefinitely. You can follow the plan for a set period, like Beyonce and Jay-Z, or on certain days of the week. Lily says that she has noticed a difference to her appearance and well-being since limiting the amount of dairy and sticking to fish and lean white meats when she does eat animal protein. ‘I definitely notice I have brighter, clearer skin since adopting a diet based on plant based, natural foods,' she said. For those keen to try it but unsure if they can commit to a life without meat, Lily has the following advice. 'One vegan meal per day is a great way to start. Having a vegan meal for lunch is best, there are lots of great salad bars doing big quinoa salads or great vegan veggie burgers.' If you can't or don't want to give up meat for good, Lily recommends 'sticking to lean, unprocessed meats' like chicken over red meat. She added: ‘The important thing is to ensure you are eating a well-balanced and healthy diet, based on natural foods and local produce. There is so much conflicting information of what a healthy diet entails, we stick to a simple formula. All our food is free from wheat, dairy and refined sugar, and is created using fresh, seasonal ingredients.' Try this tasty vegan recipe from The Detox Kitchen: . Ingredients . Courgette noodle salad with cashew pesto dressing . Method . 1. Preheat the oven at 180°C . 2. Cut the mange tout lengthwise into thin strips. 3. Rinse and noodle the courgettes using a julienne peeler or a noodle machine. 4. Toast off the sunflower seeds and cashew nuts separately in the oven for a few minutes. Leave to cool. 5. In a large bowl, mix together the mange tout, the courgette noodles and the sunflower seeds. 6. Make the cashew pesto – Put the cashews and herbs together in a food processor and blitz. While blitzing slowly add the oil and the lemon juice until it gets to the right consistency. It should look like a smooth paste. 7. Check for seasoning. Mix the pesto (using what you think is enough) in with the courgettes, mange tout and sunflower seeds. Serve cold with some baby leaf spinach or on it’s own.

"Christmas is coming soon, it must be, our Cheryl has just turned on the lights in Oxford Street and all the big budget adverts are on TV. John Lewis launched their tear-jerker TV ad about Monty the Penguin this week – and clearly it's worked because the Monty soft toy has already sold out. The fact that this stuffed Penguin has already flown of the shelves (I do realise that Penguins don't actually fly) got me thinking that you've got to go early to get the must-buy Christmas presents and so this year for the first time ever I'm going to be prepared, and get my pressies sorted before the rush. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Spencer tries out the latest must-have boy's toy, the AirWheel . And so here is my plan to catch the must-buy gifts this year… . The best boys' toy for Christmas 2014 is without a doubt the AirWheel. This is the present that every gadget-nut will want. It's a self balancing electric unicycle and it's going to revolutionise the personal transportation market. It has a top speed of 12mph (a pretty swift running pace) and you can go on roads, pavement, sand or dirt tracks and it's easily portable. It's easy to learn how to ride – no harder than riding a bike and I go everywhere on mine. You can see my riding one in this video below and prices start at £424.99 at www.yesss.co.uk . The self-balancing gadget is said to revolutionise travel . For the lady in your life – you simply cannot go wrong with diamonds. And at fine diamond jeweller vashi.com you can get a classic Diamond Circle Pendant for only £269, or some diamond hoop earrings from £299 – it would cost you four times that in Bond Street. Or if you are really putting the boat out you could splash out £2,370 for round cut solitaire 0.95 carat diamond Side Stones Engagement Ring in platinum. But I don't think I'll have need of one of those for quite some time yet. Spencer has taken advice from his co-star Binky and will opting for lingerie for the lady in his life this year . If you are not quite ready for the expense of precious stones then there is always the option of some opulent boudoir lingerie - I've taken some advice from my Made In Chelsea colleague Binky on this who tells me that Bluebella has a great range with designer styles at high street prices. Apparently the Lexi bra and briefs (£30 & £15 respectively at Bluebella.com) are very seductive, but to avoid accusations that this is basically a back-handed present to yourself, try buying some luxurious sleepwear like the Alexandria Chemise (£38 at Bluebella.com) as well. Every year there's always a few dodgy Christmas sweaters knocking about and if you would rather avoid wearing one, I suggest you leave some heavy hints that any menswear gifts should be bought from theidleman.com – every single garment on this website passes the pub test. Spencer recommends the Idle Man's Christmas jumper selection for a tasteful take on the tacky trend . This is the most important quality control for any young man, which means that even the most festive numbers here would not make you the butt of your mates' jokes down your local watering-hole. TheIdleMan's Bellfield range of sweaters is the acceptable face of Christmas jumper. Bellfield Asio Jumper With Mountain Jacquard (£40 @ theidleman.com) For mum's, aunties and wives who are looking to age gracefully, you will be doing them a massive favour by investing in a CACI Microlift. Spencer says that the Caci microlift is ideal for mums who want to age gracefully and for an extra special gift there is an Exclusive Swarovksi Crystal version . This home-use beauty gadget firms and tones the face and gets rid of wrinkles. Clearly this has to be given tactfully, carefully stressing that it has been given so that the beautiful matriarchs in your life remain so, and not that they need to use it in the slightest. CACI Microlift £350 at Harrods.com, and for those with serious wedge there is an Exclusive Swarovksi Crystal version for £760 also at Harrods.com . For dads – why not try to get the old fella to take care of himself a bit more with some male grooming products – like the Lab Series. If he is old school and resistant to moisturizing then cleverly style it as the latest post shave balm.

"Lucasfilm is suing a New York brewery to demand it stops using a name inspired by the Star Wars franchise. The Disney-owned company says the name of Empire Brewing Co.'s 'Empire Strikes Bock' beer is too similar to the title of 1980 hit Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back. The company filed a legal notice with the US Patent and Trademark office on October 15, which claims fans will mistake the drink for an official Star Wars product. The Empire Brewing Company, based in Syracuse in New York, has been making the lager for seven years . Lucasfilm claim the name of 'Empire Strikes Bock' beer is too similar to title Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back. Pictured, a scene from the 1980 hit featuring Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker . The Syracuse brewery had used the term 'May the hops be with you' in a description of the German-style 'bock' lager on its website. It also featured an advertisement proclaiming the drink a hit 'across the Galaxy' in a similar scrolling font to the famous opening used in the movies. The name will 'cause confusion', especially because director and founder George Lucas already sells Skywalker-brand wine, named after hero Luke Skywalker, the legal notice claims. Empire pub owner David Katleski says the company can't afford to wage war against a Hollywood powerhouse . The brewery, which has been making the beer for seven years, said the conflict arose after it recently filed trademark papers for the lager. Director George Lucas, already sells Skywalker wine, a name inspired by hero Luke Skywalker . Kevin Griffin, a manager at Empire Brewery, has claimed it was just a misunderstanding. He said the beer is actually just called 'Strikes Bock', with the word 'Empire' referring only to its maker. 'I don't see why they would have any objection. It's not like we're using images of Star Wars on the bottle or on our website,' he told The New York Post. 'As a Star Wars fan boy, I'm a big dork. I'd love nothing more than to be the trilogy's official beer. But I don't think there's any chance of people actually interpreting it that way.' Empire recently made a push to sell the beer at venues outside its pub in Syracuse. The pub's owner David Katleski says Empire can't afford to wage a war with the Hollywood powerhouse. 'It's kind of a 'big dog against small dog' thing,' he told the Syracuse Post-Standard. A new Star Wars movie is currently being filmed. It will feature a number of original trilogy cast members, including Carrie Fisher, Harrison Ford and Mark Hamill. Star Wars: Episode VII, scheduled for a December 2015 release, and is set 30 years after The Return Of The Jedi.","Syracuse brewery has made 'Empire Strikes Bock' lager for seven years .

"This is the shocking moment a Philadelphia high school teacher was filmed lying unconscious in a hallway after allegedly being knocked out by a  student. Pewu Johnson, 68, a substitute English teacher, reportedly reprimanded the teenager after he saw a girl sitting on his lap in an 'inappropriate' manner at Bartram High School. Later that day, the student confronted Mr Johnson and told him, 'get the f*** out of my face', before throwing him to the ground, causing him to smack his head against the floor, school officials said. Scroll down for video . Shocking: Teacher Pewu Johnson, 68,  is caught on video lying unconscious in a hallway at Bartram High School in southwest Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, after being knocked out by a male student . Recovering: Mr Johnson (pictured), a substitute English teacher, reportedly reprimanded the teenager after he saw a girl sitting on his lap in an 'inappropriate' manner. Later that day, the student confronted him . Video footage, filmed on another student's camera and later shared on social media, shows the teacher lying motionless in the hallway while his alleged attacker stands over his body. 'He grabbed me, then lifted me up, then dropped me on my back, on the floor. I became unconscious. I wasn't hearing anything. I was out.' Mr Johnson told The Philadelphia Inquirer. Following the apparent assault, Mr Johnson was rushed to hospital, where he was examined and treated for concussion. He was released several hours later, NBC Philadelphia reported. But despite his release, the victim, a Liberian immigrant with deep roots in Philadelphia, still suffers from intense neck pain and is not sure when he will be fit enough to return to work. Meanwhile, the unidentified student has been suspended from the school in south-west Philadelphia. He is expected to be charged with a criminal offense in coming days. Speaking of the assault on Thursday afternoon, Philadelphia School District spokesman Fernando Gallard said it was 'the result of an individual making a dramatically poor choice'. Attack: The student reportedly told Mr Johnson, 'get the f*** out of my face', before throwing him to the ground, causing him to smack his head. Above, video footage appears to show boy stood over the victim . Knocked out: Following the apparent assault, Mr Johnson was rushed to hospital, where he was examined and treated for concussion. He was released several hours later, but still suffers from intense neck pain . He added: 'The School District does not tolerate this type of behavior and is working with Bartram High School and Philadelphia Police to make sure that the student is discipline and also charged.' Alarmingly, Thursday's attack was the third assault on a teacher at the school in less than a month. On October 21, a teacher suffered a badly injured back after being shoved to the floor twice by a ninth-grade student who  attempted to snatch their laptop. And on October 9, a 12th grade student punched a teacher in the face in a bid to witness a fight that had erupted outside the classroom.

"With more than 100 years experience between them, there's little that former prostitutes Louise and Martine Fokkens, both 71, don't know about men. Now the pair, who retired last year, have revealed the secrets of keeping your man happy - both in bed and out - in an exclusive interview with MailOnline. 'What I've learned about men is that . when they [men] drink, it's not good,' chirps mother-of-four Louise. 'I have also learned that people need prostitutes - it is normal and we should respect it.

Between them, the Fokkens twins have slept with 355,000 men during careers that began more than half a century ago. The sisters, who are famous for their trademark matching red clothes, first turned to prostitution aged 20 after escaping violent relationships. 'We were young and we made jokes and had . respect for men,' says Louise of the twins' lasting success in the sex trade. Working hard: The twins chat to presenter Darren McMullen during an appearance on his new TV show . Essential: Louise says the secret of success in bed is sussing out what your man wants - and giving it to him . Busy: Since giving up their jobs as prostitutes, the pair have opened a pop up shop and will appear on TV . BE EASY GOING . 'Be easy, listen to what he wants - always.' FIND OUT WHAT HE WANTS - AND GIVE IT TO HIM . 'Every man wants something different and that's the real game, finding out what they want.' DON'T TURN YOUR BACK ON INTIMACY . 'Lots of men who visit prostitutes do it because their wives won't have sex with them even though they love them.' BE TRUE TO YOURSELF . 'Always be yourself. This is what we learnt when we were little and it's true.' 'We had the whole package. Then when my sister joined . me - we were in one room together - we were very popular. 'There weren't . live shows back then but we used to do our own - we did a dance.' Despite their plans to move on after a few years in the game, the duo swiftly became an Amsterdam institution and are still red light district regulars - even if they aren't seeing clients anymore. 'I am not missing work,' says Louise, a year after her retirement. 'Most weeks I am at my pop up shop in the centre of Amsterdam where we are selling our two books. 'We also do a little painting. Because of the red light district we have a lot of contacts so we have a lot of visitors to the shop.' She adds: 'We have to keep busy because we have no pension, as most people our age do. We still do see a few of our old clients, we meet them for either a tea or a coffee... or at the bar.' The pair will also appear on new FOX documentary, Outsiders With Darren McMullen, which shows them giggling flirtatiously as they give the British presenter a tour of the red light district. Enticing: According to Louise, if you want to catch a man and keep him, you need to be easy going . Successful: The duo have launched a pop up shop in the red light district, where they sell their books . Busy though they are, Louise has still found time to share her thoughts on what it really takes to make a man happy. 'Be easy, listen to what he wants - always,' she suggests. 'When we started in the 1960s, we learned the same thing from the older women we worked with. 'Every man wants something different and that's the real game - finding out what they want.' What about men who cheat on their wives with prostitutes or other women? 'They want to be free,' she explains. 'Their wives won't have sex with them even if they love them.' Warming to her theme, she continues: 'If you really want to meet a man and keep him, you need to be yourself. 'Always be yourself. This is what we learned when we were little and it's true. But also you must have respect for other people and listen to other people.' The Fokkens twins appear on Outsiders With Darren McMullen, Friday at 10pm on the National Geographic Channel .

"Three people, including a volunteer firefighter who was sitting inside on his computer, have been struck by lightning during a wild storm that has swept across Perth. It's believed the volunteer in his 30s, who works at Rockingham Fire Station, was at home when a lightning strike hit his house at about 8.30am today. 'He reported that he wasn't feeling well, it could have been residual shocks and he was taken to Rockingham hospital,' said a St John Ambulance Australia spokesman. It's believed the man was taken to hospital for treatment and was suffering shock and a 'little anxiety' more than anything, according to another fire volunteer. Scroll down for video . A lightning strike at City Beach in Perth on Monday caused its closure that morning . Thunderstorms hit the storm early morning, bringing with it numerous lightning strikes in the metropolitan area . Two other people, a man and a woman, are also lucky to be alive when a tree they were standing underneath, at Hammond Park, south of Perth, were struck by lightning about 9am. 'They were knocked back by the force and we got to them and we transported them to the Royal Perth hospital with minor injuries,' said the ambulance spokesperson. A neighbour told the West Australian that the lightning bolt hit a tree and then hit the man in the chest, knocking him to the ground. It was reported that he was 'incoherent and lying on the grass in front of the house' after he had been hit. Thunderstorms hit the storm early morning, bringing with it numerous lightning strikes in the metropolitan area. A Department of Fire and Emergency Service spokesman said they attended a couple of reported lightning strike incidents but there was no excessive damage at either of them. 'The power went out but it was quickly restored,' he said. 'We attended a few fires east of Albany as a result of lightning strikes but we have come through relatively unscathed.' 'We are attending those fires now, they are relatively small and the bad weather has now passed through, it's overcast and there's a bit of rain,' he said. Surf Life Saving Western Australia reported the City beach and Secret Harbour were closed due to lightning strikes this morning. Three people were struck by lightning, including a volunteer firefighter, and taken to hospital for treatment . They warned people to get off the beach and out of the water during lightning, but they have now been re-opened. Weatherzone meteorologist Ben McBurney said the storm had been caused by the crossing of a low pressure trough. 'Combined warm and moist air created the thunderstorm, there was not a lot of rain, around two to five millimetres but there was a fair bit of lightning he said. He said the storms in Perth had passed through and the chance of another storm now was pretty low.

'The band of rain will edge into the South West and parts of northern Ireland this afternoon, then progress eastwards,' Kate Brown, a Met Office forecaster said. 'On Tuesday there is a yellow rain warning in place for those parts of the country from just after midnight although there will be some rain beforehand. 'It's a succession of wet weather, an unsettled picture. Tonight is just one rain band that will move north and eastwards over Britain,' she added. 'Thursday looks like it may be a quieter day, there's probably going to be a fairly decent dry day but Thursday into Friday we're looking at getting some heavy rain. Friday is going to be rather wet. 'The strongest winds will be focused in the same area as the rainfall, it does look like there'll be some strong gusts on the south coast Pembrokeshire coast. 'The South East will stay dry tonight and it's not really going to get into Scotland until the early hours but most other places will see some rain. The majority of people will see downpour.'

"The ex-wife of a mining tycoon claims she is facing homelessness - despite being hugely wealthy on paper - because her ex-husband has failed to honour a £2 million divorce payout. Shelley Mann, 47, claims her former partner, David, agreed to 'maintain' her 'for life', but has left her hanging 'between the devil and deep blue sea'. Since their marriage failed and he left the £1.8m family home in Hampstead in 1999, the mother-of-two says his reluctance to pay up has caused her a dramatic fall from grace. Shelley Mann claims her ex-husband David Mann owes her £2million from a divorce settlement and that his haphazard payments to her have meant she now faces homelessness because of rent arrears . She is now threatened with life on the street as court proceedings are underway to evict her and her two daughters from their Belgravia home over £50,000 in rent arrears. Mr Mann, 49, says he is simply unable to help as he is battling cancer and has 'run out of money'. Senior family judge, Lord Justice MacFarlane, heard that Mrs Mann's comfortable home life was shattered when she and her husband, who specializes in brokering mining deals, separated in 1997, then divorced two years later. Mrs Mann was initially handed the matrimonial home in Hampstead, north London, and given 'solid' maintenance payments for her and their children as part of her divorce settlement. Her barrister, Rex Howling, said things began to go seriously wrong when Mr Mann 'failed' to keep up mortgage payments on the house. Mrs Mann says that forced her to sell the home in 2004 - for £1m less than it is worth today. She was then unable to buy a new house as the legal costs of her settlement dispute mounted and she moved into a rented home with her daughters, initially in Hampstead. However, they later moved to a 'cheaper' £6,000-a-month mews house in Belgravia, which Mr Mann paid for. But the former couple could still not get along, and after a further decade of bitter wrangling over money, Mrs Mann says Mr Mann still owes her £2m. The £1.8m Hampstead home that Mr and Mrs Mann shared before their divorced in 1999 . Mr Howling told the judge that the Mrs Mann's troubles escalated when, in October last year, her ex-husband stopped paying the rent on her home in Belgravia. As a result she has racked up £50,000 in rent arrears. Mrs Mann and her daughters, aged 20 and 21, are facing eviction proceedings in the coming days. Because they are unlikely to qualify for council assistance, they are facing life without a roof over their head, the Court of Appeal heard. Mr Howling said: 'His ex-wife and his two daughters, who both still live at home, are being pushed out.' He explained that, although Mr Mann is still paying his ex-wife about £4,000 a month, his 'haphazard and unpredictable payments' mean she can't get a deposit together or provide the proof of regular income necessary to get a new rented home. Mr Howling said: 'He is giving her money on a drip feed basis, preventing her from renting anywhere else.' 'In the eyes of the local authority, the wife, in light of her rent arrears, will be classed as intentionally homeless and will be unable to seek assistance under the Housing Act. 'She is caught between the devil and the deep blue sea.' Mr Howling said Mr Mann had access to money 'it is a matter of how he wants to apply it'. The Belgravia home where Mrs Mann and her two daughters have racked up £50,000 in rent arrears . Mr Mann's lawyer, Justin Warshaw, said his client was in poor health and was also suffering financially, saying he was 'in a similarly parlous position to his former wife'. Mr Warshaw said Mr Mann made his money through introduction fees for mining and associated deals, the last of which that netted any money was in 2013. He said that was why Mr Mann stopped paying his ex-wife's rent. The barrister added that Mr Mann is living in a housing association flat and can't even afford to pay for proper cancer treatment. He didn't attend the proceeding because he was in hospital, Lord Justice MacFarlane was told. Mr Warshaw argued that the 'ancient divorce' should not still be hanging over Mr Mann's head after 15 years. The amount owed to Mrs Mann is also in dispute. At an earlier hearing Mr Mann had been criticised for his 'poor payment record, his repeated breach of the duty of full and frank disclosure, his manipulation of the trial process and his presentation of a dishonest case,' including 'producing rather questionable medical certificates'. Mr Howling disputed Mr Mann's claim to poverty, saying he wasn't living in local authority accommodation. He added that, even if Mr Mann is in trouble financially, 'there is the possibility for his wealthy friends to dig him out of a hole.' Lord Justice MacFarlane expressed dismay at the havoc being wrought on the family by the couple's marathon divorce. He said: 'I don't know, but I strongly suspect, what the state of affairs is in the relationship between the husband and the wife. But what of the relationship between him and his daughters? 'Situations like this do enormous damage to relationships.' Lord Justice MacFarlane said the orders made by the court had not been honoured and 'haphazard and unpredictable' payments had caused Mrs Mann's predicament. He said: 'There is clearly a pressing need to try to save the housing of Mrs Mann and her daughters, because of the lack of options open to them'. Clearing the way for Mrs Mann to take debt enforcement action against her ex, he added: 'What she needs is cash at the moment.' Outside court, Mrs Mann described what is happening to her and her daughters as 'an awful situation.'","Shelley Mann claims she and her daughters will soon be homeless .

"Executive producer of The Real Housewives franchise and Bravo late-night talk show host Andy Cohen blasted into New York in 1989 from Boston University as a 21-year-old intern at CBS News. He fell madly in love with the city as well as well as all things pop, including the Andy Warhol diaries filled with gossip galore about the artist’s doings night and day. Now Cohen, 46, has written his own one-year gossip-filled diary about his life in Manhattan and behind the scenes of his popular television shows in The Andy Cohen Diaries, published by Henry Holt and Company tomorrow. Scroll down for video . Puppy love: : Andy Cohen says fell madly in love with a beagle mix dog he rescued from a kill shelter in West Virginia. He named the dog, Wacha . Not butts about it: Andy's selfie with Kim's derriere was very exciting . Secret project: Andy adored Joan Rivers and they were talking about  a concept for a show called What’s Your Problem. Joan was going to solve peoples’ social problems, ‘like Judge Judy laying down verdicts on Real Housewives-type fights’ Before Joan Rivers died, Andy, who hosts late night show Watch What Happens Live, was working with her on a concept for a show called What’s Your Problem. She was going to solve peoples’ social problems, ‘like Judge Judy laying down verdicts on Real Housewives-type fights’. When Andy pitched Joan on doing a Fashion Police thing on the RHONY, she responded, ‘I’ll just say they all look like whores’. Joan wasn’t going to move forward with What’s Your Problem without a role for Melissa. ‘(Is Melissa Rivers now an Executive Producer on my show?)’ Andy quips. He adored Joan Rivers. Her death reminded him life changes in the blink of an eye. He hangs a lot with Sarah Jessica Parker, Kelly Ripa and Mark Consuelos, along with a lot of other first names like Madonna, Anderson, Lady Gaga and at the Jerry and Jessica Seinfelds, where the food is always to die for and he eats like a pig. He vacationed in Capri with Barry Diller and Diane von Furstenberg. He was Sarah Jessica Parker's date to the Metropolitan Museum gala this year, and says the dinner was 'pop culture theater — Kanye and Beyoncé wandering by, Taylor Swift looking for Lena Dunham. Naomi (Campbell) came over to me three times in the course of the entire evening screaming, “Keep Porsha (Williams from ‘The Real Housewives of Atlanta’). DO NOT FIRE HER! I CAN’T STAND KENYA (Moore)!” Cohen obsesses about his weight but loves to indulge himself with anything besides gourmet food that includes candy and ice cream, He’s ‘tanorexic’ and needs time in the sun. Keeping it real: Andy parties with Monica Lewinsky and RHOA star NeNe Leakes at his book party . Besties: Andy and Diane von Furstenberg are close and he vacationed in Capri with her and Barry Diller . He’s on the hunt for his next lover. He fantasizes about firemen, baseball players, men he sees in airports, anywhere. He writes that his last serious relationship was with Broadway alum John Hill, a decade ago and he’s been on the hunt ever since for his next love. ‘I’m lonely and I need something to care about, take care of and think about other than myself or my job’. ‘Basically, if I have to think about only myself for another minute, I am going to rip my skin off’. ‘In the meantime I will cruise guys at my gay temple whilst repenting’. Cohen even joined Tinder in the hopes of finding his true love. 'I got caught up in the tech buzz and randomly joined,' he writes about the hookup site that allows users to pick random sex partners simply by looking at their picture. 'I said ‘yes’ to a few. . . Tinder is my ticket to meeting people I wouldn’t normally come across, like an architect who lives in Murray Hill, or a scientist from Williamsburg. Welcome to my rich fantasy land.' In the absence of a boyfriend, he fell madly in love with a beagle mix dog he rescued from a kill shelter in West Virginia. He named the dog, Wacha, after the St. Louis Cardinals pitcher Michael Wacha – his hometown baseball team. ‘The interesting thing is my sex drive has been nowhere. It’s like I’m satisfying myself with the dog. I’m not f****** the dog, of course, but I think I’m being fulfilled in other ways’, Cohen writes. “I’m in love with my dog. It turns out that I have a better chance of having a long-term relationship with him than with a person, because everything I say goes’. On the Housewives, he confesses he feels codependent in Housewife-heavy public situations and likes spending quality time with the women. He writes they use a generous amount of dye, Botox and fillers in what feels like an alternate universe at times. Cheeky: Andy asked Khloe Kardashian if her a** had always been like that. She said she was wearing special Spanx that lift her butt . The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills reunion was brutal. Two of the Housewives refused to sit next to Carlton Gebbia because ‘they believed that she had put spells on them, or she would put a spell on them’. Andy had the hunch that this was the first and last reunion for Joyce Girard and Carlton Gebbia and Carlton knew it because she was depicted as a ‘sex starved Wiccan’. (The last five episodes have not aired yet, he writes.) ‘In retrospect we could’ve fleshed out more aspects of her life. They have been secretly talking to Lisa Rinna about joining Real Housewives of Beverly Hills. One of the issues with the Housewives is that ‘in every city, some of the women are simultaneously living their real lives and playing to the audience’s perception of them, and that always winds up biting them in the ass’. It’s worse in the Beverly Hills franchise because it’s an industry town. Cohen comments that The Real Housewives of Miami are not afraid of jumpsuits or camel toe, exposing too much of the female’s private parts in tight clothing. In April, he and his Bravo team tried to figure out which Atlanta Housewives to bring back and what to pay them. “I am so far not thrilled with the new casting, so we rejected the latest bunch are going to dig deeper’, Andy writes. The deal with Bethenny Frankel to come back to Real Housewives of New York was signed. The Housewives all relate to themselves as businesswomen. Suzanne Somers was on WWHL, declared she was a businesswoman and Andy wonders if she should be a Housewife. Despite leading an exciting life coast to coast, he and CNN host Anderson Cooper text each other that ‘we are bored out of our minds’. Party time: (from left) Ellen Barkin, Andy Cohen, Kelly Ripa and Mark Consuelos celebrate Andy Cohen's previous memoir 'Most Talkative' at SiriusXM Studio in New York in May 2012 . Cohen, Anderson Cooper and TV weatherman Sam Champion all ended up in a bar in Rio in December 2013. ‘The men are more beautiful in Rio than anywhere else. It’s like living in a candy store. They are all available too, even the straight ones.' At a cocktail party, he talked with Ronan Farrow. ‘I don’t see how he’s not Sinatra’s son; he’s the spitting image’. But then someone pointed out that Mia Farrow once looked just like Sinatra so maybe Ronan just looks like Mia. ‘In any case, he looks nothing like Woody Allen, so that’s something’. WWHL provides a wealth of gossip in the book: . Rachel Ray brought panini for the entire WWHL staff carried by her acolytes. ‘She seemed pretty drunk on red wine – she’s the real version of Martha’. Nick Carter, the former member of the pop group Backstreet Boys is still drinking while writing a book about his struggles with alcohol and drugs. Actor David Arquette, who got his first big break in the Scream series and was married to Courteney Cox for fourteen year, now owns a bar and told Andy, ‘I’m not sober anymore’. Jenny McCarthy explained to him to picture women masturbating by rubbing a stain out of a garment. Lady Gaga told him not to ask her about Madonna or Perez Hilton. She confessed to him that she couldn’t get out of her dressing room and to the bathroom because of the people in the hall so she peed in the garbage can. Andy viewed her urine as the ultimate pop culture artifact and it was put into a perfume bottle. He later did a video shoot with her and said she is ‘really f******' fun’! Andy went to JLo's birthday party held in Sag Harbor in June which 'turned out to be a lot of fun'. When he saw Khloe Kardashian on the way out, he sensed a 'cold front coming from her'. 'Her ass-- I don't even know how to describe it. It was so bulbous and extended and shelf-like and badonkadonkulous. I asked her if her ass had always been like that or if I was looking at something different or what. 'She said she was wearing special Spanx that lift it. JLo said Spanx usually flatten your ass so these must be a new kind'. 'I got home and realized I have been s***-talking Kanye a lot on the show and maybe Kim a little too so I deserved some KardashiShade'. Taping Kim Kardashian in August, there were no restrictions on the interview. He had already killed questions about Kris Humphries and Ray J out of respect and now regretted it. 'I took a selfie with her a**. So that was exciting'.

"For most, the household chores are an arduous task. But for mother-of-one Linda Bannon, simple jobs such as cooking dinner in the evening, washing up and making the bed, present an almost impossible challenge. The 35-year-old was born with no arms - the result of the rare hereditary condition Holt-Oram syndrome, which affects bone growth and can cause heart problems. But Mrs Bannon refuses to let her disability get in the way of her living a normal life, using her feet in place of her hands. Scroll down for video . Linda Bannon her son Timmy, now 9, were born with Holt-Oram syndrome. The are condition affects bone growth and can cause heart problems . Mrs Bannon, 35, refuses to let her disability get in the way of her living a normal life, using her feet in place of her hands . She says her husband Richard was not fazed by her disability when they met (and married in 2004) She now plans to become a motivational speaker, to help others facing similar disabilities . And the mother-of-one has passed on her inspirational attitude to her son, Timmy, who was born with the same condition. Like her, the nine-year-old has not let the condition hold him back. He can swim, regularly takes taekwondo classes and plays video games like any boy his age - using his toes to grip the controller. Mrs Bannon, who has taught herself to eat using cutlery, put on make-up and even sew using her feet, said: 'Timmy is just like any other little boy. 'He does his homework, plays Lego and tidies his room, all using his feet. 'He gets frustrated by things like fastening buttons, but he's very positive and I'm so proud of him. 'I knew from scans he was going to be born without arms. We were understandably concerned, but I wasn't too daunted as I knew he'd be able to live a normal life like me.' The mother-of-one, who grew up in Chicago with her parents and four younger siblings, said her parents were unaware of her condition until she was born. 'They took it in their stride and never treated me differently,' she said. 'They helped me to walk and dress myself. I had prosthetic arms but they were uncomfortable. 'So by the age of 12 I was doing everything with my feet. I was teased at school, but my friends supported me.' Timmy can swim, regularly takes taekwondo classes and plays video games like any boy his age - using his toes to grip the controller . Mrs Bannon has taught herself to eat using cutlery, put on make-up and even sew using her feet . The couple knew from scans that Timmy would be born without arms - but his mother says she was confident he would be able to lead a normal life like her . When she left school Mrs Bannon became a primary school teacher, then met her husband Richard at the age of 24 while at the gym. She said: 'We hit it off straight away. He wasn't fazed by my disability - he liked my independence.' The couple married in July 2004 and decided to try for a baby. 'After I became pregnant we were told that there was a 50 per cent chance our baby could inherit my condition,' she said. 'I questioned whether we were doing the right thing, but we really wanted a family.' When Timmy was born doctors told his parents he had holes in his heart. The newborn spent two months in hospital before he was allowed home. His mother said: 'He had surgery and thankfully made a full recovery. I threw myself into being a mum. I'd carry him in a blanket hooked round my neck.' And as soon as he was old enough, Mrs Bannon began to teach him everything she had learned. When Timmy was born, he had holes in his heart and spent two months in hospital. He has since made a full recovery . While she did try prosthetic limbs (right, aged eight - and left, aged nine months), Mrs Banno  said she found them uncomfortable . While Timmy, pictured playing the ukelele, 'initially scooted around on his bum', he had learned to walk by the time he was two . 'As a baby he'd scoot around on his bum, but had learned to walk by the time he was two.' I showed him how to grip a toothbrush and cutlery with his feet. 'He swims on his back using his legs to propel himself. He gets down sometimes when he can't do things like ride a bike. But he never stays upset for long. 'However, I'm not having any more kids as I couldn't bear to see them go through the same heart problems Timmy had.' Mrs Bannon now plans to become a motivational speaker, to help others facing similar disabilities. She said: 'I want to raise awareness about my disability and show you can live a full life. 'There's no reason why Timmy can't have a wife and family. As long as he's happy that's all that matters.'","Linda Bannon, 35, and son Timmy, 9, were born with Holt-Oram syndrome .

"There's a pile of office payslips sitting on the desk in front of you and no one else is around. Could you resist a little peek to reveal how much your colleagues are being paid? If you think temptation would get the better of you - you are in the minority, but only just. A new study into nosy Britain revealed that in this enticing situation more than two in five (41 per cent) would not be able to restrain themselves. Out of those, one in five (20 per cent) admitted they’d briefly skim through the top ones. A more daring eight per cent would flick through the whole stack whilst a less brave (but more devious) 13 per cent said they would try to find a trusted colleague to snoop in their stead. Fifty per cent of Londoners said they would snoop on colleagues payslips but nearly two thirds of Scots and a similar proportion of Welsh respondents would resist believing it’s ‘none of their business’ The nosiest group by far were – perhaps unsurprisingly – competitive Londoners (50 per cent said they would snoop). By far the least inquisitive were Scotland and Wales. Nearly two thirds of Scots (64 per cent) and a similar proportion (62 per cent) of Welsh respondents would resist looking at the payslips stating it’s ‘none of their business’. Overwhelmingly, the West Midlands chose the less daring option of not looking at the payslips themselves but convincing a colleague to snoop instead. The most likely (29 per cent) to quickly scan through the top of the pile were from the East Midlands, however North Westerners turned out to be the most intrepid: they were the most likely to read through the entire pile, even ahead of competitive Londoners. The research was carried out by online anonymous diary site Pencourage.com as part of an experiment to discover how nosy and gossipy we are as a nation. The survey, which polled 2,000 individuals, also tested our our ability to keep a secret. The region most likely to tittle-tattle was the East Midlands, with a staggering 72 per cent admitting they’d be unable to keep the secret of an office affair . The telling research found that on discovering a work colleague was having an affair, a staggering two thirds of us would be unable to keep the knowledge to ourselves. Only a meager 31 per cent would consider it to be ‘none of our business’ and keep mum. Of the two thirds (66 per cent) who would be unable to contain themselves, a relatively cautious 36 per cent would only share the information with people outside the office but a less discreet 30 per cent admit they’d let the cat out of the bag at work. Of those, one in ten would purposely drop subtle hints or try to share the secret anonymously, one in eight (13 per cent) would tell their closest co-workers and 4 per cent say that despite their best intentions they’d be likely to accidentally let it slip. A rather judgmental 2 per cent would share the information openly with everyone, feeling morally justified to do so. A new study into nosy Britain revealed 41 per cent would not be able to resist looking at confidential documents . One percent would ‘tell everyone’ because the secret is ‘too exciting to withhold!’ The region most likely to tittle-tattle was the East Midlands, with a staggering 72 per cent admitting they’d be unable to keep the secret. Once again Wales and Scotland were the most discreet, with 45 per cent and 42 per cent respectively saying it was ‘none of their business’ Those most likely to intend to keep schtum yet admit they’d probably accidentally let the secret slip were North Westerners – six times more likely to do this than East Anglians. Surprisingly, Scots were the most likely by far to feel justified if openly sharing the information as ‘an affair is morally wrong’ – three times more likely to say this than other regions. No respondents from Northern Ireland, East Anglia or the East Midlands chose this option, compared with three per cent of Scots. The poll was conducted by Pencourage, which already hosts close to 40,000 anonymous journals covering intimate aspects of people’s lives: from cheeky sexual escapades to accounts of infidelity, bereavement and addiction. It allows users – who cannot be identified even by the website’s own internal staff – to post 200 words about their lives each day alongside music, videos or photos. Pencourage founder Peter Clayton said: 'The stratospheric growth our site has enjoyed since it launched shows there is clearly a natural curiosity about others’ private thoughts and real life confessions – as well as an inherent desire to share our own secrets, so we wanted to find out how these attitudes vary around the UK. 'This research into our penchant for tittle-tattle shows that whilst Britons might have a reputation of keeping a ‘stiff upper lip’ we appear to have a very mobile lower one!'","Study investigates whether participants would snoop at colleagues payslip or blab about their affair .

"Toasted pigeon was a favourite dish of Neanderthals, who unlike their brutish reputation, had the brains and skill to catch the birds. The discovery was made after an excavation of Gorham's Cave where Neanderthals are thought to have lived for nearly 100,000 years ago. Archaeologists unearthed leftovers of Neanderthal feasts, which included pigeon bone, in sediments that built up between 28,000 and 67,000 years ago on the east face of Gibraltar. Roasted pigeon was a favourite dish of Neanderthals. Pictured here are cut marks found on the excavated pigeon bones, possibly made with stone tools used during cooking . Researchers believe the Neanderthals hunted wild pigeons, possibly by climbing steep cliffs to reach raid their nests. So far, 150 ancient bird species have been identified from bones found in the cave sediments. Many were of rock doves, the ancestors of modern feral pigeons. Twenty eight of the pigeon bones had cuts from stone tools and 15 had tooth marks. So far, 150 ancient bird species had been identified from bones found in the cave sediments. Twenty eight of the pigeon bones had cuts from stone tools (pictured) and 15 had tooth marks . The discovery in Gorham's Cave, GIbraltar where Neanderthals are thought to have lived 100,000 years ago . Some also had signs of charring, which may have been created when the meat cooked on an open fire. These signs were on the pigeon wing and leg bones where the best meat could be found. The thicker bones had puncture marks from smaller bones, which can be caused when chicken wings twisted to get to the meat.' 'They liked what we like and went for the breasts, the drumsticks and the wings,' study author Clive Finlayson, director of the Gibraltar Museum, told journalists of the bone analysis. 'They had the knowledge and technology to do this.' Professor Finlayson said the bone analysis added to a growing body of evidence that Neanderthals were more sophisticated than was once widely believed. So far, 150 ancient bird species have been identified from bones found in the cave sediments. Many were of rock doves, the ancestors of modern feral pigeons . You might think of Neanderthals as lumbering cavemen who feasted on slaughtered beasts, but new research in June suggests they preferred far more refined cuisine. A study of ancient fossilised poo left behind by our distant cousins reveals they had a diet which featured vegetables and nuts. Researchers from Massachusetts Institute of Technology and University of La Laguna in Spain used analytical techniques to find faecal biomarkers from five samples of poo found in El Salt, southern Spain. The scientists analysed each sample for metabolised versions of animal-derived cholesterol, as well as phytosterol, a cholesterol-like compound found in plants. While all samples contained signs of meat consumption, two samples showed traces of plants - the first direct evidence that Neanderthals may have enjoyed omnivorous meals. 'This makes them even more human,' he said.' In June, researchers at MIT reported evidence from 50,000-year-old Neanderthal poo that those living in southern Spain also ate nuts and vegetables. Other researchers recently found plant microfossils trapped in Neanderthal teeth - a finding that suggests the species may have led a more complex lifestyle, harvesting and cooking a variety of plants in addition to hunting prey. It was not known how the birds in this latest study were captured, though the team speculated they would have been relatively easy to snatch from their nests 'by a moderately skillful and silent climber'. The researchers conceded the scorch marks were not conclusive proof of cooking, as they could be from waste disposal or accidental burning. 'Traditionally in human history, the pigeon has been considered a symbol of peace, love, and fertility, three attributes that are deeply interwoven,' the researchers said. 'Its origins may well have been with the Neanderthals who exploited this very fertility in a way that allowed them to target them for food without depleting their numbers.'

"Lara Logan of CBS News is being quarantined in a South Africa hotel for three weeks as a precaution after visiting an American-run hospital treating Ebola patients in Liberia for a '60 Minutes' report that aired Sunday. CBS said Monday that Logan's 21-day self-quarantine will end this Friday. Neither Logan nor the four other CBS employees in South Africa have shown any sign that they are infected with the virus. Logan, speaking in a '60 Minutes Overtime' web interview from the room where the CBS crew put its report together, admitted to some cabin fever as she waits out her stay. She said the South African government had given the crew permission to work at the hotel. Scroll down for video . Quarantined: CBS News reporter Lara Logan is spending 21 days in quarantine, following a visit to an American-run hospital treating Ebola patients in Liberia . Holed up: Logan, seen with Geoff Mabberley, who helped her team steer clear of the Ebola virus, admitted to experiencing cabin fever . Contained: A preview of Logan's report from Liberia showed her at the hospital speaking with doctors. Shoes are hung upside down and dried as a cleaning precaution . 'We wanted to try, as much as possible, to minimize our exposure to anybody while we still had to get our piece done,' she said. 'We were very mindful of the fact that this 21-day period after you've been in an Ebola-affected country is very important to everyone.' The interview showed Logan and CBS security worker Geoff Mabberley in a room stuffed with equipment. 'We haven't traveled far from the room that you can see,' she said. The '60 Minutes' report detailed her precautions while in Liberia, including being hosed down with a chlorine solution, having her temperature taken frequently and making sure not to touch people. Explaining the context behind an Ebola quarantine, Logan said in the '60 Minutes Overtime' interview that 'the scientists and the doctors that we spoke to said that the real quarantine period for Ebola is actually ten days. 'So, when they look at the 21 days, what they're actually looking at is two ten-day periods where, of quarantine or of not showing any symptoms other than Ebola, and then an extra day added for security because the latest that the disease ever showed in animals was within that period.' Mabberley traveled with the crew with the responsibility of watching everyone's interactions to minimize any chance they could be infected. Speaking about Mabberley, Logan said during the interview 'Geoff just watched us every minute of the day, and sprayed us with chlorine and disinfected everything - the drivers, the cars, the luggage - every time you got out, came out of somewhere.' 'I'm just constantly looking at what they're touching, where they're going, where they're standing, where they're moving to, to try and preempt the next move, try and protect them from that next move,' Mabberley said in the interview. 'And it is difficult.' Back at work: It was Logan's second '60 Minutes' story since her return from a forced leave of absence after questions were raised about her role in a disputed story on the deadly 2012 raid at the U.S. mission in Benghazi, Libya . Neither Logan nor the four other CBS employees in South Africa have shown any sign that they are infected with the virus . A cameraman who was working for NBC News in Liberia contracted the virus but recovered last month. Nancy Snyderman, the NBC News medical correspondent who worked there, was asked to go into voluntary quarantine when she arrived home but that was made mandatory after she was spotted leaving her home. ABC's Richard Besser was not quarantined upon his return from Liberia because the ABC team was judged not to have had exposure to the virus. Logan briefly teared up when talking about William, a 5-year-old boy featured in her report who was cared for in the hospital by his father but who later died. She said she has a son the same age. 'It's so heartbreaking,' she said in the interview. 'It's really been hard on all of us, not just on me. And the scale of this tragedy and the brutality of this virus, the way it tears through families, and all the children. 'There are so many children. And so, you know, such little children. Of course that's - that's also one of the things that tears at your heart. And they're young children in these wards who have nobody to care for them.' She also revealed in the interview that 'On the grave markers, instead of writing, ""Born and died,"" the way you would in the U.S., the Liberians write, ""Sunrise and sunset"" to mark a person's time on the earth. 'And that, for us, was symbolic of the spirit of the people that really moved us.' It was Logan's second '60 Minutes' story aired since her return from a forced leave of absence after questions were raised about her role in a disputed story on the deadly 2012 raid at the U.S. mission in Benghazi, Libya.","Lara Logan of CBS News is being quarantined in a South Africa hotel for three weeks as a precaution .

"Mick Jagger was diagnosed with acute traumatic stress disorder in the wake of L’Wren Scott’s death, court papers reveal. The Rolling Stones frontman has been largely silent about his feelings since his girlfriend of 13 years hanged herself on March 17. But privately he was left so upset that he was told by a doctor not to perform for a month, according to papers filed in an £8million battle between the band and their insurers. The Stones were forced to postpone the Australia and New Zealand leg of their world tour when Miss Scott died – but their insurers refused to pay out, saying their policy did not cover suicide. Scroll down for video . L'Wren Scott's death prompted the Rolling Stones to postpone a concert tour of Australia and New Zealand, but their insurers are battling with the band to not pay out for losses . Acute traumatic stress disorder can cause flashbacks, nightmares, feelings of guilt and emotional numbness. If these symptoms continue for more than a month it becomes post-traumatic stress disorder, often associated with soldiers returning from war zones. In a High Court filing as part of the fight with their insurers, the band state: ‘Upon learning of Miss Scott’s death, Sir Mick Jagger became stricken with grief. ‘Following examination by his physicians, Sir Mick Jagger was diagnosed as suffering from acute traumatic stress disorder. His physicians advised [him] not to perform for at least 30 days.’ The Stones had taken out a £15million policy to cover the costs if they were forced to cancel their tour. But the underwriters claim that because Miss Scott committed suicide, they do not have to pay out the £8million the band are demanding. The disclosure is the most revealing insight yet into Jagger’s feelings. He has so far given only one brief interview about Miss Scott’s suicide. In a statement, he said he would ‘never forget her’, adding: ‘I am still struggling to understand how my lover and best friend could end her life in this tragic way.’ Her death has resulted in a bitter insurance battle on two continents, with lawsuits filed in the US and in London. Jagger was 'diagnosed as suffering from acute traumatic stress disorder' after Scott's death and was advised by doctors not to perform for at least 30 days . In July, the Stones sued their insurers in the High Court, alleging that they had ‘failed and refused’ to pay the £8million, and seeking interest and costs on top of that sum. The eight insurers are led by Cathedral Capital and Talbot 2002 Underwriting Capital Limited, both based in London. They responded by claiming that Miss Scott’s death was not ‘sudden and unforeseen’ or ‘beyond her control’ and so did not qualify for a payout. They also claimed it was ‘reasonable to infer Miss Scott had been suffering from a mental illness’ that was ‘traceable to, or accelerated by, a condition for which she had received or been recommended medical attention’. A pre-existing condition of this kind could affect any payout. The insurers appeared to dispute the idea that Jagger, 71, was so deeply upset, and claimed that the doctor who diagnosed him had not actually carried out an examination. They wrote: ‘It does not appear that Sir Mick Jagger was assessed at any time by a qualified psychiatrist or anyone else suitably qualified with sufficient expertise to make a diagnosis of acute stress disorder.’ Court documents revealed that Jagger has 18 people on his insurance policy, including Ms Scott, Jerry Hall, seven children and four grandchildren . The Rolling Stones frontman published a statement on his website soon after  L'Wren Scott's death saying he was struggling to understand why she would end her life . The only proof they had seen was a letter from a doctor, who was not a psychiatrist and did not actually see the patient, the papers state. Last month, the insurers filed a lawsuit in New York’s Federal Court, and subpoenaed Adam Glassman, the executor of Scott’s will, the New York City medical examiner, and Brittany Penebre, her British assistant, in an attempt to gain access to any emails or messages about an ‘actual or alleged attempt at self harm by Miss Scott’ as well as her general mental health, or an ‘actual or alleged suicide attempt’. Meanwhile in Utah, where Miss Scott grew up, a judge has ruled that the insurers will be allowed to seek documents and testimony from Miss Scott’s brother, Randall Bambrough, to find out more about her mental state. However, Mr Bambrough told a local newspaper that he had yet to receive a summons. Miss Scott, a fashion designer and model, was 49 when her body was found in her Manhattan apartment by Miss Penebre. An autopsy confirmed her death was suicide. Her fashion business had been £4.6million in debt and she had abruptly cancelled her show at London Fashion Week, supposedly due to technical difficulties. There were also reports she and Jagger had split up, leaving her ‘devastated’, although Jagger’s spokesman denied this. Documents filed at the district court in Salt Lake City, Utah, reveal Miss Scott was on a long list of family on the Stones’ insurance policy. Also on Jagger’s list were his ex-wives Jerry Hall and Bianca Jagger, former girlfriends, seven children and four grandchildren. The documents give a fascinating insight into how the insurance policy worked. The revenue for the tour was expected to be £28million, and this could have gone up if 15 extra European dates were added. The insurers agreed to pay out up to 50 per cent in case of tragedy. A spokesman for the Rolling Stones declined to comment. Lawyers for the insurers did not return calls for comment. Hell-raisers: Ronnie Wood and Keith Richards . The Rolling Stones may still be going strong, but their court documents reveal that their disgruntled insurers are well aware of the toll taken by years of the rockstar lifestyle. Hidden among the fine print of their tour insurance policy is a long list of exceptions – health issues for which each member of the ageing band is not covered. For example, and perhaps not surprisingly, the insurers say they will not pay out if anything happens to guitarist Keith Richards related to ‘alcohol abuse, liver failure and/or disease and osteoarthritis’. More unusually, anything to do with the injury that he suffered in 2006, when he was hit on the head by a coconut, will not be covered either. For Ronnie Wood, anything to do with ‘alcohol abuse’ is also not covered. The exemptions for drummer Charlie Watts include any conditions related to the cancer he was diagnosed with in 2004 or his sciatica. The documents show the band expected to receive £28million for their tour. Just three shows in Japan were worth £9million.","Jagger diagnosed with traumatic stress disorder after L'Wren Scott died .

"Dozens of new types of coral have been identified in a remote section of the Great Barrier Reef and it has been described as a 'lost world' by researchers. Scientists from the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) and Torres Strait Regional Authority have been studying the area of Torres Strait for the last three years. Their findings were presented at National Environmental Research Program conference in Cairns last week, reports the Cairns Post. Dozens of new coral species have been identified at the Torres Strait (This is a stock picture) The researchers were looking at five different sites from central to eastern Torres Strait and they discovered 91 new species of coral in the region. Dr Scott Bainbridge, from AIMS, said: 'These reefs are in extremely good condition. 'They are managed by the local communities, and potentially these may also be important to southern reefs as well. 'We don’t know about their connectivity, like what role does Torres Strait play in keeping the health of the northern and southern GBR? 'It’s all undiscovered and extremely exciting,' reports the Cairns Post. The Torres Strait lies between Australia and New Guinea and is approximately 150 km wide at its narrowest extent. Scientists have been carrying out research near Cape York for three years (This is a stock picture) The researchers also found the Torres Strait to be one of the most varied coral reef systems in the country. They also found the area to be 'largely undisturbed but not immune to pressures such as coral bleaching and crown-of-thorns outbreaks' reports the Cairns Post. The new records have been added to those at the Museum of Tropical Queensland.","Dozens of new coral species have been identified at the Torres Strait .

"Booking a holiday can be a Goliath-worthy financial tussle. With so many variables you can feel quite at sea. How do you know if you've got the best deal? Should you click-to-buy now or wait a few months and hope the price has dropped? To set you on the right tracks, and help you save potentially hundreds on your week away, these travel industry experts have revealed the top tips they use when looking for a bargain break, from booking on a Wednesday to setting up flight price alerts. Scroll down for video . Get in early: save on popular holidays by booking months ahead or last minute to grab deals. This is a view of Oia Santorini in Greece, one of Europe's most popular areas to visit. 1.) WEDNESDAY IS YOUR NEW BEST FRIEND . Instead of leaping on the nearest Saturday, think with a more mid-week mind. Less people fly on these days so flight prices drop to attract buyers. Filip Filipov at travel search site Skyscanner says, ‘Avoiding starting your trip on a weekend can make a huge impact on the price of flights. Try comparing travel from a Wednesday to Wednesday rather than a Friday to Friday.’ Thank god it's Wednesday: book mid week to save up to 50 per cent  on flights . Yes, it might mess up your working week but you could save 50 per cent or more. For example, a British Airways flight between London and New York this Saturday returning next Saturday could cost £784 ($1,285) whereas the a similar fight Wednesday to Wednesday is just £450 ($738). 2.) BOOK ONLINE OR THROUGH APPS . Often . holiday agents reward you for booking online or via their app. The . usual amount tends to hover at 10 per cent but it can be much more. Expedia’s mobile app offers up to 40 per cent savings on last minute . hotels booked via the app. Get the best deals during school holiday by booking nine months ahead and avoid financial misery . 3.) SET UP PRICE ALERTS . Some . websites offer to keep you in the loop when the price of marked . holidays or flights drop. This is something you should want to be a part . of, so long as you aren’t in a rush to book. Skyscanner . is one such website. Sign up to their alerts and they will email you . when the cost of a specific flight route drops. You can track up to 25 . flight options at once. Tropical dreams: travel to the Caribbean in May or June to save 30 per cent on rooms in many hotels . Last minute deals  before and after main holiday times can win you 50 per cent off full price hotels and flights . 4.) BOOK OUT OF SEASON . Rebecca Baines of Mr & Mrs Smith says, ‘While you do need to be careful about travelling out of season when obviously weather can be less reliable, you do get the best rates.’ If you are booking a Caribbean holiday go in May or June, when you can save 30 per cent on rooms compared with December to April. It might rain, but it never gets cold. ‘In Europe, travelling in May, September and October is often best – you miss the peak crowds, and hotels usually lower their rates,’ says Rebecca. The general rule it to travel a month before or after peak times so that the weather is roughly okay but the rates substantially lower. App-solutely amazing! Save up to 40 per cent by booking hotels, flights and trips through apps and online . 5.) BOOK EARLY . Of course it’s obvious, but the earlier you book the better. Rebecca Baines, travel consultant at Mr & Mrs Smith says, ‘If you want to get the best deal for a holiday in Europe, you need to book as far in advance as possible - particularly if you want the pick of the best (or most affordable) bedrooms. For  most popular European destinations (Tuscany, the Amalfi Coast and Greece) that means booking as much as nine months in advance. Room rates are usually at their highest when availability is at its lowest.’ Many hotels offer early non-refundable early bird bookings. Bob Atkinson, travel expert at TravelSupermarket, says it’s even more crucial to plan ahead for school holidays. ‘These dates sell out quickly and will rarely go down in price. Don’t travel in the first or last weeks of the school holidays – these are the busiest and most expensive.’ Sign up to email alerts from websites such as Skyscanner and find out when prices suddenly drop . 6.) BOOK LATE (ESPECIALLY IN MAY AND SEPTEMBER) It may go completely go against the previous point, but if you aren’t booking a trip during school holidays - and like living on the edge - gambling by booking late can pay off. Bob Atkinson says you can often save as much as 50 per cent in last minute hotel and flight deals as holiday providers sink prices to get you on board if tickets haven’t sold. ‘These tend to occur just before and just after the main holiday periods with the best late deals usually in May and June and also in late September and October. Last minute travel in January is also often cheap.’ 7.) MIX AND MATCH . Skyscanner's Filip Filipov says, ‘It pays to mix and match your airlines, you can often save money by flying out and back with different airlines or from different airports.’ It’s worth taking time to have a look around and doing your homework - it could save you hundreds. One night in Paris! If you want to visit France's capital you should travel in May, September or October . 8.) DON'T GET CAUGHT OUT AT CHECK IN . When booking flights, use online search tools that  find the lowest fares and show you what extra fees might be added, so you aren't surprised at the gate or check-in. TripAdvisor has a flight search tool which helps you find low fares, view baggage fees, compare  legroom and view previous passenger photos from inside the plane. SeatGuru is also a helpful site. It will show you where is best to sit on the plane, remind you about airline hand luggage requirements, how long you have to board and  rules on pets and children. Savvy savings: websites such as SeatGuru and TripAdvisor can help you save unexpected airport costs . 9.) BE FLEXIBLE . Instead of searching by location or date, search by price. On Skyscanner you can view all the prices of one flight path over a full month, so you can cherry pick the cheapest day. Or look by location if you are uncommitted to the final destination and check what the cheapest place to fly to is on the day you want to travel. Instead of searching by location or date, look by price and be flexible on where and when you go . TripAdvisor has a similar search function which lets you see real-time room price across a range of booking sites. Basically, if you can be flexible, you’ll be in the money. 10.) SEPTEMBER FOR FLIGHTS . You might just have time to squeeze in a long weekend away before the month is out. You can save 54 per cent on flight fares by travelling in September compared to  August. According to Skyscanner, travellers in Europe will save the most on flights to Alicante, where the average flight price drops to £133 ($218) in September compared to £286 ($469) in August and temperatures still hit the mid 20C. Quick getaway! Fly to Alicante in September save more than 50 per cent on the same flight in August . Other destinations including Faro, Barcelona and Tenerife also see price drops of over 20 per cent in September while those travelling between London and New York can expect to save 18 per cent at this time of year. If you’ve missed the boat, make sure you don’t next year. And finally….. After you’ve shaved off hundreds of pounds using clever holiday-booking tactics, there’s one last financial hurdle; booking the car. There are a few things you should know to avoid a  sting. If you have children, take your own child seat. Most airlines allow the complimentary carriage of child car seats which will save you having to hire one. Hire car know-how: take your own children's car seat and add an extra driver for only part of the week . It also could be worth considering taking out annual insurance waivers (from £40/$66) from companies such as www.questor-insurance.co.uk or www.insurance4carhire.com. If you need to add an additional driver, work out when you will need them. Most hire companies will let you add an extra driver for just part of your rental, rather than the whole week. The best fuel policy for most car hire companies is to return full, which incurs no charge. The costs for returning empty can be exorbitant.","TravelSupermarket, Skyscanner and Mr&Mrs Smith experts consulted .

"Job seekers: More young people are submitting video footage of themselves to employers when applying for jobs (library image) The era of drafting a short and punchy CV to catch the eye of employers may be coming to an end. Instead, job seekers are including videos of themselves - dubbed MeVies - as part of their applications to stand out from the crowd. Leading companies including Marks & Spencer are increasingly looking out for the videos, showcasing the personality of candidates, before offering interviews. Such footage can be sent in on a memory stick, uploaded to the internet or accessed through specialist recruitment websites. The trend was initially driven by well-educated young, tech-savvy job seekers experimenting with innovative ways to get noticed at a time when there are some 85 applications for every graduate post. But 83 per cent of employers now believe CVs fail to show ‘important qualities such as personality and confidence’, according to a poll by recruitment specialist Hello My Name Is... (HMNI). Almost three-quarters of firms went further and said CVs were no longer ‘an effective tool in securing a new job’. John Dixon, the executive director of general merchandise at Marks & Spencer, said: ‘As an employer, there’s no doubt it can be problematic differentiating between candidates by CV alone. The MeVie allows you to see beyond the CV to the person behind it. ‘The development of the MeVie is going to transform recruitment.’ The poll of 540 employers and 500 university students and recent graduates also revealed 85 per cent of young people believe their personality was just as important as their qualifications and experience when applying for jobs. HMNI co-founder Jonathan Flint said: ‘While the technology for video applications has been in place for some time, only now are candidates taking full advantage of this option, which in turn has given recruiters a real appetite for innovative applications.’ Statistics: Almost three-quarters of firms said CVs were no longer an effective tool in securing a new job . Business partner James Hyde added: ‘The MeVie is the leading trend in recruitment for 2014 and beyond. It’s set to revolutionise both the way people apply for jobs and the way recruiters shortlist applications, by embracing video as an effective solution to seeing beyond the CV. ‘Our research confirms it can be really tricky for recruiters to differentiate between candidates’ written applications. But a MeVie gives job-seekers the ability to showcase so much more than their qualifications.’ However, recruitment experts said a well-written CV still remains the priority when contacting prospective employers as human resources staff usually immediately reject poorly written examples. Earlier this year it emerged that a survey of 500 CVs had found a staggering 98 per cent with gross spelling mistakes, bad grammatical errors or poor presentation. Rob Power, recruitment manager at management, engineering and development consultancy Mott MacDonald said at the time: ‘A large percentage of the CVs that we receive have errors and it’s the first switch-off point for us. Spelling and grammatical errors are easily avoidable and simply show us that the candidate is lazy.’","Employers now looking out for MeVies - videos submitted by candidates .

"If the worst-case scenario predictions about rising sea levels are accurate, the majority of London could one day be lost underwater. Using estimates from the US Geological Survey, an urban planner has created a series of maps to show what damage could be caused if the ice sheets melt due to climate change. The only areas that would escape the worst of the flooding would be the highest points in the capital including Hampstead Heath, Shooter's Hill and parts of Crystal Palace. Scroll down for video . Using estimates from the US Geological Survey, an urban planner has created maps that show what damage could be caused to London if the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets melted. This GIF shows London following a 131ft (40 metre) rise up to an 262ft (80 metre) rise in global water levels . The maps and GIF were designed by visual artist Jeffrey Linn for his Spatialities site. He is currently working on a graphic novel with the University of Leeds to show how parts of the UK would look in 200 years if nothing is done to curb carbon emissions. According to the USGS, Earth’s climate has warmed around 1°C (1.8°F) over the past 100 years. If present trends continue, including an increase in global temperatures caused by increased greenhouse-gas emissions, it predicts many of the world’s mountain glaciers will disappear. For example, at the current rate of melting, most glaciers will vanish from Glacier National Park, Montana, by the middle of the next century. The maps and GIF were designed by visual artist Jeffrey Linn for his Spatialities site. He is currently working on a graphic novel with the University of Leeds to show how parts of the UK would look in 200 years if nothing is done to curb carbon emissions. This map shows London following a 181ft (40-metre) rise . Complete melting of  ice sheets could lead to a sea-level rise of about 262ft (80 metres), according to the USGS. If this happened, the only areas that would escape the worst of the flooding would be the highest points in the capital including Hampstead Heath, Shooter's Hill and parts of Crystal Palace . And in Iceland, glaciers will decrease by 40 per cent by 2100 and virtually disappear by 2200. Most of the current global land ice mass is located in the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets, and complete melting of these ice sheets could lead to a sea-level rise of about 262ft (80 metres). Mr Linn used this figure to show what London would look like if half of these ice sheets melted, and if they melted completely. He doesn't put a timeframe on when this could potentially occur. The designer has previously made maps showing how Seattle, Portland and San Diego would similarly look underwater. Last year, the Environment Agency created a similar map to Mr Linn's that highlighted what London would look like if sea levels continue to rise and the Thames Barrier wasn’t there to protect it. Parts of Beckton, Whitechapel and Southwark are shown under water (pictured) Last year, the Environment Agency created a similar map to Mr Linn's that highlighted what London would look like if sea levels continue to rise and the Thames Barrier wasn’t there to protect it.

Parts of Beckton, West Ham, Whitechapel and Southwark are all shown completely submerged with only a handful of spots across the floodplain escaping the flooding.

The movable Thames Barrier is made up of 10 gates attached to 128ft (39-metre) tall cofferdam piles, which are buried 79ft (24 metres) into the river bed. Individual gates can be closed in ten minutes but the whole barrier takes an hour and half to close completely. When fully raised, the barrier creates a solid steel wall preventing water flowing upstream towards the capital. The four main gates span 200ft (61 metres) and weigh over 3,300 tonnes each. Each gate is 66ft (20 metres) high and can hold back loads of up to 9,000 tonnes. A separate map released earlier this week revealed how New York could undergo devastating increases in temperature, rainfall and sea level as a result of global warming. A Nasa-backed report predicts annual temperatures will increase 4.1°F to 5.7°F by the 2050s and 5.3°F to 8.8°F by the 2080s. The frequency of heat waves is set rise to two per year in the 1980s to roughly six per year by the 2080s.

Pictured are observed and projected temperature in New York City.  The frequency of heat waves is set rise to two per year in the 1980s to roughly six per year by the 2080s, according to the report . The predictions were made by the New York City Panel on Climate Change (NPCC) 2015, which is co-chaired by Nasa researcher, Cynthia Rosenzweig. While New York summers will get even hotter, rainfall will increase four to 11 per cent by the 2050s and five to 13 per cent by the 2080s, the report predicts. Sea levels have already risen in New York City 1.1ft (0.3 metres) since 1900. That is almost twice the observed global rate of 0.5 to 0.7 inches per decade. Map of annual temperature changes in the Northeast in 2050. In New York, Nasa predicts annual temperatures will increase 4.1°F to 5.7°F by the 2050s and 5.3°F to 8.8°F by the 2080s .

Coastal areas of Staten Island and Manhattan will be battling high tides as sea level rises 10 inches in as little as five years, the report claims. The NPCC report follows a separate study which found the western US will face increasingly severe mega-droughts later this century. Since the year 2000, seven western states in the US has seen their driest periods in centuries. These states are Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming . And scientists in California have warned that the region may be experiencing a century-long 'mega-drought'. The warnings came after sediment studies showed California is currently experiencing the driest spell since 1580, and that the regular rainfall seen during the last century is likely to have been a temporary deviation in a cycle of droughts and very occasional rainfall over the last 3,000 years. In 2013, California received less rain than in any year since its formation as a state in 1850. However droughts lasting more than 100 years are far from unheard of in the state. Looking back over several thousand years, droughts have been known to last over a decade, and in some cases they can last a century. And the patterns tend to repeat, meaning another drought of this length will probably happen again in the future. Projections for sea level rise in New York City will increase from 11 inches to 21 inches by the 2050s, 18 inches to 39 inches by the 2080s, and, 22 inches to 50 inches. In the worst case, sea levels will rise by up to six feet (1.8 metres), by 2100.

"For holidaymakers staying in hotels, storing items in the minibar is sometimes the only way to keep items cool. However, guests may find they are now charged for doing so - after a traveller found a sign warning that putting her own items in the fridge in her room would cost her an extra $50 (£30). Keri Anderson, from Washington, was staying at the Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas when she was almost hit by the fee. Keri Anderson's photo of a sign in her Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino room warning of the extra charge . The Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino is owned by MGM Resorts International . Rooms at the luxury hotel can cost up to $595 (£363) a night - but she was told that items placed in the fridge would cost her extra. 'I had never encountered these sorts of charges before,' Ms Anderson told MailOnline Travel. The co-founder of travel blog HeelsFirstTravel.com had stored some wine overnight on top of the drinks in the minibar at the four-star hotel. She said she didn't think twice as she had never been charged before for placing her own items in her room fridge. A chance conversation with fellow delegates at a conference she was attending the next morning was ample warning for Ms Anderson, whose two-day stay at the property was her first there. Ms Anderson has stayed in a variety of properties all across the world and never encountered such a charge . Money, money, money:  Fees are set to earn hotels £1.4bn in revenue add-ons, a 6% increase from 2013 . She rushed back to her room  to remove the wine from the fridge. 'I was almost embarrassed that – even with all the experience I had – I was surprised by, and almost charged for, the mini-bar,' Ms Anderson continued. 'I've stayed in a bunch of hotels from a small boutique hotel on Easter Island, to a luxury suite overlooking the Bangkok skyline, to a two-bedroom villa on Koh Samui, and never come across this kind of fee. 'I thought my big problem was accidentally locking the minibar when trying to open it. But when I mentioned my issue to fellow conference attendees, their first response was, ""You didn't put the wine in the minibar did you? They might charge you for putting personal items in there"".' Small print: 'It was mentioned again in the little rate card, which I hadn't seen,' Ms Anderson said . 'Horrified, I ran back to my room. I had shoved the wine on top of the soda cans late at night as an afterthought, totally missing the little tag on one of the water bottles, since I wasn't planning on consuming anything. 'And it was mentioned again in the little rate card, which I hadn't seen since I wasn't eating anything.' She added: 'Mandalay Bay didn't actually charge me and though I find it rather annoying, and even a trifle sneaky, it doesn't seem significantly different than the way other Las Vegas hotels are operating. 'That said, I'll never open another hotel fridge without reading every piece of paper in the room first!' Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino: A study conducted by New York University's hospitality school has found that hidden hotel fees add an extra 2% in hotel revenue, the majority of which is pure profit . MailOnline Travel has contacted MGM Resorts International, who own Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino, for a comment. Last month it was revealed that hidden fees were set to earn hotels £1.4bn in revenue add-ons, a six per cent increase from 2013. A study by Bjorn Hanson, a professor at New York University's hospitality school, noted that although these fees only add an extra two per cent in revenue, the majority of that money is pure profit.","Keri Anderson from Washington DC was 'horrified' at the $50 minibar add-on .

"This is the horrifying moment a father accidentally shot a firework into a trampoline where his daughter was playing. Peter Watson, 40, of Middlesbrough on Teesside, looked on in horror as the rocket fired directly into the enclosed trampoline - turning a playful bouncing session into a scene of sheer panic. CCTV footage captured sparks spraying around the netting as Mr Watson's daughter Kacey, nine, and a family friend's brother, ten, desperately try to escape. Scroll down for video . Panic: One child cowers on the side of the trampoline while Peter Watson's daughter Kacey becomes obscured from view by the intense explosion of sparks . Taxi driver Mr Watson said: 'I was in total shock, I just immediately ran over to check that they were both okay, I couldn't believe what had happened. 'Luckily, nobody got hurt, but it was certainly a fright, fireworks can be very dangerous even if they are set off correctly. 'We were very lucky, the children could have suffered some very nasty burns. 'Someone was looking down on us all that night and I won't be doing any more fireworks any time soon.' Calm: The two children are seen happily bouncing on the trampoline in CCTV footage before disaster strikes . After attending an organised fireworks display locally, the Watson family had continued the party back at their home, buying £50 worth of rockets. Mr Watson's other daughter, Sam, 21, a health carer, said: 'We were all in the garden. My dad and my friend's boyfriend set up the fireworks outside of the front gate and on a grassy area nearby. 'My dad put the kids on the trampoline, as it's the well away from the house and what he thought would be the safest place. 'The rocket that went wrong was the last one, my dad lit it and we all watched as it flew off the wrong way, then bounced off the wall of our house and landed onto the trampoline. 'Kacey and the other boy who were playing on the trampoline tried to run and get off but Kacey fell and got her leg stuck in the netting. Luckily they both managed to get out without getting burnt. 'It was very scary as all the kids were in the garden and we had no idea where the firework would land. 'Kacey was shaking and very scared during the whole night but she's fine now, I don't think she'll feel the same around fireworks in the future though.' Alert: After Peter Watson lets off the firework, smoke fills the area and a child standing in the garden falls to the ground . Terrifying: Sparks fly around the netted enclosure while the two children desperately try to avoid being burnt . Mr Watson, who suffered a serious injury to his hands 15 years ago in another firework-based accident, thinks people should learn from his mistakes and take more care with fireworks in general. He added: 'Please don't buy any fireworks online or from Facebook. Only buy them from a shop who has a licence to sell them.' 'Yes, the whole incident has put me off fireworks for a while. Next year, I'm not even going to buy a pack of sparklers.' Mr Watson has stressed that he had lit the firework according to the instructions on the packet and that it flew off in the wrong direction. He added: 'I did everything I was supposed to do. The firework was pointing away from the house when I lit it, but it shot off in the wrong direction. 'It hit the side of the house and bounced into the trampoline.'I don't want to be portrayed as an irresponsible father because that is simply not the case.'","Rocket was lit by taxi driver Peter Watson, 40, of Middlesbrough on Teesside .

"A married middle school teacher was given a long seven-year prison sentence on Monday, after admitting to having sex with one of her 14-year-old students. Sarah Raymo, 32, was arrested last January after rumors started swirling around Bay City, Michigan's T.L. Handy Middle School that she was sleeping with one of her eighth-grade students. The unidentified victim testified eight months ago that he had sex with Raymo six to eight times, both in school and at her home. The teacher, who appears to have been married at the time of her arrest early this year, was set to go to trial in late September, but instead took a plea deal and admitted guilt to two counts of third-degree criminal sexual conduct to have four counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct dropped. Sentenced: Sarah Raymo was sentenced to 7.5 - 15 years in prison on Monday, after admitting to having sex with one of her 14-year-old students. Pictured above in Bay County Court on November 10 . Tearing up: The judge gave Raymo a penalty on the high-end of the sentencing spectrum due to the 'horrendous' nature of her crime. Pictured above in court on November 10 . Former school: Raymo was a teacher at T.L. Handy Middle School in Bay City, Michigan last January when she was arrested . On Monday, a circuit court judge sentenced Raymo to 7.5 to 15 years in prison  calling her inappropriate relationship with a minor student 'horrendous'. The maximum prison term for the charges is 15 years in prison. As she received her sentence, Raymo  started shaking and breathing heavily, while wiping away tears, MLive.com reported. She declined to make a statement. Arrest: The unidentified 14-year-old student said he had sex with Raymo (pictured in January) six to eight times either in her classroom or at her home . 'As a teacher, you're placed in a position of trust over your students,' Circuit Court Judge Kenneth W Schmidt said. 'That trust was violated when you elected to freely and willingly have sex with one of your students, no matter what the circumstances were surrounding your acceptance of the fact that you were going to have sex with this young man. The victim has been greatly impacted by this. He switched schools and is seeking therapy. 'Taking everything into consideration and including the fact that you violated the trust placed in you as a teacher of students, particularly the age of these students — we're talking about eighth grade — the higher end of the guidelines is appropriate,' judge Schmidt added. However, Raymo's defense attorney  Matthew Reyes believes the judge made a mistake in the sentencing. 'It's just wrong. I don't feel the judge knows the file like I do,' Reyes said. 'She's probably not ready for what's ahead.' Reyes agrees that  what his client did is wrong, but he doesn't see her actions as predatory behavior. In a statement,  Reyes explained that while the victim could not consent to sex with Raymo because of his age, he did initiate the relationship with letters of a sexual nature. The victim allegedly started speaking to his teacher through classroom journals, which then transitioned to a text message conversation. After that, Raymo asked the student to stay after school one day and then the two had sex in her classroom.  The relationship was exposed when the student started telling fiends about the affair and it spread around school. Head down: As she received her sentence on Monday, Raymo shook and cried. Pictured above in court on Monday . 'I acknowledge that the victim is incapable of consenting to sexual intercourse, but the victim is not incapable of initiating sexual conversations,' Reyes said. The parents of the victim did not attend the sentencing hearing, but Chief Assistant Prosecutor Nancy E Borushki read a prepared statement on their behalf. 'What is very clear to the parents of the victim and to myself is that this is somebody who took advantage of their child. There has been much said out there about how lucky the victim is, and that this is not a big deal, but this is a big deal to not only the victim, but also his parents,' the statement read. 'This crime is a crime of selfishness and a betrayal of trust... she used a student and she used a child to satisfy whatever selfish needs or issues that she was trying to address. I think it's important not only to the parents, but to the victim in this case, and the community at large that when you betray trust in this fashion that there should be a severe penalty.' According to an online wedding registry on the site TheKnot, Dominowski married Christopher Raymo in September 2012 in Essexville. The woman's husband and mother appeared at her arraignment in January, but it's unclear if she is still married to her husband.","Sarah Raymo, 32, was arrested last January after it was revealed she had sex with an eighth grade student six to eight times .

The party’s leader was filmed sitting on the sofa with the TV review show’s posh couple Steph and Dom for a Gogglebox spin-off, Channel 4’s chief creative officer Jay Hunt has revealed. She told Radio Times that the show would be a ‘rip-roaring alcohol-fuelled watch,’ adding: ‘He gets p***** with them, but they also give him a grilling.’ The documentary, entitled At Home With Steph And Dom, will be broadcast next year. Gogglebox, featuring a regular group of opinionated friends and families discussing the week’s TV shows, has been a surprise hit for the broadcaster. She said that Channel 4 was now the 'alternative mainstream'. Mrs Hunt added: ‘We have found in Gogglebox an array of characters that people have taken into their hearts – they just love them. Gogglebox is my take on the week. We have a show that feels unmissable.’ She said: ‘When Channel 4 launched it was an outsider channel that represented voices that weren’t heard elsewhere. ‘We are still trying to talk to lots of people in the country and reflect Britain back to itself, we do it with a slightly different perspective.’ The former controller of BBC1 said that she was a 'conspicuous woman in an industry that is still dominated by men'. She said of some of the criticism which has been directed against her: 'You have to take it on the chin, but of course it hurts. You become inhuman if you're not affected by people being critical and it should give you pause for thought. It always gives me pause for thought.' Hunt, who earned £497,000 in 2013, defended her salary, saying: 'We are commercially funded. 'We don't take public money. In the nicest possible way, my salary is set by the board. And I think you need to talk to them about that.' The party leader will join posh couple Steph and Dom on a Gogglebox spin-off to be broadcast next year .","UKIP leader was filmed for a Gogglebox spin-off to be broadcast next year .

"A Romanian television presenter was left nursing a bruised ego after this bizarre stunt went horribly wrong. It all started when the host attempted to climb a metal ladder that was being held up by two women as he tried to demonstrate how a local singer, dubbed the Beyonce of Romania, became famous. But, as he ascended the ladder while describing the gypsy singer's rise to fame, he met the opposite fate with a humiliating fall. A bizarre stunt went horribly wrong on Romanian programme Bad But Good when host tried to climb a ladder . Held up by only his two female assistants, the women struggled under his weight as he ascended . Audience members watched in bemusement as 33-year-old Mihai Morar, the presenter of the programme called Bad But Good, tumbled off the ladder as his assistant, who was struggling to hold it up under his weight, came crashing down with him. After falling face-first into the hard floor, Morar jumped up and shouted: 'Jesus Christ! What a hit. I got it straight in the head.' His lovely assistant was knocked onto her back as the ladder fell against her chest. He quickly fell face-first towards the studio floor, taking his two co-workers down with him . After hitting the floor, the host cried out: 'Jesus Christ! What a hit! I got it straight in the head!' Thankfully, no one was seriously injured - though the TV host did suffer from a severely bruised ego . Viewer Ion Maniu, 25, from Bucharest, said: 'It was all very strange and much more bad than good. 'I didn't really get what he was trying to show and then he fell off and landed on his face while his assistant was knocked over by the ladder which had hit her hard in the chest. 'Full credit to her, she got up and continued smiling. 'But he didn't seem to pay any attention.' A spokesperson for Morar said: 'Mihai hit his head and had to be taken to hospital after the show. He is OK now though.'","Bizarre stunt went horribly wrong on programme called Bad But Good .

"The CPS has withdrawn the allegation that Mr Morrison (pictured) harassed his former girlfriend . Former Manchester United and England Under 21 footballer Ravel Morrison has been cleared of threatening to throw acid in the face of his ex-girlfriend and have her killed. He was accused of making the threats against Reah Mansoor, 19, as part of a campaign of harassment that it was alleged lasted from January 2010 to July this year. The talented footballer was also accused of threatening to blow up Miss Mansoor's house. But the Crown Prosecution Service has now formally withdrawn the allegation, and a verdict of not guilty was formally recorded today during a hearing at Manchester Crown Court which the footballer attended. The West Ham United player, 21, who is currently on loan at Cardiff City, will still stand trial on the remaining charges of assault against Miss Mansoor and her mother, Parveen Mansoor. Mr Morrison, who is originally from Manchester, pleaded not guilty to two counts of assault by beating and one of assault causing actual bodily harm on 24 July. He was arrested in the early hours of July 27 following reports that Miss Mansoor had been assaulted outside a Manchester nightclub and at an address in Salford. Her 39-year-old mother also claimed she had been attacked. The former Manchester United player denied the harassment charge at a preliminary hearing held in August. The midfielder was bailed on condition he lives at an address in Cardiff and does not contact his ex-girlfriend and Ms Mansoor, 39. He cannot enter the Greater Manchester area unless he has a court appearance or when he plays in his professional capacity. The England U21 player, pictured with his mother Sharon Ryan, will still stand trial on January 26 for three remaining charges of assault against Reah Mansoor and her mother, Parveen Mansoor . The talented footballer was accused of harassing Miss Mansoor, 19, over four years but the Crown Prosecution Service withdrew the allegation at Manchester Crown Court today . The midfielder, who is currently on loan at Cardiff City (pictured in a match against Millwall) was described by Sir Alex Ferguson as the most talented 14-year-old he had ever seen . Mr Morrison played for Manchester United as a youth player and was regarded by Sir Alex Ferguson as the most talented 14-year-old he had ever seen. But a raft of off-field behavioural problems led Ferguson to sell him to West Ham for £650,000 in January 2012. West Ham manager Sam Allardyce later loaned him to Birmingham and Queens Park Rangers. Mr Morrison, who has four England Under-21 caps, is currently playing for Championship club Cardiff City on a three-month loan deal.

"Longtime Illinois congressman Phil Crane has died of lung cancer at age 84. The Chicago-born Republican became known as a an anti-tax crusader and pre-Reagan advocate of limited government. Mr Crane died Saturday night at his daughter's home in Jefferson, Maryland, surrounded by his family, a representative said. Rest in peace: Long-serving Illinois congressman Phil Crane died of lung cancer, aged 84 . A history professor before he turned to politics, he is survived by seven of his eight children, one daughter died tragically at 31, and his wife Arlene. Crane represented Chicago's far northwest suburbs for 35 years and was the longest-serving House Republican when he was defeated in 2004 by Democrat and then-political newcomer Melissa Bean. Crane also made an unsuccessful run for the Republican presidential nomination in 1980, losing out to the eventual winner, Ronald Reagan, who would go on to become the politician most closely associated with the modern conservative movement. But Crane had touted what he saw as the virtue of smaller government going back to the 1960s, spelling out his vision of a stripped down, low-tax federal government in his 1976 book, 'The Sum of Good Government.' 'Phil was conservative before it was cool to be conservative,' said Eric Elk, a congressional aide to Crane through much of the 1990s. Longserving: Crane, picture din 2004, represented Chicago's far northwest suburbs for 35 years and was the longest-serving House Republican when he was defeated in 2004 . After a stint in the U.S. Army in the mid-1950s, Crane earned a PhD in history from Indiana University in 1963. He worked as an assistant history professor until 1967 at Bradley University, where also wrote on national politics. Crane was first elected to Congress in 1969 when a young Illinois congressman — future Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld — left to work for the Nixon administration. His conservative credentials didn't preclude personal relationships with politicians on the other end of the spectrum, Elk said. He recalls Crane and U.S. Rep. Charles Rangel, a Democrat, 'cracking each other up with jokes' before sometimes contentious sessions of the House Ways and Means Committee began. Crane also took time to write notes of encouragement to Democrat Dan Rostenkowski when the fellow U.S. congressman from Illinois ran into legal trouble. 'People would always say how Phil was such a conservative,' said Elk, who is now chief of staff for Illinois Sen. Mark Kirk. 'He was. But he was also a good person who cared about people.' Elk described Crane as erudite and well-read, recalling how he made a point of writing his children a full poem each year for their birthdays. 'He was most happy when he had those kids around him,' Elk said. Services are set for Thursday in Leesburg, Virginia.","Former Republican congressman Phil Crane died of lung cancer aged 84 .

"Lost and Found at Amsterdam airport just got a whole lot cuter, with the introduction of an investigative beagle. Airline KLM has employed a cute, uniform-wearing dog to help reunite passengers with lost items that they leave behind on planes. The pooch - appropriately named Sherlock - uses its tracking skills to smell the lost item then dash through Amsterdam Schipol Airport to find the appropriate owner. The energetic beagle can be seen bounding through the airport with mobiles and headphones tucked in his pouch and even carrying stuffed toys back to their rightful owners. A video released by the airline shows how Sherlock is doted on by staff. Sandra List, a member of KLM's Team Lost & Found said: 'I think he is a real asset to the company . Puppy power! Sherlock the beagle comes to the rescue to return a missing phone . Leaps and bounds: The unusual lost and found system has delighted passengers at Amsterdam Schipol . 'Our main goal is to return lost items to owners as fast as possible. I really love that we're getting some help with that.' But rescuing abandoned items from planes is a tough job and Sherlock certainly needed some training. His handler Dirk van Driel, explained: 'We train for muscle strength endurance and of course socialisation. On the trail: The dog sniffs the item then dashes through the airport to find its owner . Reunited: One man shows his delight as his expensive headphones are returned to him . Star of the show: Sherlock happily poses for pictures with grateful passengers . 'When you see the reactions of the passengers that really is amazing.' Sherlock has become something of a star at the airport, with grateful customers posing for selfies with him and staff showing him with attention. One woman who works on KLM's check-in desk said: 'He drops by regularly but I have to admit I do spoil him a bit.'","Sherlock work with KLM's lost and found team to return forgotten items .

"James Bird, 53, (pictured) faces a string of sex offence charges against a young pupil at a school dating back more than ten years. A primary school headteacher is accused of forcing a nine-year-old boy to perform a sex act in his office after the pupil had been 'naughty' in class, a court heard. James Bird, 53, faces a string of sex offence charges against a young pupil at a school dating back more than ten years. The headteacher allegedly ordered the child into his office after he had been sent out of the classroom by his teacher. While in his office, Bird is accused of committing four counts of gross indecency with the boy, who was aged nine and 10 at the time. Bird, who denies the charges, was suspended from his top post at Newton Bluecoat Church of England Primary School, near Preston, Lancashire, following his arrest, which is believed to be related to incidents at another school between September 1, 2002 and April 30, 2004. At Preston Crown Court today Michael Jones, prosecuting, said that the victim, who is now 21 years old, called police at 2.40 am on December 11 last year to report the crimes. Mr Jones said: 'He told officers he had been forced to perform oral sex on headteacher James Bird. 'He said when he had been a naughty child for his teacher, who he didn't like, he was sent out to the headteacher's office and had to perform sexual acts. 'He said it started when he was sent out of class. 'When he was in the corridor, the defendant would take him to his office and he said this happened on seven or eight occasions.' Bird was suspended from his job as headteacher at Newton Bluecoat CE Primary School, near Preston (pictured) following his arrest - the alleged incidents are believed to have taken place at another school . Following Bird's arrest, his home address in Leyland, Lancashire, was searched and officers seized his computers, but no evidence was found. Mr Jones added: 'It is a case of one word against the other.' Bird is believed to have been at Newton Bluecoat for the past 10 years. The trial continues.

"Tiny and innocent, little Danica May Camacho peers out at the world just moments after her birth at a hospital in the Philippines. However, Danica's birth is not only significant to mother Camille and father Florante. She is one of the world's symbolic seven billionth occupants. But, despite being officially awarded the title, claims are being made in other countries that their newly-born babies are the seventh billion newborn on the planet. Room for one more? Tiny Danica Camacho - the world's 7 billionth resident - is cuddled by her mother Camille as they are wheeled out of the delivery room . Something to celebrate: Proud father Florante Galura holds a cake marking the significance of his daughter's birth . In London a baby boy born at St Thomas's hospital was being hailed the seventh billion child and was presented with a House of Commons teddy . bear by Liberal Democrat peer Baroness Jenny Tonge, Conservative MP . Geoffrey Clifton-Brown and hospital staff just three hours after his . birth. Weighing just three when he was delivered, the boy who has tentatively been named Peter Bashir Yansaneh by his father Amara Yansaneh and mother Yasmin Karim. But Peter Bashir is just one of the many around the world to be chosen to represent the symbolic milestone. Born in England: Parents Amara Yansaneh and Yasmin Karim hold their baby, tentatively named Peter Bashir, who was born at St Thomas's hospital in London and is being described as the world's seven billionth . A BABY born in Bosnia 12 years ago was officially designated the planet's six billionth inhabitant by the then United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan. The 8lb boy, who was later named Adnan Mević, was born in Sarajevo at two minutes past midnight on 12 October 1999 to first-time mother Fatima Nevic, 29. But the joy at the birth was tempered with the knowledge that the boy had been born a displaced person in the wake of a civil war which killed 200,000 people and left his parents refugees in their own country. Now in the seventh grade, he still lives in Bosnia in a single-room apartmetn with his parents. Interviewed by ABC news in October this year, his mother said: “We never heard from the U.N. again. We never received anything from . them, not even a birthday card,” Adnan’s father Jasmin is terminally ill with colon cancer and cannot work.

Little Cin, who is yet to be . given a first name, was born at Avista Adventist hospital in Louisville, Colorado near Denver at 2:41am local time. And a baby born in the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad was awarded a certificate for being the seven billionth child born. Little Pyotr's mother Marina Nikolaeva was given the document in a ceremony in hospital. Several more parents assuming their child was the seven billionth to have been born have been photographed and celebrated in ceremonies all over the world from the USA to Japan, just like little Danica.

Philippines with an opportunity to assess population related issues. According to the UN Population Fund . (UNFPA) State of the World Population Report, the Philippines is the . 12th most populous country in the world with 94.9 million people.

"A Brooklyn tailor who survived the Holocaust has revealed how he came inches away from assassinating a senior Nazi's wife - but his conscience saved him from stooping to the level of the SS. Martin Greenfield, 84, is a New York-based tailor to the rich and famous who has been altering suits for decades, with a host of celebrity clients from the music, sports and political arenas. It was a life he never saw coming seven decades ago, when he was locked up in Buchenwald prison camp, doubting he would make it past the age of 16. And in his new memoir Measure Of A Man, Greenfield describes the harrowing day that he was freed - and debated seeking bloody revenge on his torturers. Scroll down for video . Harrowing: Brooklyn-based tailor to the stars Martin Greenfield recounts seeking revenge on his tormentors . Faced with firing a bullet at the mayor of Weimar's wife, who ordered for him to be beaten, Greenfield could not pull the trigger. Instead, he leapt in her black Mercedes, invited two German girls to join him, and drove gleefully through the gates of the defunct camp under the then ironic sign: 'To each what he deserves'. Months before, he had been doing repairs at Buchenwald when he came across a broken chicken pen, and to his surprise found a pair of rabbits still alive quivering inside. Next to them, a starving Greenfield noticed some browning lettuce the two pets had left. He started to eat it - and was caught by the mayor or Weimar's wife, who ordered for him to be beaten. Watch the full interview with Martin at CUNY TV . Survivor: He was released from Buchenwald aged 16 and headed straight to the home of the mayor's wife . 'I couldn't do it': He pointed the gun at the woman's chest as she held a baby but his conscience kicked in . Instead, he took her Mercedes and drove it - with two German girls - through the gates of Buchenwald . Her cruelty struck a nerve. He writes: 'How could a woman carrying her own child find a walking skeleton saving her pets and have him beaten for nibbling on rotten animal food? I thought. 'In that moment, my numbness to death melted. In its place rose an alien blood lust, a hunger for vengeance unlike any I had ever known. The surge of adrenaline and rush of rage felt good inside my withered frame. 'Then and there I made a vow to myself: If I survived Buchenwald, I would return and kill the mayor’s wife.' At 3.15pm on April 11, 1945, he set out to fulfill his vow. He grabbed machine guns and two sidekicks and headed straight for the mayor's home. They crept inside. 'The beautiful blond woman turned the corner and let out a screech. She had the baby in her arms again,' Greenfield recounts in an exclusive extract published by the New York Post. 'I aimed the machine gun at her chest. The baby wailed. My finger hovered above the trigger.' But when the moment came, he couldn't. 'That was the moment I became human again. All the old teachings came rushing back. I had been raised to believe that life was a precious gift from God, that women and children must be protected.' A traumatic history: Greenfield recounts his incredible journey to become a New York tailor . He added: 'My moral upbringing would not allow me to become an honorary member of the SS.' Instead, clad in uniform, he grabbed the car, two girls, and carted into his former prison. It was a moment that allowed Greenfield to reconquer his life and move to the States, he explains. The first shirt he ever touched with a needle and thread belonged to an SS guard who had given it to him to wash. Honing his sewing skills and fixing the attire to fit him properly, Mr Greenfield used the shirt as a status symbol, wearing it in place of his prison garb. He had been moved to the Buchenwald camp before he was freed by Allied forces. When freed, he was alongside another young prisoner, writer Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel. Mr Greenfield was 19 years old when he arrived in the U.S. in 1947. Today, he is showing few signs that he is ready to retire. The Post reported that suits at Greenfield’s Brooklyn headquarters cost anywhere from $1,800 to $2,700. In the past, Mr Greenfield’s prowess as a tailor has been sought out by some of America’s biggest names, including Paul Newman and Michael Jackson. But perhaps no name is bigger than the president of the United States. As a young tailor in the 50s, his bosses gave him the privilege to measure Dwight D. Eisenhower, the same man who shook his hand as a general outside the liberated Buchenwald camp years earlier. Eisenhower may have been Mr Greenfield’s first president, but he wouldn’t be the last, as Lyndon B. Johnson, Gerald Ford and Bill Clinton also bought suits from him, according to the Brooklyn Daily Eagle. Memories: His factory walls are decked with pictures of his famous clients and awards he has won . He had an appointment with President George W. Bush at the White House on September 11, 2001 - a meeting that had to be rescheduled after the terror attacks. President Obama is likely among Mr Greenfield’s clientele as well, but the humble tailor will not say so, citing a personal policy not to speak about a client unless that client has first spoken of him. Other clients include other key political figures as Gen Colin Powell, Sen Bob Dole and New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg.","Martin Greenfield, 84, was ordered to be beaten by mayor of Weimar's wife .

"Nigel Farage was caught in a war of words with Scottish nationalists last night after he accused them of being ‘fascist scum’. The UK Independence Party leader said the left-wing extremists who trapped him in an Edinburgh pub were the ‘ugly face of Scottish nationalism’ pursuing an anti-English agenda. He challenged Scotland’s first minister Alex Salmond to condemn the protesters who had chanted ‘Nazi, Nazi’, jostled him and told him to ‘go back to England’. Up against it: Nigel Farage being escorted by police officers as he leaves the Cannons Gait pub as protestors heckle him . Mr Farage also hit out at the BBC after a Radio Scotland presenter appeared to question his right to debate Scottish issues. In the extraordinary scenes on Thursday night the police forced Mr Farage to take refuge in the Canons’ Gait pub on Edinburgh’s Royal Mile for his own safety after the mob of supposedly anti-racist protesters launched the hostile demonstration against him, preventing him from leaving a press conference. Dozens of activists from the Radical Independence group, most of them students, had gathered on the street outside the press conference, where a giant ‘Vote Yes for Scotland’ banner was held up.Offensive chants included ‘you can stick your Union Jack up your a***’ and ‘go back to England, you’re not welcome here’. The Radical Independence group is not formally linked to the Scottish National Party, but Mr Farage suggested ‘elements’ of the SNP had the same anti-English views. He said: ‘It was a demonstration dressed up as being anti-racism but in fact in itself was deeply racist, with a total hatred of the English and a desire for Scotland to be independent from Westminster. ‘My goodness me, if this is the face of Scottish nationalism it’s a pretty ugly picture. ‘The anger, the snarling, the shouting, the swearing was all linked in to a desire for the Union Jack to be burnt and extinguished from Scotland forever. ‘I must say I have heard before that there are some parts of Scottish nationalism that are akin to fascism but yesterday I saw that face to face.’ UKIP leader Nigel Farage was confronted by protesters in the Cannons Gait pub in Edinburgh . Mr Farage hung up the phone on his BBC Radio Scotland interview after a presenter asked him to ‘remind me how many elected representatives you have in Scotland’.He replied: ‘Absolutely none. But rather more than the BBC do. ‘We could have had this interview in England a couple of years ago, although I wouldn’t have met with such hatred that I’m getting from your questions, and frankly I’ve had enough of this interview. Goodbye.’ Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie described Mr Farage’s treatment as an ‘attack on free speech’ and urged Mr Salmond to condemn it. ‘We’ve always known that supporters of independence can be very passionate for their cause but the offensive and aggressive behaviour toward Nigel Farage was unacceptable,’ he said. A second opinion poll has put UKIP on 18 per cent. The latest survey by TNS BMRB found support was at the same level as the party's all-time high recorded by Ipsos MORI this week. Labour’s . lead over the Conservatives was trimmed to nine points, with Mr . Miliband’s party falling three points to 37 per cent and Mr Cameron’s . Tories gaining three to 28 per cent. The Lib Dems are on just seven per cent. ‘Of course I disagree with Nigel Farage on his unpleasant and dishonest agenda but he will be defeated by argument not aggression. ‘It was deeply ironic when these self-proclaimed anti-racist campaigners told an Englishman to get back to his own country. Anti-racists turned racist but were too ignorant to notice. I am sure most people in Scotland will be appalled at this behaviour.’ George Galloway, the Respect Party MP, said the protest was bad for Scotland. In a message on Twitter he said: ‘Events in Edinburgh yesterday forcing the evacuation of Nigel Farage were a pure embarrassment for Scotland. And the shape of things to come.’The Yes Scotland campaign which is pushing for independence in next year’s referendum on Scotland’s future, distanced itself from the ugly protests. A spokesman said: ‘Yes Scotland continues to run a positive campaign and we condemn any and all forms of intimidation.’ But the SNP said Mr Farage had ‘lost the plot’. Mr Salmond, who leads the Scottish Nationalist Party, claimed Mr Farage knew ‘absolutely nothing’ about matters north of the border. He added: ‘This is a man who doesn’t like getting challenged because when the obnoxious views of his party are put to him then his bubble deflates very quickly and that is what we saw in his panicky interview this morning.’ Mr Farage was escorted by police officers away from the protest after the pub was surrounded by a mob chanting 'Nazi scum' Lothian and Borders Police confirmed two men were arrested for assault and breach of the peace at Thursday’s protest. One revealed on Twitter that he is English, and criticised Mr Farage for branding yesterday’s protest ‘anti-English’. He said: ‘As a proud Englishman, arrested yesterday for protesting, I dispute these claims.’ Liam O’Hare of the Radical Independence group also defended the protest, saying: ‘Our protest was to make it clear that UKIP’s rise in England is in no way reflective of Scotland.’UKIP has never made a breakthrough in Scotland, receiving just 0.91 per cent of the regional vote in the 2011 Holyrood election. But Mr Farage said he was confident the party would win get its first MEP in Scotland in next year’s European Parliament elections. Listen to the full interview here . By Gerald Warner . The mobbing of Nigel Farage by extreme left nationalists in Edinburgh has exposed to the rest of Britain what the UKIP leader calls the ‘ugly face’ of Scottish separatism. Even though members of hard-left activist groups are seldom the brightest bulbs on the chandelier, the fact they could abuse Farage as a ‘racist’ while simultaneously shouting at him to ‘Go back to England’ – without any conscious irony – says it all. While it should be emphasised that there are many thousands of decent Scots who have embraced the separatist agenda without harbouring any animosity towards English people, it is an inescapable fact that a significant element within the nationalist movement is motivated by anti-English sentiment. He had to be taken away in a police van after a taxi was blocked by the crowd . This bigotry was aggravated in the 1990s by the film Braveheart which, though historical hokum, provoked an emotional response among many young people that has not evaporated even today. The aggressive ‘Cybernats’ – embittered nationalists who pour out bile on the internet and in the Twittersphere – are the spearhead of a movement that, in any other ethnic context, would be called racist. A Scottish Government report five months ago recorded a 23 per cent increase in the number of white British people targeted as victims of racial crime. The figures were not broken down into the component nations of the UK, but few of them are likely to have been Welsh. Even allowing for anti-Irish sentiment, it is clear that anti-English abuse is on the rise. Nor is this shameful prejudice confined to the Agitprop rentamob that attacked Mr Farage. Last December, Scottish writer Alasdair Gray provoked outrage when he denounced English ‘colonists’ in the Scottish arts world. One of those ‘colonists’, Vicky Featherstone, who had presided over the establishment of the National Theatre of Scotland and promoted successful plays such as Black Watch, revealed when she left to take up a new post at the Royal Court Theatre that, throughout her time in Scotland, anti-English bullying had made her feel ‘paralysed’ artistically. Troubled waters: Controversy has continued to follow Farage . The passions aroused by the rise of the SNP and the drawn-out ‘neverendum’ campaign on independence have had an unhealthy effect on Scottish society. Although the mob that threatened Mr Farage and broke up his press conference was not drawn from the SNP, Alex Salmond’s party cannot plausibly disown these thugs, from an extreme left group known as Radical Independence. At the launch of the Yes Scotland campaign for the independence referendum in Glasgow on January 16, Nicola Sturgeon, deputy first minister of Scotland, shared a platform with Cat Boyd, of Radical Independence, along with other assorted leftists. Words do not come more weasel than the terms in which Alex Salmond responded to the question of whether he condemned the intimidation of Mr Farage. Despite two arrests and damning video footage, the first minister said: ‘If there’s been any law-breaking – and that’s yet to be established – then obviously we condemn that, as we always do in Scotland, but you’ve got to get things into context. A student demonstration isn’t the Dreyfus trial.’ Or, in other words, boys will be boys, no harm done if the leader of a UK political party is prevented from communicating with the Scottish public and if his attempts at civilised debate are drowned out by moronic chants of ‘Racist Nazi scum’. As for Mr Farage and UKIP, they should understand that the majority of Scots will give them a fair hearing. In a local council by-election in Lanarkshire this year, UKIP beat the Liberal Democrats back into fifth place. After the frenzy of the referendum, where the polls consistently forecast the nationalists will be heavily defeated, Scottish politics will realign. With both the SNP and the Lib Dems in decline, there could then be opportunities for UKIP. In particular, disillusioned Conservative voters could rally to UKIP, appalled that David Cameron, in alliance with Labour and the Lib Dems, is planning to give quasi-independence – so-called ‘Devo Plus’ – to the Scottish parliament. If that is to happen, UKIP will have to abandon its present proposal to hand all tax-raising powers to Holyrood. If it does, it could yet be a player in Scotland where, contrary to recent appearances, democracy is not dead.

"US violent crimes including murders fell 4.4 percent in 2013 to their lowest number since the 1970s, continuing a decades-long downturn, the FBI said on Monday. The law enforcement agency's annual Crime in the United States report showed the country had an estimated 1.16 million violent crimes last year, the lowest number since 1.09 million were recorded in 1978. All types of violent crimes were lower, with murder and non-negligent manslaughter off 4.4 percent to 14,196, the lowest figure since 1968. Rape was down 6.3 percent and robbery fell 2.8 percent, the Federal Bureau of Investigation data showed. All types of violent crimes were lower, with murder and non-negligent manslaughter off 4.4 percent to 14,196, the lowest figure since 1968 . James Alan Fox, a criminologist at Northeastern University in Boston, said there was a variety of factors behind the decline in violent crime in recent decades, including the United States having the highest rate of imprisonment in the world. He said an aging population and improved police tactics also played a role, along with the increased use of security cameras and the pervasive use of phones to take videos. 'It's hard for criminals to do anything without being caught on video,' Fox said. The violent crime rate last year was 367.9 for each 100,000 in population, down 5.1 percent from 2012. The rate has fallen every year since at least 1994, the earliest year for readily accessible FBI data, and the 2013 figure was about half the 1994 rate. The FBI's agency's annual Crime in the United States report showed the country had an estimated 1.16 million violent crimes last year, the lowest number since 1.09 million were recorded in 1978 . Property crimes fell 4.1 percent to an estimated 8.63 million last year, the 11th straight yearly decline. Losses from property crimes excluding arson were calculated at $16.6 billion, the FBI said. In an analysis, the non-profit Pew Charitable Trusts said the drop in crime coincided with a decline in the prison population, with the number of U.S. prisoners down 6 percent in 2013 from its peak in 2008. Thirty-two of the 50 states have seen a drop in crime rates as the rate of imprisonment fell, Pew said. California notched the largest drop in imprisonment rate over the five-year period, at 15 percent, and crime was down 11 per cent. The state has been under court order to reduce prison overcrowding, and voters last week approved an initiative that reduced sentences for some crimes.","Annual Crime in the United States report showed the country had an estimated 1.16 million violent crimes last year, the lowest number since 1.09 million were recorded in 1978 .

"A five-year-old boy has been killed after being hit by a freight train near his home in Utah. The youngster from Spanish Fork was playing on railroad tracks on Sunday afternoon with his with his seven-year-old sister and a seven-year-old male cousin when the locomotive struck him at around 40mph. Local resident, Amanda Larson, and another witness rushed to the scene after hearing the train brakes screech to help locate the boy's body. Scroll down for video . Scene of the incident: The youngster from Spanish Fork was playing on the railroad tracks on Sunday afternoon with his with his seven-year-old sister and a seven-year-old male cousin . 'We all saw some shoes. I think one was on our side and one was on [the other witness's] side, and he just started to scream, ""Call 911,""' Larson told CBS News. 'We climbed over the train and found him in a ditch, face-down in some water.' Larson said they spent several minutes giving the boy CPR before the emergency services arrived just after 5:30pm. Collision: The brakes were slammed down but the train did not stop in time . On hand to help: Local resident, Amanda Larson, and another witness rushed to the scene after hearing the train brakes screech to help locate the boy's body . He was then rushed to a local hospital and flown to one in Salt Lake City, 50 miles north, but he died three hours later from injuries sustained. Spanish Fork Police Lt. Matt Johnson described the incident as a 'tragic accident.' He added that the driver of the train saw the children and tried to 'honk and holla' at them to get off the tracks. The brakes were slammed down but the  train did not  stop in time. The engineer of the Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad vehicle says the youngster appeared to have 'froze' to a standstill while his relatives  jumped to safety. The train was traveling southeast into Spanish Fork Canyon. The name of the five-year-old victim, who apparently resided near the railway tracks at the Diamond Fork Apartment complex, has not yet been released.","The youngster from Spanish Fork was playing on the railroad tracks on Sunday afternoon .

"People living in remote western New South Wales have a shorter life than someone who lives in North Korea or Iraq, the Australian Bureau of Statistics has reported in their latest data. The life expectancy in rural NSW is one of the worst in the country, according to an analysis by Fairfax Media. Andrew Lewis, the mayor of Bourke Shire -which is one of the worst affected areas in Australia, said your chances of death is much higher when living in a rural area. People living in remote western New South Wales have a shorter life than someone who lives in North Korea or Iraq, the Australian Bureau of Statistics has reported in their latest data . In Iraq life expectancy is 68.5 - higher than the Northern Territory, Western Australia and western New South Wales . 'We always talk about the bush being a good lifestyle, but you die out here. 'It's a ""she'll be right"" attitude. Next thing you know, you're dead.' For 10 years now rural towns in western NSW has been among the bottom 10 areas for life expectancy; Walgett, Forbes and Bourke. But Scott McLachlan, the chief executive officer of the Western NSW Local Health District, said the results came to no surprise. 'It is something we are determined to fix through changing lifestyles. Western NSW has some of the highest rates of obesity and smoking in the country.' In Bourke the average death rate in 2013 was three times lower compared to that of Snowy River in southern New South Wales and Manly in Sydney. But behind NSW's remote life expectancy of 67.8 years falls Western Australia and the Northern Territory. In North Korea people tend to live till 69 and in Iraq life expectancy is 68.5, the World Health Organisation reports. Northern Territory's life expectancy is equal to that of Liberia, which is currently in the midst of the Ebola crisis. In North Korea people tend to live till 69, the World Health Organisation reports . For 10 years now rural towns in western NSW has been among the bottom 10 areas for life expectancy; Walgett, Forbes and Bourke . Bourke's low life expectancy could be related to the amount of Aboriginal people who live in the area and suffer from a chronic lack of health services . When it comes to why Western Australia has a lower life expectancy rate than countries like Iraq and North Korea it can be put down to the fact that it is three times the size of NSW, which means health services would be three times greater. As for western NSW, Mr McLachlan explains that the high death rate  occurs because of the amount of people with diabetes, obesity and heavy smoking rates. Bourke's low life expectancy could be related to the amount of Aboriginal people who live in the area and suffer from a chronic lack of health services. Compared to an average town in NSW, The Snowy River has less than half the Aboriginal population and Manly has 10 times less. 'Western NSW is the area that we have always needed to work on. There is clearly a long way to go,'  Dr Zakia Hossain, a demographer and sociologist from the University of Sydney. Earlier this year, Bourke's birthing hospital closed down and now their Medicare Local service is under threat. The Local Health District believes the scarce amount of GPs with obstetric and anaesthetic skills could give reason to the dying facilities in western NSW. The Local Health District believes the scarce amount of GPs with obstetric and anaesthetic skills could give reason to the dying facilities in western NSW . Now, Mr Lewis is calling on the state government to tackle the health system in the west. But Mr McLachlan said NSW's healthcare plan will  be delivering services within the next three years to the areas that most require it. 'It is incredibly hard to recruit the qualified professionals to the area,' he said. While the rural areas continue to struggle, the prestige Sydney areas in NSW such as Mosman and Woollahra have topped  life expectancy, despite ageing populations. They can expect to live past 80-years-old. Tasmania's health system is also flourishing, which may be due to its small population. 'Tasmania's two most remote areas are both islands – Flinders Island and King Island – and both of these communities are serviced by community health centres,' the Tasmanian Health Minister, Michael Ferguson, said. 'Access to these centres can be significantly better than in remote areas interstate, which in turn leads to better overall primary healthcare, especially from a prevention perspective.'","Remote western New South Wales, Northern Territory and Western Australia have shorter life expectancy of North Korea and Iraq .

"It is the ‘home’ of one of the greatest villains ever to stalk our nightmares – a place where only the brave might venture, and the more nervous might fear a sharp pain in the neck. Alternatively, it might be seen as a splendid royal palace in a less-seen part of Europe. Perfectly picturesque: Whatever its links to Dracula, there is no doubting the beauty of Bran Castle . High up on its hilltop: Bran Castle has long been linked to the story of Dracula - as played by Christopher Lee in the 1958 film adaptation of the Bram Stoker novel . Either way, these pictures give a fascinating insight into the fortress that supposedly played host to one of the darkest figures of European mythology – Count Dracula. Bran Castle – which perches on a dramatic hilltop near Brasov in central Romania – has long been linked to the toothsome vampire. Constructed in the early 14th century, it is open to the public, who are able to peer into its creaky rooms and dark passageways. Sharp-eyed tourists will point out that Dracula did not exist. And . they would – rather obviously – be correct. The most famous vampire of . all was, of course, created by the Irish novelist Bram Stoker in his . iconic Gothic novel Dracula, published in 1897. Who goes there? A lot of people, actually - the castle receives half a million visitors every year . Grand designs: The Gothic four-poster bed fits in perfectly with the legend of Dracula in spooky Bran Castle - although Bram Stoker never actually visited the area . Stoker also never visited Romania – let alone Bran Castle. However, the man who is thought to have been the spark for Stoker’s dastardly creation – Vlad III of Wallachia – is believed to have a more direct link to the fortress. Better . known as Vlad the Impaler, this notoriously 'uncompromising' nobleman . ruled Wallachia, in what is now Romania, in the 15th century (probably . 1456 to 1462) – a time when the region was under attack from Ottoman . forces, and staunch tactics were needed. Vlad . – a member of the House of Draculesti – gained his vicious reputation . thanks to his reputed habit of running through his enemies with spikes. Gloomy spaces: The castle supposedly played host (in the dungeons) to the notorious Vlad the Impaler in 1462 . Dining out: For those looking to feast on more than just blood, the eerie dining room is decorated with statues and works of art . Museum display: Over half a million vampire fans flock to the Romanian castle each year, to wander the corridors of a place which loosely inspired Bram Stoker . Following suit: The castle clings to its 14th century roots with armour and medieval weaponry on display . And he may have spent a little time at Bran Castle – though not at his leisure. Some historical sources say that Vlad III was captured by the Hungarian king Matei Corvin in 1462, and transferred to the fortress, where he spent two months languishing in its dungeons – a little sojourn that must have done little for his fiery temper. The modern-day owners of Bran Castle underline this link as one of their main reasons for marketing the property as the ‘home of Dracula’. Spooky: The castle is steeped in history. It is believed that Vlad the Impaler was locked in the castle dungeons for two months in the 15th century . They also claim that the castle bears a notable resemblance to the terrifying hilltop fortress described so stirringly in Stoker’s narrative. While conceding that Stoker did not travel to Romania before (or after) he penned his masterpiece, they also argue that ‘the imaginary depiction of Dracula’s Castle from the etching in the first edition of “Dracula” is strikingly similar to Bran Castle and no other in all of Romania.’ Whether or . not this is enough of a connection for historians or literary . academics, there is no doubt that Bran Castle is popular – it attracts . some half a million tourists a year. Those . who visit the fortress – which perches on a bluff 20 miles south-west . of Brasov – find a structure that is certainly beautiful, whatever its . ties to vampires. Enough to send shivers down your spine: Bran Castle looks even more eerie when illuminated at night - particularly with a full moon rising behind . Perfectly picturesque: Whatever its links to Dracula, there is no doubting the beauty of Bran Castle . View from above: The huge castle dominates the surrounding landscape in the beautiful Romanian landscape . Many of its echoing chambers are fitted out with furniture and fittings acquired by Queen Marie – the last Queen Consort of Romania, in the early 20th century. However, peer behind that thick velvet curtain, or wander down that dimly lit corridor, and you never know who you may encounter.","Bran Castle is tied to the iconic story of the aristocratic Romanian vampire .

"It's the world’s longest-running soap opera and a national institution. Yet celebrity fans of The Archers on BBC Radio 4 have said they fear for its future and complain it is changing beyond all recognition. Former home secretary David Blunkett said the serial, which first aired in 1950, was becoming a ‘disappearing soap’ as characters are killed off and exiled abroad. Mr Blunkett, 67, has listened to the show since he was four, but fears it is becoming a 'disappearing' soap . Meanwhile broadcasting veteran Dame Jenni Murray said a national scandal would ensue if three major characters leave. The central couple, David and Ruth Archer, who live and work on Brookfield Farm in Ambridge, look set to move up North with David’s mother Jill, after it was announced a new road could be built through their land. Writing in the Radio Times, Mr Blunkett, 67, who has listened to the show since he was four, said: ‘I fear that The Archers is on the verge of becoming the disappearing soap. Coronation Street and EastEnders must be rubbing their hands. ‘For as in the Harry Potter books, the cast seem to have an invisibility cloak, and some of them possess the technique of disapparating, which in human speak means magically disappearing.’ Central character David (pictured), who lives with Ruth Archer on Brookfield Farm in Ambridge, look set to move up North with David's mother Jill, after it was announced a new road could be built through their land . Also writing in the magazine, Radio 4 Woman’s Hour presenter Dame Jenni, said: ‘I will kill the editor if he lets David and Ruth and Jill go to Northumberland. Brookfield simply cannot go. It’s just not possible; there will be a national scandal if that happens.’ Mr Blunkett added: ‘I fear for the central family of The Archers. Are David, Ruth and Jill on the edge of being definitively written out?’ Many of The Archers’ five million listeners who tune in every week will share these concerns, following a period of turmoil. Earlier this month, Tom Graham, who has played Tom Archer for 17 years, announced he was being axed, reportedly to be replaced by another actor. In the soap, Tom has been living in Canada after jilting his fiancee Kirsty, which prompted her to leave Ambridge too. And veteran character Nigel Pargetter was controversially killed off in 2011 by falling off a roof.","David Blunkett said the serial was becoming a 'disappearing soap'

"It's hoped a new trial, which is set to see pre-schoolers learn a second language, will help to boost the declining numbers of high school students studying languages across Australia. The federal government has selected 40 pre-schools from more than 1,000 applicants to take part in the trial, called Ella, which will use play based apps starting from next year. 'Our children are now techsperts from early on, particularly with the vast array of interactive early education applications and games that are now available at their fingertips,' said the assistant minister for Education Sussan Ley. A new trial will teach pre schoolers a second language. 40 pre schools across Australia have been selected to start the one year trial early next year . It is hoped teaching pre schoolers a second language will help to boost the declining numbers of high school students studying a language . 'This play-based approach is therefore a fun and easy way to get our kids interested in learning skills for life, such as a language other than English, from early on in their education journey.' Assistant education minister Sussan Ley (pictured) says the government wants to give kids an early insight into other cultures . Following on from the strong response to participate in the trial, Ms Ley said it clearly shows the Australian public wants the chance for their kids to learn another language from the early years through to year 12. 'And it's easy to see why, when the proportion of Year 12 students studying a language other than English has dropped from about 40 per cent in the 1960s to about 12 per cent today,' said Ms Ley. 'We also hope it will give our kids an early insight into other cultures and help promote inclusive communities, given almost one-in-five Australians speak a language other than English at home.' 12 pre schools in New South Wales will be taking part in the trial which offers five different languages including Mandarin (Chinese), Japanese, Indonesian, Arabic or French. KU Shalvey pre school in Sydney's west will be teaching Japanese to their children and believe learning a language and literacy are two of the most important things for a child to learn. 'Learning a language you can have a better understanding of cultures and connect with the community,' said school principal Katrina McGovern. 'At an early age the learning capacity for children is optimal, the first five years is the best time they can learn.' 'We had a Japanese student here a few years ago who taught the kids a few words and they really enjoyed it, I think they will love it and it will definitely help the children to be engaged,' she said. The trial will also reach nine pre-schools in Victoria, eight in Queensland, five in Western Australia, three in South Australia and one in Tasmania, the ACT and the Northern Territory. Kool Kidz on Taylors in Melbourne's south east have been very much focused on their kids learning a language. 'It's a big part of my philosophy,' said school principal Sheela Edwards, 'We come from big multicultural backgrounds.' The teacher who was born in India and lived in England for 20 years says she knows five different languages and didn't realise how much she would end up using them. 'It's so important to understand and to be able to connect with people of the world, to do business with them,' she said. 'We're no longer local populations, we need to look at global jobs, look at children travelling to Europe for work and help them to do that.' 40 pre schools across Australia will be able to teach their kids a second language, offering, Mandarin (chinese), Japanese, Indonesian, Arabic or French . 40 pre schools will take part in the trial for children to learn second languages . A year ago Ms Edwards followed up on research into what languages primary schools were learning around the area. 'We wanted to see which language we could teach our kids so when they move to primary school they had an advantage.' She found that Indonesian was a popular language so when applying she chose Indonesian which they were granted. 'This announcement came as a timely beneficial opportunity, hence we jumped on it,' she said. 'Very important, children learn from each other, it's an important part of learning.' A high school Chinese teacher in South Australia believes pre-schoolers should definitely be learning languages. 'Learning a second language not only helps you to understand a different culture and way of thinking, it also helps you to understand your first language better,' she said. 'These days we don’t tend to teach English in the old way of understanding the parts of language: verb, adjective, pronoun etc. However when you learn a second language you invariably come across these terms (metalanguage) and are able to understand and apply it much better.' She believes that even if students swap and change their language later on, they should have the foundations of understanding the parts of a language. There's hope that teaching pre schoolers a second language will help to boost declining numbers in high school students studying languages . 'In an ideal world, this would also positively impact numbers in high school years. Hopefully it will, that remains to be seen,' she said. 'With the increasing globalisation of the world, it is important for our future generation of students to be able to speak another language and respect and attempt to understand another culture. English and the Anglacised world is no longer enough.' The federal opposition has criticised the trial, saying it was meant to cover 400,000 students, but it is now only going to be rolled out in 40 centres. They have also questioned the government on allocating the full $9.8 million of funding for the one year period. 'It is being spun as a trial of a trial but what this Government would be better off doing is just delivering what they promised they would,' said shadow education minister Kate Ellis. 'This is a clear broken promise – just like the billion dollars of cuts to child care families were told wouldn’t happen but have been hit with in just a year,' she said.","New trial will see 40 pre-schools teach their children a second language .

"Midwives who object to abortions could be allowed to opt out of any involvement with women who choose to terminate their unborn babies. The UK's Supreme Court will today hear an appeal after two Catholic midwives won a landmark case for the right to refuse any involvement in abortion procedures in 2013. Mary Doogan, 58, and Connie Wood, 52, argued that being required to supervise staff involved in abortions was a violation of their human rights. The women had no direct role in pregnancy terminations, but claimed they should also be able to refuse to support staff taking part in the procedures. If the court upholds that decision it could set a legal precedent, allowing other midwives who object to abortions to take the same stance. But the Royal College of Midwives and the women's charity British Pregnancy Advisory Service (bpas) warned today that such a ruling could have severe implications for the care of women choosing abortions. Catholic midwives Connie Wood, left, and Mary Doogan, right, won a landmark case for the right to refuse any involvement in abortion procedures in 2013. The case will return to the Court of Session in Scotland tomorrow after NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde appealed the ruling . Ms Doogan and Ms Wood took their case against NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde to the Court of Session in Edinburgh in 2012, but lost. But in April last year, three appeal judges at the same court ruled their appeal should succeed. Judges at the court will tomorrow hear an appeal by NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde. A spokesman for the RCM and bpas said the two bodies are 'deeply concerned' that the judgement 'extends the right of conscientious objection beyond the provisions intended by the Abortion Act'. The act allows healthcare professionals to refuse to participate in abortion care, provided it is not an emergency situation. In 2012, the Outer House of the Court of Session rejected Ms Doogan and Ms Woods' case ruling that participation in treatment meant direct involvement in ending the pregnancy. That decision was overturned in 2013 by the Court's Inner House, which judged the midwives were legally allowed to refrain from delegating to, supervising and supporting colleagues involved in abortion care on their wards. The Abortion Act 1967 allows healthcare professionals to refuse to participate in direct involvement in abortion care, provided it is not an emergency case. Catholic midwives and labour ward co-ordinators, Mary Doogan and Connie Wood argued their objection should extend to supervising, delegating and support their colleagues who were directly caring for women having had terminations. If the Court of Session supports that ruling, it could set a precedent that could 'compromise patient care', the RCM and bpas have said. The Inner House said of midwives' right to object: 'The right is given because it is recognised that the process of abortion is felt by many people to be morally repugnant. 'It is in keeping with the reason for the exemption that the wide interpretation which we favour should be given to it.' The RCM and bpas believe if that decision is upheld it will require all professional guidance to be rewritten. But their spokesman said their concerns go further, and will 'enable a tiny number of staff opposed to abortion to make women's care undeliverable in some NHS settings in the UK'. Ann Furedi, bpas chief executive, said: 'bpas supports the right of healthcare professionals to conscientious objection, not least because women deserve better than being treated with contempt by those who think they are sinners. 'But ultimately a balance needs to be struck between that exercise of conscience and women's access to legal services. ‎'There may be a small number of healthcare workers who have a conscientious objection to providing abortion care. 'There are far more who have a conscientious commitment to helping women who need to end a pregnancy. The Court of Session will review the case tomorrow. The Royal College of Midwives and the charity British Pregnancy Advisory Service (bpas) have warned upholding the 2013 decision, could compromise the care of women choosing to have abortions . 'It would be grossly unjust if an interpretation of conscientious objection was allowed to stand which would disrupt services to the point that those committed to helping women were unable to do so.' Gillian Smith, RCM director for Scotland, said they 'absolutely support midwives' right to conscientious objection'. She added: 'The RCM position has always been and will remain that we support women's choice within the law. 'We also want to ensure that women undergoing this procedure, for whatever reason, get the best possible care, which we feel could be compromised if the current laws are changed. 2007 - Catholic midwives Mary Doogan and Connie Wood became concerned at a decision to move all medical abortions to the labour ward at Southern General Hospital, Glasgow. As labour co-ordinators and midwives they had previously registered their conscientious objection to taking direct part in abortions, as allowed under the Abortion Act. 2012 - Ms Doogan and Ms Wood argued their supervision and support of staff involved directly in terminations amounted to 'participation in treatment' and breached their human rights. Judge Lady Smith at the Court of Session found the pair were sufficiently removed from any involvement to afford an appropriate respect of their beliefs. Ms Doogan and Ms Wood appealed the decision. April 2013 - The court's Inner House overturned the decision. November 2014 - The court's Inner House will hear an appeal brought by NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde. 'While recognising the rights of healthcare professionals to conscientious objection as described in the 1967 Abortion Act, we will be encouraging our members to continue to provide professional care to women who require this type of treatment.' Ms Doogan and Ms Wood were employed as labour ward co-ordinators at the Southern General Hospital in Glasgow. At the time of the original ruling, Ms Doogan had been absent from work due to ill health since March 2010 and Ms Wood had been transferred to other work. Both women, practising Roman Catholics, registered their conscientious objection to taking part in abortions years ago, as allowed by the Abortion Act. But they became concerned when all medical terminations were moved to the labour ward in 2007. They argued that before the move they had not been asked to delegate, supervise or support staff treating or caring for women undergoing terminations - a stance disputed by the health board. They said the supervision and support of staff did amount to 'participation in treatment' and breached their rights under the European Convention on Human Rights. They raised a petition for a judicial review at the court, which was refused in 2012 by judge Lady Smith. She found the midwives were sufficiently removed from any involvement in the procedures to afford an appropriate respect of their beliefs. Ms Doogan and Ms Wood said at the time they were 'very disappointed' by the decision, and appealed against the ruling. During a hearing last year, Gerry Moynihan QC, representing the pair, suggested their consciences should determine what tasks they felt they could undertake. He told the court: 'The dividing line ought to be the individual's conscience, not a bureaucrat saying what is within the literal meaning of the word 'participation' or not.' The health board argued that the right of conscientious objection was a right only to refuse to take part in activities that directly brought about the termination of a pregnancy, and was not available to the pair in respect of their duties of delegation, supervision and support.","Court of Session in Scotland will hear case of Catholic midwives Mary Doogan and Connie Wood .

In Canberra, former prime minister John Howard delivered a speech to honour those who have lost their lives defending the country, and paid tribute to the 'great professional valour' of Australia's current serving troops. This year marks the 96th anniversary of the end of World War I. Allied forces signed a peace accord with the Germans in France on November 11, 1918, signalling the end of the first Great War. 'We honour two things, first and foremost, the extraordinary sacrifice (of those) who died in defence of this country,' Mr Howard said. 'We also honour those who go to war to defend the vulnerable and the values for which this country has always stood.' Mr Howard told the crowd soldiers currently heading to Iraq stood on the shoulders of the Anzacs. 'As we contemplate that mission and we understand the extraordinary heroism that will be involved and the great professional valour that will be accompanying the men and women of the Australian Defence Force as they go on their task, let us remember that they stand on the shoulders of their Anzac forebears,' he said. 'They carry in their mission the same values of this country as did their forebears.' Opposition Leader Bill Shorten was among those dignitaries to pay their respects to the fallen diggers .

The Great War was the crucible in which our nation's identity was forged,' he said in the recorded message. 'From a population of under five million, 417,000 enlisted, 332,000 served overseas, 152,000 were wounded and 61,000 never came home,' he said. 'It was sacrifice on a stupendous scale. Every November 11, Australia renews its vow to never forget the sacrifice. 'We pause to remember the suffering and loss that has occurred in all wars, for we are a country of memory, as well as memorials. 'Today, we will remember the courage, achievements, pain and loss of all who have served in our name. 'And we draw strength from their memory.'

"For Gill Rowe, her father’s war medals weren’t just a poignant reminder of his sacrifice 100 years on – they were a treasured link to her long-lost past. But just hours before Remembrance Sunday, heartless thieves broke into the 82-year-old’s home and stole her late father’s three medals. The widowed former nurse was taking a group of elderly ladies to a lunch when the burglar struck. Gill Rowe (pictured holding a photograph of her and her late father on her wedding day) says she has been unable to sleep since her father's war medals were stolen from her home on Saturday afternoon . Mrs Rowe, a devoted Christian who is a reader at her local church in Hayes, south-east London, planned to wear the medals to lead prayers at the Remembrance Sunday service as she has for the past 16 years. But when she returned home late on Saturday afternoon she was distraught to find her door had been forced by thieves who rifled through her two-bedroom property in Bromley, before taking the prized medals from her bedside dressing table. Yesterday, she appealed for the cruel thief to hand back the treasured heirlooms. Her father, Private Harry Syms, was awarded two medals for his time serving with the Army in France in the First World War, where he received devastating injuries at the age of 17 that left him with a limp for the rest of his life. Due to his injuries, he was unable to serve in the Second World War, but was in the civil service and received a third medal with a citation signed by royalty for his vital security work for his country. Yesterday, Mrs Rowe said the medals were all she had left of her father, who died in 1959 aged 60. ‘I feel like they have stolen a piece of him,’ she said. ‘They are part of the family. I can never replace them. ‘I have worn his medals for years every Remembrance Sunday at church. I have always worn them with pride for what my father did. ‘My mother gave them to me when she died at the age of 100. ‘I loved my father dearly and they meant so much to me. ‘My father joined up when he was 16 in 1914. He was wounded badly and was later discharged from the Army. He worked for the government doing security work, which he never talked about. But he received a medal because he did a lot of important work.’ Mrs Rowe's father, Harry Syms, was awarded two medals for his service during WWI (left), as well as a third medal after WWII (right) Mrs Rowe returned home at 5pm on Saturday afternoon to find her front door wouldn’t open as the lock had been damaged. She said: ‘At first I didn’t realise what had happened. ‘Then I went upstairs to get the medals out ready for the service the next day and I discovered they had gone. ‘My heart sunk. I was absolutely devastated. I can’t forget that someone has been walking around my home looking at things, opening my drawers and taking the medals. ‘It’s frightened me. I feel like it’s not my home any more. I felt violated and I couldn’t sleep.’ A piggy bank containing around £20 in coins was also taken during the burglary. At least one of the medals from the First World War, which were on ribbons, had HA SYMS engraved around the edge. Despite her distress, Mrs Rowe attended the Remembrance service at St Mary’s Church in Hayes on Sunday. ‘I was very upset but I wanted to go to the service,’ she said. ‘I can only hope someone will recognise how important these medals are and hand them back.’ Anyone with information, or who has been offered the medals to buy, is asked to contact police on 101 or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.","Harry Syms was awarded two medals for service on Western Front in WWI .

"Nigel Farage had to be locked in a pub for his own safety yesterday after being surrounded by a hostile crowd as he launched a by-election campaign. Farage and his entourage were first heckled as they attempted to hold a press conference in The Canons’ Gait in Edinburgh by protesters shouting  ‘racist scumbag’ and ‘scum’. The flustered UKIP leader was asked to leave and went outside where he tried to carry on making a speech.

Scotland . Public disorder: Police restrain angry protesters as they take Mr Farage to safety in the riot van . As the angry demonstration continued, . he attempted to flee by hailing a taxi but it was surrounded. A woman . in a wheelchair rolled in front of the cab to stop it driving away. Farage leapt out and police had to . escort him back into the pub. He was eventually driven away in a police . van as protesters chanted ‘scum, scum, scum’. He said: ‘I do not know what they are . shouting, we have never, never ever had this response. Is it because I . am  English? I’ve never had anyone call me a racist.’ Not flowery in Scotland: The UK Independence Party leader is on the receiving end of some abusive language during the visit . 'Racist Nazi scum': Angry protesters heckle Mr . Farage outside the Canon's Gait Pub in Edinburgh after his attempts to . flee by taxi were foiled. He is seen being led back to the safety of the . pub by police officers . His trademark is to be pictured enjoying a pint in pubs during campaigns, this time for the poll in Aberdeen next month. Farage arrived at The Canons’ Gait at 5pm with around ten supporters, including UKIP candidate Otto Inglis. After being jostled and heckled, . staff asked them to leave. One said: ‘It was getting loud and unsafe for . customers. We did not invite him here.’ The protest is said to have been organised on social media by a group called Radical Independence Edinburgh. The wheelchair user who blocked his get-away gave her name only as Rachel, 24, from Edinburgh. ‘It’s obvious that people in Scotland blatantly don’t want him and his policies here,’ she said. Outside the Canon's Gate Pub: Today's . demonstration against Mr Farage and his policies is understood to have . been organised on social media by a group called Radical Independence . Edinburgh . Speaking after the event, Mr Farage . said: 'Normally I would love to be locked in a pub, but it was pretty . unpleasant. It’s not something I’ve experienced myself anywhere else in . the United Kingdom. 'If this is the face of Scottish nationalism, it’s a pretty ugly picture.' 'This was dressed up as an anti-racism protest, but it was nothing of the sort – it was an anti-English thing.' Mr Farage said the protesters were ‘not prepared to have a conversation’ and he praised the police for a ‘very, very good job’. 'If the police hadn’t been there it could have turned very nasty,' he said. The UKIP leader was in Scotland to promote his party following a string of victories in English council elections. The party is fighting next months’ Holyrood by-election in Aberdeen Donside, and is aiming to win a . Scottish seat in next year’s European election. Mr Farage asked to meet political . journalists in a pub near the Scottish Parliament, and selected the . Canons’ Gait on the Royal Mile. Often pictured with a pint in his . hand, the colourful politician chatted to reporters and drank a beer . before he carried out TV interviews. But around 20 protesters arrived in . the bar shortly after 5pm. Mr Farage was accused of being a . ‘racist’ and likened to BNP leader Nick Griffin by the angry mob. The . politician defended his policies, before peace was briefly restored and a . press conference was held with journalists. But 15 minutes later, the anti-racism . activists started chanting again and – with no apparent sense of irony - . shouted at Mr Farage to ‘go home’. A bar manager ordered protesters, journalists and ‘you too Mr Farage’ to leave the pub. But the UKIP leader was surrounded by campaigners on the street outside, with chants including: 'UKIP scum off our streets.' 'People in Scotland blatantly don't want him': . Mr Farage's attempts to flee in a taxi were foiled when protesters . surrounded the vehicle and one woman rolled her wheelchair in front of . it to stop it from driving away . Not going anywhere: Protesters block the street . ahead of Mr Farage's taxi. The woman in the wheelchair, who gave her . name as Rachel, said: 'He is a racist b******. His views on immigration . are just wrong' Time for plan B: Mr Farage is escorted by police as he exits the taxi to return to the now empty pub . Around ten police officers had been . called to the scene, who stopped traffic on the busy road. A taxi was . flagged down, but the driver refused to let Mr Farage in his car. The MEP then tried to speak to . protesters again, and a number of anti-British slogans were shouted at . him. A second taxi was flagged down by police officers, and Mr Farage . got inside. However, a female activist in a . wheelchair blocked the cab from moving, and Mr Farage was eventually . forced to exit – leaving his briefcase inside. Officers bundled him back inside the . Canons’ Gait, and the doors were locked. As protesters swarmed around . the building, a riot van arrived ten minutes later at 5.40pm and took Mr . Farage to a hotel elsewhere in the city centre. UKIP spokesman Gawain Towler said the abuse hurled at Mr Farage ‘sounded’ anti-English, adding: 'It was inchoate rage.' Mr Towler insisted that his leader . would continue with his engagements north of the Border, including a . dinner for fundraisers, and will return to Scotland in August. Mr Farage . also plans to travel north for next year’s independence referendum. UKIP has never made a breakthrough in Scotland, receiving just 0.91 per cent of the regional vote in the 2011 Holyrood election. But the party achieved its best ever . English local government results earlier this month, polling an average . of 23 per cent in the wards it contested, and returning 147 councillors. Anger: A protester confronts Mr Farage inside . the Canon's Gate pub as he tries to give interviews to the Press. The . pub's management said the Ukip leader did not even bother to inform them . of his plans . Mr Farage responds to the hecklers: A member of . the bar staff said the first they knew of the press conference was when . police phoned them at three in the afternoon - just three hours before . it was due to start . Before the trouble started, the UKIP . leader told reporters his hopes of making a breakthrough in Scotland had . been improved by next year’s independence referendum. 'The SNP is selling an entirely false . prospectus to the people of Scotland. They talked about independence . within the European Union – don’t make me laugh,' he said. 'If the SNP position was they wanted . to be out of the United Kingdom and out of the European Union, at least . intellectually, you could respect that position.' He said the independence debate has . prompted a discussion on EU membership, adding: 'We’ve got some things . to say about how Scotland might be outside the European Union with a . reinvigorated fishing industry. 'There’s a gap in the political market for UKIP in Scotland that didn’t exist last year.' But Mr Farage admitted the . 'immigration argument' was not as potent in Scotland because there has . not been the same influx of foreigners north of the Border as in the . south of England.","Protesters shouting 'racist Nazi scum' storm UKIP press conference .

"A bear 'rehabilitator' who helps abandoned bears cubs has found himself parenting 27 lively orphans after the extremely harsh winter killed their parents . Ben Kilham normally looks after between three and five cubs a year at an enclosure near his New Hampshire home until they are old enough to care for themselves. But the extremely harsh winter has proved tough for the black bears with many young cubs being left orphans. Scroll down for video . 'Father' to 27 bear cubs: Ben Kilham, Kilham certainly has his hands full caring for 27 orphaned black bear cubs in his eight-acre forested enclosure in New Hampshire . He said: 'We didn't know what to expect as they kept coming in. It was every week or twice a week we were getting calls, ""We've got a group of cubs,"" then ""another group of cubs"".' Mr Kilham keeps the cubs in an eight acre - the equivalent of 3.2 hectares - enclosed forest behind his house until spring, when he works with the state Fish and Game Department to release them in remote locations. And he's certainly got his hands full this year, as while these bears normally hibernate for the winter, this year's bumper bunch have decided not to. 'They've managed to keep themselves awake,' he said. 'There's always somebody who stirs up somebody else, and pretty soon, everybody's up.' Playtime: Twelve black bear cubs can be seen playing together in the trees in the enclosed forest behind Mr Kilham's house . For a while, Kilham tried withholding food in hopes that the bears would sleep, but that didn't work. 'They . just roto-tilled the pen,' he said. 'It was obvious that they were . seeking food, so we just gave up and started going back once a day . feeding them.' Staying awake all winter won't hurt the bears, he said, and if anything, they are better off having spent the winter in a large group. With just a few cubs, it was common for one to pace back and forth near the fence, Kilham said. But none of the current cubs is showing that kind of anxiety. 'They're just one big happy family, they roam around, play with each other,' he said. 'They are very, very happy as a big social unit.' Full-time job: Ben Kilham's sister Phoebe helps her brother to keep track of all the orphans - which include four sets of triplets . Andy Timmins, the bear project leader for the New Hampshire Fish and Game Department, said officials were expecting more orphaned cubs than usual but were surprised at just how many turned up. 'It was like nothing we've ever seen. A high year in the past was maybe, seven or eight bears,' he said. 'It was a very challenging year, for sure, and we're not done yet. I'm absolutely positive there will be more showing up this spring as a result of these conditions last year.' The bumper crop of cubs can be traced to a two-year swing in the bears' food supply. Younger . female bears often don't give birth during leaner years, but with an . abundance of beechnuts, berries and other food in 2011, there was a baby . boom. More black bear cubs were orphaned this year after a good breeding season was followed by a difficult winter . In 2012, however, dry conditions meant food was scarce, and bears were forced to venture into backyards for food. Sows that foraged for food in chicken coops and beehives ended up getting shot by property owners, leaving the cubs behind. 'The big wave of them came in June and . July as a direct result of females getting shot in chicken pens,' Timmins said. 'It was just bang, bang, bang, with calls coming in from . people saying, ""I just shot a bear, come and pick it up"".' The state has a program to help . landowners install electric fencing to protect their coops, he said, but . many are unwilling to use it. And the law is on the side of property . owners. In demand: Ben Kilham is the only licensed 'bear rehabilitator' in New Hampshire . 'We bend over backwards to help people with that problem, and we'd like to see a little more tolerance out there among the public towards wildlife that might be attracted to the chicken pen,' he said. 'It's an easy fix.' Kilham agreed. 'Once the bear's in your chicken coop, the damage is done so there's nothing gained by shooting the bear,' he said. Kilham, who has been studying bears for more than 20 years, has produced and appeared in numerous documentaries and written two books about bear social behavior. The second, titled 'Out on a Limb,' is due out this summer, and he's also working on a doctoral degree in environmental conservation that builds on his work in China helping wildlife experts who are reintroducing pandas to the wild. Back in Lyme, much of the day-to-day care of bears falls to Kilham's sister, Phoebe, who said despite the added workload this year - which includes four sets of triplets - it's not hard for her to keep track of so many bears. Some of them are named for the towns where they were found - there's 'Moultonborough One' and 'Moultonborough Two' - while others have more whimsical such monikers as Clarkie, Big Girl and Slothy. Clarkie is the group lookout and runs up to be fed first, she said. Others hang back and don't eat until the Kilhams leave. And thanks to an outpouring of donations after a local television publicized the situation, they have plenty of dog food to keep everyone well-fed until spring. 'You get to recognize them by behavior as well as by sight,' she said. 'We do pretty well. Some of those last triplets were hard to tell apart, but otherwise we do pretty well.' Growing up: Mr Kilham takes care of the orphaned black bear cubs over winter until they are big enough to care for themselves and be released into the wild .","Ben Kilham has an eight-acre enclosure for the bears in New Hampshire .

"Walking free: Rachael Thompson, 40, sliced her four-month-old's heels with a blade but was given a suspended sentence because it was a 'cry for help', a judge ruled . A mother has been spared jail despite causing 'horrific' injuries to her baby son's feet by slashing them with a razor blade. Rachael Thompson, 40, sliced her  four-month-old's heels and then told doctors the child kicked the blade when into fell into his bath. Jurors at Plymouth Crown Court took just two and half hours to convict her of assault after hearing that her son's wounds could only have been caused deliberately. But Recorder Vasanti Selvaratnum spared Thompson jail because he believed her cruel attack was a 'cry for help'. He also ruled that  the assaulted baby should stay with her despite her conviction. Sentencing her to 50 weeks, suspended for a year, he told the mother: 'You clearly love your son. The injury you caused him was a cry for help and out of character. 'There is no suggestion in any evidence I have seen that the injury the jury found you caused to your son was anything other than an isolated incident and he remained in your care for two years or more.' Plymouth Crown Court had heard how heard Thompson took her son into hospital two days after hacking at his feet in September 2011. Jo Martin, prosecuting, said Thompson told medics she had been bathing the child when she left him with her partner. She claimed she had come back to find the child's feet bleeding and a razor blade lying in the tub. The court heard doctors grew suspicious and contacted police and social services. A&E nurse Emma Congdon said she was suspicious because of the two-day delay in bringing in the baby. She said the mother told her the baby had 'kicked' the razor into the bath. She told the court the boy's wounds were 'horrific', adding: 'You would not leave a four month old baby on its own in the bath.' Trial: A jury at Plymouth Crown Court in Devon found Thompson guilty of assault in two hours . Ms Martin said police consulted an expert who said a falling razor would be unlikely to slice into a baby's feet. And even if it did, it would cut in a 'criss-cross' fashion rather deliver a clean, identical wound to both heels, she said. The little boy spent a night in hospital before being released as the injuries were only superficial. His mother was subsequently arrested and told police 'she would not hurt her child'.

"Balls were plucked out of thin air and hit onto the roof of Africa as the world's highest ever cricket match was played in a freezing ice crater near the summit of Mount Kilimanjaro  on Friday. The match, featuring past and present stars of the game including England limited overs coach Ashley Giles and South African fast bowling legend Makhaya Ntini, took place not far from the 19,341ft (5,895m) Tanzanian summit known as the roof of Africa. A group of more than 30 players, official umpires and support crew trekked almost 20,000 feet to the top of the great African peak over eight days in a bid to surpass the record set in 2009 on Mount Everest. Former England spinner Ashley Giles stands at slip during play in the world's highest cricket match near the summit of of Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania . The match was played on the ice-covered crater of Kilimanjaro, breaking the previous record set in 2009 on Mount Everest . The two teams, also including former England women's captain Clare Connor, current national representative Heather Knight and more from Australia, Canada, Kenya and South Africa, reached their target around dawn on Friday after slowly scaling the mountain to ensure they acclimatise properly. They then rolled out a plastic pitch over the ice and set about playing a full Twenty20 match. 'This is absolutely incredible! We are playing cricket on the summit of Africa!' former England spinner Giles tweeted from the summit. Due to the extreme elevation, balls travel further than they usually would so the organisers carried 24 spare ball in their packs, along with helmets, pads and bats, to ensure the game isn't cut short by a shortage of supplies. 'I am not underestimating how hard it will be because of the affect it will have on my body and my mind,' he said before setting off. 'But we should be able to pull each other through the challenge and then play a game.' Players 'warm-up' before the highest ever cricket match, a full Twenty20 contest, following a 20,000-ft eight-day trek up the vast extinct volcano . The match was played on a rolled out plastic pitch with a bright orange ball just a short hike from the Tanzanian mountain's 19,341ft-high summit . Just by being there, let alone playing a game of cricket, the teams risked acute mountain sickness, deadly pulmonary or cerebral oedema, but it's all for a good cause. For their efforts they aim to raise money that will go towards cancer research, African wildlife conservation charity Tusk Trust and building Rwanda`s first international cricket pitch. The match, once ratified by authorities, will break the 2009 Everest record by about 600 metres. The cricketers battled thin air in the high altitude, which made the ball travel further and put the players at serious risk of illness .

"This is the moment a rescue worker was lowered from a helicopter to find a group of hikers who went missing in the Southern California wilderness overnight. The young adults and teens as young as 14, all from a church group, set out in the Eaton Canyon Natural Area in Pasadena on Sunday morning and were expected back by 6pm that evening. They were reported missing at 9:30pm. A medic was lowered from the LA County Sheriff's department helicopter to assist the group, but no injuries have been reported. Scroll down for video .

The group are said to have planned to gone canyoneering in an area that closed two months ago. Local officials said the hikers range from 14 to 36 years old and have gone out as a group on three-mile treks before. Reports suggest they had climbing gear, including ropes and harnesses with them and planned to rappel down waterfalls in the canyon. However Sheriff’s Deputy Daniel Paige said they did not have the supplies and equipment needed for an overnight trip. He told KTLA 5: 'We’re not sure why they stopped hiking. We’re presuming maybe someone became injured, we’re really not sure. But for some reason they were unable to continue their trip, where they were going to hike in the canyon near where the waterfall is then hike out.' Descent: The group, said to be experienced hikers, were planning to rappel down waterfalls similar to this one in the canyon . Wenderlyn Ortiz who has been hiking with the same group before initially said she was confident they would be found and assumes 'someone got tired and stopped'.

"Nicholas Stewart from Dowson Turco Lawyers acted on behalf of a client who successfully argued he was in a 'friends with benefits' relationship . A Brisbane judge ruled that two men in an open relationship for seven years were technically 'friends with benefits' and not in a de facto relationship in a landmark decision in the Federal Circuit Court. A 53-year-old man met a 41-year-old man at a sex on premises venue in March 2005, after ending a heterosexual relationship with his wife with whom he shared children. The pair, who cannot be named, commenced a relationship and moved in together almost immediately, and lived together on and off for the next seven years while also having a sexual relationship. In a decision handed down last week, Judge John Coker rejected the 41-year-old applicant's claim he was entitled to a 40 percent share of the 53-year-old's property, based on what he called their 'de facto' status, the Courier-Mail reported. Lawyer Nicholas Stewart, who works for LGBTI specialist law firm Dowson Turco, acted on behalf of the 53-year-old and said his client argued that their relationship was that of a 'landlord' and a 'tenant'. 'He came to us and said ""De facto is not how I view this relationship - yeah we had sex and we had sex a lot but I never shared any commitment or romantic notions"",' Mr Stewart told Daily Mail Australia. 'He had many other sexual partners throughout their friendship so there was no exclusive commitment.' One of the 53-year-old's alternative sexual partners gave evidence during the hearing in June. Mr Stewart said the judge agreed with his client that the men's relationship was one of 'friends with benefits' based on its non-exclusive nature. Mr Stewart added that it was a landmark decision that had implications for both gay and straight relationships. 'It doesn't change the law but it sets up a set of facts with a view to differentiate relationships from that as de facto,' he said. 'It's a modern age and people are shacking up but not necessarily with a view to an exclusive life together or any kind of shared commitment. A Brisbane judge ruled that two men in an open relationship for seven years were not in a de facto relationship in a landmark decision in the Federal Circuit Court (pictured) 'They're having sex and might love each other but they might have multiple partners.' Mr Stewart said the 41-year-old applicant argued they were 'de facto' based on the fact that the pair lived together and shared important events like Christmas together. 'It was really important to tell the court gay men don't always have families around them to go to events like Christmas, and just because they do that doesn't mean they are boyfriends,' he said. 'And if you think about a middle aged man where all he's know is a straight life to then realise he's gay and go to a sex on premises venue, it's pretty overwhelming. 'He wanted to enjoy the fruits of being liberated but then found out he hooked up with the wrong person.'","Decision in the Federal Circuit Court ruled two men 'friends with benefits'

"A 21-year-old model and actor who caught fire train surfing on top a Metro-North car has died from his horrific injuries. Brian McClellen, an avid skateboarding stuntman, was found ablaze on the roof of the Metro-North service shortly after 5am on Sunday in Greenwich. The Ohio native suffered 85 per cent burns across his body and died in hospital Monday. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Hospitalized: Brian McClellen, 21, was engulfed in flames on top of a train to New York at 5am on Sunday. He died today from his horrific injuries . Investigation: McClellen was likely burnt after coming in contact with a pantograph, a mechanical arm on top of the train that collects power from the overhead wires, MTA spokesman Aaron Donovan said . McClellen was likely burnt after coming in contact with a pantograph, a mechanical arm on top of the train that collects power from the overhead wires, MTA spokesman Aaron Donovan said. He said a crewmember used a fire extinguisher to douse the blaze, but he still endured horrific burns. The train, which runs on overhead electrical wires had lost power and the workers had gone up to find out why which is when they found him. The North Royalton High School graduate who grew up in Cleveland, Ohio, describes himself on social media as an actor and a model based in New York City. McClellen's agent, Ryan Colby, told The New York Post the actor had been booked last week for both a TV show titled 'Younger' with Hilary Duff and for a Pierce Brosnan movie titled 'Urge.' He picked 'Younger' and was set to begin work next week, Colby said. After his death was announced his Facebook page was inundated with tributes.

"We've all had those niggling symptoms such as tiredness or pain that won't go away. And many of them could be a sign of any number of conditions. For example, while a dodgy stomach could be due to food poisoning, it could also be a symptom of IBS or something more sinister. Now, medical experts have devised an online symptom checker to try and help the general public understand what their symptoms may indicate. Called Isabel, it was founded by the parents of Isabel Maude, who was misdiagnosed in 1999. Despite doctors saying she had chickenpox, Miss Maude was actually suffering from deadly toxic shock syndrome and necrotising fasciitis, where bacteria eat away at the flesh. Fourteen years on, she still needs ongoing surgery. Scroll down for video . CHECK YOUR SYMPTOMS OUT USING THE ONLINE CHECKER BELOW  - CLICK ON THE ORANGE 'START' BUTTON . It was during the summer of 1999 that Isabel, then three, was diagnosed with chicken pox. When she developed the typical signs and symptoms of the condition, her parents, Jason and Charlotte, were told to expect the itching and general discomfort ─ relatively minor side effects that would subside after a short duration. A few days into the illness Isabel developed a high fever, vomiting, diarrhoea, and severe pain and discolouration of the chicken pox rash. Follow-up visits to the family GP and A&E reassured Mr and Mrs Maude that Isabel’s suffering was normal and nothing to worry about. But as the days went on, alarmed that their daughter's condition was critical, they took her back to hospital. Minutes after arriving, Isabel’s blood pressure dropped dramatically and she required emergency resuscitation. It became clear that what Isabel had been suffering from was not just chicken pox, but a secondary life threatening infection. She was moved under police escort to the paediatric intensive care unit at St. Mary’s Hospital in Paddington, London. Doctors there found she was suffering from common complications of chicken pox:  toxic shock syndrome and necrotising fasciitis, a flesh eating bacteria. See more from Isabel Healthcare . She spent two months in the hospital after experiencing multiple organ failure and cardiac arrest. Throughout the entire ordeal, her parent’s dealt with the notion that their daughter may not survive and, if she did, would likely have suffered brain and other organ damage. To treat the necrotising fasciitis, Isabel underwent an emergency operation to remove the infected skin, leaving extensive scars around her stomach and requiring multiple reconstructive operations. Today, she lives a normal life, but her parents remain emotionally scarred by their daughter's ordeal. However after the event, her father Jason found a way to turn the experience into something hopeful and positive. He believed Isabel’s intense suffering may have been avoided had her doctors at the local hospital had taken all of her symptoms and clinical signs into account and thought of all possible diagnoses, rather than just assuming her symptoms were related to the chicken pox. However rather than suing the hospital for the error, Jason teamed up with doctors from the intensive care unit. Isabel Healthcare was created, in honour of Isabel, and all patients whose lives have been impacted by missed or delayed diagnosis, to help clinicians around the world reduce diagnostic errors. The online symptom checker tool, launched by the website patient.co.uk, has taken 14 years and 150,000 man-hours to develop. Over 16 million people a month visit the site to research health conditions. Medical experts have devised the online symptom checker to help the general public understand what their symptoms may indicate. Called Isabel, it was founded the parents of Isabel Maude who was almost fatally misdiagnosed in 1999 . The developers claim the search engine uses specialised software linked to a medical database. It was initially developed as a tool to help support medical professionals deal with more complex diagnoses or who were in doubt about a particular diagnosis. Dr Hayley Willacy, clinical editor of patient.co.uk, which is now hosting the Isabel symptom checker, said the aim was to provide patients with a reliable research tool when looking online for information about diagnosis - and help them work more effectively with their doctor. Indeed, more people than ever before are turning to Google to diagnose their ailments rather than going to a doctor. An analysis of Google UK earlier this year showed that since 2008, there has been a surge in the number of people searching for terms related to their health, with a massive increase in people looking for symptoms of stress related illnesses. The apparent rise in stress related issues may be due to the recession, which began at around the same time. The study also found there had been twice as many searches than expected for terms such as 'stress symptoms' and 'bloated stomach'. In addition, there had also been a massive rise of 72 per cent in the amount of searches for 'blood pressure symptoms' which may indicate that people are more stressed than ever, and it is affecting their health. Just this week, experts warned that half of all cancer cases are spotted at a late stage when treatment is less likely to be successful. More than 52,000 patients a year are having their odds of survival cut because the disease is not being caught quickly enough. The online symptom checker tool, launched by the website patient.co.uk, has taken 14 years and 150,000 man-hours to develop.The developers claim the search engine uses specialised software linked to a medical database and the site has been endorsed by the past director of the General Medical Council . The shocking figure is based on huge variations in diagnosis around England, with some cancers almost five times as likely to be diagnosed late in some parts of the country as others. Cancer Research UK, which commissioned the analysis of NHS data, said that early diagnosis is ‘crucial to give patients the best chance of survival’. And new statistics from Leukaemia Care found more than half of patients with the condition are only being diagnosed after they have been to hospital which for many is too late as cancer is very advanced them. One in four cancer cases is diagnosed in an accident and emergency department said Macmillian Cancer Support after being ignored by patients or missed by GPs. Isabel's father, and founder of the symptom checker - Jason Maude, said: 'As medicine become more complex and the shortage of GPs gets worse, it is becoming vital for patients to become better informed about their own health. 'With Isabel now available and integrated on the highly respected patient.co.uk website, patients have a powerful tool to help them research their health effectively.' Sir Graeme Catto, emeritus professor of medicine at the University of Aberdeen and past director of the General Medical Council said: 'We all turn to the internet when illness strikes. 'Separating fact from fiction is, however, not straightforward and the information we select may sometimes mislead and make matters worse.

Later, the Queen paid a visit to Greenwich, where she formally reopened the Cutty Sark, five years after it was devastated by fire. After surviving the roughest seas and the devastating blaze, the 'spectacular' Cutty Sark was unveiled by the Queen after a £50 million restoration project. The world's last remaining tea clipper has been restored to her heyday when she carried goods from around the globe back to England. It has been 55 years since the Queen first opened the maritime attraction to the public, and today she returned to repeat the ceremony - but in a dramatic new setting. Richard Doughty, director of the Cutty Sark Trust, described the vessel as 'spectacular' and said: . 'We have a ship fit for the Queen and we're very proud Her Majesty and the Duke of Edinburgh have come to open the site. Magnificent: Hundreds of spectators despite the rain turned up to see The Queen and Prince Philip unveil the restoration of the Cutty Sark in Greenwich today .

Royal approval: The Queen and Prince Philip applaud a presentation during the Cutty Sark reopening ceremony . 'Fifty-five years on from when she first came, it's a very different experience, offering a light environment in the Cutty Sark's new elevated position.' The director said the wealth of positive public feeling towards the clipper was overwhelming when residents were given a free tour of the vessel at the weekend - 'people have invested love in this ship to put it back together again', he said. The clipper is now displayed in a stunning setting, lifted more than 11ft (3.4m) above its dry berth in Greenwich, south east London, and is once again a major landmark passed by runners who took part in Sunday's marathon. The space under the three-masted vessel is home to an interactive museum where visitors can learn about its history. When the fire, caused by a vacuum cleaner that had been left on, struck in 2007 most of the fixtures and fittings had been removed for a major project to renovate the vessel, now 143-years-old, so visitors can see many original features on deck. The royal couple later moved inside to view the Cutty Sark's cramped decks that during its working life were filled with tea from China, and when this cargo was no longer an option, it carried hessian from Manila to New York and castor oil from Calcutta to Melbourne. The King's Troop Royal Horse Artilllery form up at the Royal Museums Greenwich for the Queen's visit . The King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery at the Royal Museums Greenwich as the Royal Row Barge 'Gloriana' floats past along the Thames . Despite its sleek hull and large sails, the ship was dogged by bad winds and accidents and never became the fastest vessel in the tea trade. But she came into her own as a wool clipper sailing the trade route around South America's Cape Horn and through the Roaring Forties trade winds, setting in 1885 a record passage time of 73 days from Sydney to London. Displays on the decks tell the history of the vessel from its construction to how tea is made in China, and Philip had to bow his head at several points to avoid metal girders. The royal couple ventured on to the top deck as the rain stopped and high above their heads were dozens of sailing volunteers in the rigging, with many on the 152ft (46m) main mast. The volunteers had braved the cold, wet and windy conditions for the previous two hours and were given a wave by the Duke and Queen before they attended a reception in the new space below the ship's hull. As they walked into the hall, suspended above the royals was the vessel covered in the gold-coloured muntz metal, a copper and zinc alloy, it would originally have been covered in. The royal couple were introduced to many organisations behind the restoration project and in a brief speech Lord Sterling, chairman of the Cutty Sark Trust, praised Philip saying the clipper 'would not be here today' without his campaigning to preserve it. Before leaving for the National Maritime Museum, the Queen unveiled a plaque to officially open the attraction which will admit the public for the first time tomorrow. Stunning: The Cutty Sark has a dramatic new setting, raised high above its dry dock, with a new visitors' museum underneath . Prince Philip has a long association with the ship, co-founding the Cutty Sark Society in 1951 to safeguard the vessel. He came to Greenwich soon after the fire to assess the damage for himself and Mr Doughty said that the Duke had given up his association with a number of bodies when he turned 90 last year but maintained his relationship with the society, now a trust. 'That shows the depth of commitment he has for this ship he helped to save,' he said. The director added that Philip had given staff valuable advice fromlessons he had learned after the devastating fire at Windsor Castle in 1992.

He said: 'He gave us moral support and some very practical advice in terms of how to get the best from consultants and contractors and other sorts of challenges we might encounter.' The Queen also unveiled a plaque to mark Greenwich becoming a royal borough, an honour bestowed to mark her Diamond Jubilee. The monarch and Philip arrived just as driving rain that had lashed the ship and the hundreds of well-wishers began to stop. The royal couple took their place on a dais and listened to an orchestral and choral suite commissioned by Greenwich to mark the Queen's Diamond Jubilee and composed by Errollyn Wallen.",Monarch also formally reopened Cutty Sark five years after it was devastated by fire .
"The best of British design has been chronicled in a list with London's iconic Tube map and the E-type Jaguar among the country's most quintessential exports. Royal Mail's First Class stamp and a God Save the Queen poster were also included in the list put together by Reader's Digest. One less conventional entry is the Big Brother logo, designed to illustrate the all seeing eye described in George Orwell's 1984 and made famous by Channel 4 in 2002. Going places: London's iconic Tube map was ranked as one of Britain's most quintessential exports . Among items on the list of the best British designs is the E-type Jaguar designed in 1961 by Malcolm Sayer . The controversial Join the ATS poster (left) was withdrawn from circulation after being deemed unsuitable by politicians. The God Save the Queen Sex Pistols album cover (right) also made the list . It is the most recent of the images on the list, with Harry Beck's tube map the oldest at 83. Designed in 1931, the basis of the map is still used by Transport for London. Unlike those before it, Beck's map disregarded the distance between stations and based the diagram on those he drew for his job as an electrical draughtsman. Also on the list is a controversial poster advertising for the Auxiliary Territorial Service in 1941. The poster was an attempt to spruce up the previously dull propaganda used by the ATS, but was criticised for its use of a 'blonde bombshell'. It was withdrawn from circulation after being deemed unsuitable by Parliament. An image of The Queen features twice on the list, in a Sex Pistols poster for God Save the Queen, and in a more-refined profile on the Royal Mail's First Class Stamp. The E-type jag and Kodak's 1968 Instamatic camera also made the list. Daniel Eatock's Big Brother eye is the most recent entry, made recognisable in 2001. Of the logo, Reader's Digest writes: 'Whatever you think of the programme, the Big Brother logo stays lodged in the brain, symbolising the all-seeing Orwellian eye but in this case staring back at the viewer.'

"An internationally renowned preacher was among nine people killed last night when a private jet crashed into a ship-yard crane and exploded  as it came in to land on the island of Grand Bahama. Dr Myles Munroe, 56, and wife Ruth were travelling to a religious convention that he had organised in Freeport when their Lear 36 Executive Jet ploughed into the steel structure and burst into a ball of flame at around 5pm yesterday. They had taken off from Bahamian capital Nassau 45 minutes earlier. ‘The Department of Civil Aviation has been advised unofficially that the aircraft was destroyed and that there were no survivors,’ the country's Ministry of Transport and Aviation. Two of the dead have been named as Dr Myles Munroe, the leader of Bahamas Faith Ministries, and his wife Ruth . The Lear 36 Executive Jet had taken off from the Bahamian capital of Nassau and crashed while attempting to land around 5 p.m. local time in Freeport (stock image of a Lear 36) Known for his work as a 'lecturer, teacher, life coach, government consultant, and leadership mentor', Dr Munroe - who was awarded the OBE in 1998 for his 'spiritual and social contributions to the national development of the Bahamas' - was the leader of Bahamas Faith Ministries (BFM). The passengers were on their way to the Global Leadership Forum hosted by the BFM, an organization that Munroe, 60, founded. The identities of the other people on board have not yet been confirmed. The plane reportedly struck a crane at the Grand Bahama Ship Yard, exploding on impact and crashing into the ground near a junkyard area. There had been heavy rain across the region which may have caused the plane to hit the crane. The plane departed Lynden Pindling International Airport (LPIA) at 4.07pm and crashed while making an approach for landing at Grand Bahama International Airport at 5.10pm, the Department of Civil Aviation said. The ministry said authorities were on scene and a full investigation would begin at daylight on Monday. Grand Bahama is about 70 miles east of Florida. The nine passengers killed in Sunday's crash were on their way to a Global Leadership Forum hosted by the Dr. Munroe's Bahamas Faith Ministries organization.

"An illegal shisha cafe has been demolished after neighbours complained about smell of tobacco and the sound of smokers chatting into the early hours of the morning. A wooden extension accommodating up to 40 smokers had been illegally added to the back of Yasmin Restaurant and Shisha Bar on High Road in Wealdstone, North London. But the structure was removed by Harrow Council this morning as it had been built without planning permission and the cafe owners had apparently ignored requests to remove it. Demolished: The wooden extension was removed by Harrow Council this morning as it had been built without planning permission and the cafe owners had apparently ignored requests to remove it . Cafe: The structure accommodating up to 40 smokers had been illegally added to the back of Yasmin Restaurant and Shisha Bar (pictured) in Wealdstone, North London . Neighbours had complained to the council about the noise and . smell of tobacco wafting into their homes from the Turkish cafe, which was open . to the small hours of the morning. Harrow Council said it had given the owners notice to remove the extension but no action had been taken.Today council workers arrived to pull down the structure. They removed 30 shisha pipes and bags of sweet-smelling tobacco, before taking down the walls and paring the building back to its legally allowed limits. In a day of action elsewhere, planning . enforcement notices were enforced against unlicensed temporary cabins . and a plumber’s office built at the rear of a property. Seized: Council workers removed 30 shisha pipes and bags of sweet-smelling tobacco (left). Shisha smoking (right) is common in the Middle East and Asia and has also become popular in Britain in recent years . Reaction: Harrow Council said the demolition was in response to complaints from the cafe's neighbours, who it said had become 'fed up' with the illegal structure causing 'extra noise and disturbance' Scene: The shisha cafe was at the rear of a Turkish restaurant on High Road in Wealdstone, North London . 'We have got to send a signal to people who think that planning rules are some kind of minor inconvenience that disappear if you ignore them for long enough,' said Harrow Council leader Susan Hall. 'That isn’t fair on the silent . hard-working majority who abide by the law... As leader of the council . they expect me to be tough on law breakers and I will do exactly that,' the Councillor added. Harrow . Council said the demolition was in response to complaints from the . cafe's neighbours, who it said had become 'fed up' with the illegal . structure causing 'extra noise and disturbance'. Describing the need to take action against illegal structures, Councillor Hall said 'ordinary Harrow residents' are looking to Harrow Council to take a lead on the 'upsurge we are witnessing of beds in sheds - or in this case fags in sheds'. The cafe in Wealdstone, North London was demolished because it had broken council rules on planning applications - not because it dealt in shisha. However, many premises fall foul of the law as a result of legislation that came into force on July 1, 2007 which made it illegal to smoke in all enclosed work places in England. Although a loophole meant the ban did not initially apply to shisha premises, this has now been closed and they are no longer exempt from the smoke free legislation. As shisha smoking is generally a communal pastime that can last for several hours, many cafes in the UK have created elaborate shelters with heating equipment and furniture designed to replicate the inside of a building. Providing at least 50 per cent of the structure is open to the air, these shelters are perfectly legal to smoke in, with additional licenses required to serve food, drink and provide entertainment. Shisha is a legal tobacco-like substance that is mixed with sugar or molasses, so the smoke has a sweet smell and taste. Contrary . to the belief of many users, shisha is considered more harmful . than cigarettes because the liquid in the pipes does not act as . a filter for the harmful toxins.

"Whether it’s a pair of wooden shoes from Amsterdam, a beach blanket from Rio de Janeiro or a silk scarf from Cambodia, holidaymakers are filling their luggage – and their homes – with souvenirs from their travels around the world. It turns out that the tradition of collecting travel keepsakes dates as far back as 980BC, providing the groundwork for a global industry that is now worth billions of pounds. Amber beads from Scandinavia were discovered in Ireland and are believed to be the very first souvenir, according to a Holiday Inn infographic that explores the history of travel keepsakes. While today’s travellers collect ‘I Love New York’ T-shirts or tiny replicas of Paris' Eiffel Tower, the first mass produced souvenirs were pilgrim badges from shrines across Europe in 1400AD. Spoon collecting swept through the US in the mid-1800s just before the souvenir boom from 1870 to 1960 as travelling became more affordable and the industry for inexpensive mementos flourished. Popular keepsakes from England included objects painted with images of seaside towns. Today, Britons are among the biggest collectors of souvenirs, spending an estimated £1.2 billion annually.","Tradition of collecting holiday keepsakes dates back to 980BC .

"Accidental poisonings from squishy laundry detergent packets sometimes mistaken for toys or candy landed more than 700 U.S. children in the hospital in just two years, researchers report. Coma and seizures were among the most serious complications. The cases stem from the more than 17,000 poison center calls about the products received in the past two years. The calls involved children younger than six and most weren't seriously harmed. Scroll down for video . Warning: Accidental poisonings from squishy laundry detergent packets sometimes mistaken for toys or candy landed more than 700 U.S. children in the hospital in just two years . But one child died last year and the potential risks highlight a need for even safer packaging, the researchers said. Some manufacturers already have revised packaging and labels in efforts to make the detergent packets or 'pods' safer for children. The study found calls dipped slightly after some of those changes were made. Butylphenyl methylpropional: . A synthetic fragrance that is also used in a number of beauty products. It is considered safe only within recommended use of concentration.However, . it is a skin irritant and there have been tests that found that skin . applications at high concentrations in animals caused sperm damage. Alpha-isomethyl Ionone: Banned . by the International Fragrance Association (IFRA) from being mixed into . fragrance products, such as perfume and cologne, it . has been found to irritate the skin and trigger allergic reactions in . some people. However, it is still found in detergents and other . cosmetics that are not classed as a 'fragrance'. Linalool, Hexyl cinnamal, Citronellol: Severe . allergens that be listed on the label because they are severe . allergens. Higher concentrations can even cause central nervous system . disruption (thus their use in certain pesticides) and skin, eye and . respiratory tract irritation. These chemicalc can also trigger asthma . attacks. The products contain concentrated liquid laundry soap and became widely available in the U.S. two years ago. Some are multicolored and may look enticing to young children. Poisoning or injuries including mouth, throat and eye burns can occur when kids burst the capsules or put them in their mouths. In the study, 144 had eye injuries, 30 went into comas and 12 had seizures. Exposure to household cleaning products is among the top reasons for calls to poison centers involving young children. In 2012, detergent packet calls accounted for a fraction - about six percent - of the 111,000 calls involving young children and cleaning products, according to the American Association of Poison Control Centers. Many calls involve regular laundry detergent, which can cause mild stomach upsets, but poison center experts say the new concentrated laundry packets seem to cause more severe problems. Jessica Morin of Houston says her nine-month-old daughter, Marlow, was sickened earlier this year when Jessica's grandmother mistook a detergent pod for a teething toy and put it in the baby's mouth. 'I called poison control and they said to take her to the ER immediately,' Morin said. Marlow was repeatedly vomiting and underwent tests, but doctors at Texas Children's Hospital found no serious damage and she didn't need to stay overnight. 'We were very lucky,' Morin said. 'We don't have those pods in our house anymore.' Symptoms: Poisoning or injuries including mouth, throat and eye burns can occur when kids burst the capsules or put them in their mouths (Picture posed by model) The researchers examined 2012-13 data from the poison control centers group. Their study was published online Monday in Pediatrics. Overall, there were 17,230 poison center calls about young kids getting into the packets, including 769 children who were hospitalized. Dr. Gary Smith, the study's lead author, said his hospital had two recent cases - kids who developed breathing problems and required treatment in the intensive care unit. He's director of the Center for Injury Research and Policy at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio. The American Cleaning Institute, which represents makers of cleaning products, issued voluntary guidance in March encouraging manufacturers to use labels that prominently list safe handling information. The cleaning institute said it is also working with manufacturers to educate parents. But a survey the group released last week suggests many consumers still don't know about the risks. The Consumer Product Safety Commission says children should not be allowed to handle the packets and advises parents to store them out of children's sight and reach.","The capsules are usually brightly colored and wrapped in clear plastic .

"Within hours of the fatal fire, the behaviour of Mick and Mairead Philpott was already arousing the suspicions of the police. The couple were keen to ‘get rich quick’ off the back of the children’s deaths, receiving at least £3,100 directly in cash gifts which they used to buy new sportswear and to get drunk at parties. Mick Philpott remained shameless to the last - and he was still smiling even after being convicted of killing six of his children. Scroll down for video . Philpott appeared to revel in the 'celebrity' of being the father of six dead youngsters and dabbed away non-existent tears at a press conference . Together with his wife Mairead and friend . Paul Mosley, he had plotted to set fire to the family home in an . appalling attempt to frame Philpott's former live-in lover Lisa Willis. Today the trio face sentencing for their deadly actions. Far from being an anguished father, Mick's inappropriate actions in the aftermath of the blaze made investigators suspicious. A shrine to the six dead children: Philpott tried to auction teddy bears left in memory of his children . Flowers piled high: The community left teddies outside the Philpotts' home in Victory Road, Derby. Shameless Mick wanted to sell the teddies and keep the money .

Prosecutors wanted to tell jurors . about Philpott’s private thirst to ‘spend’ the cash or ‘get rich quick’ from it, arguing he had been presenting  a ‘very different public . face’.  But the evidence was ruled inadmissible. The deadly gamble was to save the six . youngsters, blame Miss Willis, and win back custody of five children who . had recently moved out of the cramped three-bedroom semi with her. Yesterday Mick, Mairead and Mosley were found guilty of manslaughter by a jury at Nottingham Crown Court. The former live-in lover who Mick Philpott tried to frame for the . fatal fire in a bitter custody battle is 'happy for the first time in . years', it was revealed today. Lisa Willis, who had five children with the killer, left the house . she shared with him and his wife Mairead in a bizarre love triangle in . February last year. But when took the children with her, Philpott hatched a despicable plot to start a fire at his house and blame her. She was arrested the day after the blaze which killed six of his other children, but was released within hours. A source told The Sun: 'She has escaped the nightmare that was living with Philpott and Mairead. 'She is now a new woman, happy for the first time in years.' Assistant . Chief Constable Steve Cotterill, of Derbyshire Police, said after . yesterday's verdict: 'We decided at a very early stage Lisa Willis was . not involved.' Philpott, 56, shouted obscenities before saying ‘it’s not over yet’ moments after Mrs Justice Thirlwall asked for the verdicts to be received in silence ‘out of respect for the memories’ of the children he had killed. But with typical arrogance, Philpott, who infamously appeared on the Jeremy Kyle Show to demand a bigger council house, crossed himself, waved and smiled as he was led away. On May 11 last year, after Philpott had a sordid sex session with his wife and Mosley on their home snooker table, the fire was lit, with the intention that the six children sleeping upstairs would be saved through an upstairs window, with Philpott both ‘the hero and the victim’. But the idiotic plan went disastrously wrong. Too much petrol was used and the fire burned out of control – leaving Philpott unable to reach the children in temperatures approaching 1,000F. Jade Philpott, ten, and brothers Duwayne, 13, John, nine, Jack, eight, Jesse, six and Jayden, five, all died of smoke inhalation.

Mick Philpott and Mairead Philpott was found guilty of manslaughter and starting the blaze yesterday . Mick and Mairead Philpott wanted to 'get rich quick' off the back of their six children's deaths . He died there three days later. Duwayne’s . godmother Jeannie Donnan said that in the hospital canteen ‘they would . all sit quiet and then all of a sudden they’d all start a food fight and . I was like, how can you have a food fight? You have just lost six kids … . I was just sitting there thinking “no, this is not right”.’ By the time of a press conference five days after the blaze, he and his wife were already under deep suspicion. Philpott . called the conference himself, ostensibly to thank the emergency . services for their efforts to save his children. He appeared to be . revelling in the ‘celebrity’ of being the father of six dead youngsters. During the trial, the court heard how Philpott lived with . his wife, Miss Willis and their combined 11 children in his cramped . three-bedroom council house in Allenton, Derby. But he was left irate after Miss Willis, 29, became disillusioned with his ‘domineering behaviour’ and summoned the courage to escape the unconventional family home with her five children early last year. That decision to leave, taking with her more than £1,000 a month in benefit payments, was the ‘catalyst for everything that was to follow’. Steve Cotterill, Derbyshire Assistant . Chief Constable, compared Philpott’s demeanour to that of an ‘excited . child’. Far from seeming nervous, Philpott chatted about his love of . karaoke and singing Elvis songs. Tragic end: Kind-hearted locals raised £15,000 for the funeral of Mick Philpott's six children (top row, l-r) Jayden, five, Jessie, six, Jack, eight, (bottom row, l-r) John, nine, Jade, 10, and Duwyane, 13 . He . dabbed imaginary tears from his eyes during the brief conference, then . performed a fake collapse in a corridor seconds after being ushered off . stage. His wife said nothing throughout the event. Just . 24 hours earlier, the couple made their first of three ‘circus-like’ visits to the mortuary, in which Philpott called his six dead children . ‘little sh***’, indulged in one-sided ‘horseplay’ with a police officer . and asked for gin when he was offered water. Yesterday Philpott’s sister, Dawn Bestwick, said his family believed ‘justice has been served’. ‘This past year has been a very difficult time for our family as we have had to come to terms with what Michael and Mairead and Paul Mosley have done,’ she said. ‘We can now attempt to move on and our six angels can rest in peace.’ Mrs Philpott’s family said the children had been taken away in the ‘cruellest way imaginable by the very people who were supposed to love and protect them.’ Her sister Bernadette, who was ejected from the courtroom, said she was convinced of the Philpotts’ guilt from the outset.","Mick Philpott faked a collapse at a press conference after children's deaths .

"More than a million people watched a video of a couple 'having sex' on Charlton Athletic's football pitch before it was revealed as a publicity stunt. The footage was uploaded to a Vine account on Wednesday afternoon and appeared to show a mystery couple in the middle of the club's grounds - The Valley - in south east London. The clip was captioned by user Showboat Vines as 'Someone broke into The Valley (home of Charlton) and did this in the centre circle! #SextraTime'. Scroll down for video . The video of the couple allegedly 'having sex' at the home ground of Charlton Athletic in south east London . A full version of the video has been released - and it was not shot on Saturday after all . But after initially denying knowledge of the video, Charlton have now confessed it was a publicity stunt for a scheme allowing grassroots footballers to score - for real - at the club's ground. The vine clip was taken from a longer video which has now been uploaded to YouTube and purports to show several CCTV angles of the excited couple sneaking into the ground. The video had already prompted debate after fans of Silent Witness claimed it may have been from a deleted scene from the BBC crime drama. An episode of the crime series filmed at the stadium in January last year features a storyline about a footballer who was linked to a brutal murder of a young woman after a sex tape of him was leaked. Bleacher Report UK posted on Twitter: 'Could the ""Charlton Athletic sex tape' actually be a scene from the TV show Silent Witness?' While Steve Harrison wrote: 'Did the BBC break a story that Charlton are investigating a couple having sex on the centre spot? Wasn't it filmed for one of their shows?' But a PR firm for Charlton - whose officials initially announced they would carry out an investigation - now admit the video was a promotional tool. Promotion: The video was all to grab attention for a scheme involving grassroots footballers . Not everyone saw the funny side. One fan of the club nicknamed the Addicks fumed: 'We are the Addicks - not the sex addicts!' It is not the first time a couple have sneaked onto a football pitch to share a moment of passion. In 2013, after a Danish Superliga match between Brondby and Randers, which ended goalless, an unknown couple sneaked onto the pitch and started having sex by the centre circle. Brøndby press officer Mikkel Davidsen reported the incident on his Twitter feed, and an image of the canoodling couple was then posted online. Further reports have also indicated that the pair's love making failed to last long as the couple were interrupted by the club's security chief, James Mickel Lauritsen, who threw them out of the stadium. Croatia international Dino Drpic and his wife Nives Celsius also had sex on the centre spot of his club's Zagreb stadium. His national team later beat England 2-0 there in a Euro 2008 qualifier. In an interview on a Serbian TV chatshow to promote her book 'The Naked Truth', Miss Celsius revealed that the couple had even arranged for friends to leave the floodlights on at the Maksimir Stadium so they could see what they were doing. Charlton currently lie 16th in the Championship, eight points clear of the relegation zone .

"It's long been hailed as one of the great international cities, but now London's linguistic diversity has been mapped thanks to Twitter. This colour-coded graphic pinpoints the location and language of tweets sent from the British capital and shows how linguistic groups are clustered in the city's various districts. The revealing map is the work of University College London PhD student Ed Manley and James Cheshire, a lecturer at UCL's Centre of Advanced Spatial Analysis. Global city: This map shows the language distribution of tweets across London over this summer . Using an open-source website language detector, the pair detected the predominant language used in 3.3million GPS-enabled tweets sent over the summer. Perhaps unsurprisingly, 92.5 per cent of the tweets were sent in English, but the researchers detected a total of 66 languages among the data including tongues as esoteric as Haitian Creole, Basque and even Swahili. The map shows how English tweets, . shown in grey, predominate and provide crisp outlines to roads and train . lines as people tweet while moving around the city, Professor Cheshire . explains. The city's beating heart: Most of London's linguistic diversity is situated in the city centre, but includes multilingual hot spots like the Olympic Park and a bizarre concentration of French speakers in Lewisham, bottom right . In the city's north more Turkish tweets, shown in blue, appear; Arabic tweets - appropriately in green - are most common around Edgware Road; and parts of the West End show pockets of Russian tweets in pink. Professor Cheshire explains on his blog: 'The geography of the French tweets (red) is perhaps most surprising as they appear to exist in high density pockets around the centre and don’t stand out in South Kensington (an area with the Institut Francais, a French High School and the French Embassy). 'It may be that as a proportion of tweeters in this area they are small so they don’t stand out, or it could be that there are prolific tweeters (or bots) in the highly concentrated areas.' Mr Manley told Metro the project revealed a few matches but 'a lot of the time it didn't actually match in the same volume as we expected'. On his blog he points out that languages he had expected to feature prominently like Bengali and Somali barely appear on the map. 'Either people only tweet in English, or usage of Twitter varies significantly among language groups in London,' he speculates. To create the map  Mr Manley fed a Twitter dataset containing the tweets through the Chromium Compact Language Detector - a open-source Python library adapted from the Google Chrome algorithm which detects a website's language. The approach was not entirely reliable. Around 1.4million tweets had to be discarded because the language could not be determined, while it showed a surprising number sent in Tagalog - a language of the Philippines. A closer look revealed that many of these exotic tweets included uses of English online colloquialisms like 'hahahahaha', 'ahhhhhhh' and 'lololololol'. 'I don't know much about Tagalog but it sounds like a fun language,' Mr Manley said on his blog, adding that it was eventually removed from the analysis.","92.5 per cent of tweets sent in English, but other major languages include Spanish, French, Turkish and Arabic ."
"A new photo of a mysterious flying object over Kansas has been revealed. It appears to be the same aircraft as one that was snapped soaring over Texas last month. The exact identify of the aircraft remains a mystery, but rumours abound that it could be a secret jet. A mysterious flying object was snapped flying over Wichita, Kansas by Jeff Templin. It resembles a similar unidentified aircraft streaking across the skies of Texas last month . 'The photo is grainy because it was taken with a hand-held maxed-out 400mm telephoto lens through a cloud layer and then it was severely cropped to bring it up even close,' says Jeff Templin, who took the photo on 16 April. 'There is no way to know the altitude and no way to judge its size as there is no point of reference. 'My sense of it with the naked eye was that it was quite high, at least the altitude passenger jets cruise over but if it were smaller like a ""drone"" it could conceivably have been lower and smaller.' The Aviationist speculates that the plane could be a RQ-180 stealth drone or a prototype of America's next generation long range strike bomber (LSRB). They, too, are unsure if it is the same plane as the one spotted previously . A retired Marine with nearly two decades of aviation experience stepped forward with a compelling theory about the mysterious plane that was spotted flying over Texas last month. On March 10, photographers Steve Douglass and Dean Muskett took pictures of three puzzling aircraft flying over Amarillo, and posted them online in hopes of identifying the planes. Retired-Marine James Vineyard submitted one of the more interesting explanations, telling the Houston Chronicle he believed they were SR-72 Blackbirds - a spy plane that can cross the U.S. in less than an hour, unmanned.

A retired Marine says the plane pictured in Amarillo last month is the SR-72 Blackbird - a plane designed to cross the country in less than an hour . The mystery aircraft  seen over Amarillo on March 10. Three of the craft were spotted flying by . Vineyard spent 17 years as a Marine and also worked with a jet squadron in Arizona. In 1956, British magazines started . getting eyewitness accounts and grainy photos of the Lockheed U-2, then . operating out of RAF Lakenheath on its first flights over the Soviet . Union - marking the first sight of a spy plane that government's . had hoped to keep secret from prying eyes. It provided day and night, very high-altitude (70,000 feet / 21,000 m), all-weather intelligence gathering. He . says the Pentagon may have dispatched the planes to the Indian Ocean to . aide in the search for missing Malaysian Airlines flight 370. But Douglass, who saw the planes himself, doesn't agree. 'The . SR-72 is still in development,' he said Tuesday. 'Plus it's a . high-speed, high-Mach plane. These were going airliner speed. They were . not in a hurry to get anywhere.' The . SR-72 is currently being developed by Lockheed Martin in California, . and according to the company's website they say the plane could be . operational as early as 2030. It . is the predecessor of the SR-71 which broke speed records when it flew . from New York to Lonton in less than two hours in 1976. Lockheed . Martin's Hypersonics program manager Brad Leland wrote that the plane . is designed to 'strike at nearly any location across a continent in less . than an hour.' 'Speed is . the next aviation advancement to counter emerging threats in the next . several decades. The technology would be a game-changer in theater, . similar to how stealth is changing the battlespace today,' Leland said. Another source told the Chronicle that the plane was a B-2, but the two photographers discovered that no B-2s were flying in the country that day . The SR-72 is a successor to the SR-71 which broke speed records when it flew from New York to London in less than two hours in 1976 . Another . reader, who wished not to be identified, told the Chronicle with . confidence that 'It's a B-2 stealth bomber flying out of Whiteman Air . Force Base in Missouri.' That's . what the photographers thought when they first saw the group of . aircraft, but they say they checked with the base and no B-2s were . flying anywhere in the U.S. that day. Instead, . Douglass believes that the planes are a no type of spy plane - a . stealth transport plane that could sneak troops into a another country . unseen.","A new image shows a mysterious aircraft flying over Kansas .

"Wearing bespoke tailored outfits with perfectly combed hair, these models would look suitably placed on the set of Downton Abbey. Their immaculate period white-and black-tie attire and country-gent tweed jackets are akin to the wardrobes of the 1920s characters and to the tailleur worn by His Lordship's Hugh Bonneville in the hit ITV series. But alas, they are not from the period drama, and rather their impeccable dress is the Edwardian-inspired Autumn/Winter collection by Savile Row tailors.

"Savannah Guthrie has given birth to a baby girl called Vale, it was announced by her delighted Today show colleagues on Thursday. The morning anchor had the baby, weighing 8.5lb and measuring 19.5inches, in the early hours of Wednesday at a New York City hospital. The 42-year-old host had  posted a cryptic tweet in the earlier hours of Thursday which read: 'My 3am wake up call sounds a lot different now. Sweeter...' Scroll down for video . Savannah Guthrie and husband Mike Feldman pictured with their newborn baby girl Vale Guthrie Feldman .

He retweeted Savannah's tweet, adding: 'This sound is like music to my ears.' Mr Feldman, 45, was by Savannah's side when she gave birth. The political consultant and the TV presenter married on March 15 this year in Tucson, Arizona. They announced at their wedding reception that Savannah was pregnant with her first child. Today reported: 'At the moment, she has blue eyes, a little bit of blondish hair and the chubbiest cheeks you've ever seen.' Savannah sent a message adding: 'The baby is more cheek than baby at the moment.' The name Vale is taken from an old English word meaning 'valley by a stream', anchor Matt Lauer shared with viewers. Lauer said: 'They named her that because she was so calm and so serene until ten o'clock last night. 'I actually talked to Savannah and Mike on the phone last night and the baby was fussing a little bit and she said ''but she was so peaceful!''' He added: 'They are over, overjoyed and everybody is doing great.' Lauer said that he had then been texting with Savannah on Wednesday when she suddenly she went quiet. After a probing text, Savannah replied with a text of a baby's foot.

NBC has not revealed who will fill in for Savannah while she is away learning the ropes of first time motherhood. In May, NBC News president Deborah Turness said in a statement to The New York Times: 'Savannah has been such a big part of the Today show’s momentum over the last few months. 'While she’s with her newborn we’ll keep that momentum going with our own homegrown talent with perhaps a few surprises mixed in.'

Last month, she finally ditched the heels and appeared on her live segment wearing sneakers. 'Unbutton those jeans and glory in the elastic waistband,' she wrote on her blog. 'There is no point in sucking in your stomach, or squeezing into a dress, or trying to look good in a bathing suit.' Opening up about the sacred connection she has with her unborn child, following a long struggle with fertility issues leading up to it, she wrote in May: 'The baby is the first thought when I wake up, and the last thought as I sink into slumber at night. 'I whisper little encouragements to the baby: ""You’re doing a great job growing up!"" or ""I’m so happy you’re here!""' 'I pray for the baby. I sing to him/her. I wonder about the baby constantly: ''What are you up to? Are you sleeping right now? Are you awake?

"An ancient Egyptian kingdom close to the Nile collapsed more than 4,200 years ago because it failed to adapt to climate change, according to new research. During Egypt’s Old Kingdom - the pyramid-building time - 4,200 years ago, droughts and fires plagued the region, causing famine and social unrest. Scientists examined 7,000-year-old ancient pollen and charcoal samples from the Nile to piece together the time - and found evidence of a 'mega drought' in the the area. The Great Pyramid in Giza was built by Egyptians between 2560¿2540BC . Marcia McNutt, of the US Geological Survey (USGS), said: 'Even the mighty builders of the ancient pyramids more than 4,000 years ago fell victim when they were unable to respond to a changing climate. 'This study illustrates that water availability was the climate-change Achilles Heel then for Egypt, as it may well be now, for a planet topping seven billion thirsty people.' The researchers examined the presence and amount of charcoal, as fires increase during times of drought leaving charcoal in the geological records. The temple of Abu Simbel was built after the mega drought observed in the geological records . They also found large reductions of wetland pollen, signifying far fewer plants grew, and increases in microscopic charcoal occurred during four different periods between 3,000 and 6,000 years ago. One of those events was the abrupt and global mega-drought around 4,200 years ago, which led to famines and probably played a role in the end of Egypt’s Old Kingdom and affected other Mediterranean cultures. These events are also recorded in history - the first about 5,000 years ago when the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt happened and the Uruk Kingdom in modern Iraq collapsed, the Geology study says. The second event 3,000 years ago took place in the eastern Mediterranean and is associated with the fall of the Ugarit Kingdom and famines in the Babylonian and Syrian Kingdoms. Christopher Bernhardt, of the USGS, said: 'Humans have a long history of having to deal with climate change. The aftermath of the drought and sandstorms which destroyed the Egyptian Old Kingdom around 2200BC was shown in the BBC's Death on the Nile . 'Along with other research, this study geologically reveals that the evolution of societies is sometimes tied to climate variability at all scales - whether decadal or millennial.' Professor Benjamin Horton, of the University of Pennsylvania, said: 'The study geologically demonstrates that when deciphering past climates, pollen and other micro-organisms, such as charcoal, can augment or verify written or archaeological records - or they can serve as the record itself if other information doesn’t exist or is not continuous.'","Researchers analysed pollen and charcoal levels in the Nile and found evidence of massive fires and few crops .

"Sir Nicholas Macpherson, the most senior mandarin at the Treasury, has revealed that they will seek to play a 'critical role' in the referendum debate . Treasury mandarins are planning to issue a stark warning . about the economic perils of withdrawing from the European Union. In a move that has enraged Eurosceptics, officials are set . to publish a formal report in the run up to a referendum arguing that it will . damage Britain’s trade relations if the UK votes to leave in 2017. Sir Nicholas Macpherson, the most senior mandarin at the . Treasury, has revealed that they will seek to play a ‘critical role’ in the referendum . debate, just as the department has done in the argument over Scottish . independence. The Treasury produced a report arguing that a Yes vote in . Scotland would damage the economy. In a speech to the Mile End Group, a politics forum at Queen . Mary, University of London, Sir Nicholas said: ‘Just as the Treasury has played . a leading role in setting out the implications of Scotland leaving the free . trade area that is the United Kingdom, so would I expect it to play a critical . role in setting out the economic implications of the options of staying in or . leaving the EU, should there be a referendum on our membership in the next . Parliament.’ He signalled that the Treasury would argue that Britain . needs to be in the EU to benefit from free trade in the single market and deals . between the EU and other countries. ‘A belief in free trade links seamlessly the Treasury of . William Gladstone to that of George Osborne,’ Sir Nicholas said. ‘The Treasury . has always taken the view that the United Kingdom is a small country with few . natural resources. Its prosperity rests on trade. And the fewer the impediments . there are to trade, the more the economy will grow and the greater the . prosperity of the nation.’ A senior Government source made clear that the Treasury . would argue that Britain must stay in the EU and said Sir Nicholas’s views are . also shared by the Chancellor George Osborne. Asked if the Treasury will argue for the UK to remain, the . source said: ‘Absolutely. Sir Nicholas is of the view that while there are . aspects of the EU which need to be reformed it would not be in Britain’s long . term economic interests to go it alone. That is a view which is shared by the . Chancellor.’ The Tories have promised to hold a referendum on Britain's membership of the EU by 2017 of David Cameron is Prime Minister after the 2015 election . The revelations led Tory MPs to accuse the Treasury of . attempting to scare the public in favour of a ‘yes’ vote. Leading Eurosceptic Douglas Carswell said: ‘These comments . clearly show that Macpherson and the Treasury are not neutral players in the . debate about Britain’s future in Europe. ‘They are signed up members of the “yes” campaign already. In . some ways it is useful to know – because at least we will know who we are up . against in the referendum. ‘But in a way it is not surprising because it was Whitehall . grandees who took us into this wretched club in the first place.’ Bill Cash, chairman of the European Scrutiny Committee, . criticised Sir Nicholas for speaking out. ‘I think it is extremely unwise for officials to make . remarks of this kind on sensitive issues of national importance,’ he said. The Treasury refused to comment. ‘Sir Nicholas’s comments . speak for themselves,’ a source said.","Sir Nicholas Macpherson reveals plan to argue against exit from Europe .

"When Popy Rani Das, 21, from the Kishoreganj district of central Bangladesh, fell in love with a local boy, her family was delighted - even more so when he asked her to marry him. But less than two months after the marriage, Popy, now 22, found herself in hospital doubled up in pain. The reason? Her husband Prodeep, incensed by her family's inability to pay a dowry, had tricked her into drinking a glass of acid in a bid to murder her and clear the way to marriage with someone else. Tragically, Popy is by no means alone. At Jibontara Hospital in Dhaka, a specialist burns unit funded by the Acid Survivors Foundation, the wards are packed with men, women and children who have fallen prey to acid attacks. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Tragic: Popy Rani Das, 22, was tricked into drinking acid by her husband Prodeep who is currently being prosecuted. A year on from the attack, she is still in hospital . Agony: Muezzin Abdul Kader, 47, was attacked by a cousin during a land dispute while Shamsun Nahar, 29 (right), also found herself the victim of a relative's attack . Globally, the majority of acid attacks occur in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Cambodia, Nepal and Uganda, although the numbers of British victims are increasing and include, most famously, model-turned-presenter Katie Piper. The reasons are legion, with many occurring between husbands and wives although others happen because of rejection, as a way of removing a business rival or even as revenge for a relationship gone wrong. One man who knows all too well the implications of what can happen when a business deal goes wrong is muezzin Abdul Kader, 47, who was left scarred for life after a cousin threw acid in his face during a dispute over land. Others, such as Shyamol Kumar, 14, were caught in the crossfire when someone close to them was attacked. The teenager, who comes from the city of Debiganj in Bangladesh, was splashed with acid as he slept next to his mother - the intended target - one night. Innocent victim: Shyamol Kumar, 14, was hurt in an attack on his mother by neighbours angry that she refused to have an affair with them while his father was away . Big plans: Despite the injuries inflicted on Umma Aysha Siddike Nila by her husband, the 22-year-old is currently studying for a degree in finance . Horrific: Jahanara Akhtar Parul, 27, was attacked by a cousin during a family row while Shamim Sheikh, 45, was hurt by the husband of a woman he had an affair with . Now Shyamol, Popy and Abdul's stories have been brought together in a heartbreaking collection of photographs by Copenhagen-based Danish photographer, Ken Hermann, 35. 'Popy was one of the hardest to photograph,' he reveals. 'She was really crying before we did the interview and . pictures.' And for good reason: Since the attack, Popy's badly burned mouth, digestive tract, stomach and trachea have left her unable to eat without pain. 'It was pretty shocking to see so many victims of acid attacks,' adds Mr Hermann, 'but apart from that, doing the shoot wasn't difficult. All the survivors were very friendly and helpful. When you start working, you get so focused on getting the right pictures that you almost forget how bad some of the victims look.' Particularly badly hurt was Umma Aysha Siddike Nila, now 22, who was 15 when she had acid thrown into her face and upper body by her husband, Akbar Hossain Jilhuq, a man 20 years older than she is. Like so many victims, Umma's injuries came about following a series of violent rows with her husband - rows that left her so traumatised, her parents had threatened to take her away from her husband. Shocking: . Student Monira Begum, 24, was attacked by her fiance and father's . employer Swapan Gazi following a dispute between the two men . Appalling: Mokammala Rita, 43, was attacked by a neighbour rejected by her sister while Shamsun Nahar, 43, was left blind after refusing to have an affair . Dispute: Hasen Ali, a 58-year-old farmer, was attacked by a neighbour with industrial acid following a wrangle over a stolen bicycle . Sadly, they weren't in time to stop the attack which left Umma badly scarred and forced to give up her dreams of becoming a dancer. Nevertheless, Umma, who is currently studying for a degree in finance, has big plans for the future - much to delight of Hermann. 'I really respect those people,' he adds. 'Some . of them are very badly hurt and yet, they are still fighting to live as normal a life as possible which must be incredibly difficult following such a devastating attack.' Entitled Survivors, the project includes photos of 18 acid attack victims - all of whom come from Bangladesh, although the problem extends far beyond the south Asian country's borders. This is something Mr Hermann hopes to highlight. 'Not enough is being done to help these people, although things are getting better,' he says. 'The reason I wanted to do the project was to draw attention to the issue and make people aware that it's still going on. 'Hopefully, that will mean fewer people will become victims in future. The Acid Survivor's Foundation has done a lot to help people in Bangladesh but much more could still be done.' For more on Survivors, see kenhermann.dk.
