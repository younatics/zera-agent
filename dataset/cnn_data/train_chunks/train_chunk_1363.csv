"The majority of teenage girls don't often think about their fertility when they are still in high school. But Jaida Wand didn't have a choice. When the 17-year-old from Coogee in Sydney finishes her HSC this year, she has decided to freeze her eggs  to have the best chance of having children later in life. Jaida, who was diagnosed with stage three Hodgkin's lymphoma in November 2013, underwent six months of gruelling chemotherapy. But she still doesn't know for sure how the treatment affected her fertility. Jaida Wand, 17, was diagnosed with stage three Hodgkin's lymphoma in November 2013 . 'When I got diagnosed, everything happened so fast. (Within a week) we went to see a fertility specialist. I was in my pyjamas in the waiting room,' Jaida told Daily Mail Australia. 'I was worried about having to do homework two days before and then I was having to worry about having kids. 'I asked the doctor if my cancer would effect (my ovaries)... she didn't know and that was pretty shocking. I was really sick - stage three out of four - so it was too late to freeze my eggs. I had to jump into treatment the next day. 'I was just about to start treatment that was going to make me look like a different person... and I had to think about whether I was going to be infertile - it was crazy and shocking.' When the 17-year-old from Coogee in Sydney finishes her HSC this year, she has decided to freeze her eggs to have the best chance of having children later in life . Jaida underwent six months of gruelling chemotherapy but still doesn't know for sure how the treatment effected her fertility . Jaida says she's eligible to have her eggs frozen now, but she will wait until after her HSC to go through the processes. 'So when I'm 35 I'll have eggs of a 17-year-old... it's pretty weird,' she said. She is among thousands of young cancer patients who are participating in a world first online registry that will collect data from their medical history and inform them on their ability to have a child after diagnosis. The Australiasian Oncofertility Registry is headed by Jaida's oncologist, Dr Antoinette Anazodo, who works out of both the Prince of Wales Hospital and Sydney Children's Hospital at Randwick. Jaida is among thousands of young cancer survivors  participating in a world first online registry that will collect data from a patient's medical history and inform them on their ability to have a child after diagnosis . The Australiasian Oncofertility Registry is headed by Jaida's oncologist, Dr Antoinette Anazodo (pictured), who works out of both the Prince of Wales Hospital and Sydney Children's Hospital at Randwick . Jaida, who was in Year 10 when she was diagnosed, said several of her friends shaved their heads in support . 'Once a patient finishes treatment they may not be able to accurately recall the drugs or treatment received as a result of their diagnosis,' Dr Anazodo said. 'As some cancer drugs can cause reproductive challenges, the registry will be able to assist cancer patients and survivors by providing information at a later date when they choose to start their family.' Dr Anazodo said outcomes generated from the registry will also assist cancer clinicians in providing accurate risk projections for a patient's future infertility after cancer treatment. While Jaida isn't interested in having children now, she said it was comforting to know she could potentially still have them. 'When I got sick it was pretty overwhelming and devastating. I had to give up my social life for a while and I kept thinking it was okay because things would get better. But then I thought maybe my fertility wouldn't,' she said. 'I didn't want my cancer to define me.' The bubbly teenager made it to her Year 10 formal by rescheduling her chemo treatments. She wore an 'amazing' wig (pictured) that she joked was better than her normal hair . Jaida said she had to give up her social life and had to miss school while she was undergoing treatment . Jaida would spend three days in hospital every time she had a round of intense chemotherapy . Jaida had to miss out on classes at school and most social events during her treatment, but she did make it to her Year 10 formal. 'We scheduled my chemo around my formal. The most annoying part (of treatment) was losing my hair. I lost everything - my eyebrows, eyelashes. I wore this amazing wig to the formal and it was better than my normal hair,' she said. Since finishing treatment, Jaida and her family have been making up for lost time. 'As soon as I finished treatment, my parents took me and four friends to Fiji to celebrate. They've been spoiling me like crazy. 'I've also been to Japan, Dubai and Turkey.' Since finishing treatment, Jaida and her family have been making up for lost time by travelling to Fiji, Japan, Dubai and Turkey . Jaida will finish her HSC at the end of the year and plans to study science at university. She says she's making the most of life after six months of intense treatment . She plans to study science at university when she finishes high school, but admits she'd love to work in oncology and learn more about cancer. 'I look at myself a year ago and I was bald in hospital and sick. Now I've got a tan and I'm going to the beach. 'Things could have been a lot worse. I'm really lucky that mine was curable. It doesn't mean I didn't have a bad experience - I lost my innocence, it changed my life, I had to grow up a lot faster.'","Jaida Wand was diagnosed with  Hodgkin's lymphoma in November 2013 .

"Thousands of snippets of data have been gathered to provide a detailed look at one of New York City's most iconic sights - the yellow cab. An info-graphic by Vizual-statistix this week has revealed that the most common first name in 2014 among the 52,131 authorized  drivers (those behind the wheel of both yellow cabs and limousines) is Mohammad - and alternate spellings MD, Mohammed, Muhammad, and Mohamed. The next most common names were Jean and Abdul. The most common surname is Singh followed by Rahman and Islam, according to the wealth of information available for public use through the project NYC Open Data. According to city statistics, New York cab drivers are the epitome of diversity. Cabbies come from all of the Big Apple's five boroughs; 31 states (and D.C). and more than 175 countries around the world. A new info-graphic on New York City cab and limo drivers reveals that the most popular driver name is Mohammed followed by Jean . More than 10,000 yellow cab drivers come from Bangladesh (23 per cent), close to 6,000 from Pakistan (13 per cent) while U.S.-born drivers made up 6 per cent. The profession continues to be male dominated - with around 49,500 men at the wheel compared to just 536 women. The average age of a yellow cab driver is 46 years old - with the youngest aged 19 and as of August 2013, the oldest was 94. Big yellow taxi: Cab drivers in New York are the epitome of the city's diversity . Creator of the infographic, Seth Kadish, told Daily Mail Online on Wednesday that he creates the data-based graphics as a hobby and that his taxi-driver graphs and tables took around an hour to complete. Mr Kadish, who lives in Portland, Oregon, is a data scientist by trade for California-based company Chegg. He was inspired to collate taxi driver names after a previous graphic he had seen about salon worker names. In order to create the graphic, Mr Kadish explained, he did not take middle names into account but allowed alternate spellings of the same name. On his Tumblr account, he added: 'The heat map below the bar graphs shows the frequency of first and last name pairings. This hints at the diversity of first or last names in some countries compared to others. 'For example, Singh is the most common last name, but none of the most common first names are paired with it - it is traditionally a last name in India, but due to the diversity of first names in India, none of them are in the top 20. 'The most common first name paired with Singh is Balwinder, which is the 52nd most common first name. 'Conversely, Jean (the French version of John) is the sixth most common first name, but is not associated with any of the top 20 last names. Francois, the most common last name paired with Jean, is not even among the 100 most common last names.' The data scientist has created many info-graphics on a wide range of subjects and said he is often influenced to seek out data by what he reads in the news. The cab driver info-graphic was created after a glut of stories about Uber - but Mr Kadish couldn't analyze the controversial transport company's data because it isn't shared publicly. His other recent graphics include 'The correlation between police presence and black populations in US cities'; 'Meeting expectations in Fantasy Football' and 'The Global Prisoner Population by Country'. The New York Taxi and Limousine Commission has also created its own graphic about yellow cabs where it explains that 60 per cent of the yellow taxi fleet are now hybrid vehicles - leading to 190,000 fewer tons of CO2 being emitted into the atmosphere each year. Other fascinating facts for 2014 about NYC's yellow cabs include that a typical taxi travels 70,000 miles per year - far enough to make it round the world, 2,8 times. According to date from the City of New York, more than 10,000 yellow cab drivers come from Bangladesh (23 per cent), close to 6,000 from Pakistan (13 per cent) while U.S.-born drivers made up around 6 per cent .

"What do you give a boy born with a silver spoon in his mouth? The answer, it seems, includes a possum fur cloak, a speedboat that doubles as a car, and a rather more traditional rocking horse. Whether Prince George will have time to enjoy any of these things is another matter, however – because they were just three of nearly 800 official gifts he was showered with last year. The impressive haul meant the 18-month-old received more presents than any other member of the Royal Family. Scroll down for video . George also received a mini leather flying helmet from Lord Of The Rings film director Sir Peter Jackson, a baby BMX bike, a customised surfboard, a skateboard and a cuddly toy from President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle. According to Kensington Palace, the future king received more than 250 games and toys on his inaugural royal tour to Australia and New Zealand last April, and more than 120 items of clothing. There were also several dozen pieces of sporting equipment, well over 150 books and enough CDs and DVDs to keep him amused for a lifetime. Is that for me? Prince George grabs at a cuddly bilby toy given to him during a visit to Taronga Zoo . Another one! George was presented with a wombat toy bigger than him by Sir Peter Cosgrove in Australia . Well-stocked: In total, George was given 219 toys by members of the public during the Australia toy . Details of the presents were published yesterday in the official list of gifts given to the Royals in 2014. The exact value of each item is not listed, so as not to offend the giver, and many are also so unique the price is virtually impossible to calculate. The list of almost 2,000 items is not exhaustive, however, because Prince Charles’s private office and that of William, Kate and Harry at Kensington Palace only reveal gifts given on official foreign tours. Haul: Prince Harry was given five football shirts and one polo shirt during his visit to Brazil in June . Unusual: The 30-year-old was given a decommissioned automatic rifle during November's trip to Oman . Charles and Camilla were the recipients of some of the more expensive presents, including two ceremonial swords from King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia. On the couple’s official tour to Colombia in the autumn, the Duchess of Cornwall was gifted a magnificent pair of gold and emerald earrings by the First Lady of Colombia, and a designer snakeskin handbag in Canada. The Queen received an eclectic range of goods, from a boot scraper to a seven-inch miniature throne from the popular TV series Game of Thrones, given to her on a visit to Northern Ireland. While his miniature boat and industrial quantities of toys might be the most eye-catching part of George's haul, they aren't the only ones. Here are the best of the rest: . Global giving: The Royal Family has received items from all over the world, some unusual . Prince William was given an Akubra Cattleman’s hat on the tour Down Under and several pairs of cufflinks. Kate received jewellery including a silver and opal brooch, as well as bags and outfits. Princess Anne and Prince Andrew received some of the more original offerings. She received Princess Molly Minx Face Powder from an anonymous admirer in Thailand, while the Duke of York was given an Arctic Monkeys CD by schoolchildren. A Kensington palace spokesman said: ‘The vast majority of the gifts are logged and archived. Some will be taken into royal residences, some displayed or stored and some, such as flowers or perishable items, are often donated to organisations that could make good use of them.’ Giving and receiving gifts is considered an important part of the Royal Family’s work in developing good relations with other countries . Modest items – including books, clothes and gadgets such as mobile phones and iPads – can be used by the Royals, displayed in a residence, loaned out to an organisation or stored. Food or flowers worth less than £150 can be used, or given to a local charity, hospital or hospice. A high-value item, such as jewellery, is not considered to be personal property. Royals are, however, permitted to use it during their lifetime. A gift fit for a Queen! Her Majesty is presented with a wooden plaque by Sierra Leonese athletes in Glasgow . Presents: Prince Charles was given a considerable number of gifts in Mexico including a packet of dried beef . Lavish: President François Hollande of France gave the Queen a 15-piece set of Sèvres porcelain . Miniature: During a visit to the Game of Thrones set in Belfast, the Queen was given a model Iron Throne . Presents from Kuwait: During his most recent trip to the Gulf state, Prince Andrew was given a model dhow . Unusual: During a visit to Canada in December, Edward and Sophie were given tins of fish .","Prince George amassed 603 presents during his trip to Australia alone .

"A record-breaking 'dream bull' bull who sired an estimated 500,000 offspring in more than 50 countries been laid to rest. When Toystory passed away on Thanksgiving Day, his owners believed the 2,700-pound bull had provided more than 2.4 million units of semen - making him a world beater. A single unit, about 1/20th of a teaspoon, sells for anywhere between a few dollars to several hundred, meaning Toystory most made tens of millions of dollars for his owners, Genex Cooperative Inc. Toystory, pictured above, sired an estimated 500,000 offspring in more than 50 countries before he died on Thanksgiving Day; his owners made tens of millions selling over two million units of his sperm . A Dutch bull named Sunny Boy had previously been thought of as the worlds best sire. The bull, memorialized with a life-size statue at the headquarters of his owner in the Netherlands, sold 1.7 million units in the 1990s. Toystory surpassed the 2 million mark in 2012, according to markings on his 'spermometer', Wsj.com reports. The milestone was celebrated at his home barn with a cake and lashings of hay. Normally bulls siring careers are short lived and they're put out to pasture, as a bull with better generics comes along. Such is the prestige to have a bull that can sell a million units, breeders have coined a name for it - the millionaires club. Jan Hessel Bierma, the editor in chief of dairy breeding magazine Holstein international, said Toystory was a 'dream bull'. Such was Toystory's fame in the artificial segmentation game, the bull's prowess was celebrated with a line of hats, t-shirts and even his own commemorative semen straws. On his Facebook page, the late sire was remembered as a 'legend' and 'Torazo', the Spanish word for super bull. Toystory was a beast of an animal with a neck measuring 57 inches, and a ferocious sexual appetite to match. He typically produced sperm nine times a week - about twice the average of other bulls owned by Genex. One veterinarian reportedly dubbed Toystory 'meaner than a snake', and Glen Gilbert, vice president of production said the bull's interest in sex was the only thing keeping them safe. He told the newspaper: 'The old adage was as long as he was interested in sex, he wasn’t interested in you. But if he lost that other interest, you had to be careful.' Toystory was named after the children's movie, but he was no gentle giant with one veterinarian saying he was 'meaner than a snake' Toystory, named after the children's movie, was born in 2001. His father, Bellwood Marshall was a popular sire and his mother, Toyane, was a top milk producer. Mitch Breunig, who raised the bull at Mystic Valley Dairy in central Wisconsin, said Toystory stood out because he gained weight so fast. He sold the bull at six months old for about $4,000. At around a year old, Genex used Tostory's semen to breed dozens of cows. His breeders than had to wait a few years to see how his offspring turned out before they could start selling his sperm. By the mid-2000s, Toystory's semen sales took off and he scored highly in the dairy industry's influential performance rankings. At that time a unit of his sperm was selling for $60 and by 2009, Genex had sold a million. Toystory's semen became renowned for getting cows pregnant and his daughters were known to be easy to birth and dependably strong. Mr. Bierma compared Toystory with a Volkswagen Golf, saying the bull wasn't 'fancy' but would do 'the job every day and for a long time' and wasn't too expensive. Toystory's daughters had 'exceptional feet and legs and exceptional udders', said Eddie Bue, manager of Ludwig Farms in central Illinois. He paid $300,000 for one of Toystory's daughters in 2009. Over the summer, Toystory began having back problems and was put into retirement. He is now buried atop what is known as Stony Hill, which his handlers chose to reflect Toystory's stature. Genex has said that a memorial service will be held for the bull in spring, when they plan to name a breeding campus after him. Keith Heikes, chief operating officer at Genex, said it was 'very possible' no other bull with ever surpass Toystory's record.","Toystory was sold for just $4,000 but made his owners tens of millions .

"A man on a cocaine binge fatally beat or strangled four others at their homes — in one case, using his own shoestrings — then walked into the police station to confess after recognizing one victim's relatives in a newspaper photo, a prosecutor said on Wednesday after the defendant was sentenced to life in prison without parole. Donald Hoffman apparently was high and looking to steal money for more drugs when he killed the men last fall in the small, north-central Ohio city of Bucyrus, Crawford County Prosecutor Matthew Crall said. Hoffman used whatever means were available, stomping on one man's throat and striking another with a bottle, Crall said. Hoffman, 41, pleaded guilty Wednesday to four counts of aggravated murder in a deal with prosecutors, days before his scheduled trial in the potential death penalty case. In exchange, they dropped remaining charges. Guilty: Donald Hoffman, 41, stands between defense attorneys Robert Whitney, left, and Rolf Whitney as he pleads guilty to aggravated murder in a deal with prosecutors on Wednesday . Hoffman wore an orange prison outfit and kept his hands folded in his lap, showing no emotion beyond his perpetual frown. When the judge asked if he understood he was pleading guilty in four murders, Hoffman replied plainly: 'That's exactly what I'm doing, sir.' Murdered: Freeline Hensley, 67, was one of Hoffman's four victims . Hoffman said he made the plea agreement to spare the community a trial. He offered no explanation for the slayings and declined an opportunity to further address the court. About three dozen relatives of the victims attended the hearing, and a few told the judge they had hoped Hoffman would face execution. One victim's daughter called Hoffman heartless. 'You don't deserve to be living while my dad is in the ground,' Macy Chatman said in court. 'I pray you live a very lonely and painful life.' Hoffman's extended family also thought he deserved to die, said Laura Reed, who identified herself as Hoffman's cousin and his only relative attending the hearing. His adoptive parents are deceased, and his sister didn't attend the hearing, said Reed, who was there partly to see whether Hoffman showed remorse. 'It would've been nice if he would have said, 'I'm sorry,'' Reed said, adding that she never wants to see him again. The plea deal, which restricts potential appeals, could provide some closure for the victims' families, the prosecutor said. Crall said Ohio's moratorium on executions and other concerns related to the status of the death penalty in the state factored into discussions about Hoffman, who wanted to plead from the outset. Friends and relatives said at least some of the slain men knew each other and Hoffman. Two bodies were found September 1, and two more were discovered the next day after Hoffman approached police. Authorities identified them as Billy Jack Chatman, 55; Freelin Hensley, 67; Darrell Lewis, 65; and Jerald Smith, 65, whose relatives said he sometimes spelled his first name Gerald.

(AP Photo/Kantele Franko) Most of those in court Wednesday seemed eager to be rid of Hoffman, including the judge. 'I hope the words you've heard from the people you've hurt ring in your ears for the rest of your life,' Judge Russell Wiseman said. He said describing the crimes as heinous or despicable isn't sufficient, and that Hoffman's one slightly redeeming act was taking responsibility for the slayings. 'Mr. Hoffman,' the judge said, 'this community bids you goodbye.'","The 41-year-old beat and strangled four men in a small dilapidated Ohio home - in one case using shoestrings to kill .

'We must not lower our guard, at any time,' Prime Minister Manuel Valls told Parliament, adding that 'serious and very high risks remain.' MPs lined up overwhelmingly behind the government, giving repeated standing ovations to Valls' rousing, indignant address. Lawmakers  then voted 488-1 to extend French airstrikes against Islamic State extremists in Iraq. 'France is at war against terrorism, jihadism, and radical Islamism,' Valls declared.

"President Barack Obama is challenging major cable and telephone companies to expand broadband access  by encouraging the Federal Communications Commission to pre-empt state laws that stifle competition for high-speed Internet service. Obama wants to expand access to broadband communications services, siding with local communities that want either to expand competition or provide municipal services themselves. To promote it, he used a Cedar Fall, Iowa, speech today to announce that his administration will provide technical and financial assistance to towns and cities that want to improve Internet service for their residents. 'Today high speed broadband is not a luxury. It's a necessity. This isn't just about making it easier to stream Netflix or scroll through your Facebook news feed,' he said. 'This is about helping local businesses grow and prosper and compete in a global economy. 'It's about giving the entrepreneur, the small business person on main street, chance to compete with the folks out in silicon valley or across the globe.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . President Barack Obama is pictured here departing the White House today for Cedar Falls, Iowa, where he will give a speech this afternoon urging the Federal Communications Commission, an independent regulatory agency, to override state laws that bar competition among broadband providers . The proposals do not require congressional approval and are part of a series of new measures Obama is rolling out before his State of the Union address next week. Obama detailed broadband plans this afternoon in Cedar Falls, a community that has taken steps to provide high-speed Internet to its roughly 40,000 residents. Roughly 20 years ago Cedar Falls created a community broadband network. In 2010 it began a two-year process to upgrade to a full fiber network. 'Basically, you guys were like the captain in Jaws...'We're gonna need a bigger boat,' he said, using a variation of the film's famous quote. The administration's stance will put it at odds with major cable and telephone companies such as AT&T, Comcast and Time Warner Cable Inc., that currently provide Internet service, often with little or no competition. Obama has already angered the industry by calling for new FCC rules that treat Internet service providers as public utilities. In a White House video before the announcement, Obama says: 'You know what it feels like when you don't have a good Internet connection. Everything is buffering, you try to download a video and you've got that little circle thing that goes round and round, it's really aggravating.' But there are also 'real world consequences to this and it makes us less economically competitive,' Obama says, explaining that businesses are more likely to set up shop in towns where broadband Internet is easy to access. Jeff Zients, director of Obama's National Economic Council, said Obama wants to use the bully pulpit of the presidency to press the FCC, an independent regulatory agency, to 'ensure that all states have a playing field that allows for a vibrant and competitive market for communication services.' Nineteen states place restrictions on municipal broadband networks, many with laws encouraged by cable and telephone companies. Obama referred to the laws today as 'old' and put consumers at the 'whim' of their providers. Obama estimated that 45 million Americans are unable to purchase next generation broadband Internet that creates connections that he said are six or seven times faster that 'today's basic speeds.' Advocates of those laws say they are designed to protect taxpayers from municipal projects that are expensive, can fail or may be unnecessary. The National Governors Association and the National Conference of State Legislatures have urged the FCC not to pre-empt state laws on broadband. And Republican Sen. Deb Fischer of Nebraska said the proposal amounts to the federal government attempting 'to wield greater power and control.' 'This afternoon, we will see the president parachute into Iowa and tout a new federal takeover of state laws governing broadband and the Internet,' Fischer said. 'These Washington-centric solutions set a dangerous precedent and have real impacts on local communities and businesses.' This graph, distributed by the White House, shows the internet speeds of populous U.S. cities compared to their global counterparts and U.S. communities that have invested in broadband infrastructure . The FCC is already considering requests for Chattanooga, Tennessee, and Wilson, North Carolina, to prevent state laws from blocking the expansion of their broadband projects. FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler said in June that local communities that want to provide their own broadband service 'shouldn't be stopped by state laws promoted by cable and telephone companies that don't want that competition.' A new White House report says that while 94 percent of Americans living in urban areas can purchase an Internet connection of 25 megabits per second. 'But that number doesn't look quite as good when you look at the speeds we're gonna need for all the apps and all the videos and data, new software that is constantly coming on the market,' Obama said today. 'We gotta keep pace. We gotta be up to speed.' The White House says only 51 percent of Americans in rural areas have access to what Obama described as 'super fast' Internet speeds. According to its report, three out of four Americans lack a choice for such Internet service because of lack of competition. But many rural Americans also lack access to high-speed Internet because of the costs associated with constructing the infrastructure necessary to transmit broadband. The White House has announced that the Commerce Department would promote faster broadband connections by hosting regional workshops and offering technical assistance to communities interested in creating their own network. The Department of Agriculture will provide grants and loans of $40 million to $50 million to assist them. A council comprising more than a dozen government agencies will also seek to remove regulatory and policy barriers that hinder broadband competition, the White House said.","The president is encouraging the Federal Communications Commission to override state laws that stifle competition for high-speed Internet service .

"At first glance it might look like a large, hairy caterpillar, but this mass of orange fluff is in fact the chick of a small bird that lives in the Amazon. Biologists have found that the young of dull grey bird called the Cinereous Mourner have evolved an unusual tactic to avoid being eaten by predators. Rather than relying upon their parents, which measure around seven inches (20cm) in length, to protect them, the chicks mimic poisonous caterpillars. Scroll down for video of the chick moving like a caterpillar . A one day old Cinereous Mourner chick, left, has bright orange, spiky feathers that make it resemble the hairy caterpillars produced by Flannel Moths, (right) which use their colours to warn predators that they are toxic . On hatching, the chicks are covered with a distinctive mass of bright orange and strangely shaped, spiky feathers. This gives the chicks the appearance of a large and hairy caterpillar that use bright colours to warn predators that they are toxic. There are few birds that are known to use real toxins to protect themselves from predators. While some palaentologists have speculated that avian dinosaurs that evolved into birds may have had venomous bites, there are no birds that actively inject their prey with venom. There are some, however, like the hooded pitohui in New Guinea that carry toxins in their features. Ornithologists discovered that their feathers contain a neurotoxin, that is thought to be obtained by eating toxic beetles and spreading saliva over their feathers. The birds have bright orange and black colourings to warn off potential predators. The African spur-winged goose is also toxic to eat as it gathers posoin in its tissues from the blister beetles that it feeds one. To add to the effect, however, the researchers found that the chicks begin to move in strange ways after a few days, writhing their heads much like a caterpillar. Dr Gustavo Londoño, a biologist at the University of California who led the study, said: . 'These traits gave it a resemblance to a hairy, aposematic caterpillar. 'Because predation is the main cause of avian nest failure, selection should favor strategies that reduce the probablity of nest predation.' Dr Londoño and his colleagues, whose results are published in the journal The American Naturalist, suggest that the Cinereous Mourner, also called Laniocera hypopyrra, have evolved this strategy for keeping their young safe due to the relatively long period they spend raising them. The chicks spend around 20 days in the nest before they are mature enough to leave - considered to be a long time for a bird of their size. This may be because the adults only feed the chicks once every hour, meaning the chicks move relatively slow. Using pictures and video footage of the chicks in the nest, Dr Londoño and his colleagues were able to watch their behaviour while in the nest. They found that the chicks moved their heads from side to side when the nest was disturbed. After 14 days the chicks were around 5.5 inches (14cm) long. The chicks resembled the caterpillars of a flannel moth, which are often toxic, and measure up to 4.7 inches (12cm). They also found that the Cinereous Mourner chicks did not beg for food when the parent arrived at the nest like chicks of other species. Adult Cinereous Mourner birds, like the one above, grow to around seven inches and have a drab grey colour . A Cinereous Mourner chicks, above, move their heads from side to side when disturbed like a caterpillar . The feathers of the Cinereous Mourner chicks have unusual barbs that help them look like caterpillars . The researchers said that this could be because the chick does not know that the arriving bird is their parent or a predator. They claim this may help to put off potential predators such as other birds and snakes. First described by the French naturalist Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot in 1817, the Cinereous Mourner is suffering declines and is believed to be vulnerable. An estimated 10,000 mature adults live in the lowland rain forests of Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Peru, Suriname, and Venezuela. Dr Londoño said: 'The caterpillar we encountered measured 12 cm, which closely matches the size of the L. hypopyrra nestling. 'The striking morphological similarity is the caterpillar’s orange 'hairs' with white tips, which match almost exactly the nestling’s elongated orange downy feather barbs with bright white tips. 'The morphological appearance of an aposematic caterpillar was reinforced by behaviour - the caterpillar-like head movements of nestlings when disturbed closely resembles the movements of the aposematic caterpillar.' When the chicks reach around 18 months, like the one above, they begin to lose their 'caterpillar' plumage .","Chicks of the Cinereous Mourner bird have bright orange spiky feathers .

"New York, eat your heart out. It may come as a surprise to some locals, but a new Deutsche Bank study has found that housing in Wollongong is more expensive than in the Big Apple. The sprawling New South Wales beachside town with a population around 300,000 has joined the ranks of Sydney, Melbourne and London in having pricier homes than America's biggest city. The study of global house prices, spearheaded by Deutsche Bank chief economist Peter Hooper, found homes in those cities were more expensive than those Toronto, Washington D.C and Miami. Scroll down for video . The pool inside 227 Cordeaux Rd in Mount Kembla, Wollongong, a property which is selling for $3.9million . A new Deutsche Bank study has found that housing in Wollongong is more expensive than in the Big Apple . And in a fact Business Spectator said 'should really terrify (home)owners and policymakers alike', the survey reported that Australian homes are overvalued by a whopping 49 per cent. The stark report comes amid mixed forecasts about the immediate future of the property market - and no doubt, eyes popping at Wollongong's place in the survey. While many associate Wollongong with affordable family homes and small brick units by the beach, the town does have its fair share of luxury properties, according to agents.

What do you get for that much money? Six bedrooms, a six car garage, horse stables, a resort style pool, a studio and 'absolute privacy' just a short hop from the beach, said MMJ sales director David Geary. 'You name it, (the owner's) got it,' Mr Geary told Daily Mail Australia, who then reflected on the appeal of the southern city, home to a university and a hospital. 'You've got a beautiful waterline district escarpment on one side, and beautiful ocean beaches on the other,' Mr Geary said. 'Nothing's more than 10 minutes away from the beach. It's a real seaside place where people would love to retire as well.' 'It's a good quality life, just an hour from the airport up there in Sydney,' he said.

"One of the two former Vanderbilt football players on trial for raping an unconscious student in a dorm room has been accused of urinating on the woman while she was passed out. But while the claims against Cory Batey were mentioned in opening statements on Tuesday, on Wednesday one of his lawyers argued that jurors should not have heard the allegation. 'Your honor, the prejudicial value of that is enormous, absolutely enormous,' Worrick Robinson said as he battled to keep the claim out of court. The judge said they would revisit the issue. Batey is on trial for rape with fellow former football player Brandon Vandenburg, who is accused of encouraging three players to assault the woman, who had been his date that night, in June 2013. On trial: Former Vanderbilt football player Cory Batey, right, has been accused of urinating on a woman after raping her with fellow former football player Brandon Vandenburg (left) in a dorm room in June 2013 . Both Batey and Vandenburg - as well as the two other men - have pleaded not guilty. The two others, Jaborian 'Tip' McKenzie and Brandon Banks, are expected to testify against Batey and Vandenburg. Batey's lawyers said that the claim he urinated on the woman - as well as another claim that he made a racial statement - came from one of the two men set to testify against their friends. Defense attorneys have said McKenzie and Banks have repeatedly changed their stories and are only testifying to help themselves. Judge Monte Watkins ruled that jurors would not hear about the alleged racial statement because there are no racial undertones to the case. Batey and two of the former ex-players are black. Vandenburg is white. It is not clear what the statement was. The judge, however, said they would revisit the allegations about the urination later. Graphic details: Deputy District Attorney General Tom Thurman told jurors that the former players giggled, shot video, and one of them violated the victim with a water bottle . Prosecutors have argued that rape is an act of power, control and humiliation and jurors should hear the allegations that Batey urinated on the woman. Deputy District Attorney General Tom Thurman said it was the final act in the attack in the dorm room after the rape. But Robinson, the defense attorney, said there was no evidence of urine in the room. Watkins ruled that the allegation of the urination could only be introduced if there was corroborating evidence. According to published accounts, on June 23, 2013, Vandenburg, a star player who had recently transferred to Vanderbilt from College of the Desert in California, took the 21-year-old student to a bar called Tin Roof, and on the ride back the player's date reportedly passed out in the car. Lieutenant Donnie Harville of the Vanderbilt Police Department testified during the rape trial of the former Vanderbilt football players on Wednesday . Several Vanderbilt students stated that the woman was then carried to Vandenburg's room on the second floor of Gillette House, where she was allegedly raped by a group of young men. Deputy District Attorney General Tom Thurman told Tennessee jurors that Vandenburg and Batey giggled, shot video and sent text messages while they sexually abused her. He described in sometimes graphic detail how one former player violated the female student with a water bottle while a teammate egged him on. The prosecutor said one of the players passed out condoms and raped her. During the opening statements, the alleged victim, an Oklahoma native, sat in the audience wiping her eyes with a tissue. She is expected to take the stand as a witness for the prosecution. Star witnesses: Brandon Banks (left) and Jaborian 'Tip' McKenzie (right) also have been charged in the rape case but are expected to testify against Vandenburg and Batey . 'Unreliable': Defense attorneys for Vandenburg (left) and Batey (right) warned jurors that Banks and McKenzie have changed their stories repeatedly . Crime scene: Police say Vandenburg brought his unconscious date to his second-floor room in the Gillette House dormitory, where he proceeded to rape her . Testimony so far has come from friends of the woman who saw her earlier that evening and from Vanderbilt police showing surveillance video from inside the dorm. Vandenburg and Batey are being tried on five counts of aggravated rape and two counts of aggravated sexual battery. Vandenburg is also charged with one count of tampering with evidence and one count of unlawful photography. The defense will blame alcohol and a culture of binge drinking and sexual promiscuity on campus. Robinson also told jurors that there is no evidence of Batey's DNA in the dorm room and no evidence of his fingerprints on a condom box. One of Vandenburg's attorneys said evidence would show that his client was not responsible for what someone else did to the woman, who allegedly was his date that night. The case comes in the midst of a roiling debate about the prevalence of rape on campuses of the nation's colleges and universities.

"A brand new camera drone designed to capture amazing 4K footage from the sky suffered a major malfunction for one owner. Mark Taylor was out using his DJI Inspire 1, which retails for $2,900, and wanted to test out the auto-takeoff, thinking he would use the device for some real estate images eventually. Unfortunately, the drone thought that straight ahead towards the garage was the best way to travel up, and was smashed to pieces. The drone waits on the ground before it is set to takeoff . The drone, on auto takeoff, is supposed to go up and elevate until it reaches a cruising altitude . Instead the drone flew straight into the garage and was smashed . Mark Taylor (above) the owner of the drone was not controlling it at all at the time . 'Last couple of flights not stable on auto take off - shimming and drifting. wanted to record if it drifted to send to dji to get settings changed or trouble shoot the issues as it crashed earlier in the am - but was fine 2 times after just a lot of shimming and bobbing in the desert in the open or in the subdivision of the house i was trying to film,' wrote Taylor on YouTube. 'We went out and checked everything recalibrated the compass again even though we hadn't moved - and this happened with no operator input just in auto take off mode.' No word if the cost of the drone gets refunded in this case, or of the device can be repaired. And it most certainly was not Taylor's fault says Taylor. 'This was not operator error,' he told Peta Pixel. 'To all the people who say I can’t fly, wrong: I have dozens and dozens of flights.

"David Cameron is to urge Barack Obama to force US-based web giants to do more to tackle terrorism. The Prime Minister will use talks in the White House to press for tougher action to require the companies to alert authorities to suspicious online exchanges, ban encrypted communications and store data. He accuses them of failing to assist in the fight against terror, and insists they have a ‘moral duty’ to act. David Cameron is to urge Barack Obama to force US-based web giants to do more to tackle terrorism . Cyber-terrorism and surveillance will be central issues at the visit, which Tory strategists hope will be a pre-election ‘love-in’ between Mr Cameron and Mr Obama and boost the Prime Minister’s standing at home. Unusually, the President has agreed to host Mr Cameron close to an election, apparently repaying the favour Mr Cameron made by visiting the US and all but endorsing him during the last presidential race. In the wake of the terrorist attacks in France, the leaders will focus on economic and national security — which they will argue are linked. British officials said Mr Cameron, due to begin his two-day visit to Washington today, would seek support for a crackdown on terrorists using social networks and other websites to communicate and foment hatred. A report last year into the murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby concluded that Facebook failed to pass on information that could have prevented his death, and that the website is a ‘safe haven for terrorists’. One of his killers, Michael Adebowale, used it to express his intent to murder a soldier ‘in the most graphic and emotive manner’ five months before the attack, Parliament’s intelligence and security committee found. Facebook had previously shut down his accounts because he’d discussed terrorism – but failed to relay concerns to the security services. Michael Adebowale (left) wrote about murdering a soldier online before he killed Lee Rigby (right) A senior Lib Dem peer and terror expert yesterday dismissed claims that a so-called ‘snoopers’ charter’ would be used to spy on ordinary members of the public. Lord Carlile said MI5 agents simply ‘do not have time’ to carry out random investigations. His intervention was seen as a snub to party leader Nick Clegg, who has repeatedly opposed the Communications Data Bill, which gives security officials the power to access the public’s emails and internet history. Lord Carlile said the term snoopers’ charter was ‘grossly misleading’, adding: ‘MI5 do not have the time to intervene in the communications of ordinary citizens unless there is a reason or possibly happens by mistake as occasionally occurs.’ Home Secretary Theresa May yesterday implied that Mr Clegg’s position was putting the lives of ‘innocent’ people in peril. She said it was ‘highly probable’ that communications data was used in Paris to locate the Charlie Hebdo terrorists. British security sources say they often have ‘considerable difficulty’ in accessing online communications on sites belonging to US-based internet companies, such as Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Twitter and Yahoo. Some of these say they can’t cooperate because they ‘need to protect users’ privacy’. Mr Cameron also wants a ban on encrypted communications services, such as Snapchat and WhatsApp, whose messages cannot be accessed by intelligence and security agencies even if they have a valid warrant. A senior Government source said: ‘If you are talking about concerns around extremism and terrorism, one of the things clearly to talk about is how do we cooperate on this, how do we keep pace with developments in technology and capabilities and what our agencies need. ‘The Prime Minister’s objective here is to get the US companies to cooperate with us more, to make sure that our intelligence agencies get the information they need to keep us safe.’ Companies such as YouTube and Facebook insist they take terrorism seriously and share the British Government’s aims to prevent it. But they say it is not as clear-cut as preventing child abuse – where images are illegal and are immediately reported to the authorities and ‘fingerprinted’ so they do not recur. Online videos involving terrorism, violence or incitement are already taken down when they are reported by users, and the perpetrators’ accounts are blocked. But material has to be considered on a case-by-case basis. There are 300 hours of video uploaded on to YouTube every minute, 12billion exchanges on Facebook every day and 500million tweets. The firms insist the technology does not exist to automatically flag up alarming or provocative content, and so they rely on users reporting material. Britain and the US can only defend their freedoms if they boost their economic strength, David Cameron and Barack Obama say today. The two leaders, speaking as Mr Cameron arrived in Washington for talks with the US President, said they agreed on a series of measures that would bolster both economies against another global downturn. Officials say Mr Cameron and Mr Obama will link economic security and national security – arguing the West can only protect its citizens and its values if it retains its economic dominance. The world leaders said they will support small businesses, expand apprenticeships, improve education for all, and back increases in the minimum wage . In a joint statement today they said: ‘We’re working to help families stake their claim to a better future and buy their first home. 'We’re supporting small businesses, expanding apprenticeships, improving education for all, and backing increases in the minimum wage.' The Prime Minister will today join International Monetary Fund boss Christine Lagarde for talks on the global economic outlook for the year – with warnings lights again flashing in the Eurozone. The Prime Minister and President Obama added: ‘Over the last few years, our governments have worked closely to restore economic growth, improve our living standards and make sure families get the help they needed. ‘Yet we know that progress and prosperity are never guaranteed. As we meet today at the White House, we reaffirm our belief that our ability to defend our freedoms is rooted in our economic strength, and the values that we cherish – freedom of expression, the rule of law, and strong democratic institutions. ‘We must do all we can to bolster our economies against another global economic downturn.’ The leaders will meet today and tomorrow for talks on national security, particularly tackling the threat of violent extremism including the response to the terror attacks in Paris last week. In a joint article in The Times, they added: 'Security and prosperity go hand in hand. By confronting the terrorists who threaten us, standing together against Russia’s aggressive acts and continuing our efforts to advance our economic growth, we will continue to advance the security and prosperity that our people deserve.' Underlining the importance of the economic relationship between both countries, US and UK companies are also set to announce trade and investment deals worth more than £1.1 billion, creating 1,700 new jobs in the UK. Deals to be announced today include a £660m investment by Carlyle International Energy Partners in the UK’s oil and gas industry in the North Sea. Food manufacturer, Mars, will announce a multi-million pound expansion of its facility in Kings Lynn, a UK development company and US firm Grand Heritage Hotel Group will unveil plans for a new £400m all-weather leisure, health, sport and education destination on the edge of the Peak District National Park. And there will be £1.3m in U.S. government funding for Watford-based Smiths Detection, for research and development of its wearable chemical detection technology, already used by over 100,000 troops in the UK, U.S., and around the world.","Mr Cameron's two-day visit to Washington is due to begin today .

A bubble designed to provide a calming refuge for stressed office workers is set for launch.  The Orrb is a pod in which the user can escape bustling open-plan workspaces and find time for themselves. It is described as a 'corporate wellness facility' or like using a 'mind gym' The pod was designed by London-based designer Lee McCormark. Described as a 'corporate wellness facility' or like using a 'mind gym', individuals access an online account when they first enter. Here they can choose from a selection of wellness routines under the banners of relax, learn, test and boost, in either 10, 20 or 30 minute allocated time slots. People who work longer than 48 hours a week a more likely to develop a dangerous relationship with alcohol, experts from the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health have warned. More than 14 alcoholic drinks a week for women and more than 21 drinks for men is considered 'risky', raising a person's risk of liver disease, cancer, stroke, coronary heart disease and mental health problems. The European Working Time Directive gives people the right to work no more than 48 hours each week, including overtime. However, vast swathes of the workforce across the continent put in much longer hours to achieve faster promotion, salary increases or simply get their job done. Past studies have found a link between working longer hours and 'risky' alcohol consumption. Aside from being confined to an office, developers also see Orrbs possibly being placed in airports, universities and public spaces. Devices are currently being hand-finished in the US and UK, the two initial territories targeted by the company, and Orrb is set to launch officially in Spring with the subscription service Orrb X. Orrb will be launching in San Francisco and London, and they are aiming for 250 initial orders. 'We've been hearing back from the wellness training industries and it's all positive,' said Mr McCormack. 'The timing is right for something like this, it's taken the wellness industry a while to build up the traction with corporate work culture, companies now get it and are receptive to what they are saying. 'We've now come along to say ""we can go that extra distance, we all know how hard it can be to fully engage with content like this in the workplace, we can offer a user experience that will be exactly the same quality right across the network.""' London-based designer Lee McCormack also sees Orrbs being placed in airports, universities and public spaces (illustration shown).

Inside individuals access an online account on a touch screen (shown), from where they can choose from a selection of wellness routines under the banners of relax, learn, test and boost, in either 10, 20 or 30 minute allocated time slots to take a break from work . The pods will come in a variety of colours including white and black, and include a comfortable seat inside to let the occupant adequately relax. 'We've been hearing back from the wellness training industries and it's all positive,' said Mr McCormack . Orrb investor Khajak Keledjian, Chief Executive of Intermix, said: 'Taking a moment out, for 10 or 20 minutes a day, is vital in business. 'You need a moment to close up, to see and feel for yourself, and in order to do that you need somewhere to go; you need the tools to be able to do that.' Mr Keledjian cited the stresses of running a successful business as the key factor in seeking out meditation and then further investigating how wellness could be incorporated into our environment. 'The idea is to really have it available so that it can reach out to a wider population and the beauty of this device is that it can be used for many purposes,' he explained. 'You can meditate, you can relax, if you choose to, people can buy it and different people have used it for different purposes, I see it in airports, universities, public spaces [in the future].' Perhaps in the the future these small enclosed spaces will be seen in airports, train stations and more, as seen in this illustration. Orrb investor Khajak Keledjian, Chief Executive of Intermix, said: 'Taking a moment out, for 10 or 20 minutes a day, is vital in business .

He said: 'All the way along we've made sure that it's for everybody, not just for a particular personality type. 'A happy heart quietens down the busy brain, putting in place a programme that is part of an environment is a wonderful combination, it's going to reach globally.

"Roughly 60 emaciated dogs in in Alabama thought to be made to fight with hogs as part of a sick gambling game were rescued on Monday from a residence. The Cottonwood Police Department got a search warrant for the property where they found the severely abused dogs requiring immediate rescue and where they also discovered illegal drugs and firearms. The Humane Society told AL.com that the digs range in age from four months old to teenagers . Saved: Approximately 60 dogs were rescued from a suspected hog dog breeding operation in Cottonwood, Alabama on Monday . Emaciated: The dogs range in age from 4 months to teens, and this one was a French bull dog . Horrible conditions: Dogo argentino puppies wait to be rescued from the Cottonwood residence . 'The cruelty these dogs were shown is painful to see, and we couldn't stand by and allow them to suffer,' said Col. Jim Smith, public safety director for the town of Cottonwood said. Of the dogs most of them were of the breed Dogo Argentino - Argentine board-fighting dogs - but two of them were French bull dogs and one was a German Shepard. The Humane Society believes that the dogs were trained to bite the faces of hogs as spectators placed their bets to see which dog could complete the vicious task first. Animal cruelty and felony drug related charges are pending. Veterinarians were on scene to evaluate the dogs and provide any immediate medical attention needed. The rescued dogs will be held at a temporary shelter where they will receive veterinary care and enrichment.

"Soldiers from the 101st Airborne Division deployed to Ebola hotspots in West Africa to  battle the deadly disease will not receive full protective Hazmat suits for their mission. Instead, the troops will be given only masks and gloves  to protect them from the potentially fatal virus, General David Rodriguez said at a Pentagon briefing. The Kentucky-based Army division is being sent to Liberia to help coordinate the response to the epidemic, and will  primarily be building hospitals and treatment and training centers. A U.S. Marine checks the temperature of Major General Darryl Williams, commander of U.S. Army Africa.  Soldiers from 101st Airborne Division will have their health will be monitored through  taking their temperatures . Major General Darryl Williams, the commander of US troops in Africa, claimed that the soldiers would not need full protective Hazmat suits as they would not be coming into direct contact with anyone infected with Ebola, Nashville Public Radio reports. He said: 'They don't need the whole suit - as such - because they're not going to be in contact with any of the people.' General Rodriguez said that soldiers’ health will be monitored through surveys and taking their temperatures on their way in and out of camps. If a serviceman does get sick, they will be flown home immediately for treatment. The troops will be housed either in tent cities at military airfields or in Liberian Ministry of Defense facilities. Major General Darryl Williams (center) said the soldiers would not need full protective Hazmat suits as they would not be coming into direct contact with anyone infected with Ebola . Last week, the 101st Airborne were seen learning how to put on Hazmat suits as part of their intense safety training at Fort Campbell - but it appears that this will not be a part of the training that will be put to use . Next week, the 101st Airborne will hold a traditional pre-deployment ceremony - known as a 'color casing' - before departing for Liberia. As the Ebola threat evolves, the Pentagon has acknowledged the size and duration of the mission in West Africa could too. Deployments might even top the current projection of nearly 4,000, an increase from an earlier estimate of around 3,000. The military has already stood up a headquarters in Liberia's capital, Monrovia, and hopes to have a 25-bed field hospital up and running by the middle of this month. It also aims to quickly build up to 17 Ebola treatment units. Protective gear for US Army soldiers from the 101st Airborne Division. It has emerged that the troops will be given only masks and gloves to protect them from the potentially fatal virus .

Last week, the 101st Airborne were seen learning how to put on Hazmat suits as part of their intense safety training at Fort Campbell ahead of their deployment to Liberia. But it appears that this part of the training will not be put to use in the coming weeks, if soldiers are not provided with the full-suit protective clothing. At the weekend, it emerged that US soldiers are being flown to West Africa following just four hours of training in how to protect themselves against the deadly virus. This includes how to put on, remove and decontaminate protective equipment, as well as a practical test that aims to ensure soldiers understand the procedures.

During the four-hour hazmat training, a team of two can train as many as 50 soldiers, the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases told The Daily Beast. According to USA Today, the four-hour training process can be daunting for soldiers, with some being told that Ebola 'basically causes your body to eat itself from the inside out'. Others have reportedly been warned that the disease is 'worse' that what they might have encountered in Afghanistan, while several have been told the virus is 'catastrophic... with a high fatality rate'. 'I’ll be honest with you,' one soldier told the newspaper. 'I’m kind of scared.' A US Army soldier from the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault), who are earmarked for the fight against Ebola, learns how to put on a protective mask before their deployment to West Africa . Despite the trainers' apparent shock tactics, the Army maintains that the risk of soldiers contracting the virus is minimal because it is not airborne and they will not have contact with sick patients. 'It's been shown that this disease is most manifest when handling bodily fluid - blood, other sorts of fluids, said Major General Williams. 'There is no plan right now for U.S. soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines to do that'. The servicemen are also not permitted to shake hands, must frequently wash their hands with a chlorine solution and are required to have their temperatures measured several times a day. However, some are working with Liberian Army members on a daily basis, and their current living quarters - particularly those  in hotels - means they are surrounded by foreign nationals. Major General Darryl Williams, commander of US Army Africa, and US Ambassador to Liberia Deborah Malac visit the site of an Ebola treatment center under construction  in Tubmanburg, Liberia . Military spokesmen said they were relying on CDC guidelines to protect soldiers against Ebola. But these guidelines have been called into question after victim Thomas Eric Duncan was misdiagnosed and his nurse was allowed to board a plane just a day before she was hospitalized with the virus. President Barack Obama has committed more than $1 billion toward a global fund to battle Ebola in West Africa. Since the Ebola outbreak, most cases of the virus have been recorded in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone. Symptoms of the virus include a high fever, vomiting, a headache and joint aches. These appear two to 21 days after exposure to the disease, the CDC said.

"This is the gruesome moment a maggot wriggled out through the skin of an insect researcher – after he had kept it there on purpose. Piotr Naskrecki of Boston in the US, was bitten by mosquitoes during a visit to Belize last summer – but found his bites were not healing when he returned. The Harvard University entomologist later realised that the bites contained bot fly larvae and decided to let them develop as part of an experiment. Piotr Naskrecki realised bites he received while travelling in Belize contained the larvae of bot fly (pictured) The Harvard University entomologist later realised that the bites contained bot fly larvae and decided to let them develop as part of an experiment . Female bot flies capture mosquitoes and lay their eggs before letting them go as a way of getting larvae in to a living host. Once the eggs are under the skin, they start to grow and the newly formed maggot uses its barbs to grip on. Mr Naskrecki had one of the larvae removed with a special suction device but launched an experiment to allow the two remaining maggots to grow. He then decided to make a video called the Human Bot Fly showing the maggots emerging through his skin. It took two months for the creatures to grow to a size where they were capable of crawling out - but only takes 40 minutes for them to wriggle free. The gruesome-looking hole left by the maggot closes up and heals within about two days . 'I figured that being a male it was my only chance to produce another living, breathing being out of my flesh and blood,' he says on his video. 'The process was not particularly painful. In fact, I probably would have not noticed it if I had not been waiting for it as the bot fly larvae produce painkillers that make their presence as unnoticeable to the host as possible.' 'Perhaps my opinion would have been different had the bot flies decided to develop in my eyelids, but I actually grew to like my little guests, and watched their growth with the same mix of pleasure and apprehension as when I watch the development of any other interesting organism under my care. He goes on to explain that the hole left by the maggot closed up and healed within about two days. Mr Naskrecki then kept the maggot in a container and watched as six weeks later an adult fly emerged from its casing. Bot fly use mosquitoes as a means of getting larvae to a living host . While intrepid travellers might accept getting the odd mosquito bite on holiday, most of them expect the red sores that emerge will quickly disappear. But when they start to develop into something resembling a boil, there is a slim chance bot fly larvae may have crawled under the skin. The bot fly, found in a number of locations around the world including in Africa and South America, often use mosquitoes as a means of getting larvae to a living host. The female will capture the mosquito before laying its eggs and letting it go. Once the mosquito has bitten the host, the larvae enters the skin - either through the bite wound or through hair follicles - before burrowing into the skin. After between five and 12 weeks it will be ready to leave its host by crawling out. Pupation takes place in the ground and adults will generally emerge after two or three weeks.","Piotr Naskrecki was bitten during photography visit to Belize last Summer .

"At 41 stone and wearing size 66 jeans, Alana Faulk, had one choice - lose weight or die. Languishing on her driveway unable to get herself up, the 54-year-old reached her lowest point. A decade previously she had suffered the indignity of having to be rescued by firefighters from the bathroom floor at her doctor's surgery, having just been weighed on industrial scales. Determined not to face a similar fate again, it was there the 54-year-old decided she had to lose weight. Ms Faulk had previously had a gastric bypass. But after cheating the operation, which restricts the size of a person's stomach, she managed to pile the pounds back on. 'I was at my lowest point,' she said. 'I knew I had to change myself. Or die.' Alana Faulk, now 54, had to be rescued by firefighters from the bathroom floor at her doctor's surgery after falling moments after an appointment where she discovered her weight had ballooned to 41 stone . Having battled her weight for a decade, the nightclub owner from Detroit, made the decision to lose weight once and for all after falling again, 10 years later on her driveway. She took an hour to crawl to her front door. After revolutionising her diet, Ms Faulk has shed almost 20 stone . The nightclub owner from Detroit, Michigan, said she had always been overweight. 'The lifestyle was a lot of drink and greasy food,' she added. 'When the club shut I always stopped at McDonalds for a quarter pounder with extra cheese. 'But gradually I began to wonder what sort of toll it was taking on my body. 'I loved to dance the night away but it wasn't as easy as it once had been.' Ms Faulk went to see her doctor in the early 2000s, and for the first time stepped on the scales. She said: 'They had to get the freight scale they used for weighing packages, I couldn't believe it. I was 41 stone. 'I was amazed but it wasn't that much of a shock. 'My size 66 jeans wouldn't do up anymore. When I couldn't do up my size 66 jeans, I just bought a bigger size and another. I had to order all my clothes online. 'While everyone knew me as fun-loving, party girl Alana, but I was sick of being heavy. Ms Faulk asked her doctor if she could be referred for a gastric bypass operation, but was refused because it was deemed too dangerous at the time during the early 2000s, when the surgery was not routinely offered. But fate intervened. 'On my way out the surgery, I went to the loo,' she said. 'When I locked the door, I slipped and fell.' She was unable to get up, or get out of the way so anyone else could get in. 'I desperately tried to pull myself back onto my feet,' she recalled. 'But each time my huge arms failed my mammoth weight. My chunky legs buckled beneath my huge frame. 'After half an hour, the surgery called the fire brigade. Five firefighters managed to break in and get me out. 'I felt so ashamed.' Ms Faulk managed to cheat a gastric band operation, gradually learning to eat more and ballooning in size again within five years. By 2010, having had the surgery in the early 2000s, she weighed 35 stone once again . As a result her doctor agreed to refer Ms Faulk for surgery. The operation took place a few months later, and was a success. In just a year, Ms Faulk lost more than 20 stone. 'Friends barely recognised me and I felt fabulous,' she said. 'At first I couldn't even consider eating a cheeseburger but then, after about five years, I discovered I could eat more and drink more.' It was 2005 and the beginning of a slippery slope. Ms Faulk reverted to her previous unhealthy diet, and began to pile the weight back on. By 2010 she weighed 35 stone again. She said: 'I've stared every discrimination in the eye and vanquished it. I've completely turned my life around' 'I felt miserable,' she added. 'But I didn't do anything about it.' 'Big portions no longer made my stomach ache,' she admitted. 'So I started downing loads of sickly sweet spirits and mixers and greasy burgers. 'But as I put on weight I lost my hope and passion.' But it wasn't until the following year that another fall was to prove the turning point. While walking up her driveway, Ms Faulk slipped and fell. 'I was so hefty, I couldn't move,' she said. 'I felt like a beached whale and because I was so ashamed I didn't call for anyone to help me. 'Instead I crawled to the front door myself.' What should have taken a few moments, took Ms Faulk an hour. 'I was so exhausted I slept on the hall floor for an hour,' she said. 'But I knew this was my lowest point. 'I was petrified about my health. I was scared I'd die if I carried on eating and drinking as I had. 'If I wanted to change, then I had to do it myself.' Ms Faulk gave her diet a massive overhaul, ditching the junk food and alcohol in favour of salads and diet drinks. 'It hasn't been easy,' she said. 'But I am moving in the right direction. I'm now 20 stone and I have so much more energy. I'm half the woman I used to be but I've never felt more whole.' Since then she has written a blog, Pick A Struggle Cupcake, about her experiences. She finished: 'I've quit drinking completely, which was difficult because I still owned a bar. 'I've gone back to college. I've stared every discrimination in the eye and vanquished it. 'I've completely turned my life around.'","Alana Faulk stepped on the scale for the first time in the early 2000s .

"Weight gain, ageing looks, lower sex drive and a greater risk of heart disease, some types of cancer and the crumbling bone disease, osteoporosis. No wonder most women dread the menopause and would like to put it off as long as possible. But for a growing number the change of life appears to be happening sooner than ever. The most common age for menopause — judged to start when a woman has not had her period for a year — is 51, according to the NHS. But a survey of 2,000 women last month found that on average most stopped menstruating around the age of 46. Furthermore, according to a study by scientists at Imperial College London, as many as one in 16 women experience the change before the age of 40. Although the onset of menopause is strongly influenced by our genes, the good news is that there are lifestyle changes you can make to delay it. BUY LOW-FAT DAIRY PRODUCTS . Researchers from Harvard found those who consumed skimmed milk products, including low-fat cheeses and yoghurts, delayed their menopause by just over three-and-a-half years . You may think you are just warding off middle-age spread by switching to low-fat dairy products. But in a study which tracked 46,000 women, researchers from Harvard found those who consumed skimmed milk products, including low-fat cheeses and yoghurts, delayed their menopause by just over three-and-a-half years. The scientists believe cow’s milk may contain a number of metabolites — or enzymes formed possibly during the process to remove the fat — which boost the amount of the female sex hormone oestrogen in a woman’s system, helping to keep her reproductive organs working for longer. TRADE IN YOUR NON-STICK PANS . It’s not just what you eat that can influence how long you can put off the menopause. How you cook your food may also make a difference. Non-stick pans are coated with perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), a synthetic chemical used to repel grease and water, which has been identified as a hormone disruptor. Non-stick pans are coated with perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), a synthetic chemical used to repel grease and water, which has been identified as a hormone disruptor . In one U.S. study, 26,000 women were tested for this type of chemical in their blood. Those aged between 42 and 64 with the highest levels were found to have gone through the menopause sooner. Menopause expert Dr Marilyn Glenville says it’s wise to choose your cookware carefully, especially as PFOAs appear to build up in the body over the years. She says: ‘We don’t yet know how big a factor these chemicals are, but they may have a cumulative effect over a woman’s lifetime. ‘Using the right kind of pots and pans to cook your food may be important because the actual surface of the pan that you are using can end up being absorbed into your food when heated to high temperatures. ‘My advice is to avoid any non-stick pans or utensils completely as it’s just not worth having the possibility of that toxic exposure. It’s just as easy to cook with stainless steel, cast iron or glass cookware.’ EAT MORE FISH . Women who eat fish two or more times a week were among those who started their menopause later . Don’t just save fish for Fridays, eat it through the week to keep menopause at bay. Turkish researchers studied the lifelong eating habits of 157 women who had been through the menopause, aged 45 to 60. They found the women who ate fish two or more times a week were among those who started their menopause later in the group. It’s thought that omega 3 oils in fish help the pituitary gland in the brain to stimulate a woman’s ovaries to keep producing eggs. USE NATURAL BEAUTY PRODUCTS . A key area of concern is phthalates, found in four out of five beauty products. They are common in foundation, face cream, lipstick and nail varnish, as they give a smooth texture and long-lasting effects, but have also been found to disrupt hormone balance. Dr Natalia Grindler, from Washington University, Missouri, looked at the levels of phthalates in the blood or urine of 5,700 women. Those with the highest amounts were found to have gone through the menopause an average of 2.3 years before the others. Dr Grindler says: ‘There’s a lot that we don’t know at this point, our research is still preliminary, but it’s enough to suggest it is having a detrimental impact in the long term.’ To avoid any risk, Dr Glenville advises thinking more carefully about the products you regularly put on your skin. ‘As your skin is the most absorbent organ of the body, do you really need or want all these chemical entering your blood stream? ‘Check the ingredients list properly and, where possible, stick to natural, plant-based products.’ DITCH THE CLINGFILM . These days much of our food comes wrapped in plastic — and we also use materials like clingfilm to keep it fresh. This could have an effect on our hormones because these pliable plastics contain chemicals which have been found to disrupt the reproductive and hormonal systems in animals and children. Pliable plastics, like clingfilm, contain chemicals which have been found to disrupt the reproductive and hormonal systems in animals and children and it is thought it could affect older women too . Although it’s not yet clear how this would affect the hormones of older women, some experts advise a ‘better safe than sorry’ approach — pointing to the rise in health problems such as breast cancer and other oestrogen-dependent conditions like fibroids or endometriosis, which are possibly linked to these chemicals. Dr Glenville advises never to heat food in plastic — and if you must buy food wrapped in it, remove the packaging when you get home. She says: ‘Instead, store food in the fridge in a dish with a saucer covering it or use grease-proof paper.’ CUT BACK ON YOUR WORKING HOURS . Women who work more than 48 hours a week tend to go through the change of life sooner than their less hard-working counterparts. Researchers in France looked at the health and lifestyle of more than 1,500 women in their 50s. They found that those who worked more than 48 hours a week were more likely to go through the menopause before 51 than those doing shorter hours. The more stressful the job, the sooner the menopause hit, according to the study. Women in particularly high-pressures positions had their change of life as much as a year earlier. Women’s health coach Audrey Sourroubille Arnold, of Lotus Power Health, says many women may be driving themselves headlong into menopause with their stressful workloads. She says: ‘When your body is under stress and has to decide whether reproduction or survival is more important, it will choose the latter. Your reproductive system will be impaired and that can lead to early menopause.’ REDUCE YOUR FAMILY WORRIES . Dr Marilyn Glenville (pictured) says the pressure of everyday life can affect women's hormones . A falling menopause age is not just due to workload, but to women being caught up in the sandwich generation — caring for parents and children — and feeling they are being constantly bombarded physically and emotionally, says Dr Glenville. ‘For women over 40, there can be the pressure of everyday life coping with caring for elderly parents as well as children who are staying at home for longer. ‘At this time of life, the hormones are constantly changing. This constant pressure can act as the last straw — and their periods stop and never come back.’ DO THE CROSSWORD . Scientists have found a link between testing yourself intellectually and delaying the menopause. The reason is that oestrogen does not just regulate your sexual cycles. It also keeps your brain sharper — and the memory working well. Although it’s not possible to boost oestrogen with intellectual exercise, if you are feeling fuzzy-headed, doing brain exercises will help offset the effects of falling hormone levels. GIVE UP SMOKING . A woman’s lifetime supply of eggs develops in her ovaries when she is still a foetus. The vast majority are lost naturally over the years or never mature. By the age of around 51, most of them have run out — and fewer and fewer are released until your reproductive cycle stops altogether. As this happens, the supply of oestrogen falls — and finally drops so low that it triggers the symptoms of the menopause including hot flushes, vaginal dryness, mood changes and ultimately the loss of fertility. Smoking is one of the factors that can kill off the eggs sooner. Smoking can kill off eggs sooner than they would naturally die. Most smokes have the menopause around two years earlier than non-smokers (picture posed by model) Research has found that most smokers have the menopause around two years earlier than non-smokers. Dr Sarah Brewer, author of Live Longer, Look Younger, says: ‘Those who smoke more than ten cigarettes a day are 40 per cent more likely to experience menopause earlier than non-smokers — and also to have more intense symptoms. ‘The most likely reasons are that the toxins found in cigarette smoke affect the enzymes involved in making the sex hormones so that oestrogen production falls. ‘It’s also possible that smoking has a direct toxic effect on primitive egg cells within the ovaries that stops them from staying viable.’ Natural Solutions To Menopause by Dr Marilyn Glenville is published by PanMacmillan at £12.99. Visit marilynglenville.com .","Weight gain, lower sex drive and greater risk of heart disease are just a few of the symptoms women get during the menopause .

"The mother of a U.S. teenager charged with trying to join the Islamic State made a desperate appeal for the terror group to stop brainwashing youths, declaring: 'Leave our children alone!' Mohammed Hamzah Khan's mother cried softly as she read her statement in a federal courthouse lobby in Chicago. Minutes earlier, her 19-year-old son appeared in orange jail garb in an upstairs courtroom to plead not guilty to attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist group. Zarine Khan, flanked by her husband, Shafi, said her family felt compelled to speak out in the wake of 'unspeakable acts of horror' in Paris last week that killed 17. One of the gunman reportedly pledged allegiance to ISIS, while two others cited Al Qaeda. 'The venom spewed by these groups and the violence committed by them... are completely at odds with our Islamic faith,' the 41-year-old said. Zarine Khan (right) and Shafi Khan, parents of Mohammed Hamzah Khan, have made a desperate appeal for the Islamic State to stop brainwashing youths into joining their ranks after their son appeared in court charged with attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist group . About a dozen Americans were believed to be fighting in Syria, while more than 100 have either been arrested on their way or their return, FBI Director James Comey said last fall. Mohammed Khan, who lived with his parents in a middle-class Bolingbrook neighborhood, was arrested in October as he sought to board an international flight in Chicago on the first leg of a plan to sneak into Syria to join Islamic State militants, court documents allege. Weeks later, prosecutors revealed that Khan's 17-year-old sister and 16-year-old brother were in on the plot and had been detained at the airport with Khan. According to court documents, the girl once used the Twitter handle @DeathIsTheeNear to send a favorable tweet about a video of beheadings — placing a smiley emoticon in the text. The younger siblings haven't been charged. Investigators later found a three-page letter in Khan's bedroom in which he apologized to his parents for leaving so abruptly. Accused: An undated passport photo of Mohammed Hamzah Khan who has pleaded not guilty to attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist group at his arraignment in Chicago . But Khan, who studied at the Roman Catholic Benedictine University in Illinois for a year, added he felt obliged to go due to his disgust with Western society and his anger over U.S.-backed bombing of Islamic State fighters, court filings alleged. 'This nation is openly against Islam and Muslims,' he wrote. Adept propagandists managed to woo Mohammed Khan into falsely believing they had established a legitimate Islamic government in parts of Syria and Iraq, Khan's lawyer, Thomas Durkin, told reporters on Tuesday. 'He's a very devout, committed, thoughtful kid who bought into some very slick advertising,' Durkin said. He has said there is no evidence Khan aspired to do anything other than live in territory controlled by Islamic State. Another suburban Chicago youth, Abdella Tounisi, then 18, pleaded not guilty in 2013 to seeking to provide material support to a foreign terrorist group — in his case, Al Qaeda-affiliated Jabhat al-Nusra in Syria. He also allegedly searched online for information about joining up. 'We condemn the brainwashing and recruiting of children through the use of social media and the Internet,' Zarine Khan said Tuesday. Khan's mother and father, originally from India, are both naturalized U.S. citizens. Khan was born in the Chicago area. His parents did not know of the plans to journey to Syria until their son's arrest, Durkin has said. Khan's mother ended her statement Tuesday before a dozen reporters and TV cameras by directly addressing the Islamic State group, which she referred to as ISIS, and its leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. 'We have a message for ISIS, Mr Baghdadi and his fellow social media recruiters,' she said, raising her voice. 'Leave our children alone!'","Mohammed Hamzah Khan, 19, has denied terror charges at Chicago court .

"As far as dream jobs go manhandling a 400kg alligator called Brutus wouldn’t be one of them, but for keepers at the Australian Reptile Park it’s just another day at the office. On Wednesday keepers at the park in Somersby on the Central Coast successfully removed a rogue American alligator from its lagoon of 30 with as little of fuss as possible. Head of Reptiles, Billy Collett, led the operation, and it wasn’t a job for the fainthearted as Brutus had been playing up for weeks. Scroll down for video . It takes five Australian Reptile Park keepers to keep Brutus pinned to the ground during part of the operation . Head of Reptiles, Billy Collett, grabs Brutus around the head as other keepers make sure the alligator can't move . Tails you win, heads you lose: Mr Collett steers well clear of Brutus' immense jaws as he's put into an isolation enclosure . ‘He is a younger male, full of testosterone. He’s causing lots of trouble; biting our boat, chasing us around while we’re nest raiding and causing many injuries among the alligators,’ he said. ‘It was critical we caught him and moved him to a time out pen.’ So just how do you move an almost 400kg alligator? With great difficulty as it turned out. But Mr Collett and his team had been through this before and took it all in their stride. How's that for a poke in the eye? Australian Reptile Park keepers use a pole to keep Brutus at bay . Say cheese! Brutus is successfully roped by the keepers after being lured out of his lagoon with food . One, two, three, heave! After roping Brutus, keepers drag him from the lagoon so that he can be restrained . ‘It takes eight very experienced keepers. He was lured from the lagoon with food, roped, restrained and then tied to a board so he could be walked 500 metres to his isolation enclosure,’ Mr Collett said. ‘The exercise went to plan. Brutus will remain in isolation until autumn. Alligators are less active as the weather becomes cooler, so when it does, we’ll reintroduce him into the lagoon.’ After being tied to a board, Brutus is carried 500 metres by keepers to his isolation enclosure . Now that wasn't too bad was it? Mr Collett checks Brutus to see that he is OK before releasing him into the isolation enclosure . There are a variety of reptiles, including snakes, lizards, alligators and crocodiles at the park, as well as other Australian animals, such as kangaroos, cassowaries and Tasmanian devils. The park is also heavily involved in snake and spider venom collection for use in the production of Anti-venom and is credited for saving thousands of lives.","Rogue American alligator, Brutus, is removed from his lagoon after consistently making a nuisance of himself .

"Schoolchildren are being taught inside corridors, sheds and even a toilet because of overcrowding in classrooms, it has emerged. One school in Northumberland is not only having to turn pupils away, but is also being forced to teach children in make-shift classrooms, including a garden shed. Central First School in Ashington, which bought a double decker bus on eBay for use as a temporary classroom last year, has been finding new means of teaching its ever-growing pupil population. Scroll down for video . Schoolchildren, such as these pupils at Central First School in Ashington, are being taught inside cupboards, corridors, sheds and even a toilet because of overcrowding in classrooms . Pupils at work in a school corridor. New figures have revealed that one in five primary schools have more pupils than they have the capacity for . Central First School is not only having to turn pupils away, but is also being forced to teach children in make-shift classrooms, including a garden shed . The school bought a double decker bus on eBay for use as a temporary classroom last year and has been finding new means of teaching its ever-growing pupil population . 'We've had to turn toilets and cupboards into working spaces,' said headteacher David Godfrey. 'We've had to turn structures outside into working areas for displaying artwork and for teaching the STEM subjects [science, technology, engineering and mathematics]. 'We have a very good reputation as a school and we're full to capacity. Regrettably we're having to turn pupils away.' News of the school's creative approach to new classrooms comes as parents rush to meet tomorrow's deadline for primary school applications. Applications are expected to be made for around 370,000 three and four-year-olds who are due to start school in the autumn. This week many parents are rushing to meet tomorrow's deadline for primary school applications . In the North East, where Central First School is located, more than 80 schools are overcrowded . Figures obtained by the Labour Party suggest almost one in five primary schools (18 per cent) have more pupils than they have capacity for - which has forced many children into large classes or temporary, make-shift classrooms. The party sent Freedom of Information requests to all 152 local education authorities in England, with 130 responding. The responses also revealed that as well as Central First School's classroom bus, St John's Primary School in Bristol has annexed and converted an old police station to cope with demand. And Gascoigne Primary School in Barking, east London, which has 1,200 pupils has sacrificed its playing field, library and old music block to build classrooms, as well as having eight portable classrooms on its playground. Mr Godfrey bought the double decker bus on eBay, ripping out the old seats and replacing them with desks and a plasma TV screen to create a space for 15 pupils. Although the bus cost £5,000 and the transformation a further £3,000, it has still worked out much cheaper than building an extension and Mr Godfrey said his pupils love studying in the vehicle. Mr Godfrey had looked into constructing a new build or renting porta cabins but said the cost of this ran into the hundreds of thousands. It is feared the problem of overcrowding will only get worse, with more than three-quarters of councils saying they saw a need for extra primary school places within the next three years. Pictured are Tammy-Leigh Lane, 8 and Ryhs Davis, 7 at the shed classroom in Central First School's yard . Central First School headteacher David Godfrey said more funding is needed for oversubscribed schools to either extend their classrooms or re-build from scratch . The bus is a fully functioning classroom throughout the whole school day with lessons of up to 12 being held on the top deck and smaller groups of two or three downstairs. Responses to the Freedom of Information request also suggested the problem of overcrowding would only get worse, with more than three-quarters of councils saying they saw a need for extra primary school places within the next three years. Half said they would need additional places in secondary schools. In the North East, where Central First School is located, more than 80 schools are overcrowded. The Local Government Association has also warned that schools will have to find places for almost one million more children in the next decade because of the population boom. It said council taxpayers alone could not absorb the £12billion cost of an extra 900,000 primary and secondary places needed – and accused the Government of failing to make up the shortfall. Population projections suggest that the 7.14million children in England’s schools will rise above 8million by 2023. The organisation has warned that councils need extra help with funding ‘before time runs out’ Mr Godfrey said more funding is needed for oversubscribed schools to either extend their classrooms or re-build from scratch. Mr Godfrey has called for more funding for schools. Pictured is the inside of his school's shed classroom . 'I think there has to be more funding,' he said. 'Especially now the Government introduced free education to two-year-olds from low income families. 'Schools are having to accommodate this quota without any investment from central Government in the existing buildings.' There are nine primary schools in North Tyneside which currently have more pupils than the official capacity - 36 per cent of the total, or more than one in three. There are also two secondary schools in the area which are over capacity. In South Tyneside, 11 primary schools are over capacity, just under a quarter of the total, as well as two secondary schools. Mr Godfrey (pictured with some of his pupils) said schools are having to accommodate additional children 'without any investment from central Government in the existing buildings' County Durham has 28 primary schools and five secondary schools which operating above capacity, while Newcastle has six overcrowded primary schools and two secondaries, and Northumberland has four primary schools operating above capacity. Figures for Sunderland were not available. There have been ongoing concerns about pressure on school places, particularly for primary-age children, fuelled in part in recent years by a rising birth rate. Councillor David Simmonds of the LGA said: ‘We fear a tipping point could soon emerge when councils and schools can no longer afford the massive costs for the creation of places, nor find the space necessary for new classes, if this crisis is not properly dealt with. ‘Additionally, councils face a challenge creating places on time and in the right places when their hands are tied by red tape.' Around 90,000 places were created in 2012/13 by councils, and more are being established - but the scale of the problem is too big to be solved at a local level, the Association insisted. Mr Godfrey bought the double decker bus on eBay, ripping out the old seats and replacing them with desks and a plasma TV screen to create a space for 15 pupils . Although the bus cost £5,000 and the transformation a further £3,000, it has still worked out much cheaper than building an extension and Mr Godfrey said his pupils love studying in the vehicle . The bus is a fully functioning classroom throughout the whole school day with lessons of up to 12 being held on the top deck and smaller groups of two or three downstairs . Conservative Education Minister Nick Gibb said: 'This government has had to deal with an unprecedented increase in demand for school places. We have only been able to do this because of the tough decisions we have taken as part of our long-term economic plan to get the economy back on track. 'As a result, we have protected the school budget from cuts, invested an extra £5 billion to create new school places and spent £18 billion to improve school buildings across the country. Indeed, one of the first decisions we took in 2010 was to double the amount of money allocated to creating new school places. 'By contrast, the last Labour Government cut funding for school places during a baby boom while allowing immigration to get out of control, and wasted millions of pounds of taxpayers' money on their failed ""Building Schools for the Future"" programme.' Labour claims the figures show a desperate need for more school places - and have accused the Government of pumping money into new free schools at the expense of existing schools. Free schools were introduced by the Coalition government and are free from local council control. Four out of five free schools opened last year did not fill all their places. Responses to Freedom of Information requests, also filed by Labour, showed that 83 per cent of Free Schools that opened in 2014 had not filled all their places at the start of the first term. Only seven of the 16 new mainstream secondary Free Schools opened last year were full. Tristram Hunt, Labour's Shadow Education Secretary, said: 'David Cameron is irresponsibly diverting millions away from children in areas with a shortage of school places in order to fund his pet project Free Schools programme in areas where there are already enough places.'","Central First School in Ashington transformed an old bus into classroom .

"A Sydney  siege hostage has offered to sell her first-hand account   for a 'six-figure sum' as it's revealed fellow victims could receive just $1,500 compensation - a fraction of what's available to those caught up in overseas terror attacks. Marcia Mikhael, 42, was one of the few hostages left inside the Lindt Cafe in Martin Place when police stormed in and shot dead gunman Man Haron Monis on December 15. A lawyer for Ms Mikhael, who works as a Wespac executive, told The Australian she had a 'wonderful story to tell' and she was sitting near one of the hostages, Katrina Dawson, when she was killed in the police crossfire. Scroll down for video . Marcia Mikhael, 42, was one of the few hostages left inside the Lindt Cafe in Martin Place when police stormed in and shot dead gunman Man Haron Monis on December 15 . She was one of several hostages forced to record a chilling video message in front of a black Islamic flag to relay several demands required by the 50-year-old gunman. The mother of three has offered her story for a six-figure some and doesn't 'want to be insulted' with anything less, according to her lawyer Jason Arraj. 'It's got to be a win-win business transaction... so when I say I don't want to be - insulted, I'm saying I don't want a figure of $10,000 — that's not going to cut it at all,' Mr Arraj told the newspaper. Ms Mikhael will put the money towards a foundation she wants to set up and it 'is not for the purpose of making a dollar for the benefit of Marcia herself'. It emerged this week that hostages caught up in the siege will receive as little as $1,500 plus costs in compensation under the NSW victims support scheme for the 16-hour ordeal, the Daily Telegraph reports. A lawyer for Ms Mikhael, who works as a Wespac executive, she had a 'wonderful story to tell' and she was sitting near one of the hostages, Katrina Dawson, when she was killed in the police crossfire . Ms Mikhail was one of several hostages forced to record a chilling video message in front of a black Islamic flag to relay several demands required by the 50-year-old gunman . It emerged this week that hostages caught up in the siege will receive as little as $1,500 plus costs in compensation under the NSW victims support scheme for the 16-hour ordeal . The maximum payments for the NSW victims support scheme were cut from $50,000 to $15,000 plus costs back in 2013 . While victims of terror attacks overseas can claim up to $75,000 in financial assistance under Australian federal law, the same legislation doesn't apply for attacks on home soil. The maximum payments for the NSW victims support scheme were cut from $50,000 to $15,000 plus costs back in 2013. Peter Hughes, who survived the Bali bombings in 2002, received federal government compensation after Prime Minister Tony Abbott backdated payments for victims of terrorist events to cover the September 11 attacks in New York. He says the compensation has to extend to cover those caught up in terror attacks in Australia. While victims of terror attacks overseas can claim up to $75,000 in financial assistance under Australian federal law, the same legislation doesn't apply for attacks on home soil . Mother of three Katrina Dawson (left) and Lindt Cafe manager Tori Johnson (right) were both killed after being held hostage for more than 16 hours . Victims held hostage by the gunman were forced to hold up Islamic flags in the windows of the Lindt Cafe . An inquest into the Lindt Cafe siege will open on January 29 and the NSW Coroner will examine ballistics to determine which shots killed the gunman Man Haron Monis (pictured) 'It doesn't matter where the terrorism happens, it doesn't matter if it's international or it happens on our own lands, if they're Australians they should receive this help,' Mr Hughes told the Telegraph. 'It's not about the money, it's about showing that someone ­really cares and that's what I hope happens with victims of the Martin Place siege.' 1. How did barrister Katrina Dawson die? 2. How did cafe manager Tori Johnson die? 3. How did gunman Man Haron Monis die? 4. What caused the injuries of the hostages? 5. Did the police act properly in holding off? 6. Were there explosives in Monis' backpack? 7. Did Man Haron Monis intend to die? 8. Should police have responded to Monis' demands? 9. Did anyone else know about Monis' plans? 10. What could have been done to prevent his actions? NSW Attorney General Brad Hazzard wrote to his federal counterpart George Brandis to raise the issue of compensation last month. Mr Hazzard said it seemed strange that Australians who were the victims of terrorist attacks on home soil were not entitled to the same access to Commonwealth compensation that they would if they were travelling overseas. The federal government will now consider extending the scheme, a spokesman for Mr Brandis said. An inquest into the Lindt Cafe siege will open on January 29 to determine how the deaths occurred, the factors that contributed to them and whether they could have been prevented. The inquest may be held at one of Sydney's two coroner's courts - in the inner western suburb of Glebe, where Monis's body was taken following his death at the siege's end, and at Westmead 26 kilometres from the city centre. NSW State Coroner Michael Barnes will determine over the next fortnight how large a venue is needed for the number of witnesses required, including lawyers representing victims and police officers. Following his determination on what happened inside the Lindt cafe, Mr Barnes will make recommendations to governments and other agencies to protect future public health and safety.

"A passenger has been pulled of a flight and arrested after he stole the aircraft's megaphone. Police were called to a WestJet flight that had landed in Saskatoon from Toronto, Canada after cabin crew had noticed the item had gone missing. After police warned the passengers that all bags would be searched to recover the missing item, a man at the back of the plane, later identified as Jake Michael Piasentini, 29, of Saskatoon, admitted to the theft. Police boarded a WestJet plane after landing at Saskatoon Airport and charged a passenger with theft . Of all the things to steal, Jake Michael Piasentini, 29, of Saskatoon plunged a megaphone into his bag . Mike Van Dijk, who was on board the WestJet flight, told The Canadian Press: '[They said] that they had lost something. 'And, at first, it kind of seemed like something had fallen off the plane.' Officers next told everyone that they wanted the thief to come forward. 'You can either tell us who it is right now, or we're going to have to go through all the bags and it's going to take quite a while,' Van Dijk recalled an officer saying. Alcohol is believed to have played a major part after a Saskatoon resident stole a plane's megaphone . After the item was handed back to aeroplane staff, officers arrested the man, and he is set to appear in court in the next two weeks. Police revealed the megaphone was stolen from the kitchen area, and alcohol was believed to have been a major factor in the incident. Piasentini could be facing a fine of CAD$5,000 ($4,183, £2,747) for theft and a further CAD$5,000 for interfering with a flight. A WestJet spokesperson, in an email to News Talk Radio, said there was no danger to the flight at any point during the incident.","Jake Michael Piasentini, 29, of Saskatoon, admitted to the theft .

"An 18-year-old accused of bludgeoning his roommate to death in New York on Monday claims he was being held captive by the troubled lawyer, and had been tied up and forced to liquidate his stocks at gunpoint. Bitcoin trader Quentin Capobianco told police that 29-year-old Jesse Smith - who authorities previously said had a heroin problem - ordered him to sell his assets to pay for some damages in the upmarket Astoria apartment they shared. Capobianco said Smith had restrained him with zip ties and was threatening him with a shot gun. However Capobianco managed to free himself and 'grabbed the hammer from the kitchen and hit Jessie three or four times until he was unconscious', he told the police, DNAinfo reported. Held Captive: Quentin Capobianco, 18 (left), claims that roommate Jesse Smith, 29 (right), tied him up and threatened him with a shotgun for eight hours during a dispute about money . Scene: Police were called to this Astoria address about 3.30pm on Monday amid reports of a fight. When they arrived they found Smith with severe head trauma and arrested Capobianco . Dead: Smith (left) is seen here inside an Atlantic City hotel room in a photo from his Facebook page . Police were called to the apartment about 3.30pm Monday amid reports of a fight. Smith was rushed to Emhurst General Hospital with severe head trauma but later died. Capobianca was arrested at the scene . Police said they recovered a bloody hammer and a shot gun from the apartment. Capobianco has been charged with second degree murder and criminal possession of a weapon with intent to use. The Queens District Attorney's office believes Capobianco's account but still hopes to convict him of murder because he escaped his bindings and went to another room where he snatched a hammer and clobbered Smith, DNAinfo reported. Capobianco listed on Linkedin that he worked with Smith. Smith had recently left his job at The Povman Law Firm in Forrest Hills, where he handle personal injury claims. The two are believed to have operated a currency exchange business using online currency Bitcoin. However, according to The New York Post, they got into a money dispute over some damage that had been caused to their apartment by a wall-mounted fire place. Priveleged: Smith grew up on Long Island an attended the University of Vermont and Hoffstra University School of Law . Charged: Capobianco is facing second-degree murder charges, however claims he was being held captive by Smith and hit him with a hammer 'three or four times' after breaking free . Neighbors told the newspaper that Capobianco had only been living in the apartment - in the luxury Exo building at 26-38 21st -  for about five months. Smith had lived alone in the apartment but had Capobianco move in to help with the rent. A one-bedroom apartment in the building - which features a gym and rooftop deck - goes for around $2,800. A clerk at a nearby liquor store told The Post that Smith would often come in to buy champagne to celebrate new clients . 'He was starting a new business,' the clerk said. 'He said he was not going to work for someone else anymore, he was only going to work for himself.' Beaten to death: Smith was pronounced dead at Elmhurst General Hospital on Monday . Smith's Facebook page features several photos of him partying, including a trip to Atlantic City. His lawyer profile at Povman Law Firm - which was pulled down from the company website Tuesday - says that he grew up on Long Island and received a psychology degree from the University of Vermont. He then attended Hoffstra University School of Law. Smith worked at a 'prestigious criminal defense firm', his redacted profile said, before joining Povman, where he worked on personal injury claims, from 'complex medical malpractice cases to common car accidents or slip and falls'. Struggling: Smith was a practicing lawyer but had a heroin problem, police sources said . Lifestyle: Smith's social media accounts show an active partying lifestyle. It is not clear if this photo, posted in August 2012, is of his living room . However it appears he had recently left to go into business with Capobianca. The Povman Law Firm said they had 'no comment' on Smith when The Daily Mail contacted them on Tuesday.","Quintin Capobianco, 18, says he was held captive for eight hours .

"Dozens of mothers have donated breast milk for a six-month-old baby whose mother recently died from a heart attack. Liz Marquez, a 32-year-old mother of five from Diamond Bar, California, suffered cardiac arrest on December 7 and was taken off life support nine days later, leaving behind Brixton, her premature son, whom she'd planned to breastfeed for at least a year. Mrs Marquez's friend Kristina Pulistar quickly launched the Milk for Brixton Project, a campaign to collect breast milk from local mothers. Devoted mother: Liz Marquez, 32, suffered a fatal heart attack in December, leaving behind her preemie son Brixton . She told CBS Los Angeles: 'The first thought in my head was, oh my gosh, the baby. I knew that she was using breast milk with Brixton, and immediately I just went straight to finding donor milk for her.' Ms Pulistar, 29, sought support from Mrs Marquez's friends in their local community of mothers and from breastfeeding advocate Vanessa Simmons, who shared the family's story on her website, Normalize Breastfeeding. Brixton's father, Brian Marquez, told Normalize Breastfeeding: 'I know how important it was to my wife that our child be purely breastfed for at least one year. I feel it's part of my commitment to carry that goal out for my wife.' Mrs Marquez was particularly determined to provide breast milk for Brixton, who was born prematurely at just 32 weeks, because she saw how much it 'helped him through his many trials in the beginning of his life and his NICU stay,' according to Ms Pulistar. However, Mrs Marquez had struggled to produce enough breast milk to feed Brixton and began using milk donated by local moms, according to her childhood friend, La Nina W. Sad: Mrs Marquez had planned to breastfeed Brixton (pictured with his father, Brian Marquez) for at least a year . Good cause: Mrs Marquez's friend Kristina Pulistar (pictured) quickly launched the Milk for Brixton Project, a campaign to collect breast milk from local mothers . Successful project: Milk for Brixton has now received more than 4,500 ounces of breast milk from local mothers . Milk for Brixton has now received more than 4,500 ounces of milk and has set up a GoFundMe page to raise money for a deep freezer to store the milk and gas for drop-offs and pick-ups at 13 locations near the Marquez family's California home. For safety reasons, Ms Pulistar told The Stir that the organization will not accept donations from women who 'smoke, drink, or take recreational or prescription drugs.' The crowd-funding campaign has earned more than $1,000, and Ms Pulistar told The Huffington Post that the project even caught the attention of actress Alyssa Milano, who donated gas cards to the cause. Ms Pulistar said that the response has been 'unbelievable', adding that she hopes to help other families with babies in need of breast milk. 'I would even like to help infants who have mothers with illnesses that prevent them from being breastfeed. I want to make a difference and normalize donor milk sharing!' she said. 'Liz was an amazing woman and mother. Her children were her world. She always held them close and did everything for them.'","Liz Marquez, a 32-year-old mother of five from Diamond Bar, California, suffered a fatal heart attack, leaving behind her preemie son Brixton .

"Businessman and father-of-four Craig Lavelle has launched his own bin collection business in Bury where bins are being collected every three weeks . A businessman has stepped in to offer rubbish collections after a council slashed its own bin- emptying service to just once every three weeks. It will cost families £8.40 a time, but Craig Lavelle says there has been a ‘tremendous response’ to his idea. The enterprising 54-year-old said he was prompted to act after realising how furious residents were about the council’s scaled-back service. Many were last week still waiting for their Christmas rubbish to be emptied. The Labour-run council in Bury, Greater Manchester, began three-weekly collections in October, the first in England to do so. Falkirk in Scotland, and parts of Gwynedd, North Wales, are also running collections every 21 days. Town hall bosses say the move will boost recycling rates and save money for other frontline services. But so far locals have not been impressed and fear it is the precursor to a monthly collection. While some complained about wheelie bins bursting with three-week-old rotting waste and black bins bags scattered all over the streets, others said fewer collections were causing an increase in vermin and fly tipping. In some areas the situation was so bad that residents reported their bins had been ‘secretly’ filled by their neighbours or even stolen because people were so desperate to dispose of their rubbish. So it is perhaps not surprising that after canvassing 5,000 households in Bury, Mr Lavelle – who is a managing director of a commercial waste company – found there had been a ‘tremendous response’ to his idea. His new firm, Bury Bins, to be launched on March 1, would charge £8.40 per bin and would collect every week – apart from the week of the council collection – and on the same day, so as not to confuse residents. It means anyone who signs up will be shelling out £327.60 every year, or £168 every six months, on top of their council tax to have their bins emptied every week. But unlike the council’s waste, no rubbish collected by Bury Bins would go to landfill, instead being all burned for energy. Bury Council was the first in the country to announce three-weekly collections and there are fears the new measures will see increased fly tipping and streets strewn with over flowing bins, which could attract pests . Mr Lavelle’s plan is to launch Bury Bins in a small area with one lorry, before rolling it out across the town, depending on demand. ‘The people of Bury want a service and I’m going to provide one for them,’ he said. In order to satisfy the Environment Agency that all waste would be disposed of correctly, Bury Bins will have a waste carrier’s licence, and the company also has public liability insurance to protect its staff and customers. A Bury council spokesman defended the three-weekly collections, pointing out that recycling rates had improved from 47 per cent to 55 per cent since they were introduced, and the move could save £800,000 annually. He added: ‘After only the first month, non-recyclable waste had reduced by 600 tons compared with the same month in 2013.’ A Facebook page 'Say NO to Bury Council 3 weekly bin collection' has been liked almost 6,000 times . Doretta Cocks, of the Campaign for Weekly Waste Collections, condemned the switch to one council collection every three weeks. She said: 'I dread to imagine the consequences of rubbish remaining in a bin awaiting collection for three weeks especially during hot weather. 'Just think of a situation where those with babies have to dispose of nappies. 'It will be horrendous and I cannot understand why the council's own health experts are standing by and letting it happen. It is a recipe for the spread of disease.' 'Residents are paying for a service through their council tax and they are not getting it. 'It is also the thin edge of the wedge towards monthly collections - I feel it is only a matter of time now before that happens which would be a disgraceful.'","Craig Lavelle left angry by Bury Council's three-weekly bin collections .

"Fire crews and paramedics have been issued with bullet proof vests amid growing fears over a Paris-style gun attack on the UK, it was claimed tonight. Emergency response teams have also been given training in how to cope with a 'marauding' attack by Islamist fanatics which spreads across the country and lasts for days. It comes amid warnings that the threat from home-grown terrorists is at its highest level since 9/11 - with Home Secretary Theresa May revealing today that at least three serious terror plots have been foiled recently. Scroll down for video . The Home Secretary said the UK's anti-terror agencies were increasingly powerless to tracking British-based fanatics . Mrs May told MPs that innocent lives were being put 'at risk' by the failure to give the security services the powers they need to prevent a terrorist attack. She said the UK's anti-terror agencies were increasingly powerless to tracking British-based fanatics because the law stops them from monitoring emails. The Tory Cabinet Minister said every day that passed without giving MI5 and the police new powers meant 'crimes will go unpunished and innocent lives will be put at risk'. She also claimed that around 600 Britons are now thought to have travelled to Syria to fight on the front line with ISIS. Across Europe there are now thought to be up to 5,000 Islamist fanatics at large after returning from the Middle East. In a Commons statement this afternoon, Mrs May confirmed that Britain's counter-terror services were being given extra training in how to deal with a Paris-style attack - where marauding gunmen bring mayhem to the streets. It comes after David Cameron held talks with spy chiefs earlier this week to step up Britain's defences against the threat posed by a 'fanatical death cult of Islamist extremist violence'. According to the Telegraph, paramedics and fire crews are being taught how to work in buildings, airports and railway stations that may be booby-trapped with bombs. The Home Secretary told MPs that future training exercises will incorporate 'specific elements' of the Paris attacks, she said. Mrs May confirmed that Britain's counter-terror police will now be given extra training in how to deal with a Paris-style attack . Mrs May accused Labour's shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper (above) of not supporting new anti-terror powers for the police and security services . Training exercises involving the police, military and security agencies will be adapted in the wake of the murderous attacks in France last week which left 17 victims dead. The Prime Minister asked the police and military to 'continue to work closely together' to ensure that the police, who lead on counter-terror measures, can call on military back-up when needed across the country. Discussion centred on levels of preparedness for 'marauding' gun attacks, similar to those seen in Mumbai in 2008 when 164 people died in 12 shooting and bomb attacks over four days. Police and security agencies 'regularly' carry out training exercises to test their response to a terror attack, including scenarios similar to the incidents in Paris, Downing Street said. 'The meeting agreed that for future exercises, the relevant agencies should identify whether there are any further specific elements of the Paris attack that should be built into the exercise scenarios.' It is understood that particular focus has been on the way brothers Cherif and Said Kouachi moved from central Paris after carrying out their attack on the offices of the Charlie Hebdo magazine. They are said to have spent a night in woodland before trying to return to the capital, before becoming holed up on an industrial estate in the small town of Dammartin-en-Goele. Terrorist brothers Cherif Kouachi (left) and Said Kouach (right) died after murdering 12 people in last week's gun rampage . Flowers lay outside Charlie Hebdo headquarters in Paris today - a week after the attack on the newspaper . While thousands of French police were focussed there, Amedy Coulibaly took several people hostage in a Jewish supermarket in the Vincennes district of eastern Paris, stretching resources further. British security teams are to assess their own ability to carry out large scale searches in urban and rural areas and react to the challenge of an incident which lasts several days. A Downing Street spokesman said: 'The Prime Minister held a security meeting in Downing St this morning to review the Paris attacks and the risks to the UK of a similar attack. 'Following an intelligence update, they discussed the UK's preparedness for similar incidents. The relevant police and agencies regularly carry out exercises to test their response to a terror attack, including scenarios similar to the incidents in Paris. 'The meeting agreed that for future exercises, the relevant agencies should identify whether there are any further specific elements of the Paris attack that should be built into the exercise scenarios. 'The Prime Minister also asked the police and military to continue to work closely together to ensure that the police can call on appropriate military assistance when required across the country. 'They also discussed the risk posed by firearms, agreeing that our existing tough firearms laws are a very important part of the protections we have and that we should step up our efforts with other countries to crackdown on the illegal smuggling of weapons across borders.' It comes as the UK's most senior firearms officer called for a new elite armed police unit to be on stand-by for Paris-style terror attacks. Mr Cameron has pledged to introduce 'more comprehensive' powers to monitor terror suspects in the UK. MI5 chief Andrew Parker warned last week that al Qaida terrorists in Syria were planning 'mass casualty attacks' against Western targets, and Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said a terror attack in the UK was 'a possibility' - though he stressed he did not think it 'likely'.","Emergency teams  given training in how to cope with a 'marauding' attack .

"A new study has found that a third of female university students in the UK have been sexually assaulted (pictured posed by model) A third of female university students  have been sexually assaulted with almost half of them admitting they didn't even report the attack to their family, according to a new survey. The study found that 31 per cent of female students polled said they had experienced 'inappropriate touching or groping' while at institutions in the UK. It also found that 43 per cent of those who had experienced unwanted advances did not report it to the university or even their family and friends. The study carried out by research group YouthSight for the Daily Telegraph comes amid calls by charities for new guidelines warning higher education institutions could be breaching the law by not investigating reported sexual abuse. It also found that one in eight men who responded said they had been groped or had unwanted advances. Meanwhile more than half of the women and a third of men polled said they knew of someone else who had experienced behaviour ranging from touching to rape. Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health and wellbeing at Public Health England, told the paper: 'It is unacceptable that a third of women and 12 per cent of men said they had faced unwelcome sexual advances. 'It is crucial that those on the ground, the students, feel confident and safe enough to take active steps when they witness a problem, or experience domestic harassment themselves.' The new study comes just months after universities were accused of failing to combat a widespread ‘lads’ culture’ which has seen unwanted sexual advances and jokes about rape become commonplace. Student leaders warned that harassment was ‘rife’ on campus after another survey also found that more than a third of female students have been groped or touched inappropriately and almost two thirds said they had heard jokes about rape or sexual assault. The same survey also revealed a lack of awareness of procedures in place at universities designed to tackle inappropriate behaviour, with 60 per cent saying they were unaware of any codes of conduct written by their university or their students’ union. Speaking at the time, Laura Bates, from the Everyday Sexism campaign, said: ‘Students are experiencing sexism, sexual harassment and assault within the university environment. ‘It is worth mentioning that one category of such experiences “inappropriate touching and groping” actually constitutes sexual assault under UK law.' However Nicola Dandridge, chief executive of Universities UK, added: ‘If alleged criminal behaviour is involved, all universities would support any students reporting such incidents to the police. 'It is important to remember that this is an issue for society generally, not just one confined to university students.'","Survey finds 31% of female students claimed they have been sexually assaulted .

"Just what is a woman to do when they've secured a table at the hottest restaurant in the world for their 39th birthday, but don't have anyone to take? If you're mobile tech entrepenuer Stephanie Robesky and the restaurant in question is Noma's Tokyo pop-up, the answer is to take the search to your blog. Ms Robesky is one of the lucky few to get a table during the usually Copenhagen-based eateries five-week stint in the Japanese capital, which ends on Valentine's Day. But Ms Robesky, from San Francisco, is dateless - so she has advertised the second seat at her table-for-two. Unsurprisingly when 6,000 scrabbled to get a reservation, Ms Robeksy has been inundated with offers. Stephanie Robesky was among the lucky few to get a table at Nobu's Tokyo pop-up - but doesn't have a date for the sought-after meal . So Ms Robesky has advertised for a fellow food enthusiast to join her for the meal, which falls on her 39th birthday . Writing on her blog, Nerd Girl, she explained: 'Yes, there were 60,000 people who tried to get this reservation and I am lucky enough to have secured one for two. 'And, sadly, I don’t have a dining companion. 'So I decided since I’m single and dateless on what will be my 39th birthday that I would open up the opportunity for someone to take advantage of this crazy, once in a lifetime meal and find myself a date.' Indeed, each sitting at the restaurant has just 44 spaces for diners, meaning seats are at a premium. And it seems even head chef René Redzepi knows how sought-after they are: he gave Ms Robesky's hunt a boost when he tweeted out her appeal from his official Twitter account. But the opportunity is not open to just anyone. Ms Robesky, who lists her likes as travelling, good food, 'nerding out' on gadgets and hanging out with bald cats, among other things, has set out a strict criteria which a potential date must meet. Ms Robesky has been swamped with men desperate to accompany her to Noma, which is based in Copenhagen (pictured) This is the first time head chef René Redzepi has left his Danish restaurant (pictured) for a residency in another country . Writing on her blog, she stipulated eight must-haves for anyone applying - including being single, living in the Bay Area of San Francisco, and know how to use a knife and fork 'properly'. 'Knowledge of Japanese etiquette a big plus,' she added. The date will also have to be able to cover their own flight and accommodation costs. However, the 38-year-old will pay for dinner and wine pairing for the meal, which is to take place in the last week of January. But even with the strict rules, and with flights boasting a price tag of somewhere around $1,000, Ms Robesky has had so many applications she has had to extend the opening date. 'I didn’t think that this was going to go as crazy as it has,' she wrote in an update on January 13. 'I am honestly humbled by this entire experience and I haven’t even gotten to the grand finale!' She added: 'There are so many awesome guys out there that it is going to be really difficult to pick just one.' The lucky winner will be selected after she meets up with three of the potential dinner dates on January 17. But whether or not the world will ever discover who Ms Robesky's dining companion was is unclear. She has left that decision up to him. Danish Chef Rene Redzepi, who won the title World's Best Restaurant with Noma two years in a row, has moved to Japan for a five week stint in Tokyo . Foodies across the planet have been raving about Noma for  years - with more than one dubbing it 'the world's best restaurant'. The restaurant, which is based in Copenhagen, serves Nordic food reimagined under the watchful eye of head chef René Redzepi. Noma's website boasts it is 'hoping to rediscover our history and shape our future' through its food. Diners are offered a 20-course menu, including unusual dishes such as beef tartare and ants, radish and yeast and reindeer moss and cep mushrooms. A meal at the two Michelin-starred restaurant costs around about £166, with wine pairing costing an extra £104. But it is worth it, according to the restaurant critics. Writing for the Daily Mail in 2010, Tom Parker Bowles concluded: 'Noma is utterly and gloriously unique. And quite, quite brilliant.' The Tokyo pop-up is the first time Redzepi and his team have ventured outside Denmark. It opened last Friday, and so far reviews trickling out suggest it will be just as successful in the east.","Stephanie Robesky has secured a reservation for the world-famous restaurant's five week residency in the Japanese capital .

"A husband 'tortured' and killed his wife while playing the Koran at full volume in a bid to drown out her screams, because of a row over a shelf, a court has heard. Thahi Manaa, 37, of Firth Park, Sheffield is accused of killing his wife Sara el Shourefi at their home on March 4, 2014. Police recovered several blood-stained implements near Ms el Shoureifi's body, including an electric drill, two metal bars, two screwdrivers and a wooden shelf. A screwdriver had also been driven into the 28-year-old victim's eye socket penetrating her brain. Sara el Shourefi was killed at the family home in The Oval,  Firth Park, Sheffield in March 2014, file photo . Sheffield Crown Court heard that the attack happened in a downstairs living area while his own mother and children aged two and four were locked elsewhere in the rented property. Prosecutors claimed that following the attack, Manaa bound his wife's legs with packing tape before bundling her body into a cupboard. Relatives alerted the police later that same day. Manaa, who was born in Kuwait and came to the UK in 2010 and granted leave to remain until 2016 denies his wife's murder on grounds of diminished responsibility but has admitted her manslaughter. A post mortem counted 270 injuries on Ms el Shoureifi's body, including a large number of puncture wounds while clumps of her hair had been torn out. Her scalp was hanging off her head and she had been kicked and stamped upon as well as a knife being used on her neck. Nicholas Campbell QC, prosecuting, said: 'It was a sustained and brutal attack and Sara received sadistic injuries.' Sheffield Crown Court heard Manaa gave various accounts to psychiatrists before claiming to have lost his memory about the attack. He told one doctor the couple had ongoing rows about a shelf he had put up in the living room. Mr Campbell said: 'His wife wanted it to be moved. There was an argument and he hit her with his hands and with the shelf he was trying to reposition. 'He said he hit Sara on the head and shoulders with the shelf and she became a little tired. He offered to take her to hospital or call 999 but she told him it would not be necessary. He went upstairs but when he came back down she was lying on the floor. There was a screwdriver sticking out of her left eye.' Neighbours heard high-pitched screams and the sound of banging coming from the house on the morning of the alleged murder. One said: 'It seemed as if Sara was being tortured. It seemed as if she was in a lot of pain.' Another witness heard Manaa hitting his wife. 'She pictured Sara on the floor with the defendant coming in and out of the room shouting and hitting her. As the assault continued the screams became more laboured until everything went silent.' Sheffield Crown Court, pictured, heard that Thahi Manaa arrived in the UK in 2010 from Kuwait . In a statement to police, Manaa's nephew Ahmad Jabber admitted his uncle told him: 'I have killed my wife. His eyes were bulging and he seemed to be a crazy person as if he was out of his mind.' Manaa came to the UK in 2010 and his wife a year later. He was granted leave to remain in the country until 2016. Both of their families were known as 'bidun' or stateless in Kuwait and had moved around the Middle East because their safety could not be guaranteed. The couple married in 2004 and they brought their three children with them and had a fourth child over here. But his wife’s only close relative in the UK was her younger sister Narjis Farhoud who lived just two minutes away from the family’s privately rented home in Firth Park, Sheffield. Prosecution counsel Mr Campbell told the court that most of the victim's family were back in Kuwait.  'Her isolation from the family at home is a significant factor in the events which unfolded. Ms Farhoud told the court that her sister was pretty with long hair but the longer she lived with her husband, the more subdued she became. She started wearing glasses and had limited reading and writing skills. Ms Farhoud said her older sister was not allowed out of the house on her own and had to ask Manaa to buy her sanitary towels. The court heard that the victim was not allowed to learn English and admitted to her sister that she was being physically abused, but 'had to bear it.' Mr Campbell told the court that Manaa would beat his wife for the slightest reason. 'He punched her regularly and when she tried to protect herself he would grab her hand and control her movements. He would pull out chunks of her hair.' He added: 'Narjis believed not a week would go by without her sister being assaulted in one way or another although Sara told her she was hit almost every day. 'Sara said she accepted all of this behaviour because she loved him.' The court heard that Manaa took his wife's mobile phone from her at the beginning of 2014 to prevent her from having any contact with her family in the Middle East. She could only talk to her sister through her mother-in-law. The trial continues.

"Leaving: An official escorts a failed asylum seeker up the steps to an airplane waiting to take off from Stansted Airport in this 2006 file photo . Taxpayers have forked out more than £300million on flights and ‘bribes’ to persuade foreign criminals and illegal immigrants to go home. The bill has been racked up over the past five years as officials struggle to clear a huge backlog of overseas convicts, visa over-stayers and people who sneaked into the UK in the back of lorries. In some cases, the migrants could only be convinced to leave with the help of so-called ‘assistance’ packages worth up to £1,500 each. They are free to spend the cash on education, medical bills, housing and even setting up a business back home. The highest sums were £68million spent in the year ending April 2010 and £71.8million the following year. Last night Tory MPs said much of the blame rested with Labour, which handed the current Government a border system in chaos. The bill only includes flights, assistance grants and, for violent offenders, guards on the journey. If the cost of prison sentences and the time taken by Home Office staff to process the paperwork are included, the total would be far higher. Tory MP Michael Ellis, a member of Westminster’s home affairs select committee, said: ‘This is another example of the appalling legacy and the incompetence of the previous Labour government, which lost control of our borders and security arrangements and created an overweening bureaucracy.’ The figures were revealed to Labour MP Frank Field, a member of the Balanced Migration campaign group, in a Parliamentary written answer. It gives a total bill of £306million between 2009-10 and 2013-14 – including £55.3million in the last year alone. £300million: The bill has been racked up over the past five years as officials struggle to clear a huge backlog of overseas convicts, visa over-stayers and people who sneaked into the UK in the back of lorries . Migrationwatch chairman Lord Green of Deddington said: ‘The removal of immigration offenders is absolutely fundamental to the credibility of the entire system. This figure illustrates the huge cost of each case.’ He said that, given the level of public concern about immigration, the system was in need of more resources. Under the facilitated removals programme – offered to foreign criminals and immigration offenders who agree to drop any remaining appeals – the grant can be used to set up a business, take an education course or pay for housing or medical expenses. Handouts are worth £1,500 if a foreign prisoner signs up while serving their sentence or £750 if they wait until they have been released from jail. The grant is paid in cash, with the foreign nationals handed a pre-paid cash card on departure containing £500. On return home, they get the rest by contacting the International Organisation for Migration which administers the scheme for the Home Office whose officials argue it is cheaper than forcibly deporting them after a long legal battle. Porous? Britain's Prime Minister David Cameron and Home Secretary Theresa May walk through immigration at Terminal 5 during a visit to Border Agency staff at Heathrow Airport, in this November 2010 file photo . A vast camp for migrants in Calais will open this morning, sparking fears it will attract hundreds more to the French town. It will offer beds, showers, food and even power points to charge phones for the 2,500 migrants trying to reach Britain from the port. The Jules Ferry camp was built using a £3million EU grant which would include cash that ultimately comes from British taxpayers. Critics compare the centre to the Sangatte camp which became a magnet for migrants before it was closed. Tory MP Michael Ellis said: ‘It is bonkers for the Calais authorities to do anything which encourages migrants to their town. It will only create problems for us next.’ By March the 12 acre camp, with three football pitches and a tennis court, will be able to feed 1,500 migrants by day and sleep 500. It is believed officers from the UK Border Force will be on site to inform migrants of the realities of entering Britain, in an apparent effort to dissuade them. Last October, ministers were attacked by the UK’s spending watchdog for failing to deport more foreign criminals. The National Audit Office said the number of foreign prisoners had gone up despite a near tenfold increase in officials working on their cases. There are 12,250 foreign offenders in the UK and the Government spends around £850million a year on managing them. Huge sums are also being spent on compensation for foreign criminals and illegal immigrants who were kept locked up for too long while officials fought to deport them. Over the past four years, the total bill is £17million – with recipients including sex offenders, robbers and drug dealers. Judges decided the claimants had been ‘unlawfully detained’ because the Home Office continued to hold them even though they did not have a realistic prospect of booting them out. A Home Office spokesman said: ‘Those with no right to be in the UK should return home and we are determined to crack down on immigration offenders. 'Thanks to the efficiency savings made by this Government, the annual cost of removing foreign nationals with no right to be here has fallen by almost a quarter – while the number of voluntary returns has risen sharply, from just over 27,000 in 2010 to more than 39,000 in 2013.’","Tory MPs accuse Labour of handing over a border system in chaos .

"ABC managing director Mark Scott has shaken off the viral campaign to get a Taylor Swift song to enter Triple J's Hottest 100. The media boss issued a tweet on Thursday responding to the #Tay4Hottest100 campaign, which has taken the internet by storm. 'It's gonna be alright @triplej,' Scott wrote on Twitter, with a link to a story about the trending hashtag. Scroll down for video . In his tweet, Mark Scott (right) made another reference to Taylor Swift's (left) song Shake It Off, which topped music charts around the world . The line references the U.S. pop singer's song Shake It Off, which is at the centre of the campaign. It kicked off after Joe McKenzie tweeted Scott about the omission of Swift's hit from the Triple J's Hottest 100 voting list. 'Triple J is refusing to let me vote for Taylor Swift in the Hottest 100 I personally blame @mcscott [Scott's Twitter handle],' he wrote. To which, Scott replied: 'Shake it off Joe.' This tweet sparked a social media campaign, with fans of Swift boycotting the Australia Day tradition by voting for her songs.

It kicked off after Joe McKenzie tweeted Scott about the omission of Swift's hit from the Triple J's Hottest 100 . Triple J - which is controlled by the ABC - allows voters to manually enter their selections, so some decided to abuse that privilege. 'So this just happened,' Rachael Tomic tweeted including a photo of her top 10 votes, which were all Taylor Swift songs. While Venessa Paech threw her support behind Swift. 'If we're being honest we'd admit Shake if Off is a better crafted song than most of the noise on JJJ,' she said. Supporters have taken to Twitter, sharing their Hottest 100 votes on the social media site . While Venessa Paech threw her support behind Swift.'If we're being honest we'd admit Shake if Off is a better crafted song than most of the noise on JJJ.' Even the Australian Bureau of Statistics weighed in on the debate, saying: 'Shake it off, Australia! The Census gives no insights into how many ‘Haters’ there are in Australia. #Tay4hottest100.' Others against the move to include Shake It Off on the list were also vocal on the matter. 'It was hard enough to narrow down to 10 songs without losing one of those to Taylor Swift. Sorry TayTay,' Anna tweeted. Shake It Off is amongst the most favoured to take out number one spot on the Hottest 100, according to betting agencies. Even the ABS got on board the bandwagon, tweeting this gem on Wednesday afternoon . But with the supporters, there were also those who did not want Taylor Swift entering the charts . Sportsbet.com.au is paying $5 for the single to be the Outright Winner 2014 at the time of publication, while rival site sportingbet is also forking out the same amount but it is the third pick for a win. Swift's single Shake It Off has topped charts around the world, including reaching number one on the ARIA Singles Chart when it was released last year. The singer's album is still the highest selling album in Australia this week, according to the chart. Triple's Hottest 100 counts down the top 100 songs of the year as voted by fans. Songs that are eligible for the list this year have to be released between December 1, 2013 and November 30, 2014, according to the radio station's site. A Triple J spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia she could not comment on the movement. 'We don't comment on voting campaigns whilst Hottest 100 voting is open, as it may influence the results of the poll,' she said.","Mark Scott tweeted in response to campaign: 'It's gonna be alright @triplej'

"The IRS, long Americans' least-favorite government agency, is likely to be a lot less popular this tax season - refunds will be slower, the risk of identity theft will be higher and there will be longer hold times to reach customer service. By some estimates, fewer than half of the taxpayers who call the IRS will be able to speak to a representative. IRS Commissioner John Koskinen revealed  to the changes to employees in a memo - saying budget cuts have taken their toll on the Internal Revenue Service.

Oddly enough, the cuts hurt the government more than anyone, who will lose out on receiving an estimated $2billion in tax revenue - at the very least, Koskinen claims. 'We now anticipate an even lower level of telephone service than before,' writes Koskinen, 'which raises the real possibility that fewer than half of taxpayers trying to call us will actually reach us.' He then adds, 'we have no choice but to do less with less.' As for the refund check delay, it won't be too bad, with most Americans only having to wait about one extra week.

"It could take up to five years to solve the problems in the NHS which have caused a crisis in accident and emergency departments across the country, a senior health official warned. Professor Keith Willett, who led a review of England's casualty units, insisted there was no 'quick fix' to the chaos in many hospitals, which has seen the numbers visiting A&E surge by 400,000 since April as a result of the NHS 111 helpline. More doctors and nurses need to be recruited and the funding system changed to reduce waiting times and prevent bed blocking by elderly patients waiting for social care. Professor Keith Willett insisted there was 'quick fix' to the chaos in many hospitals, which has seen the numbers visiting A&E surge by 400,000 since April. Their comments came after figures showed that the numbers of patients being seen within the four-hour target period dropped to 86.7 per cent in the week ending January 4. The soaring number of visits has been blamed on an ageing population and patients flocking to hospitals to have minor ailments treated. The government has come under increasing pressure over the winter crisis in the NHS, with Labour vowing to make the health service a central plank of its election campaign. Professor Willett warned that the problems could not be solved in just a few months. Giving evidence to the health select committee, he said the entire health system needed to be overhauled to ensure changes in one area do not impact other parts of the NHS. 'We have had numerous examples over numerous years of doing one really good initiative in one part of the pathway and it doesn't have the effect we expect because the rest of the pathway is sufficiently busy to negate the advantages of that.' He said his emergency care review had found there was a need for a 'transformation of the whole system'. There had to be a 'particular focus' on out-of-hospital care to 'both reduce demand and alleviate the issues of congestion within the hospital'. But he warned: 'It is not going to be a quick fix. We have said it is going to be three to five years to get all of these things in place.' He said staffing issues had to be addressed as well as changing the way people are treated to stop beds being taken by people unable to leave hospital while waiting for social care. Ambulance trusts have been accused of reclassifying call-outs to free them from response time targets . Professor Willett said: 'We have heard about recruitment issues in general practice, in acute medicine, in emergency medicine, in paramedics. 'Those things are not addressed over a few months. We also know that the curriculum has got to change. We know that we have got to have better connectivity around information and we have better working relationships. 'And we have to change the payments system that is not all going to happen inside one year.' NHS England medical director Sir Bruce Keogh said it would 'foolish' to claim there would be no repeat next winter of the problems which have seen hospitals fail to meet their target of seeing 95% of A&E admissions within four hours. 'In answer to the question 'Can we tell you that next winter that we will be okay?' I think it would be very foolish to sit here and say this because it is part of a three to five year programme,' he said. Dr Clifford Mann, the president of the College of Emergency Medicine, told MPs that since April there had been more than 14 million visits to A&E, a rise of 446,049 on last year. He said NHS 111 was to blame for the bulk of the increase. 'Of the 450,000 extra attendances in the system in the last year, 220,000 were advised by NHS 111 to come to the emergency department and another 220,000 had an ambulance despatched to them by NHS 111. 'If you put those figures together you have more than 95 per cent of the rise in type 1 [major A&E unit] attendances. I don't think we should blame people for attending the emergency department when we've told them to go there. It's absurd.' Dr Clifford Mann, the president of the College of Emergency Medicine, told MPs that since April there had been more than 14 million visits to A&E, a rise of 446,049 on last year . 'That's certainly true, but the other way of describing it is to say that's equivalent to eight or nine extra emergency departments and of course we haven't built or staffed eight or nine extra emergency departments in the last 12 months.' A surge in demand for emergency care is also hitting ambulance services hard. Paramedics say they are so overstretched they often rely on firemen and police officers to take patients to hospital. NHS figures last week showed that eight out of ten ambulance trusts in England miss the target for responding to life-threatening calls. Ambulance chiefs were accused last night of risking patients' lives to meet response time targets. One trust may have hastened the deaths of dozens of desperately ill people by downgrading emergency call-outs to non-urgent. This freed them from hitting a response time target of eight minutes. East of England Ambulance Service admits that 8,324 patients had their cases reclassified in this way in a two-month period last year. At least 57 were not taken to hospital and died. Some of those downgraded had a terminal illness or a 'do not resuscitate' order. It emerged last night that another major ambulance trust – Yorkshire – is also suspected of recategorising thousands of urgent cases. Managers made the calls 'non-urgent' when they realised ambulances were not going to reach patients inside the eight-minute window. Denise Burke, of the Norfolk-based campaign group Action on Ambulances, said: 'They are playing Russian roulette with patients' lives. 'What is most shocking with East Anglia is the way patients who were near the end of life were treated. They were deciding on patients' quality of life and whether they died then or in dignity a few months later. 'Any of those families will be questioning whether their loved ones' lives could have been extended by a few months.'","Health bosses warn turnaround of emergency care will take 3-5 years .

"Scientists in Ohio believe they have identified a drug which could help people suffering binge eating disorder, which often leads to obesity (file picture) A drug used to treat ADHD could be used to curb binge eating, scientists revealed today. Binge eating disorder is when a person feels compelled to overeat on a regular basis. It first develops in young adults, with the NHS estimating there is around a one in 30 to one in 50 chance of a person developing the disorder at some point during their life. Though similar to bulimia, it differs because sufferers are not compelled to purge the food they have eaten. Instead many people with the condition become obese, while others attempt to limit weight gain by fasting. Most patients diagnosed with the condition are treated via psychological or psychiatric therapy, self-help programmes and support groups. Now scientists at the Lindner Center of HOPE in Ohio have identified a drug, originally approved to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, which also reduces the urge to eat. They discovered that at certain doses lisdexamfetamine dimesylate was effective. There are currently no approved drugs to treat the eating disorder. Dr Susan McElroy and her team compared the drug with placebo in 514 adults with moderate to severe binge eating disorder during a random clinical trial from May 2011 to January 2012. The medication was administered in dosages of 30, 50 or 70 mg/day or placebo. The study found the two higher doses reduced the number of days each week that people were compelled to binge eat. But the research team discovered the low dose had no effect. Their findings also indicate the percentage of patients who managed to stop binge eating for four weeks was lower with the placebo group (21.3 per cent), compared with the 50-mg/d group (42.2 per cent), and the 70-mg/d (50 per cent). Dr McElroy said: 'In the primary analysis of this study of adults with moderate to severe binge eating disorder, lisdexamfetamine dimesylate treatment with 50 and 70 mg/d, but not 30 mg/d, demonstrated a significant decrease, compared with placebo, in weekly binge eating days per week at week 11. 'Similarly, binge eating episodes decreased in the 50- and 70-mg/d treatment groups. 'The one-week binge eating episode response status was improved in the 50- and 70-mg/d treatment groups, and a greater proportion of participants achieved four-week cessation of binge eating episodes and global improvement of symptom severity with all lisdexamfetamine dosages. 'Confirmation of these findings in ongoing clinical trials may results in improved pharmacologic treatment for moderate to severe binge eating disorder.'

The first stop for the 20-year-old Stennis after leaving Bremerton on Monday is Naval Magazine Indian Island, where it is scheduled to pick up six million pounds of ammunition. That process is expected to take three days and more than 1,400 crane lifts. The Stennis returned from its last mission supporting the war in Afghanistan in May 2013 and underwent a 16-month, $240 million overhaul at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard. In 2012, the vessel was at the centre of a dispute with Iran when it left the Gulf through the Strait of Hormuz after Tehran launched a series of military exercises.

"Is this the the slowest police chase ever? A video of an Auckland man gliding away from for police in a shopping trolley has gone viral, garnering over four million views and over 115,000 likes on Facebook. The 29-second clip shows a man leaning over a trolley and rolling down Queen St in Auckland, before a police car appears to spot him and pursue him down the street with sirens blazing. A video of a man scooting away from police in a trolley cart has gone viral . Onlookers cheer the man on as he veers around the corner, with one man urging him to 'go faster brother!' The video, which is filmed on a sunny day, does not reveal who the mystery trolley rider is nor when it was filmed. New Zealand police have denounced the clip, declaring the conduct of the man could be worthy of prosecution. Auckland City district road policing manager Regan James told Stuff NZ 'The individual may think this is a joke but it is clearly a dangerous activity which puts himself and others at risk.' 'A shopping trolley travelling at speed in this way on a busy CBD road with multiple road users, including pedestrians, cyclists and motor vehicles, has the potential to cause serious injury to an adult pedestrian or, even worse, to a child', he said. 'Without information about the date this occurred, we are unable to say what the outcome of this incident was. We can, however, say a warning or even prosecution for using a vehicle carelessly could be considered.' Auckland police have denounced the clip as being reckless, claiming the man could be liable for prosecution . The video has been reposted by several prominent Facebook pages, including LAD Bible and Fortafy. It has garnered a wealth of comments from New Zealanders, such as Robert Danbury, who posted: 'Never have I been more proud to be a New Zealander.'

"The US Secret Service will . remove four senior officials while another has opted to retire . from the agency charged with protecting the president in its . latest shake-up after a series of security lapses, an agency . official said on Wednesday. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters that Acting Director Joseph Clancy ordered the four assistant . directors who oversee the agency's missions of protection, . investigations, technology and public affairs to leave their jobs. 'Four assistant directors have been notified that they're . being assigned to other positions,' the official said. Acting Secret Service Director Joseph Clancy is seen here testifying on Capitol Hill on November 19. This week Clancy told four of the highest-ranking Secret Service executives that they need to resign, retire or be reassigned as a result of a series of security mishaps . According to the Washington Post, the directors were given the option to resign, retire or request a new assignment from the Secret Service or the Department of Homeland Security within the next 30 days. They are: Mark Copanzzi, Paul Morrissey, Jane Murphy, and Dale Pupillo. The assistant director in charge of Secret Service training, . Vic Erevia, who also headed Obama's protective detail, disclosed in recent . weeks that he was retiring. 'Change is necessary to gain a fresh perspective on how we . conduct business,' Clancy said in a statement published by the . Washington Post. 'I am certain any of our senior executives will . be productive and valued assets either in other positions at the . Secret Service or the department. Still at the Secret Service is Deputy Director Alvin T. Smith, one of the agency's longest service leaders. The management changes stem from recent lapses by the agency that included a knife-carrying man jumping the fence outside the White House . in September and entering the building. It was one of the worst security breaches since . President Barack Obama took office in 2009, and it resulted in the firing of Secret Service head Julia Pierson. Clancy, a retired Secret Service agent formally assigned to Obama's personal protection detail, was brought in as her temporary replacement. Obama has yet to nominate a new director. A member of the U.S. Secret Service Uniformed Division gives a thumbs-up as he walks through snow during a storm in front of the White House on Jan. 6. Just-announced management changes at the Secret Service stem from lapses by the agency that included a knife-carrying man jumping the fence outside the White House in September and entering the building . In November, Clancy told Congress  he was seeking to establish . a culture of trust within the Secret Service after replacing Pierson, who left the agency on . Oct. 1. He also called the security breaches that landed him before the the congressional committee 'unacceptable' and 'simply inexcusable.' The high-profile demotions leave few members of Secret Service's old guard in positions of authority following a DHS audit released in December that concluded the agency was 'starved for leadership.' Clancy confirmed to the Post that the reforms came as a result of the DHS review and 'my own assessments.' Clancy said the Secret Service needs, at minimum, the 6,572 paid 'full-time equivalent' positions the White House has requested in its 2015 budget. In addition to the beginning of the 2016 presidential campaign season, he noted, the agency will be expected to protect Pope Francis when he visits the U.S. next year.","Joseph Clancy removed four assistant directors who oversee protection, investigations, technology and public affairs from their jobs .

"Seven-year-old Malachi Tyler who suffers from an incurable brain tumour has always dreamed of becoming a police officer. And now his wish has come true after the youngster was invited to join 200 recruits at a Metropolitan Police passing out parade and was even given his own handmade uniform. Malachi, from Tunbridge Wells in Kent, is blind and suffers from the genetic condition neurofibromatosis, which causes tumours to grow on his nerves. Seven-year-old Malachi Tyler takes his place alongside other officers at a police passing out parade at Hendon Police College in London . Malachi was asked to join the new recruits for the parade after always dreaming of becoming a policeman and was given his own special uniform for the occasion . He lost his eyesight shortly before his second birthday, but his parents Emma, 42 and Graham, 51, were hopeful it might return. But when they learned he was unlikely to see again, Mrs Tyler said her son was devastated he wouldn't be able to fulfil his dream of becoming a policeman. She explained: 'He's always wanted to be a policeman but when he realised he wasn't going to get his sight back he got very upset that he wouldn't fulfil his dream. 'He said ""but mum, I won't be able to arrest anybody, they will be able to get away from me"". 'When his tumour started to grow again in July we decided to give him something to look forward to and draw up a bucket list. 'Some of the things were quite funny like meet a New Zealander because he likes their accent and one was that he wanted to arrest somebody.' Malachi, pictured with his parents Emma and Graham, left, suffers from an incurable brain tumour, which has caused him to go blind . During the ceremomy, Kingston Borough Commander Glenn Tunstall told the recruits that Malachi was the bravest new officer there . A friend, who is a police officer, was then able to arrange a visit to Kingston Police Station in Surrey and organised for Malachi to 'arrest' Chief Inspector Gary Taylor and 'pepper spray' staff - albeit using water. He was then invited to the police inauguration last December but was admitted to hospital for three emergency brain operations and missed it. But luckily he recovered to attend a parade last week at Hendon Police College in Barnet, north west London. He was asked to join in with the new officers by donning his own special uniform made especially for him and then got the opportunity to help drive a police car. During the ceremony, Kingston Borough Commander Glenn Tunstall told the recruits: 'It is a real honour for me to introduce the youngest of our recruits on parade today. 'To his family he is Malachi Tyler but to us he is PC 999VK Tyler of Kingston Police Station. 'Although he is amongst good company - I would argue that Malachi is one of the bravest people here today. Malachi was asked join in with the new officers by donning his own special uniform made especially for him and then got the opportunity to help drive a police car after a visit to Kingston Police Station . Malachi, pictured with another officer, first received chemotherapy when he was just 12 months old for this condition . 'At the age of one Malachi was diagnosed as having a brain tumour, and a month before his second birthday, he lost full use of his sight. 'His positivity, his cheekiness, the constant giggles and ultimately his courage in the face of adversity humbled us all. 'In the Met one of our values is courage - which is epitomised by this little boy and his family.' Mrs Tyler added: 'It was mega emotional for me, I definitely shed a few tears but Malachi loved it. 'Uniform Services made him the little outfit - it must be the smallest one they ever made. He looked lovely in it. 'He was also allowed to drive a police car. One of the instructors used Malachi's white cane to do the pedals while he drove. 'They even got the helicopter to fly over and do a bow to him. 'All the new recruits did a whip round and raised £750 for Malachi's trust.' Malachi's tumour is inoperable but his parents hope they can prevent it growing any more. Chemotherapy, which he first received when he was just 12 months old, may eventually halt the growth of the tumours that took his eyesight.","Seven-year-old Malachi Tyler always dreamed of becoming a policeman .

"An Australian government agency has labelled the Sydney siege a terrorist attack. In positive news for businesses affected by the December attack on the Lindt chocolate cafe, Treasurer Joe Hockey today labelled the siege a 'terrorist incident' for insurance purposes. The ruling under the Terrorism Insurance Act means that insurers will not be able to refuse claims because of terrorism exclusion clauses in their policies. Scroll down for video . The Australian government has designated the Sydney siege a terrorist incident for insurance purposes. Above, survivor and barista Elly Chen flees for safety that terrifying December 15, 2014, afternoon in an iconic photograph . Closed for business: The Martin Place cafe remains closed a month since the deadly siege, where manager Tori Johnson and barrister Katrina Dawson were killed and sixteen others were held hostage by gunman Man Haron Monis . Three insurances have registered claims relating to the siege to date, according to the Australian Reinsurance Pool Corporation. Mr Hockey said he was pleased the companies did not apply terrorism exclusion policies. Today's announcement follows reports one of the hostages is seeking a 'six figure sum' to speak to media outlets. Marcia Mikhael, one of 18 hostages held prisoner by the mad gunman Man Horan Monis, is reportedly seeking a 'six figure sum' for a televised interview.

The Shahada flag: Two hostages were pictured being forced to place the black Islamic flag in the window of the Lindt cafe store . Daily Mail Australia understands several hostages have held discussions with television networks about telling their story. The Federal and State governments are both conducting a review into the siege to examine what lessons could be learned. The NSW Coroner announced this week that an inquest will be held into the siege from January 29.","Lindt cafe siege labelled a terrorist attack for insurance purposes .

"A major security flaw has been found in Android, Google's phone software. The bug could allow hackers to gain control of a device if the user is running an old version of the software. However, the search giant has come under fire for saying it will not address the issue  - which experts say could leave up almost a billion users vulnerable. Android 4.4 and 5.0, are unaffected by the latest flaw. However, around 60 percent of Android users are using 4.3 or below, and are at risk. Users of the latest Android handsets or those who have update to Android 4.4 and 5.0, are unaffected. However, around 60 percent of Android users are using 4.3 or below, and are at risk.

Android 4.4 and 5.0, are unaffected. However, around 60 percent of Android users are using 4.3 or below, and are at risk . 'If the affected version [of WebView] is before 4.4, we generally do not develop the patches ourselves, but welcome patches with the report for consideration,' said Google. 'Other than notifying OEMs, we will not be able to take action on any report that is affecting versions before 4.4 that are not accompanied with a patch.' Rapid7's Tod Beardsley discovered the security bug, and Google's response, which he described as 'some eyebrow-raising news.' WebView is used in about 930 million Android devices, Beardsley said. 'Unfortunately, this is great news for criminals for the simple reason that, for real bad guys, pretty much everything is in scop,' he said. He called for Google to take action. 'As a software developer, I know that supporting old versions of my software is a huge hassle. 'I empathize with their decision to cut legacy software loose. 'However, a billion people don't rely on old versions of my software to manage and safeguard the most personal details of their lives. Experts have called for Google to take action and fix the issue, even though it only affects users of an old version of Android. 'In that light, I'm hoping Google reconsiders if (when) the next privacy-busting vulnerability becomes public knowledge.' Beardsley told ZDNet that he learned of the policy change last October and suspects it coincided with the release of Android 5.0 Lollipop, the klatest version of Google's Android software.. 'It's important to consider that there is no published end-of-life or end-of-support policy from Google with regard to any version of Android.

"Women may spend a fortune on anti-wrinkle creams, but it seems we’re more attached to our laughter lines than we thought. A study last month, which retouched the images of 50-somethings to fade their flaws, found that all the women involved preferred pictures in which some wrinkles remained. Can this really be true? We asked three writers in their 50s to look at photos of themselves now and in their 40s, 30s and 20s, and say which they prefer... Scroll down for video . MANDY APPLEYARD . Mandy Appleyard, pictured in her 50s, was shocked by old and tired she looks but feels this is the face she deserves given the life she's lead . 50s - This is the face that i deserve! This is worse than I thought. I’m 54, but I’m shocked by how old and tired I look. I can’t really see my eyes for the wrinkles, and the huge crease around my neck makes me look as if I’ve been garrotted. But this is the face I deserve. I’ve smoked, drunk, burned the candle at both ends, sunbathed, fought off a serious disease, never taken skincare seriously and been hit by life’s slings and arrows: my face tells that story. But I have no regrets — life is to be lived in the moment. My skin may be wrinkled and tired, but I’m happy in it. Not that I’ll be posing again any time soon! 40s - Tricky years but i'm wearing well . Mandy Appleyard pictured in her 40s . The ageing that I see here is acceptable. The wrinkles are gathering round my eyes like birds round landfill and my eyes are drooping, but I’d say I’m wearing well in this photo — especially since I don’t drink water, rarely use moisturiser and don’t have facials. My 40s were tricky. A serious relationship broke down, I moved back to the UK from America after falling ill, underwent six months of chemotherapy and did a couple of jobs I hated, so I don’t feel nostalgic for that decade. But I’d be very happy if I looked like this now. 30s - A happy chapter, full of adventure . Mandy Appleyard pictured in her 30s . Now this picture I like. It’s recognisably me, with some of the creases ironed out. It makes me feel nostalgic for my 30s. I was happiest with my looks in this decade. I went to live on a boat in California with someone I’d fallen in love with, we got engaged and I fell pregnant for the first time: it was a happy chapter, full of adventure, and which promised the settled relationship and family life I had feared I’d never have. Here, my face is still young enough to be pleasing, but also has character. This was definitely my heyday. 20s - This just doesn't look like me... Mandy Appleyard pictured in her 20s . From sublime to ridiculous! This just doesn’t look like me — the familiar flaws and fine lines now as much a part of my face as my eyes and nose are gone. I was a party girl in my 20s. I worked hard as a journalist in London and Hong Kong, had several unsuitable boyfriends and worked on my suntan when I could. I was reckless — that’s what being young is about. But I wouldn’t want to go back, and I wouldn’t want to look like this. JULIA STEPHENSON . Julia Stephenson, pictured in her 50s, was horrified by this pictured, wishing she could give her face more volume, she says 'there’s nothing sadder than older women chasing their looks and youth' 50s - The worst photo I've had taken . I’m quite horrified with this most recent picture. I was getting over a bad cold, so my face was much more blotchy than usual, but this is still the worst photo I’ve ever had taken. I just wish I found it easier to put weight on so that my face would have more volume. I’ve been fairly relaxed about the passing of my youth — I was a plain child and adolescent, so I’ve never depended on looks. Losing them isn’t a big deal. I don’t bother too much with creams and I hate facials — there’s nothing sadder than older women chasing their looks and youth. 40s - Face of experience, and character . Julia Stephenson pictured in her 40s . I don’t look so bad in this picture and appear to be holding up reasonably well. My 40s were a wonderful time, when I started to come into my own. I’d settled down with my long-term boyfriend and home life was very happy for the first time in decades. I was also having some success as an author and doing charity work with animals and the environment. I had a column in a national newspaper and twice stood as an MP for the Green Party. I started to have more confidence and felt like I was living life to the full. All of that shows in this face. This is the face of a woman with experience and character. 30s - I spent half of this decade celibate . Julia Stephenson pictured in her 30s . This is a nice picture, but my 30s were tumultuous. My love life was a mess and I was constantly falling for unsuitable men — the man I thought was the love of my life never consummated our relationship, and I later found out he was gay, so I spent half the decade celibate. What a waste. I wasn’t happy and was always travelling — a way of running away and not facing up to things. I was constantly embarking on strange diets and going on pointless, expensive spiritual retreats and courses in an attempt to ‘find myself’. So, I don’t miss my 30s — although I would be very happy to have this face back! 20s - Pretty, but i hated being looked at . Julia Stephenson pictured in her 20s . This is pretty, but lacks the character of the later pictures. I have no desire to return to this unhappy and frustrating decade, when I hadn’t found what I wanted to do in life. I settled down with my first boyfriend at 22, married him at 26 and divorced him at 28. In retrospect, I should have lived a bit before settling down. I didn’t even appreciate being pretty. I resented being constantly looked at. These days, if anyone looks twice I’m delighted! TESSA CUNNINGHAM . Tessa Cunningham, pictured in her 50s, was shocked by the toll time, unhappiness and illness had taken on her face . 50s - What a shock, but this really is me . I’m so stunned upon seeing this photo, I tell myself there has been some ghastly mistake. It has obviously been digitally aged by ten years. But this careworn crone really is me. Although my beauty regime was hit-and-miss when I was young and I’ve occasionally used sunbeds, since I hit 40 I have taken great care of my skin. I slather on factor 50, have facials, have never smoked and don’t drink to excess. So, what’s gone wrong? I can only put it down to stress and having very pale skin. And the awful truth is that it’s now too late to turn back the clock. 40s - Started on a high but it all fell apart . Tessa Cunningham pictured in her 40s . I love this photo. It’s how I think I still look — a confident woman, comfortable in her (slightly dewy) skin. That’s how I was ten years ago. I started the decade on a high — I had a new husband and two children and was bursting with health. Then, at 48, I was diagnosed with breast cancer. I embarked on surgery, followed by six months of gruelling chemotherapy and radiotherapy. My marriage fell apart — we divorced when I was 51. I was probably the most unhappy I’ve ever been. I didn’t realise it would catch up with me so visibly. 30s - Life was still full of possibilities . Tessa Cunningham pictured in her 30s . This was the decade when everything came together. I got my first job on a national newspaper, married at 31 and, a year later, had my first baby. My second daughter was born when I was 34. I adored being a mum, and all of life’s problems (I divorced my first husband when I was 37) still lay in the future. No wonder I’m free of worry lines here. But I wouldn’t want to step back to this decade, knowing what lay ahead. Nevertheless, it’s good to be reminded of a period when life was full of so many possibilities — and so little stress. 20s - I wish I'd realised how lucky i was . Tessa Cunningham pictured in her 20s . This photo makes me so cross. If I could step back in time, I would give myself a good slap. As I look at this young, attractive woman I wish she’d realised how fortunate she was. I had so much going for me, yet I squandered this wonderful decade. Eager to find ‘The One’, I threw myself into a series of bad relationships. I wish I had treasured things that mattered — friends and my parents, who are sadly now dead.","Recent studies show that women are more attached to their wrinkles than even they may realise .

"A woman was saved from death by her coffee table after a disused central heating boiler exploded at her home. The explosion ripped through Susan Woods' Mansfield semi-detached home, turning her possessions into a pile of rubble and causing fragments and bricks to hit her and pierce one of her eyes. The 54-year-old said she was told by firefighters she could have been chopped in half by the force of the blast but was probably saved by the coffee table in front of the fire, which shielded her from some of the explosion. Scroll down for video . Susan Woods (top right) was saved from being chopped in half by her coffee table after a disused central heating boiler exploded at her home like a bomb, causing rubble and mortar to fly through the air . The fireplace in the Mansfield semi-detached home has been turned into a pile of bricks and rubble . 'It's a wonder I am still here,' she said. 'I was just sitting in the front room on the settee in front of the fire with my sister having a coffee and all of a sudden it was like a bomb had gone off. 'It was terrifying - I didn't know what had happened. 'I blanked for a bit and then started shouting for my sister.' Firefighters said an old central heating boiler caused the explosion and Mrs Woods could have been killed . Mrs Woods was left with bruises and was hit in the eye by flying mortar and debris after the explosion . Mrs Woods was X-rayed for potential damage to her pelvis and chest but luckily escaped any serious injury. Her sister was not injured. Mrs Woods likened the explosion to a bomb going off and said it had caused structural damage to the house. The care worker is now terrified to go into the living room where the explosion took place, and see the devastated remains of with its dented wall, piles of rubble and fragments of mortar littered across the floor. The fireplace has been turned into a pile of bricks and cupboard doors have been thrown around the room. She describes the explosion as like a bomb going off and is too scared to return to the living room . Flying debris caused severe damage to the walls, leaving them scorched and with dents and holes in . She added: 'A fireman said if it hadn't been for the coffee table in front of the fire protecting me I could have been chopped in half. 'I have been so unnerved by this, I want to move out as soon as possible. Someone dropped a leaflet through the door this morning and it terrified me.' Her husband Malcolm Woods said he lit their Rayburn fire, which uses solid fuel, at about 2.15pm and an hour later the boiler exploded. Mrs Woods and her husband Malcolm (right) had only lived at the Mansfield property for ten weeks . Firefighters said Mrs Woods' coffee table probably saved her from being cut in half by the force of the blast . Rubble covers furniture in the living room after the powerful blast, which caused structural damage . The walls have been damaged and pitted with holes by flying mortar following the large boiler explosion . The fire is believed to have been in front of an old disused back boiler, which used to be used to heat home and contained water which would heat up as the fire did. These boilers can explode if they are left unused and empty. Usually residual moisture left in the boiler turns to steam and as the back boiler gets heated pressure builds up and it gets extremely hot because it is empty, and then explodes. Mr Woods said: 'Sue was screaming and shouting - I managed to break through the door and get them both out - it all happened so quickly. Solid fuel back boilers consist of a fire grate which has material for lighting the fire, like coal. A jacket containing water is usually behind the fire, and heats up as the main fireplace does. However when boilers are sealed off or not used any more some water will remain and will eventually be heated to form steam - creating pressure. Because of the lack of water the jacket becomes extremely hot - sometimes up to 700 degrees Centigrade - and as internal pressure builds up it can explode. Many boilers have been sealed off after people switched to gas or oil fired systems with remote controlled central heating. In the last five years three people have been injured by back boiler explosions and one died. 'The fire service told us the explosion was probably down to the old back boiler having no water in it.' He said they were told the fire had been used by previous tenants and was safe to use and they had only lit for some extra warmth. The couple had only lived at the privately rented property for 10 weeks before the explosion took place at about 3pm on January 9. Fire crews from Mansfield, Edwinstone and a specialist rescue team from Tuxford attended the scene, along with a gas engineer. The damaged property and a neighbour's house were made safe by firefighters. Structural engineers from Nerwark and Sherwood District Council have propped up the chimney breast. A spokesman for Nottinghamshire Fire service said: 'We would urge anyone who believes they may have a disused solid fuel back boiler in their home to seek professional advice about the appropriate protection or venting of the system, or having it removed completely.'","Susan Woods was having a coffee with her sister in her Mansfield home .

"Internet users say the Russian Postal service's new uniform is far from a first-class look, claiming that it resembles the clothing worn by Nazi SS soldiers. Images of the uniforms were uploaded to Twitter on Tuesday, with many users drawing comparisons between them and the foreboding outfits that Hitler's feared SS squadron members wore. Both uniforms appear to share the same dark colouring and angular badges and braiding on the lapel and cuffs. Scroll down for video . Critcism: The Russian Post service has come under fire for issuing new uniforms (left) that some say resemble Nazi SS clothing (right) A Twitter profile called raging.me said the postal uniforms 'sure look familiar to something fascist'. However, Vadim Nosov, a spokesman for Russian Post, strenuously denied that the uniforms look the same, claiming that internet users had deliberately darkened the photos of the postal uniforms. According to The Moscow Times, he told the RIA Novosti news agency: 'The uniform of postal management staff is dark blue, [but] office staff wear a lighter colour. The uniforms in the photographs distributed online have simply been retouched to look black.' He added that the design takes its inspiration from army uniforms that date back to the rule of Peter the Great, the Emperor of Russia between 1721 and 1725. A spokesman for Russian Post strenuously denied that the uniforms look the same claiming that internet users had deliberately darkened the photos of the postal uniforms . A portrait of Nazi SS chief Heinrich Himmler, dressed in his uniform . Last year Russian president Vladimir Putin defended Stalin's deal with Hitler to divide up Poland in 1939 because the Poles did the same thing with the Czech Republic in 1938. He said it was important that Russian academics were involved in attempts to re-write the history of the 20th century so the impact of the Soviet Union was not forgotten. Putin said: 'We had the so-called Munich Agreement in 1938. And what is it? The West hushed it up. 'Chamberlain arrived, shook his paper and said, 'I brought you peace' when he returned to London after the talks. To which Churchill, I believe, in private, stated, 'Well, now the war is inevitable.' 'Because appeasement of the aggressor, which Nazi Germany was, would clearly lead to a major future military conflict, and some people understood that. There should be a deep multilateral study of what was happening before World War II.' Putin attempted to claim there was a difference between the Munich Agreement and the non-aggression deal between the Soviet Union and Germany. He said: 'For example, there are still arguments about the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact, and the Soviet Union is blamed for dividing Poland. But what did Poland itself do, when the Germans invaded Czechoslovakia? It took part of Czechoslovakia. It did this itself. And then, in turn, the same thing happened to Poland. 'I do not want to blame anyone here, but serious studies should show that these were the foreign policy methods at the time. The Soviet Union signed a non-aggression agreement with Germany. They say, 'Oh, how bad.' But what is so bad about it, if the Soviet Union did not want to fight? What is so bad?' He also said it was necessary to compare the 25 million victims in the Soviet Union to the combined allied losses.","Twitter users claimed Russian postal uniforms resembled SS uniforms .

"Tempers flared this morning at the Tampa funeral of Phoebe Jonchuck, the five-year-old girl thrown to her death from a Florida bridge by her father last week. While Pastor Bren Byerman preached forgiveness, some of the 100 or so mourners at the Lake Magdeline United Methodist Church struggled to keep their anger towards John Jonchuck in check. It was too much for one man who was asked to leave the 10am service when he interrupted, shouting out angrily and threatening Jonchuck, who is in police custody. Pain: Michelle Kerr, mother of Phoebe Jonchuck, wipes her eyes as she leaves the church after memorial services for 5-year-old Phoebe Jonchuck at Lake Magdalene Methodist Church in Tampa on Wednesday .

Despite the understandable emotion, Phoebe's mother insisted mourners wear bright and vivid rainbow colors to the funeral and Pastor Byerman pleaded for her friends and family to forgive Jonchuck. The tiny casket for the little girl was decked in pink tulle and flowers and her favorite baby toy doll and her most treasured stuffed animal were put inside. Phoebe's mother, Michelle Kerr, wore a multi-colored maxi dress and was clearly overcome with the emotion of the sad occasion. Her grandmother, Michelle Jonchuck, who has said she wished her son killed himself instead of Phoebe said of her 'angel princess' - 'Every time I see a rainbow, I will think of you'. 'I love you. You are so sweet,' she said according to WFLA.

Friend of the family: Attorney Genevieve Torres leaves the church after the funeral at Lake Magdalene Methodist Church in Tampa on Wednesday. Torres, said Jonchuck had called her 'God' and asked her to translate a Bible in Swedish the day before he killed Phoebe . Pastor Byerman addressed the question no one can answer - just why her 25-year-old father would throw his daughter 62-feet to her death from the Dick Misener Bridge in St. Petersburg? She was found dead around a mile downstream one hour after. While he remains arrested and jailed on a first-degree murder charge, Byerman said, 'When we try and wrestle with the whys, some people will say maybe it was God's will. At this time I can't believe quite that,' he said according to the Tampa Bay Tribune. 'There needs to be a lot of forgiveness here today. 'Not only forgiveness for the person who took Phoebe's life, but also for ourselves.' So small: The casket of Phoebe Jonchuck is carried out after memorial services at Lake Magdalene Methodist Church in Tampa on Wednesday . Final journey: The hearse leaves after memorial services for 5-year-old Phoebe Jonchuck after an emotional funeral service on Wednesday . In a touching gesture, in the middle of the funeral the congregation blew out a kiss when they heard Phoebe's name. The mourners sang 'You are My Sunshine' and 'Jesus Loves me' while after the service her grandmother spoke to reporters holding her other favorite toy doll, Lucy. 'She loved rainbows and butterflies, puppies and cats,' said Michele Jonchuck. 'She was happy and always wanted to be a dancer. She loved arts and crafts. There aren't enough words to describe how this child brought so much happiness to people.' Asked to talk about her son, Michelle said that she fears her son will never be able to explain what he did. Horror: John Jonchuck is accused of throwing his daughter of the Dick Misener Bridge (right) in St. Petersburg last Thursday . Tribute: A memorial has been set up in honor of the late Phoebe Jonchuck, 5, on the south side of the Dick Misener Bridge near the north end toll booths of the Sunshine Skyway Bridge . Fury: Phoebe's grandmother, Michelle Jonchuck said last week that she wished her son had killed himself instead of his little girl . 'The child loved her daddy,' she said. 'And her daddy was never mean to her. He adored her. Why he did it is a question that maybe one day will be answered, or it never will.' 'Obviously, there was something that snapped,' she added according to People. 'I have to forgive him, because I'll never go to heaven if I don't forgive him. I'm not happy with him. Everybody has to forgive each other's trespasses. I never imagined that this would happen.' The Blount & Curry Funeral Home in Carrollwood covered the costs of the funeral and Phoebe was buried soon after. 'Phoebe did have a good life,' said Michelle. 'She's an angel up there, and she'll never leave us.'","Service for Phoebe Jonchuck held in Tampa, Florida on Wednesday .

"Demonstrators said they are dealing with the sexual assault of a woman internally after she was attacked by a man in her tent in the early hours of the morning. It is the second alleged sexual assault at the camp, which organisers have warned is attracting prisoners straight out of Rikers, but have refused to call police. The woman was in her tent at around 6am yesterday when the man burst into her tent and attacked her. Problem camp: The protesters have said that they will handle the sexual assault internally rather than call in police . Actress Joan Rivers has highlighted the lack of gay protesters at Occupy Wall Street and told all the demonstrators to ‘get jobs and go back to work’. The LGBT advocate said gay men have ‘better bodies on the whole’ and care more about their appearance. ‘Very seldom will you find a gay schlep,’ she told New York Magazine. ‘This is why there are no gay protestors in Zuccotti Park. Because there’s no place to change and no closets.’ Other critics have also pointed out the lack of minority groups appearing at the protests. Fellow protesters surrounded the man and . shone flashlights in his face before chasing him out of Zuccotti park . where they are staying. 'We don't tell anyone, we handle it internally,' a protester told the New York Post, adding that another woman was raped weeks earlier. She said that fellow protesters were 'yelling at him to leave,' shouting 'pervert, pervert, get the f**k out.' Organisers have raised concerns that the camp is becoming a refuge for homeless people and is attracting convicts fresh out of Rikers prison. Not so fun: Three protesters have been taken to hospital with cold related ailments . Arrivals: The camp is said to be attracting former prisoners straight out of Rikers Jail . Cold: The protesters, who were drenched by snow and rain over the weekend, are reportedly 'in need of emergency supplies' Pat Buchanan today warned the Occupy Wall Street protest is 'going to end very, very badly with these folks in the winter'. Speaking on 'The McLaughlin Group' he said that he expects the demonstrations to become violent as the weather gets worse. 'They’re not going to be getting publicity and they’re going to be acting up and acting badly like the worst of the demonstrators in the ’60s,' said the former senior adviser to presidents Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford and Ronald Reagan. 'They’re going to start fighting with the cops.' 'They're telling people who leave prison . to go to Zuccotti park, ' Daniel Zetah, leader of the Occupy Wall . Street community-relations group told the newspaper. The . newly-released criminals are thought be attracted by the free . accommodation and food, and reported alcohol and drug-fuelled parties . taking place at the site. 'There's a lot of drugs, alcohol, assault [and] theft [by] the homeless groups coming in. We've had meetings all day to brainstorm what to do,' Mr Zetah said. The cold weather is continuing to plague the protesters, who have had their gas-powered generators confiscated by fire department as they are seen as a safety risk. Organisers have put out an 'urgent' alert on their website asking for waterproof boots, hats and gloves. The protesters, who were drenched by snow and rain over the weekend, are reportedly 'in need of emergency supplies crucial for cold weather survival'. They also want cots so that . demonstrators can get off the ground and are looking for thermal heaters . after the generators were taken. Three protesters have been taken to hospital with cold-related ailments. Some protesters say they will defiantly remain, no matter how bad the weather gets though.

So far around $50,000 has been spent on clothing, food and medical supplies.

"As many as 1,000 trees were destroyed by the snow storm in Central Park it was revealed as three million homes without electricity were warned the blackout could last for a week. Park officials said that the unprecedented damage spread across half of the park's 840 acres was the worst they had seen in 27 years after a record 2.9 inches of snow fell on Saturday. Even though the storm was relatively mild in compared to those in the midst of winter, the massive damage is thought to have been caused by leaves still on the trees keeping snow weighing down on branches. 'It's like a bomb blew off,' Central Park Conservancy president Douglas Blonsky told the New York Times. 'Boom.' Scroll down for video . Unprecedented: Central Park received 2.9 inches of snow Saturday, the most ever recorded in the month of October since snowfall records were first kept in 1869 . The milder temperatures, which stayed close to freezing, but not well below, meant that the snow was damper and heavier, meaning that it brought extra pressure on the trees. In the park trees of all ages and sizes were among the nearly 1,000 felled by the early snow storm. By comparison only 125 trees were destroyed when Tropical Storm Irene passed through in August. Saturday was only the fourth snowy October day in New York's Central Park since record-keeping began 135 years ago. Across the road at one of New York's most luxurious hotels, The Plaza, all the trees were destroyed. Downed: The massive damage is thought to have been caused by leaves still on the trees keeping snow weighing down on branches . Stripped: All the trees at New York's luxurious Plaza hotel, opposite Central Park, were destroyed . Damage: In the park trees of all ages and sizes were among the nearly 1,000 felled by the early snow storm . City officials reported that they had . received more than 2,000 calls reporting tree damage by late afternoon . on Sunday, with about half coming from Staten Island , and a quarter the . Bronx. 'We've never . seen a storm like this in October, when the trees are still mostly in . full leaf,' Adrian Benepe, commissioner of the city's parks department . told the New York Times. 'I've never seen such widespread damage.' On Sunday night, an advisory to be cautious when entering Central Park remained in effect. 'Heavy wet snow and strong winds, combined with full leaves on trees has damaged trees in the Park, creating an elevated and ongoing danger of falling branches and trees,' park users were told. 'Conservancy crews are working to address the damage, and Central Park is open, but some dangerous conditions may persist.' Mess: A thousand trees were destroyed in Central Park compared to only 125 trees were destroyed when Tropical Storm Irene passed through in August . Records: Saturday was only the fourth snowy October day in New York's Central Park since record-keeping began 135 years ago . Alert: City officials reported that they had received more than 2,000 calls reporting tree damage by late afternoon on Sunday . The number of homes and businesses without power on the East Coast has grown to more than 3 million. From Maryland to Maine, officials said it would take days to restore electricity, even though the snow ended on Sunday. The storm smashed record snowfall totals for October and worsened as it moved north. Communities in western Massachusetts . were among the hardest hit. Snowfall totals topped 27 inches in . Plainfield, and nearby Windsor had gotten 26 inches by early Sunday. It was blamed for at least 11 deaths, . and states of emergency were declared in New Jersey, Connecticut, . Massachusetts and parts of New York. More . than 800,000 power customers were without electricity in Connecticut . alone — shattering the record set just two months ago by Hurricane . Irene. Massachusetts had more than 600,000 outages, and so did New . Jersey - including Gov. Chris Christie's house. White out: A jogger makes his way through Central Park as the snow fell on Saturday . Crushed: A tree fallen on a car in Massachusetts where snowfall totals reached up to 27 inches . Warning: states of emergency were declared in New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts and parts of New York . Parts of Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, New York, Maine, Maryland and Vermont also were without power. 'It's going to be a more difficult . situation than we experienced in Irene,' Connecticut Gov. Dannel P. Malloy said. 'We are expecting extensive and long-term power outages.' Thirty-two shelters were open around . the state, and Malloy asked volunteer fire departments to allow people . in for warmth and showers. At least four hospitals were relying on . generators for power. Around Newtown in western . Connecticut, trees were so laden with snow on some back roads that the . branches touched the street. Every few minutes, a snap filled the air as . one broke and tumbled down. Roads that were plowed became impassible . because the trees were falling so fast. Many of the areas hit by the storm had also been hit by Irene. Vaccaro, the weather service spokesman, said the snowstorm 'absolutely crushed previous records that in some cases dated back more than 100 years.' Work: Jay Ericson clears snow of branches weighing down on power lines at his home following a snow storm a day earlier in Glastonbury, Connecticut . Danger: A downed tree limb lies across power lines in Belmont, Massachusetts . Accident: A jeep drives around a downed tree while another sits in a ditch on Union Valley Road, West Milford, New Jersey . There usually isn't enough cold air . in the region to support a nor'easter this time of year, but an area of . high pressure over southeastern Canada funneled cold air south into the . U.S., Vaccaro said. That cold air combined with moisture coming from the North Carolina coast to produce the unseasonable weather. A few businesses enjoyed the early snow - ski resorts in Vermont and Maine opened early. But it was more commonly an aggravation. Many residents were urged to avoid travel altogether. Speed limits were reduced on bridges between New Jersey and Pennsylvania. A few roads closed because of accidents and downed trees and power lines, said Sean Brown, a spokesman for the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation. Five people died in Pennsylvania because of the storm, two each in car accidents in suburban Philadelphia. Fallen: A tree split in half blocks a street after a snowstorm in Windsor, Connecticut . AWOL: A car that went off the road sits abandoned on Interstate 91 in Bernardston, Massachusetts . An 84-year-old Temple man was killed Saturday when a snow-laden tree fell on his home while he was napping in his recliner. Storm-related traffic accidents also killed people in Connecticut, New York, New Jersey and the Canadian province of Prince Edward Island. A New Jersey man died Saturday in a house fire sparked by a downed power line, and a man in Springfield, Mass., was electrocuted by downed wires.

"The NSA has revealed that there were at least a dozen employees who used the agency's spying capabilities to secretly eavesdrop on their romantic partners. The specific cases of employees listening in to their lovers' phone calls come as the investigation into widespread wiretapping and email surveillance by the National Security Agency is examined following the release of classified documents by Edward Snowden. The names of the federal employees who allegedly ordered these wire taps have not been revealed and six cases have been brought to the Justice Department for evaluation but it seems that none have resulted in criminal prosecution. Renewed criticism? Revelations about Moalin et al could renew controversy over NSA spying on U.S. citizens and residents and the way data it collects is used . The inspector general of the NSA, George Ellard, sent a letter to Senator Chuck Grassley saying that there were 12 employees who admitted to participating in 'Loveint', the official name for Love Intelligence'. One of the most egregious instances came when a male intelligence employee who lived and worked abroad used data collection tools to listen to the phone conversations of nine women living outside of the U.S. The investigation into this man's habits came when one of the women he was having a sexual relationship with suspected that he was listening to her phone conversations. That woman happened to be foreign-born but working for the American government, so she raised the alarm to one of her federal co-workers. CNN reports that a different male employee said that he searched for information connected to his phone number and that of his girlfriend 'out of curiosity'. The whole truth: NSA Director General Keith Alexander testified on Capitol Hill on Thursday as part of an ongoing investigation into widespread abuses of power at his agency . He didn't have the credentials to listen to actual conversations but he looked at the various calls made to and from those numbers. NBC reports that another man said that he used NSA resources on his first day of work to view emails from his girlfriend's six different addresses but claimed that he did so because he wanted to 'practice on the system'. Male employees were not the only ones to abuse the system, as one married woman in 2004 admitted that she used the tools to see if her husband was cheating on her after she saw an unknown foreign number in his call log. There have been no specific firings that came in connection to these cases, though the wife who admitted to looking into her husband resigned before she could be formally dismissed. Others- like one man who admitted to participating in Loveint during a polygraph exam- faced demotions in pay or rank or recommendations against granting them certain security clearances.","Investigation into abuses of power at the NSA shows that at least a dozen employees tracked their romantic interests phone calls and emails .

"Awards season is underway in Hollywood, but one show will roll out green turf instead of red carpet and celebrate achievements like best mutt instead of best actor. At the inaugural World Dog Awards hosted by comedian George Lopez, dogs will walk in on artificial grass and wag out with golden fire hydrant statuettes honoring the best in entertainment and social media. There are no long speeches or fashion critics at the show airing Thursday on the CW Network. At this event, the podium is packed with dog treats, patches of grass allow pets to do their business and signs call for barking instead of applause. Plus, pooches lounge on couches and sniff out swag bags boasting pet food, collars and toys. Front-row seat: Duke, a seven-year-old Great Pyrenees who was elected mayor In Cormorant, Minnesota, lounges on a couch during the 2015 World Dog Awards at the Barker Hanger in Santa Monica on Saturday .

She was accompanied by her Pomeranian dogs, Prince Hilton (right) and her newest pup Princess Paris Jr (left) Dog lovers: Miss Hilton joined former NFL player Terrill Owens and other nominees on the stage at the  2015 World Dog Awards . The World Dog Awards are the latest in a series of canine kudos weaving their way into Hollywood's human awards landscape. The Pawscars gives accolades to animals in film roles, including a tarantula that won best supporting arachnid a few years ago for appearing in 'Salt' with Angelina Jolie. Voting is open for the show, scheduled to air March 4. The Golden Collar Awards made their online debut in 2012, giving the top nod to a Jack Russell terrier named Uggie for his star turn in 'The Artist.' After a two-year hiatus, the show returns Oct. 4 and is open only to adopted shelter dogs that have appeared online or in TV, movies or commercials. The World Dog Awards are different than other shows, executive producer Robert Horowitz said. Feline fine: Audience member  Karen McGill, with Bagel The Sunglass Cat, pictured walking along the stage . Wild thing: Eric Felland with his seven-year-old boxer Hanzo, the samurai surfing dog who was nominated as the most talented extreme-sports dog . 'You have seen Westminster, you have seen dogs honored for their service and to promote adoption, but not a show that focuses on how important they are in everyday life,' he said. Fans voted online for the winners of most categories before the show's filming on January 10. They chose Most Pawpular Dog, for the most influential pooch on social media; Happiest Reunion, for the most inspiring videotaped reunion between a returning military member and a dog; and even Most Dog-Like Cat. In one of the most heated contests, colleges' competed for best team mascot. The contenders are Smokey the bluetick coonhound from the University of Tennessee; Jonathan the husky from the University of Connecticut; Hairy Dawg the bulldog from the University of Georgia; T-Bone the Irish setter from Pace University; and Bully the bulldog from Mississippi State.

Scooby-Doo, the titular animated Great Dane who's been investigating mysteries for decades, is receiving a lifetime achievement award, given to an iconic dog character in popular culture. Warner Bros. created a custom animated segment, allowing Scooby-Doo to 'accept' his award from 'NCIS' actress Pauley Perrette. Dogs receiving star treatment at the show got to bring a plus-one — a person to handle the other end of the leash, Horowitz said. Organizers expected about 100 dogs and 1,000 people to attend.

"A Harley Street plastic surgeon could be struck off after he was found guilty of teaching nurses how to administer Botox to patients illegally. Dr Mark Harrison charged the nurses £400 a day for the training courses at his central London clinic, during which he told them they should give Botox to patients without a prescription. After being exposed by an undercover investigation, the 51-year-old surgeon denied wrongdoing, but he has now been found guilty of encouraging the nurses to break the law. Scroll down for video . Guilty: Surgeon Mark Harrison, pictured appearing in a promotional video, told nurses to use Botox prescriptions on multiple patients . Botox can only legally be administered by a doctor, to a patient with a valid prescription - but a loophole in the law allowed Harrison to authorise nurses to perform the procedure simply by speaking to them on his mobile. He charged £30 for each 'consultation' - and offered a day-long training course at his practice, Harley Aesthetics, to prepare nurses who want to administer Botox, which makes the skin smoother and is commonly used as an anti-wrinkle treatment. In 2012, a BBC journalist went undercover posing as a trainee nurse to film the doctor secretly during one of his 'Introduction to Botox' courses. Harrison, who lives in a £4million Kensington townhouse, apparently told nurses to use Botox on one patient even though it was prescribed for someone else, and encouraged them to ignore a patient's medical history. He was filmed telling the nurses: 'Strictly speaking a vial with a patient name on should only be used on that patient. We use it on a number of people. Is it ever an issue? No. 'It is not legal, but it's what everybody does... doctors, professors, me. Just order a vial in your name - it's not policed at all.' Prescription: The doctor spoke to nurses on the phone and authorised them to administer Botox to patients . In the recording, he also suggested that if nurses could not contact him before administering Botox they should go ahead with the procedure nonetheless and he would authorise it afterwards. At a Fitness to Practice hearing in Manchester, a disciplinary panel rejected claims that Harrison had been a victim of 'entrapment' by the BBC investigation. He was also found guilty of making dishonest and misleading statements to an preliminary hearing of the General Medical Council, but cleared of other misconduct charges including a claim that he encouraged nurses to top up Botox with saline solution. At a previous hearing, Harrison said: 'I can understand that on a busy ward with lots of different vials and lots of different patients, to use vials between patients would be dangerous. It would be unacceptable. 'However, in the context of Botox where you have a single practitioner administering a single medication to one patient at a time, I would contend that that is not dangerous, but I have not been accused of doing it.' Clinic: Harrison practiced from this address in Harley Street, where the courses were held . But finding him guilty, the panel said: 'Dr Harrison, during the Botox course, encouraged attendees to order Botox in the name of patients for whom it was not intended to be used. Dr Harrison, on several occasions, encouraged this practice.' He now faces further hearings to decide whether his fitness to practise medicine is impaired. Harley Aesthetics was one of the UK's largest providers of Botox, offering a range of treatments starting from £200. Harrison built up a network of hundreds of nurses who would call his mobile whenever they wanted authorisation to inject a patient with Botox. In the wake of the investigation into his practice, the General Medical Council has banned doctors from remotely prescribing cosmetic injections such as Botox, meaning they must hold a face-to-face consultation with the patient.","Mark Harrison, 51, ran the Harley Aesthetics clinic in central London .

"Two brave police officers doubled snake catchers when they were called to a four-storey unit block in Sydney's south. A terrified resident raised the alarm when they spotted a large Darwin carpet python slithering along their window on Chapel Street at Rockdale. One of the officers was trained by Australian wildlife rescue organisation WIRES and luckily had his snake catching equipment with him. But the policeman did not walk away unscathed after the snake bit him while he was trying to wrangle it. Scroll down for video . Two constables captured a snake at a fourth-storey unit in Rockdale - in Sydney's south . When the police arrived about 10.30pm on Friday, the grey snake had wedged himself between the fly screen and the window of the unit. As the WIRES-trained officer got his tools and started working on capturing the snake, his colleague held onto a net, ready to trap it. At one point, the net-wielding policeman asked his partner - who was trying to pry the snake away from the window with a hook - what the snake felt like. The snake-catching officer asked his colleague if he wanted to touch it. This was met with an emphatic 'No'. One of the officers, from NSW's St George Local Area Command, was a snake catcher who was trained by WIRES . The officers were identified on the NSW Police's St George Local Area Command Facebook as Constables Pritchard and Dawkins . The officers were identified on the NSW Police's St George Local Area Command Facebook as Constables Pritchard and Dawkins. But it proved to be a trickier task than initially thought as the creature was 'very strong' and refused to let go of the window's edge. Eventually, the snake lets go but not before it was able to sink its teeth into the constable. But a NSW Police spokesman told Daily Mail Australia no one was seriously injured during the process.","NSW Police officers were called to Rockdale - in Sydney's south - on Friday .

"A first glimpse of Skye always stirs the soul. It doesn’t matter whether you are Bonnie Prince Charlie being rowed over the sea by Flora MacDonald, a present-day passenger on the ferry from Mallaig, or a driver on the arched bridge that carries the A87 over the Kyle of Lochalsh. We had taken the latter option. As we left the Scottish mainland behind, that swarthy mountain range Black Cuillin rose ahead, a range of russet and mauve crowned by sawtooth ridges – a siren call to anybody who loves hiking in Britain’s wildest extremities. At the very edge of it all: Skye is an example of the UK at its most wild and gloriously rugged . That includes my wife Hennie and me. We had scheduled four days to dip in and out of the Skye Trail – an 80-mile walking route between the tail and the right pincer of this lobster-shaped island. Better still, we had parked in Broadford, at the Isle’s eastern edge – leaving Macs Adventure to take the strain. This Glasgow-based hiking specialist would drop us wherever we needed to be, collect us if necessary, and drive our bags between the hotels they had booked for us. An ideal way to squeeze the best out of the trail. With just dry clothes and sandwiches in our day packs, we set out from the remote settlement of Elgol, with its tiny quay. The precarious coastal path around the headland of Rubha na h-Airigh Baine was an instant wonder, showcasing views across the wind-harassed Loch Scavaig to the Isle of Soay. Seals bobbed in the Hebridean swell, while quarrelsome gulls screeched above us. Eventually we reached Camasunary Bay, a wave-pounded beach of grey pebbles strewn with driftwood and crab husks. Here, the pink-tinged granite Cuillin rises 3,000 feet out of the sea in majestic fashion . Our next section of the trail was Glen Sligachan, following an ancient track through expanses of bog, heather and shimmering lochs the colour of whisky. Munching our sandwiches atop a huge boulder next to a chattering burn, we watched white lines of water pouring down from the heights. Red deer patrolled the lower slopes, and I still maintain that the speck wheeling in the distance was a golden eagle (Hennie remains sceptical). Best feet forward: The Skye Trail runs for 80 miles across this most dramatic of islands . We agreed, however, that the Sligachan Hotel – which sits next to an old stone bridge at the head of the glen – is a gem. Sepia images of tweed-clad mountaineers adorn the walls, and there is still an old-fashioned feel to the place. It would be hard to imagine a more inspiring location. We watched a fine sunset from the adjacent Seumas Bar – in the company of hikers, campers and a ‘library’ of 300 malt whiskies. For all its rousing beauty, the landscape is speckled with reminders that Skye has seen cruel times – the roofless ruins of crofts left when the Highlands aristocracy evicted small-scale famers from their land to make way for sheep during the 19th century ‘Clearances’. We pondered this brutal piece of history while admiring the scenic drama of Lake Sligachan. 'Aye, we are proud of our heritage. But there is still resentment about the clearances, if you ask the Gaelic-speaking old folk,' said Gus McFarlane, our taxi driver. We were on our way to Portree, the port from which thousands of evictees left for America and Australia. Nowadays Skye’s largest town is a tourist hub, with shops selling hiking gear and hand-spun knitwear. Hotels, restaurants and pastel-painted pubs line the horseshoe harbour. We strolled along the quayside, appetites sharpened after all the walking. Skye taps its natural larder superbly. I asked as to when the island’s famously silky oysters are in season. “Any month with an R in it,” came the reply from our beaming waitress – who, according to her name badge, was called ""Fionninghua"". Just wonderful: Skye's Black Cuillin range throws its reflection into the waters of Loch nan Eilean . 'That includes Mary, Juner, Jurly and Augrust,' she added. We sucked on langoustines with hard shiny shells, landed just yards away, then tucked into braised lamb with asparagus and celery, everything locally grown. Our final day’s walking was over the craggy escarpment of Craig Ulatota, on the north-east coast. The still more remote Isle of Raasay was in constant view as we neared the Old Man of Storr – a remarkable outcrop of crumbling basalt. On our final evening, we sat by the sea, watching surf turn to smoke as waves battered otherworldly shapes sculpted by the elements over the centuries. These rock stars provide just our sort of nightlife, we decided. A five-night hiking break, taken between March and October, costs from £410 per person with Macs Adventure (0141 530 1950, www.macsadventure.com). The price includes accommodation with breakfast in hotels and guesthouses, baggage transfers, taxis, maps and emergency back-up.","This fabled island of dramatic scenery sits in the north-west of Scotland .

"This is the moment a mysterious flying object was caught on camera as it hovered in the night sky. Footage of the UFO - a dome-shaped object with pulsating lights - was taken from outside a home in Tynemouth, North Tyneside. Craig Lowther, a venture capitalist, said he was letting his dog into the garden at about 11.30pm on Monday when he spotted the unidentified object hanging in the distance. Scroll down for video . Mysterious: This flying object was caught on camera as it hovered in the night sky over Tynemouth . Pulsating: Craig Lowther spotted the UFO as he was letting his dog out into the back garden on Monday . He went back inside to grab his camera in the hope of taking a closer look at the flying object - and managed to capture it on film. The object, which is made up of flashing white and purple lights, hovers in the sky for two minutes while Mr Lowther records its movements. The 43-year-old told Chronicle Live that he originally thought it was a plane travelling on 'an unusual flight path'. But he quickly realised it was 'an unusual colour for a plane' and 'it was not moving as you would expect a plane to move'. Mr Lowther said it was at this point he went into his house to find his video camera. He said: 'I used the zoom so I could get a better look, and what I saw surprised me. It appeared to be a dome with a bulge in the middle and it had pulsating lights on it. 'I am out at night a lot walking the dog but this was like nothing I have ever seen before.' Flickering: The video first shows this speck of white light apparently flying somewhere in the distance . Hovering: The shape grows and appears to move closer to the camera - transforming into this purple dome . Clear: Mr Lowther continues to film as it hovers for two minutes and moves erratically across the sky . In the video, the object at first looks like a white speck of light that is somewhere in the distance. It then grows larger, and transforms into a diamond, or dome shape, as it hovers closer to the camera. The UFO appears to glow purple and white in the night sky, with a light quality that resembles static on a TV screen. Mr Lowther continues to film as it disappears back into the distance, before once again reappearing. Last month, a similar unidentified object was captured as it hovered in the sky over Tynemouth. In the video, posted on YouTube, the white pulsating light hovers in the sky, much like in Mr Lowther's footage, but it never grows into a larger object. And in 2006, another UFO was photographed by a man in nearby Northumberland. The spooky shot was captured by two men as they were taking photos of the sunset.","Mysterious flying object was filmed from a back garden in North Tyneside .

Once connected, the small USB wall charger remotely decrypts, logs and sends keystrokes to a hacker using specially designed software. Scroll down for video . The device, known as KeySweeper, looks and works like a typical USB wall charger (pictured), but uses a built-in chip to  ‘sniff’ for keystrokes typed onto nearby wireless keyboards.

These keyboards use a specific chip that runs on a frequency known as 2.4GHz RF protocol, which is how the communicate wirelessly. As keystrokes are typed on wireless keyboards, they are typically encrypted as they move from the keyboard to computer. By determining which chip a keyboard uses, Mr Kamkar can figure out how to decrypt these keys.

For example, if the user types the URL for an online banking site, or enters a 16-digit number, which suggests it could be a credit card number. And even if KeySweeper is unplugged, an internal battery will keep it running - although the battery life depends on the battery used. The range of the KeySweeper is said to be on par with a standard Bluetooth device, at around 32ft (10 metres). Mr Kamkar used Microsoft keyboards, in particular, because they use the same protocol encryption, meaning once he had decrypted one, he could decrypt others. In theory though, this process could be applied to any wireless keyboard. Mr Kamkar has released the source code and instructions for building a KeySweeper, but advises against people doing so without an electrical background. Last year, Israeli researchers created keylogging software that can steal keystrokes from computers even when they're not connected to the web, using so-called 'air gaps.'

The researchers from Israel designed computer software that logs keystrokes, and this software transmits these strokes via FM radio signals generated by the computer's graphics card. The data is picked up by a nearby mobile, equipped to pick up radio signals. In the example case, the researchers used a Samsung Galaxy S4 and had to plug in the headphones to get the radio receiver to work. This can be done without being detected by the user, but does rely on the software being installed on the computer in the first place. Since FM radio signals can travel over long distances, the receiver could be placed in another building.","KeySweeper device was created by security researcher Samy Kamkar .

"Bryan Patrick Miller has been arrested by police in connection with the shockingly brutal 20-year-old murders of two young in 1992 and 1993 . Police investigating the cold case murders of two women in Arizona have arrested a man more than 20 years after their  bodies were found in a canal. Angela Brosso, 22, and 17-year-old Melanie Bernas disappeared 11 months apart while riding their bikes through Phoenix. Miss Brosso was decapitated, with her head found in the nearby canal where Miss Bernas's body was later discovered. Investigators took six months to link the killings through forensic evidence and failed to make a breakthrough until yesterday when they arrested Bryan Patrick Miller, 42, on suspicion of murder. Police said they tied the case to Miller through DNA, but refused to say how they obtained the sample. Miller's family home near North Mountain Park was illuminated by industrial lights last night as officers combed the property, taking away an old bicycle from a shed. Neither of the women's bikes - Brosso's purple, 21-speed Diamondback nor Bernas's green SPC Hardrock Sport - has ever been found, suggesting the killer may have kept them as trophies. Sgt Trent Crump, a Phoenix police spokesman, said it wasn't immediately clear if the one found at the Miller family home belonged to either victim, it was reported by The Arizona Republic. According to Miller's Facebook page he is a father of one, works as a driver for Amazon, likes Zombie films and conventions and recently embarked on a relationship. A recent posting read: 'I have had to deal with some if the worst rejections you can imagine and some that were exceptionally cruel.. I am awkward when it comes to a lot of social aspects of my life'. Another in October last year read: 'My birthday is on friday and normally I dread my birthday because of well ""reasons"", but this year I have decided to celebrate my birthday the entire month of October. Seeing friends, concerts, food, car-related events, and just trying to enjoy things more, and this weekend I have the zombie walk and an extra day off and then next week is Halloween and Fearcon.' Miss Brosso's headless body was found shortly after she went missing in November 1992 and her head was discovered 11 days later in the Arizona Canal. Miss Bernas became the killer's next victim in September 1993 when he struck while she was riding her bike near the same canal. Unsolved: Angela Brosso, 22, and 17-year-old Melanie Bernas were murdered 11 months apart while riding their bike through Phoenix Arizona in the early 1990s. Police finally made an arrest this week . Probe: Investigators search a shed at the family home of the suspect Bryan Patrick Miller, taking away an old bike, but police say they do not yet know whether it belonged to one of the murder victims .

Pictured: An officer taking a closer look at a bike found in Miller's shed in North Mountain Park. Miller's family home near North Mountain Park was illuminated by industrial lights as officers combed the property in search for clues following the arrest of Bryan Patrick Miller . Her body was found floating in the water close to the Black Canyon Freeway, with her turquoise bodysuit discovered nearby. Police said the killer probably had special military training due to the speed and brutality of the women's executions. 'It's the most brutal murder we've probably ever had,' said William Schira, a Phoenix detective on the cold-case squad said in 2012. Phoenix police and the Cold Case Homicide Unit launched a fresh appeal for information that year, hoping someone who lived in the area may recall anything unusual among their neighbours. 'We're calling on the public who lived in that area at the time to think: 'Who had specialized training and might have seemed a little off?',' said Phoenix police Sgt Troy Hillman at the time. It is not known whether Miller's arrest was made as a result of that inquiry. Crime scene investigators admit they were traumatized by the sheer brutality of the murders. 'It's the most brutal murder we've probably ever had,' said William Schira, a Phoenix detective on the cold-case squad .","Angela Brusso, 22, and Melanie Bernas, 17, killed in Phoenix 22 years ago .

"He prides himself on being something of a hunk - if his latest Calvin Klein shoot is anything to go by. So Justin Bieber probably won't take too kindly to being mistaken for a girl when he dined out at one of his favourite restaurants this week. The singer had turned up to the State Social House in Los Angeles with four friends only to find his usual perch had been taken by a meeting of gay Republicans. Undeterred, he took a seat in the private area, known as the Attic, anyway as the group discussed gay rights. As it was, his presence initially went unnoticed because  the meeting just thought he was a 'butcher version of Miley Cyrus', they later explained. 'Looked like a girl': Justin Bieber was mistaken for a 'butcher version of Miley Cyrus' by a group of gay Republicans when he dined out at one of his favourite restaurants in Los Angeles this week . Favourite haunt: The singer had turned up to the State Social House (above) in Los Angeles with four friends only to find his usual perch had been taken by a meeting of gay Republicans . The Los Angeles chapter of the Log Cabin Republicans were holding a meeting in a private seating area in the State Social House called The Attic when Bieber sat with some friends in the corner . Ben Coleman, the event chairman of the Los Angeles chapter of the Log Cabin Republicans, said the restaurant manager had informed him 'some other people' wanted to 'hang out in the corner'. He told the Jillian Barberie and John Phillips show on 790 KABC: 'I went downstairs and someone I knew said ""did you see Justin Bieber just went upstairs?"" 'I went back and looked around the corner and I saw the group and, literally, I didn't see Justin Bieber, I just saw a bunch of girls. 'I got a closer look and said, oh yeah that's the Biebs, for sure. But he looked like a butcher version of Miley Cyrus.' The group were listening to a talk by Ronald Reagan's former personal assistant Peggy Grande at the time. The Bieber effect: Angry fans of Justin send death threats to married model Lara Stone following their racy Calvin Klein advert . Mr Coleman said he tried to get a picture of Bieber, but was flatly refused. According to Gossip Cop, he posted on Facebook: 'I tried to get a pic of the Biebs in front of the Log Cabin banner... with Peggy and I, but the bodyguards said no. 'And they had guns.

"Within five minutes of taking a lethal sedative, Brittany Maynard was fast asleep and all of the pain from her struggle with cancer erased from her face. She died another thirty minutes later, leaving the world just how she planned - surrounded by her loving husband, family and friends. Dan Diaz, the widower of the 29-year-old who has become the face of the right-to-die movement, spoke out this week in interviews with People magazine and Meredith Vieira to describe his late wife's last moments on November 1 and how he plans to honor her memory. Scroll down for video . How she died: Brittany Maynard's widower Dan Diaz (pictured) appeared in a Today show Wednesday to describe his late wife's last moments, after deciding to undergo doctor-assisted suicide rather than continue to battle a painful and aggressive form of brain cancer . In the room: Diaz (left) and his brother Adrian (right) were both in the room when 29-year-old Maynard passed away, just two years after they wed . According to Diaz, 43, his wife marked that day to be her last, after a tumor was found rapidly growing in her brain and doctors gave her just six months to live. While chemotherapy and radiation were an option for Maynard, they wouldn't significantly extend her life and she didn't want to spend what time she had left battling a torturous disease in a stuffy hospital. Instead, she decided to spend her last months on Earth rock climbing, traveling and spending time with her beloved husband, who she only married in September 2012. She decided beforehand that if she was feeling well on November 1, that she would delay her death. But a seizure in the morning led her to commit herself to follow through with the brave act. 'It was a reminder of what she was risking because what was coming next was losing her eyesight, becoming paralyzed, inability to speak and she’d be essentially trapped in her own body,'Diaz told Vieira. After breakfast, Diaz says he and Maynard took a 90 minute hike with friends and family and their dogs Charley and Bella near the home they rented in Portland, Oregon to apply for the drug. Oregon is one of three states in the U.S. that has legalized doctor-assisted suicide. Circled on the calendar: Maynard (pictured) marked November 1 as the day she wanted to die. She said she would delay the death if she felt well that day, but a small seizure in the morning commited her to take the lethal dose of secobarbital . Short romance: Maynard and Diaz, 43, wed in September 2012, and a little more than a year later she was diagnosed with brain cancer . When they got back from the hike, Maynard said she knew it was 'her time'. 'She was tired of the pain, the discomfort, the suffering, the seizures,' Diaz told People. 'Even that small one that morning was a reminder of how sick she really was.' She mixed her prescribed sedative secobarbital which comes in powder form with a glass of water and took it to their bedroom, where she drank the concoction surrounded by her loved ones. Diaz says she put everyone at ease by talking and joking until she fell into a sleep. 'Within five minutes she was asleep. And within 30 minutes, her breathing slowed to the point where she passed away. She was surrounded by the people she loved and her passing was peaceful,' he said. 'It truly was the most peaceful experience that you could ever hope for when you talk about a person's passing,' Diaz added to Vieira. 'The suffering and the torment and everything she had gone through, that was finally lifted,' he said. He added that his wife had never questioned taking a lethal concoction of drugs to end her life, despite reports at the time suggesting that she may be having second thoughts. Many of these reports cited videos and photos in which Miss Maynard appeared to be in good spirits. 'The weeks leading up to Brittany’s death, her symptoms were getting bad,' he told the show, which will air later this week. 'Those videos were taped 2 weeks before, 3 weeks before. 'Brittany’s seizures were getting worse, they were getting more intense, they were becoming more frequent. The pain she was feeling, the discomfort, the headaches and when those seizures hit. 'There was one instance where we had to go to the hospital. She couldn’t speak for four hours, and the last seizure she had was the most horrific and scary for her. 'Unfortunately, that video, just because of when it came out it gave the impression, ""oh, well she looks healthy"", but that was not the case whatsoever. Her health was deteriorating daily.' Diaz promised to take up his wife's cause to get doctor-assisted suicide legalized in their home state of California, which is why he has decided to speak publicly about her final hours. Living her life: Maynard decided to spend her last months traveling, rock climbing and hiking - some of her passions. Pictured above with her husband at the Grand Canyon . But one thing he won't reveal is her last words. 'That's a sacred part of things for me, and I don't want to share that with the world,' he said. Diaz says his wife first read about the right-to-die in Oregon shortly after she was diagnosed with brain cancer, telling her husband: 'Look, if things get bad, this is an option.' Things did get bad. While her initial diagnosis last year gave her three to five years to live, the tumor grew rapidly and just a few months later she was told she likely wouldn't survive past six months. 'This cancer was going to kill me and the way it was going to kill me was terrible,' she told Today before her death, explaining her reason to commit suicide rather than battle the disease. Since doctor-assisted suicide is not legal in California, the couple moved to Portland, Oregon and last May, she was approved a prescription for secobarbital. It was actually her husband Diaz who picked up the lethal drug at the pharmacy, while she was in Alaska fulfilling one of her many bucket list adventures. Fulfiling her dreams: Miss Maynard is pictured with her mother, also at the Grand Canyon . Diaz struggled with his wife's decision at first, but was ultimately supportive. 'Did I want her to die? Of course not. Did I want this whole thing to go away? Of course. But did I ever want her to change her mind? No. I would never want my wife to suffer for no reason,' he said. Confessional: Diaz talks about his wife's decision in the latest issue of People, appearing on the cover in a picture taken before her death . 'She was absolutely resolved to be in control of how she died.' Speaking of his acceptance of his wife's decision to die, Diaz explained: 'You don’t want to let go of your loved one but to suggest that she should suffer for me, for anyone, no. 'That’s what you struggle with - here’s the person I love and I don’t want to see her go.' Still on leave from his job as a senior manager in the food industry, Diaz is now working to help get right-to-die legalized in California by telling his wife's story. 'My preference would be not to be in front of any cameras. But this was one thing Brittany had asked, that we make this a reality in California. I want to keep my promise to her.' California legislators plan to propose a right-to-die bill later this month, but it has in the past drawn criticism from religious groups. While in New York this week, Diaz also met with Senator Diane Savino who hopes to get a measure passed in her own state. Diaz also defended his wife's honor against those who say she was manipulated by Compassion and Choices the group which worked with her to generate support for the right-to-die cause. 'If you knew Brittany, anyone would say that was impossible for her to have been exploited by an organization. She did this. She pursued, applied for and was given it before she was even contacted by Compassion and Choices. She decided to participate because she believed in the casue. There's absolutely no chance that she was being exploited or manipulated at all. He has since moved out of their rental in Oregon and taken their dogs back to California. While Maynard's choice of death provided a sense of closure, Diaz says he's still rocked by her loss. 'I have good days and bad days.,' he said. 'But the feeling of loss is always there - particularly in the morning when I first wake up. And at night, when the house is quiet and I'm just there with the dogs, I think about her every day. He says he keeps her driver's license in his wallet now, to see her smile and be reminded of their short, but loving, marriage.

"It has become one of Hollywood's  surprising second acts - how 62-year-old Liam Neeson became one of Tinseltown's most bankable action heroes playing a cold blooded killer with a particular set of skills. But now the Irish-born actor and star of the ultra-violent Taken trilogy has thought it wise to wade into America's fraught gun debate. Speaking at a press conference in Dubai for the launch of Taken 3 on Tuesday, Neeson offered an interviewer his opinion of his adopted home's attitude to firearms. 'There's just too many [expletive] guns out there,' said Neeson, who is reputed to have been paid $20 million for the new latest Taken installment. 'Especially in America. I think the population is like, 320 million? There's over 300 million guns. Privately owned, in America. 'I think it's a [expletive] disgrace. Every week now we're picking up a newspaper and seeing, 'Yet another few kids have been killed in schools.' Scroll Down for Video . The gun-totting star of the 'Taken' trilogy, Liam Neeson, has condemned the level of gun ownership in America labelling it an '(expletive) disgrace' while offering his condolences over the Paris terrorist attacks; above Neeson, as Bryan Mills, in Taken 3 . Sleeper hit: Taken, which was penned by Luc Besson, followed the simple story of a former CIA operative whose daughter is kidnapped. Liam Neeson's character then kills a lot of people and rescues her . Action hero: Liam Neeson starred in a 2010 remake of the 1980s classic Saturday serial The A Team - where he played the commander of a framed special forces ops team . Neeson was quick to draw a line between guns in movies, and real life saying 'it's fantasy' and says movies like Taken 3 don't inspire people to buy guns . Taken again: In the sequel to Taken, called Taken 2, Liam Neeson used his particular set of skills to rescue his wife and shoot a lot of bad guys again . When asked if the issue extends to police responsibility Neeson said 'let's not get into it'. But then added: 'Let's put it this way: I think a light has been shone on the justice system in America, and it's a justifiable light.' Neeson, a supporter of gun control, is best known as gun-toting father, Bryan Mills, who will stop at nothing to get his loved ones back. But he was quick to make the distinction between fiction and reality, and said his movies wouldn't inspire people to buy and use guns. Growing up watching cowboy movies had not turned him into a killer, he said. 'A character like Bryan Mills going out with guns and taking revenge: it's fantasy. It's in the movies, you know? I think it can give people a great release from stresses in life and all the rest of it, you know what I mean? It doesn't mean they're all going to go out and go, 'Yeah, let's get a gun!' Runaway success: Liam Neeson has starred in three Taken movies since the release of the first film in the franchise in 2008 and each of the posters for the movies showed the actor sporting a gun . Biggest hit to date in the series: The latest Taken movie has grossed almost $40 million in its opening weekend and deposed the last Hobbit movie from the number 1 spot in the US box office . The Irish-born actor became an American citizen five years ago and currently lives in New York City. Before speaking about gun ownership in America, Neeson reflected on Said and Cherif Kouachi shooting spree last Wednesday that claimed a dozen lives. He said: 'First off, my thoughts and prayers and my heart are with the deceased, and certainly with all of France. 'I've got a lot of dear friends in Paris.' The wildly successful Taken trilogy has grossed almost $603 million to date in box office worldwide. Since 2005, and Batman Begins, Liam Neeson has launched his lucrative second career as an action hero. Change of career: No more historical dramas for 60 something action hero Liam Neeson . In a little under a decade, the Irish-born actor has starred in 10 action films, having previously starred in character driven roles. But from the box-office takings, it is clear that Neeson's career switch has paid-off, and handsomely. Twleve of Neeson's 15 highest-grossing movies in the United States are action films and of those dozen, only three were released before 2005. Indeed, studio bosses have been keen to utilize the actors bankability through his new-found action hero status. In the United States, the average profit per Neeson action movie is $181 million, while his non-action offerings rake in $4 million. That puts him up with stars such as Tom Cruise and Leonardo DiCaprio, who make anywhere between $100 million and $300 million per film. And of course, this new found stardom has boosted Neeson's net worth. He was reportedly paid $1 million for Taken, $15 million for Taken 2 and $20 million for Taken 3 - seeing his bank balance shoot up to $75 million. (Source: The Fool) It has turned Neeson from a respected character actor most famous for his portrayal of Oscar Schindler in Steven Spielberg's Oscar winning Schindler's List into a fully fledged action hero. The star is reported to have been paid $20 million for his role as CIA operative Bryan Mills, joining the ranks of Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks as Hollywood's best paid stars. However, some of course are not happy with Neeson's foray into Second Amendment politics. 'The rank hypocrisy of an actor who uses guns in his films and attacks gun ownership at the same time is way over the top. I guess you don't need brains to act,' said Alan Gottlieb, founder of the Second Amendment Foundation to WND. 'All you have to do is read the script.' Historical roles: The superstar is seen toting a gun in A Million Ways to Die In The West (2014, left) and in 1995's more traditional career move Roby Roy (right) Neeson said his 'thoughts and prayers and my heart' is with the victims of the Charlie Hebdo massacre .","The 62-year-old is famous for playing gun-totting father Bryan Mills in Taken franchise .

"French security services have allegedly identified another suspected accomplice of Amedy Coulibaly, who kidnapped and killed four people in a kosher deli in Paris on Friday. According to Le Parisien, police sources are investigating a man from a Paris suburb, who may have driven Coulibaly to the supermarket. French police revealed that Coulibaly, 32, rented a small suburban house in Gentilly the week before the hostage situation - and filled it with an impressive arsenal of weapons. The police refused to disclose what they discovered inside, but detectives from the Paris Criminal Brigade and a special anti-terrorism unit reportedly seized a scooter there. This allowed them to identity another man who they believe acted as Coulibaly's accomplice. He has not been identified by name, but the newspaper claims he may have shot and wounded a jogger in nearby Fontenay-aux-Roses on January 7, the same day the Kouachi brothers killed 12 people in the Charlie Hebdo attack. Le Monde reported that the runner, who was shot on the back of the leg at around 8.30pm local time, fled to his neighbours for help while the gunman escaped. The incident was initially being investigated by a prosecutor in Nanterre, but it has since been elevated to an anti-terrorism unit in Paris. Scroll down for video . Siege: Police raided the Hyper Cacher deli (pictured), where Amedy Coulibaly was holding people hostage . Raid: Amedy Coulibaly, who murdered four people inside the deli (pictured) was killed in the siege carried out by French anti-terror forces . Accomplice: Police are still on the hunt for Coulibaly's  wife, Hayat Boumeddiene (left), who fled to Syria before the hostage-situation in Paris . Investigators are also following a money trail because they do not believe Coulibaly and the Kouachi brothers had the means to  bankroll their activities without help. Christophe Crepin, a spokesman for the French Police Union, said: 'Not only was there the cost of weapons, ammunition and equipment to cover, but also money needed to rent suspected hideouts like the one in Gentilly and to pay their living expenses. 'We're dealing with a well-organized mafia-like structure.' Coulibaly killed the son of a chief Rabbi, a teacher, a pensioner and a shop worker saving for his marriage at the Hyper Cacher in Vincennes. Police are still searching for Coulibaly's partner, Hayat Boumeddiene, who fled to Syria before a wave of terror attacks in Paris - in which 17 innocent people died. A police source said she flew to Turkey via Madrid on January 2 - despite alleged sightings of her in Paris on Thursday. Authorities in Istanbul then reported seeing a woman matching her description cross the Turkey- Syria border on Thursday, the day her husband killed policewoman Clarissa Jean-Phillipe. Sources say she had a return ticket from Istanbul to Madrid for yesterday but failed to show for the flight. Earlier today, MailOnline revealed exclusive footage from inside the kosher deli in Paris, where the fanatical gunman  murdered four shoppers, before being killed by armed police. CCTV video from inside the Hyper Cacher store shows bodies on the floor, while a child's pushchair sits empty in one of the aisles - littered with abandoned shopping.

Fear: Hostages inside the Hyper Cacher mart huddle together near the checkouts after watching four of their fellow shoppers murdered in cold blood . Murdered: two bodies are pictured on the floor of the market. The one closest to the camera is believed to be Yohan Cohen who was shot after he grabbed one of Coulibaly's guns, only to find it had jammed . Coulibaly can be seen in the back of the shop wearing a bullet proof vest, while a shop assistant stands against the opposite wall with his hands up. A time-stamp at the bottom of the image shows the time as 1.40pm, almost exactly four hours before firearms officers cut Coulibaly down in a hail of 40 bullets at 5.21pm local time. One of the bodies, pictured next to a checkout, is believed to be that of Yohan Cohen, the 22-year old shop worker who grabbed one of Coulibaly's rifles after the terrorist placed it down. According to witness accounts Mr Cohen picked up the gun and attempted to turn it on Coulibaly only to find it had jammed. The terrorist then shot him in cold blood and he died on the spot.","French authorities claim to have identified accomplice of Amedy Coulibaly .

Pineda - known as the First Lady of murder - and her husband Jose Luis Abarca are accused of ordering the disappearance of the trainee teachers. It is believed that Pineda, in her role as boss of the local Guerreros Unidos cartel, ordered corrupt police to kidnap the victims overnight on September 26, before handing them over to mobsters. They were then killed, stacked 'like a grill', incinerated, and had their remains dumped in a river, according to the testimonies of gang members who have already been questioned.

"On the anniversary of the day that Jeanette 'Jenny' Moss was found murdered in her exclusive Melbourne home, police say they are no closer to finding her killer. A neighbour found the body of the 69-year-old's socialite, a widow with two children and four grandchildren, in her Middle Park home on January 15 last year. Despite being terminally ill with pulmonary fibrosis diagnosis, Ms Moss had spent the day before she died going to the gym, meeting with friends, and grocery shopping at her local Coles. Jeanette 'Jenny' Moss was found dead in her apartment on January 15th, 2014 . She had made plans for the 16th of January, including a visit to The Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, reported The Age. Despite intensive investigations into her death, including an information caravan set up outside the Beaconsfield Parade apartment block, homicide squads are still waiting on a breakthrough. 'It is very sad for us to say that as one year passes we are still no closer to finding Ms Moss' killer,' Detective Sergeant Stephen McIntyre said. The Melbourne grandmother was reportedly well loved and active in her local community, working as a councillor in the wealthy Middle Park area and enjoying a membership with the Albert Park Yachting and Angling Club. Ms Moss was on the board of several charities and was often spotted at Victoria's racing carnivals, and was preparing for her 70th birthday party, which would have been held just a month after she died. Her funeral was held at All Saints Anglican Church in St Kilda and was attended by 350 people. Police has released images of missing jewellery (including a ring and watch, right) in the hope that it will lead to crucial information about her death . Despite intensive investigations into Ms Moss's death, including an information caravan set up outside the Beaconsfield Parade apartment block, homicide squads are still waiting on a breakthrough . Witnesses say that she had been spotted the day before he body was found, running errands in her green 1997 BMW, but police are still unclear on the series of events that unfolded when she arrived at her home. Her apartment had been fitted with a security entrance, and was on the second floor of the apartment block, which led police to believe that Ms Moss probably knew her killer. Authorities said that Ms Moss had received 'injuries to her upper body' from an 'altercation' in the apartment, where she had lived alone since the death of her husband, Hal Moss, in 1999. Neighbours reported that the local CCTV camera was faulty, and that the wire had been disused for several years. 'Whether it was someone she knew, or someone she didn't know, we just don't know,' Detective Sergeant McIntyre said. 'She was really vulnerable. It wouldn’t have taken much at all — from what we can gather — to overpower her and really (there wasn’t) any necessity to kill her ... we can’t imagine why anyone would need to do that,' he said. 'She presented no threat to anyone,' reported news.com.au. Derham Moss, Ms Moss's son, said that his children were still wondering what had happened to their grandmother. 'All I can hope for now is some type of closure,' Mr Moss said. 'That closure is, I guess, who and why. I mean, my mother would not have had an enemy in the world - she was well loved, she had a huge network of friends,' he told The ABC. Despite a thorough search, a ring, necklace and watch reported missing from the apartment has not been recovered. Investigators have released photos of jewellery missing from Ms Moss' apartment in the hope it will provide the breakthrough they need. Anyone with information is being urged to call Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 or report via their website.","Socialite Jeanette Moss was discovered dead in her exclusive Melbourne home a year ago .

"Rescued By Americans: Bendita Malakia survived the attack on the upmarket Westgate mall in Nairobi after being brought to safety by an 'American security team' An American woman who was trapped inside the Nairobi mall as terrorists ran amok claims she was eventually rescued by an 'American security team'. That is according to Bendita Malakia, the Harvard-trained lawyer who was caught up in the siege and hid along with 15 others in a store inside the mall for five hours before the armed men arrived to lead them to safety. Thirty-year-old Malakia, who is from Elizabeth City, North Carolina, recounted the frantic scene tonight in an interview with NBC News as her rescuers bluntly told her, 'If you guys want to get out, we understand it's dangerous, but this is probably your best shot. If you don't get out now you may not get out.' Rushing to the exit, accompanied by the armed security men who she believed were from the United States, two grenades thrown from only 30-feet away detonated near to them, but thankfully for Malakia she escaped and returned home to her parents on Monday. While there has been no official confirmation of any direct American involvement in the stand-off between the heavily-armed militants from the Somalia-based al Shabaab and Kenyan Defence Forces, the statement from World Bank employee, Malakia, seems to suggest there was. Scroll Down for Video . Foreign Intervention: Security officers secure an area inside Westgate Shopping Centre in Nairobi September 21, 2013 (these are not the American security forces reported to have been operating inside the mall according to one witness) Fleeing: Armed police guide an unknown woman carrying a child to safety at Westgate Shopping Centre in Nairobi September 21, 2013 . Indeed, on the second day of the four day siege in Nairobi which claimed the lives of at least 67 people and injured over 200, there were reports from French press agency AFP that Israeli security forces were actively aiding Kenyan forces. And as the attack carried on to its final conclusion, British MI6 agents were also reported to be providing assistance to their Kenyan counterparts. However, it is not known who the 'American security team' who came to Malakia's rescue were working for or what capacity they were operating under. Kenyan officials have acknowledged that Israeli and American security personnel have taken part in planning the operation to retake the complex and provided logistical support according to the UK's Independent newspaper. Chillingly for Malakia, she was almost killed within moments of the mall attack's initial onslaught and only survived because she moved seats at the restaurant she was sitting in with a friend. Deciding they didn't like their seats they requested to move and then suddenly their revelry was broken by the sound of explosions and gunfire. Terrifying: A picture issued 23 September 2013 shows armed men checking a cafeteria inside the Westgate shopping mall after the shootout on Saturday. It's not clear if this is the cafe where Mr Handler was sitting . 'We had a drink, and we're chatting, and then all of a sudden there's this explosion,' said Malakia to NBC News. 'The gentleman who had taken my old seat must have gotten shot immediately because he was basically on the floor, on the ground, like dead right next to the chair that I was sitting in.' Running for their lives to hide in the break-room of a store inside the upmarket mall, Malakia said that despite reports the gunmen were targeting non-Muslims for death, in the first few moments that was not the case. 'When they first came in, they were just shooting. They weren't asking any questions, they were just shooting,' Malakia said. 'Later, they tried to differentiate on religion, but at first they were just shooting.' Cowering in silence in cramped conditions along with 15 others, Malakia said that they could still hear the muffled shouts and screams from across the four story shopping mall in the Kenyan capital. 'People are screaming, you hear lots of running, gunshots, explosions, and there’s all sorts of things,' she said to NBC News. 'Some of the older women especially are hyperventilating, it's just kind of, it's complete chaos, it's mostly gunshots and screaming and running at that point. 'You could hear people screaming don't shoot.' Smoke rises from the Westgate shopping centre in Nairobi following a string of explosions during the third day of a stand-off between Kenyan security forces and gunmen inside the building . It was then that she took the opportunity to text her family in the United States, in case she did not make it out alive. 'It was terrifying, we all had a very real sense that we were going to die,' Malakia said. Now back with her family in North Carolina, Malakia has said she doesn't yet know whether she'll ever return to Kenya. 'I think part of it was luck. We did a lot of praying in there.' This comes as an American NGO worker described the terrifying moment he dashed across Nairobi's Westgate Mall carrying his two-year-old daughter and hid in a storage room after hearing explosions and gunshots. Pennsylvania-born Nick Handler, who is a field director for a farming non-profit, was sitting at a cafe in the mall with his daughter, Julia, when the deadly siege began on Saturday. His wife Lyndsay, who is eight months pregnant with the couple's second child, was shopping on the floor below, leaving the family separated during the chaos. Survivors: Pennsylvania-born Nick Handler, right, who is a field director for a farming non-profit, survived the shooting with daughter, Julia, while his wife, Lyndsay, pictured escaped unharmed from a different floor of the mall . 'All of a sudden I just heard a loud . explosion followed by a few gun shots and I just immediately just . grabbed (Julia) and luckily it was right by the door and we were able to . sprint out of the cafe and ran across the mall,' Handler told ABC News by phone on Monday. The father and daughter initially followed other frightened mallgoers out a service exit towards the back of the mall before a wave of people came rushing back inside, apparently 'running away from some shooting out the front,' Handler said. Hugging Julia tight, Handler went back inside the mall and ended up hiding in an inventory room with about 40 other people while al Qaeda-linked gunmen massacred innocent mallgoers outside. He said at one point it seemed the terrorists may have discovered their hiding spot as a group of people who had left the storage room suddenly started rushing back in, screaming. 'Aside from that initial explosion, this was probably the most terrifying moment,' Handler told ABC, 'not knowing if perhaps the people who had left had encountered some of the attackers who were then coming into the area that we were hiding.' Ordeal: The father and daughter, pictured, hid in a storage room with about 40 other people while al Qaeda-linked gunmen massacred innocent mallgoers outside . Charity worker: Handler, pictured with a younger Julia, works for an NGO in Kenya . Julia spent the whole time pressed up against her dad's side. 'When we were running away from the initial explosion and then into hiding she was definitely freaked out but once we got settled down and we were just waiting the situation out she was incredibly brave,' he said. Meanwhile, . Lyndsay, who left her husband and daughter to go get groceries just moments before the . first explosion, hid in a dark movie theater on the third floor of the . busy shopping mall. Eventually, she made it to the roof with another . group. 'That . was just the most terrifying thing for her, not being able to be with . us and having no idea what was happening,' Handler said. Luckily, the couple were able to communicate on the phone. 'We . were talking that whole time,' he said. 'I was aware she was safe and . she was aware that I was inside and she was helping to communicate our . location to people who might be able to help.' After an agonizing wait, Lyndsay was rescued by heroic plain clothed policemen who led her down a fire escape to safety. Some 90 minutes later, Handler and his daughter were also rescued and the young family shared an emotional reunion. The charity worker said he rushed down a driveway on the side of the mall to knew exactly where his wife was waiting. They took each other in a tearful embrace. 'We just ran towards each other and hugged,' he said. 'Just . the look on her face, the emotion and I think all of the fear and the . uncertainty that had been building up. She just let it all out.

"Prehistoric hunters in Greenland lived through a 'Meteorite Age' where they mined metal from fallen space rocks to make weapons, according to archaeologists. Danish researchers have found evidence that suggests ancient cultures in Greenland were making tools from a meteorite they found on the ice more than 1,200 years ago. This was nearly 300 years before Norse settlers from Iceland arrived in Greenland and are thought to have brought iron with them made from ore on Earth. Prehistoric Eskimos made spears like the one above with a point made from iron mined from a meteorite . With no metal naturally accessible in Greenland, the discovery suggests that the meteorite was responsible for kickstarting the Iron Age in the country and allowing the native hunters to develop new metal technology. The meteorite is thought to have crashed into the Greenland ice sheet around the Cape York Peninsula in north west Greenland, around 10,000 years ago and split into at least eight large pieces. Greenland is one of the largest frozen landscapes in the world, with much of the land covered with giant ice sheets. The first humans are thought to have arrived in Greenland around 2500 BC, and was repeatedly colonised by waves of immigration from the islands north of Canada. The first Paleo=Eskimo cultures to arrive on Greenland were the Saqqaq culture, who appear to have intermittently inhabited the western reaches of the country island between 2500BC and 800BC. Two other unique cultures, known as the Independence Cultures also arose on Greenland over the same period until the Dorest Culture arrived in 700BC. They continued until 1300AD, although the early Inuit Thules began arriving around 1100AD. It is thought that the Thule's take over of the trade in meteorite iron is thought to have been partly responsible for the demise of the Dorset culture. The Norse began settling in the southern part of Greenland in around 980AD before spreading and bringing with them iron from elsewhere in Europe. Among them was an enormous lump of iron known as Ahighito, or the Tent, which weighs around 31 tons, a 22 ton piece called The Man, a 2.5 ton chunk called the Woman and the Dog, weighing half a ton. These are now all housed at the American Museum of Natural History after being transported there by arctic explorers in the 19th century. However, archaeologists from the National Museum of Denmark have now found evidence that the native 'Paleo-Eskimos' who lived in the area had been knocking fragments off these boulders for hundreds of years. They found piles of basalt stones weighing up to 40kg (88lbs) that had been carried to the locations where the meteorites were found where they were used to hammer pieces off the meteorites. The metal was then used to forge a knife or harpoon blade. Dr Martin Appelt, an archaeologist from the National Museum of Denmark, told online magazine Polarfronten: 'We knew the locations because what we have here are large scientific objects, but the story of the meteorites as the whole area's source of iron have sunk into oblivion.' Together with a team of archaeologists from Denmark and Greenland, Dr Appelt and his colleagues discovered huge piles of hammer stones. Mikkel Myrup, an archaeoloigst from the Greenland National Museum, measured the piles using a drone and estimates that they may contain up to 70 tonnes of hammer stones. The Ahnighito, or Tent, fragment of the Cape York  meteorite, above, weighs 34 tons but was mined for iron . The Agpalilik fragment, also called the Man, of the meteorite now sits outside the Geological Museum in Copenhagen (seen above) but the iron rich space rock brought new material for weapons to Greenland . The 34 ton Ahnighito meteorite fragment was mined for centuries before it was moved by American polar explorer Robert Peary, seen above posing next to the meteorite in its original location, to the United States . This would suggest that huge amounts of iron had been mined from the meteorites over the years. 'They did a heck of a lot of hammering,' said Dr Jens Fog Jensen, another archaeologist involved in the research from the National Museum of Denmark. 'The blacksmiths would start by knocking off a small piece, thoroughly beating it flat and giving it a sharp edge, then hardening it further so that it could serve as an arrowhead or flensing knife.' Analysis on iron tools from the area show that it had come from these meteorites as they have a distinctive chemical signature that includes traces of nickel. The meteorite broke up over the Cape York Peninsula in north west Greenland, scattering on the ice sheet . Polar explorers transported the Ahnighito meteorite fragment to the American Museum of Natural History . It is through early Eskimos, also known as the Dorset people, began exploiting the iron in the meteorites in the mid eighth century. When the Thules, an early Inuit people, arrived in the 12th century, they took over the trade in meteorite iron. Weapons made from the meteorites have been found as far away as Canada. In southern Greenland, which was the first area to be occupied by the Norsemen, just one single fragment of the meteorite has been found. It is thought that they had no need to use the meteorite iron as they had access to iron from terrestrial ore. Dr Appelt added: 'It has been traded over large distances and testifies to the significance of the meteorites from the Thule as a source of iron in the Eastern Arctic.'","Danish archaeologists found evidence that early Eskimo hunters broke iron from giant meteorites on the Greenland ice sheet using basalt stones .

"A brisk daily walk of just 20 minutes could add years to your life, scientists said last night. In a stark warning against couch-potato lifestyles, they said lack of exercise killed twice as many people as obesity. The Cambridge University study of 334,000 people found that even a modest amount of activity prolonged life. And the least fit had the most to gain. Scroll down for video . A lack of exercise could cause twice as many deaths as obesity, British researchers have warned . Twenty minutes of walking a day – or its equivalent – would cut their risk of premature death by almost a third. The researchers could not say how much extra life could be gained through using exercise in this way to move from the ‘inactive’ to the ‘moderately inactive’ part of the population. But even the obese could expect a 16 per cent reduced risk of dying early. Those of healthy weight could profit by 30 per cent. Ulf Ekelund, who led the study, said: ‘This is a simple message: just a small amount of physical activity each day could have substantial health benefits for people who are physically inactive. ‘Although we found just 20 minutes would make a difference, we should really be looking to do more than this – physical activity has many proven health benefits and should be an important part of our daily life.’ The researchers estimated that 337,000 of 9.2million recorded deaths of European men and women were attributable to obesity. But twice this number – around 676,000 deaths – could be blamed on inactivity. But a brisk 20 minute walk every day could cut the chance of dying early, it is claimed . Government guidelines advise Britons to do 150 minutes of moderate activity such as gardening, dancing or brisk walking, or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise, including playing sport, running or aerobics, every week. But a recent survey found that a third of people can barely manage to walk for 30 minutes over seven days, even when trips to the shops, work or school are considered. And a report backed by the initiative Walking for Health last year found that physical inactivity cost the economy up to £10billion a year through sick days, healthcare costs and early deaths. Professor Nick Wareham, director of the Medical Research Council epidemiology unit at Cambridge, said: ‘Helping people to lose weight can be a real challenge, and whilst we should continue to aim at reducing population levels of obesity, public health interventions that encourage people to make small but achievable changes in physical activity can have significant health benefits and may be easier to achieve and maintain.’ June Davison, senior cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation, said: ‘The results of this study are a clear reminder that being regularly physically active can reduce the risk of dying from coronary heart disease. ‘The research suggests that just a modest increase in physical activity can have health benefits. Adults should aim to do at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity activity a week, carrying it out in sessions of ten minutes or more. Whether it’s going for a walk, taking a bike ride or using the stairs instead of the lift, keeping active every day will help reduce the risk of developing coronary heart disease.’ A brisk 20-minute walk would burn between 90 and 110 calories. The study was reported in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. The authors defined premature death as dying before the average age for doing so. ____________________________________________________________________________ . Labour will advise people exactly how much exercise they should take if the party wins May’s election. Risking accusations of ‘nannying’, health spokesman Andy Burnham will say today the ‘promotion of physical activity’ must be at the centre of health policy. Labour will also impose maximum amounts of fat, sugar and salt that can be contained in food marketed at children. There will be ‘targeted action’ on high-strength, low-cost alcohol with minimum prices and a ban on larger bottles. And plain cigarette packaging will be introduced immediately to ‘halt the industry’s increasingly sophisticated methods of recruiting new, young smokers’. Labour want children born in 2015 to become the first ‘smoke-free generation’.","A lack of exercise kills twice as many people as obesity, researchers warn .

"A dad left his five-year-old son inside his freezing cold car for two hours in the middle of the night so that he could go to a strip club, police have said. Dwayne Keith Winn, 44, left the youngster in the parking lot of B.Y.O.B Eclipse Club in Humble, Texas just before 3am on Sunday and headed inside, police said. A security guard doing checks on the parking lot noticed the young boy inside the car, but thought he was a young woman. Just after 5am, the guard noticed the person was still inside the car and on closer inspection, he noticed that it was a child. Arrest: Dwayne Keith Winn, 44, allegedly left his young son in his car while he went to a strip club in Houston, Texas in the early hours of Sunday. The boy was found shivering inside two hours later . Captain Wally Wieghat with the Precinct 4 Constable's Office told Click2Houston that the child had been in the car for more than two hours in almost 40-degree temperatures. 'He was cold and he was shivering and he was hungry, one of the officers went and bought food for him,' Wieghat said. Guards found Winn inside the club and tried to question him but he ran off, Wieghat said . When he eventually returned, he told officers that he had only been using the restroom in the club and had been there for around 15 minutes. But security guards at the club take a time stamp photo of patrons' ID cards and Winn was found to have entered the club at 3am and left after 5am, Click2Houston reported. Found: A security guard checking the parking lot, pictured, found the young boy shivering and hungry at 5am . Inside: The 44-year-old father claimed he went to the club, pictured, to use the restroom but investigations revealed he had actually been inside for two hours. He was arrested and remains in jail . 'I hesitate to think how it could have ended up and just thank the good Lord it did not end that way,' Wieghart said. Winn was charged with abandoning a child with intention to return and remains in the Harris County jail on $15,000 bond. If convicted, he could face a $10,000 fine as well as a jail term ranging from 180 days to two years. At the time, the boy's mother was at home with another baby. The five-year-old boy has been released to relatives and the Children's Protective Services will check on the home, officials said.

"Spain's Eurovision hopeful Edurne reveals she and Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea are 'very, very happy' together but would 'erase him' from her life if he was unfaithful. The stunner, voted sexiest woman of the year in Spain in 2010 by the readers of FHM, said she may not even have time to marry her boyfriend of four years if she wins the song contest. Edurne was speaking after it was today announced she had been chosen to represent Spain in May's Eurovision. Scroll down for video . Happy couple: Edurne Garcia has been dating Manchester United goalie David de Gea for the past four years. New year: Stunning Edurne tweeted this picture with the caption: 'Batteries recharged 100 per cent, prepared for everything awaiting me this year' The singer rose to fame after appearing in Spain's equivalent of Pop Idol in 2005 and she succeeds former X Factor star Ruth Lorenzo, who finished tenth in last year's Eurovision. After being told the news, Madrid-born Edurne, 29, said she is keeping her fingers crossed Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal will give his star goalie time off so he can travel with her to Vienna for the competition. Her boyfriend, 24, was one of the first people she phoned after being told she had been selected to represent Spain at this year's competition. She said: 'He was very happy for me when I told him, just like my family and friends. 'The people who love you share in your good news. 'David and I are very very happy together. I think he's going to be tied up with league commitments but I hope he can be there at the final along with my family and friends so we can live the experience together.' The Spanish singer had previously said she would love de Gea to ask her to marry him, but now it seems she may not have the time. 'If I win, I don't know if I'll have time to marry or not,' she added. 'I think I'll have to take advantage of the moment and do a lot of other things. But everything happens at the right time. 'At the moment it's the Eurovision song contest and I want to concentrate 100 per cent on that and afterwards we'll see about the other things.' Famous: Edurne rose to fame after appearing in Spain's equivalent of Pop Idol in 2005. She sang with Olly Murs at the the 40 Principales Awards in 2013 . Edurne got used to being in front of a camera as a child. She did her first casting call and TV advert for a fruit juice when she was just six. She got into singing because of her family's love of karaoke, becoming part of a child band called Trastos when she was 12, which published three records. She admitted today: 'I knew when I went on stage for the first time and heard the first applause that this was my world. 'I can't find words to describe the sensation I felt, being so young. 'I knew then I wanted to devote myself to music for the rest of my life.' She went on to combine studying to become a vet with working as a supermarket cashier at weekends to make ends meet. And although she ended up abandoning her studies to concentrate on music she remains a great animal lover. Long distance: Despite living in different countries, Edurne said: 'We're very good together and complement each other very well' She looks after two dogs and three cats at her home near Madrid and her Chow Chow lives with her boyfriend in Manchester. Edurne, who performs under her first name only, is a household name in Spain although she is relatively unknown in Britain. She has enjoyed chart success with several songs from her five albums, including the lead single from her first album reaching number five in the Spanish charts. From 2007 to 2013 she played Sandy in a Spanish production of the musical Grease. She has also appeared in the Spanish version of Strictly Come Dancing and has spent the past seven months co-presenting a comedy show on Spanish TV. De Gea and Edurne met during the recording of a charity CD in November 2010, just a few months before David moved to Manchester. He was far less known in his native country than his famous girlfriend. Eurovision: 'Perhaps this is the most important thing that has happened in my career ever. I know it's a huge challenge and a huge responsibility and I will give it my best shot,' Edurne (pictured) said . She has been dating Old Trafford shot-stopper de Gea, who is five years younger than her, for the past four years. They have spent much of their time thousands of miles apart following his decision to sign for Manchester United in June 2011 for 17.8 million pounds, a British record for a goalkeeper. Edurne stayed in Spain when her boyfriend moved to the UK so she could focus on her career. Although their careers mean they spend most of their time apart at the moment, she says she confides in David 100 per cent. But she warned: 'I'm not jealous and you have to have trust in your partner but I wouldn't understand it if the person I'm with was unfaithful. I would erase him from my life.' Speaking last April, the Spanish singer admitted: 'These years with David have brought me so many things and continue to do so. 'We're very good together and complement each other very well. 'I'm very happy by his side. I couldn't ask for more in that respect. 'It's obviously difficult with him being so far away so much of the time and I'd love not to have to have a long distance relationship. 'But while David's happy, I'm going to support him whatever he decides. 'For him, his career is the most important thing at the moment and for me as well. 'We support each other and respect each other as we should. And although I'd love him to be a bit nearer, Manchester is only two hours away by plane and whenever we've got a bit of free time we try to see each other.' Edurne will perform a song entirely in Spanish called Amanecer - 'Dawn' in English. She presented the song to Spain's state broadcaster as part of her Eurovision bid ahead of today's announcement. Hinting she was hoping to bring fans important news two days ago, she posted a picture on Twitter of her with her washboard stomach under a palm tree in a bikini. The message alongside it said: 'Batteries recharged 100 per cent, prepared for everything awaiting me this year.' This year's Eurovision Song Contest, the 60th, will be held in the Vienna Stadthalle. The two semi-finals will be held on May 19 and May 21, and the grand final on May 23. 'I'm very happy and am looking forward to May to give it my all,' Edurne added. 'Perhaps this is the most important thing that has happened in my career ever. I know it's a huge challenge and a huge responsibility and I will give it my best shot.'

"Secret Tory files about the private lives of MPs are to be opened up for an inquiry into widespread child abuse at the heart of the establishment. David Cameron has ordered the Conservative Party’s whips’ office to hand over any evidence to investigators trying to uncover historic child abuse in Westminster. It comes after the extraordinary revelation that the government of former Prime Minister Edward Heath could cover up scandals involving MPs and ‘small boys’ in return for loyalty. David Cameron has ordered the Conservative Party’s whips’ office to hand over any evidence to investigators trying to uncover historic child abuse in Westminster . Tim Fortescue revealed how the whip’s office, which rules over MPs for the party leadership, would try to ‘get a chap out of trouble’ in return for loyalty. He served as a whip between 1970 and 1973. Mr Heath himself pioneered the keeping of a ‘dirt book’ about MPs' private lives to turn to his political advantage. Mr Fortescue made the extraordinary comments in a 1995 documentary for the BBC, entitled Westminster's Secret Service. The former Tory MP, who died aged 92 in 2008, claimed he could help MPs with scandals 'involving small boys' in order to exert control over them to make sure they vote in line with their party's intentions. Mr Fortescue said: ‘For anyone with any sense, who was in trouble, would come to the whips and tell them the truth, and say now, 'I'm in a jam, can you help?'. ‘It might be debt, it might be... a scandal involving small boys, or any kind of scandal in which... a member seemed likely to be mixed up in, they'd come and ask if we could help and if we could, we did. ‘And we would do everything we can because we would store up brownie points... and if I mean, that sounds a pretty, pretty nasty reason, but it's one of the reasons because if we could get a chap out of trouble then, he will do as we ask forever more.’ The Prime Minister has now written to Home Secretary Theresa May informing her that the Tory Party had to ‘co-operate fully’ with the Home Office’s inquiry into child sexual abuse. It means the ‘dirt books’ will be scrutinised by Home Office officials. Former Tory MP Tim Fortescue, who died in 2008, revealed in a 1995 interview how the whip’s office, which rules over MPs for the party leadership, would try to ‘get a chap out of trouble’ in return for loyalty . They are not household names, but whips wield extraordinary power in the shadows of Westminster. They are charged with ensuring party members turn out for votes, and vote the way their party wants. One way to encourage loyalty  is to help them when they get into trouble, and keeping it secret. Before becoming Prime Minister, Edward Heath was Tory chief whip from 1956 to 1959. During this time he gathered information, gossip and intrigue about every member of the party, and used it to his advantage. The file became known as the 'dirt book', and successive administrations have used the same tactic to keep MPs in line, covering everything from teenage misdemeanours and extra-marital affairs to allegations of law-breaking. Mr Heath once said: ‘I acted on the principle that the more you know about the people you are speaking for, and the more they know about you and what you are being asked to do, the better.’ Mr Cameron’s decision came in a response to a letter from the campaigning Labour MP John Mann, the Telegraph reported this morning. In it he urged party leaders to ‘put all other considerations aside and urgently uncover and pass on any information relating to child abuse in your political party. He wrote: ‘In particular every living Whip needs to be questioned by their party on any evidence or rumours that were circulating at the time.’ In his reply Mr Cameron said: ‘The Conservative Whip’s Office and our Party headquarters will co-operate fully with the inquiry and I have written to the Home Secretary to make this clear. ‘Of course, any information regarding potential criminal activity of any nature – past or present – should always be passed to the Police without delay.’ Mr Fortescue's damning revelations were first raised in the Commons by the Labour MP Lisa Nandy last year. She said Mr Fortescue’s interview was ‘just one powerful example of how personal and political interests can conspire to prevent justice from happening’. Miss Nandy called for the child abuse inquiry to consider ‘not just the police and social services but will also look at what happens at the heart of power’. She added: ‘If those systems are found to exist today, [they must] be overturned, whether that makes life uncomfortable for political parties, whether it makes life uncomfortable for Parliament, or whether it makes life uncomfortable for the Government itself.’ Tory Mark Reckless also asked if the inquiry would ‘consider any allegations or evidence held by the whips’. Mrs May, the Home Secretary, insisted no part of society would be off limits in the inquiry. ‘It is not my intention that political parties should be outside the scope of the inquiry,’ she said. ‘I think this has to be wide-ranging, it has to look at every area where it is possible that people have been guilty of abuse and we need to learn lessons to ensure that the systems we have in place are able to identify that and deal with it appropriately.’ Mr Fortescue was a Tory whip in the Edward Heath's government between 1970 and 1973 . She stressed that the inquiry panel will not be investigating specific allegations, which would be a matter for the police. ‘It is looking across the board at the way things have been approached in the past and asking that question as to whether, and I expect to draw this quite widely, people did have in place the proper protections for children or not and if not, what are the gaps, are those gaps still existing today, and what do we need to do to make sure that those gaps are filled?' ‘I would expect that as much information as possible is given to the panel to enable them to do that.’ Whistelblower Peter McKelvie has claimed a 'powerful elite' of at least 20 prominent establishment figures formed a VIP paedophile ring that abused children for decades. The former child protection officer first raised the alarm about high profile individuals engaged in child sex abuse.","Cameron has ordered Tory Party to open up records to child abuse probe .

"More than 100 corpses, many of them children, have been found washed up in a shallow tributary of the River Ganges. Officials do not suspect a crime, and instead believe the dead were given water burials. It is Indian custom not to cremate unwed girls, and many poor people cannot afford cremation. But their discovery has sparked renewed concerns about the health of the Ganges, a sacred river where millions of Hindus cremate their dead. Grim find: Some of the more than 100 bodies found washed up in a tributary to the River Ganges, who are believed to be people whose families could not afford to cremate them or else girls given water burials . Macabre: Bodies are seen floating in Ganges river near Pariyar. Officials do not suspect a crime, but instead believe the dead were given water burials . The 102 bodies were found floating near the village of Pariyar, in Uttar Pradesh, India's most-populous state. They were too badly decomposed for post-mortem examinations or identification, officials said. DNA testing is being done to determine where the bodies might have come from. 'Once we will complete all the legal formalities, these bodies will be buried to avoid spread of diseases,' Sub-Divisional Magistrate Saryua Shukla said. Television footage showed dogs and birds feeding on the bloated and decaying bodies floating in the stream, whose waters are thought to have receded recently. Police inspector general Satish Ganesh said they were probably given river burials upstream at a cremation area known as Pariyar Ghat before becoming stranded in shallow water. Millions of Hindus practice open-air cremation, with the ashes of loves ones scattered in the revered but heavily polluted Ganges. Their discovery has sparked renewed concerns about the health of the Ganges, a sacred river where millions of Hindus cremate their dead . Scavenger dogs and crows gather around dead human bodies that are floating in Ganges river . But poor families who cannot afford enough wood and other materials for the burning ceremony sometimes place the bodies in the water, while others are not cremated entirely. While it is illegal to dispose of the dead in rivers, some practicing Hindus also believe that giving an unwed girl a water burial will ensure she is born again into the family. The bodies of some holy men are also placed in the river instead of being cremated, in accordance with tradition. The Hindu nationalist government of Narendra Modi has vowed to clean up the Ganges. But the discovery of so many bodies in one place has intensified environmental and health concerns. Hindus bathe in the Ganges as an act of ritual purification, but the 1,600-mile river flowing from the Himalayas to the Bay of Bengal is full of sewage and industrial waste and increasingly suffers from water shortages. Devotion: Hindus bathe in the Ganges as an act of purification, but the 1,600-mile river from the Himalayas to the Bay of Bengal is full of sewage and industrial waste and increasingly suffers from water shortages . An activist said damming - including in the upper reaches of the Ganges basin - meant there was not enough water to flush the bodies downstream and help with their breakdown. 'The problem is that there is not enough river flow that is being maintained for the Ganga river,' said Mallika Bhanot of the nonprofit Ganga Ahvaan, which is working to preserve the river. 'These traditions (of placing the dead in the river) are actually becoming a health hazard with the dead bodies rotting instead of flowing off in the river,' she told CNN-IBN news channel. 'Earlier it used to flow into the river and the fishes and everything used to feed on it and it was something that was going (on) harmoniously (with nature).' Villagers first noticed the bodies on Tuesday, when many had become stuck on a river bank with dogs and vultures circling the area. A local official earlier reported that 80 bodies have so far been retrieved but warned the figure wwould rise. 'There could be around 100 bodies but we are yet to get an exact number,' district magistrate Saumya Agarwal told AFP by phone from Unnao district. 'It seems that as the water level has receded in the river, these bodies have surfaced.' 'We are trying to figure out the reason. We have sent a team of doctors on the spot to collect the samples from bodies to investigate the case,' she added. The narrow river breaks off from the Ganges just before passing Pariyar, about 17 miles from the state capital of Lucknow. 'It seems these were in water for very long,' police officer Ram Chander Sahu said.","Discovery sparks renewed concerns about the health of the River Ganges .

"Useful as a mixer: Coca-Cola is the world’s best-known brand. In 2012, more than 1.8 billion people in more than 200 countries drank a Coke every day . Coca-Cola is the world’s best-known brand. In 2012, more than 1.8 billion people in more than 200 countries drank a Coke every day — that’s about one can or bottle for every four human beings on the planet. To create all the world’s Coke takes 79 billion gallons of water every year, added to a secret syrup of sugar (or high-fructose corn syrup), caffeine, coca leaf extract and flavourings. And an estimated eight thousand billion gallons of water is used to make the bottles and cans each year. When chemist John Stith Pemberton, from the U.S. state of Georgia, created the original Coca-Cola formula in 1886 in a pharmacy in the state capital Atlanta, he labelled it a ‘brain tonic’. The first advertisements promised that it ‘Cures Morphine and Opium Habits and Desire for Intoxicants’. Pemberton’s inspiration was a popular concoction called Vin Mariani, created by Angelo Mariani, a chemist from Corsica in 1863. It consisted of Bordeaux red wine infused with a sizeable pinch of cocaine, which was legal in most countries in the 19th century, and was said to give a galvanic energy boost. The anti-alcohol Temperance movement in the Deep South of the U.S. was opposed to Vin Mariani. Pemberton’s version was alcohol-free, a soft soda drink made from sugar syrup spiced with citric acid, nutmeg, vanilla, Chinese cinnamon oil and the two ingredients which gave Coca-Cola its name – kola nut powder to deliver a caffeine kick, and coca leaf extract which contained trace quantities of cocaine. The first Coca-Cola outlet was Joe Jacob’s pharmacy in Atlanta. Pemberton sold his undiluted syrup to Jacobs, and customers had their drinks mixed and served at the soda fountain on the first floor, at five cents a glass — sitting at the marble-topped counter, in a magnificent bar with floor-to-ceiling windows. All Pemberton’s quack cures and fruit remedies couldn’t cure his drug addiction. He died in 1888, shortly after selling the formula for Coca-Cola and all his shares in the business to another Atlanta pharmacist, a workaholic Methodist named Asa Candler. The first Coke bottles were all shapes and colours: clear, green, brown, straight-sided, squat and all other sorts. The classic design, known as the ‘hobbleskirt’, that became the brand’s signature did not appear until 1916. Candler’s success didn’t go unnoticed. North Carolina businessman Caleb Bradham launched a copycat product in 1893, without the coca leaf extract. He called it Brad’s Drink. Five years later, looking for a name to convey its fizzy appeal, he rebranded it . . . as Pepsi-Cola. By 1903, concerned at news reports of growing drug abuse in southern U.S. states, the puritanical Candler had decided to remove all traces of cocaine from Coke. His new formula contained ‘de-cocainised’ coca leaves and kola nut powder. It was known by the secret name, Merchandise#5. Anti-drug campaigners attacked America’s growing dependence on caffeine, and called for a national ban on caffeinated beverages. One Texan politician declared in 1909: ‘The reason they put this dope in Coca-Cola is to create a constant craving for more and thus sell the drink.’ Caffeine prices shot up due to shortages in World War I, and in 1918 Coca-Cola halved the quotient to today’s levels – a can contains about half the caffeine of a shot of espresso. The first glass of soda-fountain Coke in 1886 cost five cents — about 80p today. By 1950, the cost of a bottle was about the same. A can of Coke in a supermarket is now about 70p. Uniform: The first Coke bottles were all shapes and colours: clear, green, brown, straight-sided, squat and all other sorts. The classic ‘hobbleskirt’ design that became the brand’s signature did not appear until 1916 . In 1943, Coca-Cola got the order that turned it into a global brand. General Dwight D. Eisenhower, the future U.S. president, dismissed fears over the wartime sugar shortage and placed a contract for six million bottles of Coke each month for the troops. The fast food chain McDonald’s is Coca-Cola’s biggest customer. Their franchise outlets don’t sell ready-mixed Coke in bottles or cans — they purchase the syrup and dilute it with soda dispensers, just as it was first sold in the 1880s. Consumers started to demand decaffeinated drinks, especially coffee, in the Eighties. But that had a surprise bonus for Coca-Cola: the price of caffeine fell as demand plummeted, and the company was able to develop ‘high-energy’ drinks packed with the stimulant . . . which proved popular with students and all-night ravers. After Prohibition in the early Thirties, when breweries were struggling to keep up with demand for beer, the first steel cans were developed. But the acid in fizzy pop started to eat through the metal within weeks. Now the cans have a protective polymer lining. The first Coke cans were manufactured in 1955, for export to military bases. Demand soared, and the company discovered huge savings in recycling costs: tins could be thrown away, but bottles had to be collected and returned to the depot, which meant paying for transport. The ring-pull can was a disaster for bottle-makers. In 1929, there were 1,200 bottle plants in the U.S. but by 1997 there were just 100 left. It was a disaster for beauty spots and beaches too, as consumers simply threw away their cans. ‘Keeping America clean and beautiful is your job,’ one TV advert scolded. Coke chairman J. Paul Austin loathed litter, and became one of the first corporate eco-campaigners. In 1970, he warned, ‘Unless all of us begin immediately to reverse the processes of impending self-destruction, which we have set in motion, this green land of ours will become a graveyard.’ To encourage people to pick up litter, Coca-Cola launched the ‘Bend A Little’ campaign. Posters featured a young woman bending over to clear up cans and rubbish. Another billboard featured a Coke bottle with the slogan, ‘If you love me, don’t leave me.’ Ingredients: To create all the world’s Coke takes 79 billion gallons of water every year, added to a secret syrup of sugar (or high-fructose corn syrup), caffeine, coca leaf extract and flavourings . The trend towards fast food helped soft drink consumption to boom. In 1955, the average American drank 11 gallons of fizz every year. By 2005, that had more than tripled, to 36 gallons . . . and every gallon contains about a pound of high-calorie sweetener. That sweetener was not sugar. In fact, it was an artificial by-product from maize or sweetcorn, grown in the Midwest with U.S. government subsidies and turned into a brown syrupy gel that was sweeter than sucrose. It was called high-fructose corn syrup 55, because it contained 55 per cent fructose and 45 per cent glucose (table sugar is 50/50). The company’s adverts have always celebrated the drink’s popularity. In 1917, billboards boasted how many bottles were drunk: ‘Three Million A Day’. By 1925, it had doubled to ‘Six Million A Day’ — a mere third of a single percent of today’s demand. But the most famous was never an official slogan — the pop song, I’d Like To Buy The World A Coke, was from a 1971 television ad.","Whether you drink it with clinking ice or lace it with rum, the chances are you've had a glass of Coca-Cola.

"World markets were hit by another bout of global economic growth fears today with London shares falling 2.8 per cent as the copper price was hammered. The euro also fell below its 1999 launch value versus the dollar for the first time in nine years, and to six-year lows against the pound. The single currency was hit by growing expectations that the European Central Bank will announce a government bond-buying programme to jumpstart the eurozone economy out of deflation. But wider market jitters were caused by the World Bank slashing its overall growth forecast for 2015 from 3.4 per cent to 3 per cent, citing stagnation in Europe and in Japan. Both the FTSE (above) and the Dow Jones (below) have fallen today  due to a fall in copper prices . The bank also highlighted a slowdown in China's expansion and estimated growth for 2014 at 2.6 per cent, well below earlier expectations of 2.8 per cent. That hammered copper, a leading barometer of industrial demand, whose global price fell 6 per cent - its biggest drop in nine years mirroring the continuing slump in the world oil price, which has more than halved in six months, also on global growth concerns. In turn that hit heavyweight commodity and mining shares in London, sending the FTSE 100 index plunging 180 points to 6,362.2. Leading shares on Wall Street meanwhile opened 1.2 per cent down, and the French and German blue-chip indices were down by a similar amount. The euro fell 0.4 per cent to $1.1728, its lowest level in nine years and below $1.1747, the level it started trading at in Sydney on January 4 1999. The euro also hit a new six-year lows against sterling at 77.40p, making a pound worth €1.295. The fresh falls by the single currency came as an adviser to Europe's top court said that an earlier, unused, ECB bond-buying programme proposed in 2012 was pretty much legal. Pedro Cruz Villalon, advocate general at the court, said while the ECB was entitled to buy bonds and that the Outright Monetary Transactions scheme outlined was 'necessary' and 'proportionate', it would first have to spell out its justification and remove itself from any direct aid programme to a eurozone member state. That ruling was seen as leaving the door open for the central bank to embark on outright money-printing for the first time after its next policy meeting on January 22. Marc Ostwald at ADM Investor Services International said: 'There is nothing in this ruling that blocks QE.' Although the advocate general's opinion looked at a bond-buying blueprint from 2012, designed at the height of the financial crisis to avert a break-up of the euro, it could shape future quantitative easing moves by the ECB in order to combat deflation in the eurozone. Craig Erlam at Alpari said: 'The reason why this ruling was so important was because of the implications it could have had for QE, which the ECB is expected to announce next week.' The euro has fallen sharply against the dollar over the last month and is now below its 1999 launch level . Stimulus expected: ECB boss Mario Dragh is expected to unveil a government bond-buying programme after next week's policy meeting for the eurozone's central bank. He added: 'Had the ECJ ruled against OMTs, Draghi would have come up against significant opposition as the two programs are very similar. Both involve purchasing government bonds on the secondary market, which some have argued constitutes government funding. 'With this hurdle now out of the way, Draghi is free to announce a bond buying program without fearing a backlash from those that previously called it illegal and outside of his remit.' The opinion is another milestone in a long-running dispute between the ECB and Germany, the largest member of the 19-country bloc about the merits of printing money to aid the struggling eurozone economy. The German Constitutional Court had referred the OMT legality question to Europe's top court. Oil prices that have fallen by about 60 percent since June are wreaking havoc on economies that depend on commodities exports. Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov called for a 10 percent spending cut on everything but defence on Wednesday. At the same time, Europe is on shaky ground despite the European Central Bank's bond-buying stimulus plan. 'The global economy is running on a single engine... the American one,' the World Bank's chief economist, Kaushik Basu, said. 'This does not make for a rosy outlook for the world.' Analysts said oil prices would remain weak as a result of oversupply, prompting cuts to price forecasts for 2015 and 2016. Growth for this year is expected to be better than last year partly due to the economic benefits of low oil prices and the strengthening US economy as well as low interest rates, though the pace will be lower than had been thought. Metal bashed: Copper prices saw their biggest drop in nine years, following on from sharp falls in oil prices, as the World Bank slashed global growth forecasts raising worries about demand or commodities . The eurozone is expected to grow by just 1.1 per cent this year, down from a forecast in June that it would expand by 1.8 per cent, according to the World Bank's Global Economic Prospects report. The report expects the UK to grow by 2.9 per cent this year, above the average for high income countries of 2.2 per cent but behind the United States at 3.2 per cent. China is expected to grow by 7.1 per cent this year, a slowdown from 7.4 per cent in 2014, according to the World Bank. Brent crude was lower again today at around $46 a barrel compared to $114 in June. London-listed mining and commodities firms were hammered by the plunge in metal prices, with Glencore shedding £3billion of its value and Anglo American losing more than £1billion of its worth as both plunged by 9 per cent. Meanwhile, Antofagasta fell 8 per cent and BHP Billiton was down 6 per cent. The falls by less commodity-focused European markets were less pronounced, however, with Germany's Dax 30 index and France's CAC 40 index both down around 0.3 per cent, helped by the enhanced ECB bond-buying hopes.","World Bank slashes global growth forecasts due to stagnation in eurozone and Japan .

Top economist says world economy 'running on one engine... the American one'"
"Britain could be richer than America within 15 years if it presses ahead with economic reforms to boost growth, George Osborne said last night. In a bullish assessment, the Chancellor said there was 'no reason why Britain cannot be the richest major economy in the world', provided it continues reforms to upgrade the country's skills base and creaking infrastructure. Mr Osborne also laid out plans for a new fiscal rule that would prevent future governments going on a borrowing spree – and force them to start paying down Britain's debts. Scroll down for video . Chancellor George Osborne used a speech to the Royal Economic Society at the Bank of England to claim the UK could overtake the US to become the most prosperous country in the world . The Chancellor said a string of new reforms would be needed after the election to boost growth. He hinted at a fresh assault on the planning system, saying he wanted to go 'further' to make it easier to build new homes and infrastructure – including a new runway at one of London's airports. And he said the number of youngsters going to university was still 'too low'. But he hit out at 'pessimists' who claimed the Government's austerity programme would prevent a recovery. 'The problem for the pessimists is that the evidence and experience of the last few years increasingly don't support their claims,' he said. 'Instead, the case for optimism is strengthening. If we are willing to take on the vested interests and pursue the right policies with consistency and discipline then there are no limits to what Britain can achieve.' The UK economy is now above its pre-crash peak after seven quarters of growth, which Mr Osborne hopes will continue over the next decade . The value of Britain's biggest companies tumbled by nearly £40billion last night as fears over the outlook for the global economy sent shockwaves around the world. Stock markets fell on both sides of the Atlantic – with the FTSE 100 index down 2.35 per cent or 153.74 to 6388.46 in London – after the World Bank slashed its forecasts for global growth. This reduced the value of Britain's blue-chip companies by £39.1billion. Kaushik Basu, chief economist at the World Bank, said the global economy had become far too dependent on growth in the US. He also warned that the UK would be one of the countries hit the hardest by prolonged stagnation in the eurozone. Mr Osborne added: 'We can become the most prosperous of any major economy by the 2030s, with that prosperity widely shared – an aim I believe is firmly within our grasp.' Treasury sources suggested the target was to make the UK the wealthiest country in the G7 by GDP per head. The UK is currently joint fifth, far behind the United States. In a speech to the Royal Economic Society in London, Mr Osborne said plummeting inflation, which fell to 0.5 per cent this week, was the 'latest challenge' for the economy. But he said it was driven by falling oil prices, which households should 'celebrate'. He added: 'We should not confuse this welcome news for Britain's households as a result of falling oil prices with the threat of damaging deflation that we see in the eurozone.' However, the Tory Chancellor's remarks drew a stinging response from his coalition partners. A Lib Dem spokesman said: 'Osborne's plans are unfair in two very important aspects. Like us, they are planning to balance the books by 2017-18. But they will do that solely by cuts that will hit the working age poor. That is totally unfair. 'In contrast, we will balance the books by a mixture of spending cuts and some taxes on the better off. Once the books are balanced the Tory plan to run a surplus means they will embark on years of cuts to our public services. 'That will damage public services and damage the life chances of those who depend on them. There should be light at the end of the tunnel once the deficit is eliminated. Osborne's plans confirm the Tory's want to turn that light off. Life under a Tory majority government will be grim indeed for all but the best off.'","Britain can be richer than the U.S. within 15 years, George Osborne claims .

"How much you can really learn from putting numbers on something as complex and complicated as sexual behaviour is debatable. But it still doesn’t stop us wanting to do it - and as a point of interest and for rough comparison, sex research stats are definitely worth a browse. Check out how well you score (though don’t make yourself paranoid) by seeing how you stack up against the average… . Tracey Cox reveals the average statistics behind our sexual habits, and the results will surprise you . How much sex do married couples have? This is a ‘How long is a piece of string?’ question because statistics vary wildly depending on your age and whether or not you have children. Accuracy also isn’t helped by the fact that nearly all research focuses on intercourse, rather than other activities like oral sex. We do know, the amount of sex you have falls with age and the length of the relationship. And as a broad (and I mean broad) generalisation of what most long-term couples get up to, this study (based on intercourse) gets it about right. Couples in the age bracket aged 40 to 49 are having sex just as much as partners ten years their junior . The results will surprise you: . 18-24 years old - 35 per cent have sex two to three times a week, 24 per cent four or more times a week . 25-29 - 48 per cent do it a few times a month, 35 per cent a few times a week. 30-39 - 50 per cent do it a few times a month, 21 per cent do it two to three times week. 40-49 - 47 per cent do it a few times a month, 20 per cent two to three times a week. 50-59 - 36 per cent do it a few times a month. 60-69 - 35 per cent do it a few times a month. Is there a way to predict how much sex you’ll have as a couple? You can predict how often you’ll have sex later on by how much sex you have in the first year of your relationship. Nearly all couples experience a drop off point two years in. When are people most likely to have an affair? When life circumstances change dramatically (new job, death of a parent) and also when you’re just about to reach a milestone birthday. If you’re 29, 39, 49 - just about to enter a new decade - you’re highly likely to reflect on your life and identify what’s missing. Tracey says that these facts are a very broad generalisation and may not apply to everyone . If that’s sex, you might well decide to have an affair, according to results of a study of more than eight million men. The researchers also surveyed women and found similar patterns, though not quite as pronounced. Is it normal to fantasise about people other than your partner? A UK study of nearly 20,000 people found 96 per cent of men and 90 percent of women fantasise but 95 per cent of us don’t share them because most of them revolve around people other than our partner. How long does it take men to climax? Once he’s penetrated, most men ejaculate within four to ten minutes. How many men have problems getting an erection? Erectile dysfunction affects more than half of all men aged between 50 and 70 but recent stats indicate one in four men under 40 also frequently have erection problems. How many women orgasm from intercourse alone? Pretty impressive research that analysed 33 studies spanning the last 80 years found only a quarter of women consistently orgasm during intercourse. Recent research suggests the size and placement of the clitoris influence who can and can't. The bigger and closer it is to the vaginal opening, the more likely you are to orgasm from penetration alone. What’s the easiest way to make a woman orgasm? The most reliable is through using a vibrator. Men, rather sensibly, appear to be no longer threatened by this, with 70 per cent of 3,000 men surveyed saying they don’t find them intimidating. How often do people masturbate? Studies vary dramatically but, according to research, a good estimate would be around 75 per cent of men and 45 per cent of women regularly masturbate. In reality, I’d put it higher for both - as would most of the sex therapists and people I know. It’s entirely normal to continue to masturbate, even if you’re having regular sex. If you’re having sex less than ten times a year, you’re officially in a ‘no sex’ marriage. This is the criteria US sex therapists use. Around 20 percent of UK marriages are believed to be ‘no sex’. You’re in a ‘low sex’ marriage if you have sex less than 25 times a year. How many positions do the average couple enjoy? Most couples alternate between two to three favourites. One American study of 10,000 people found 40 per cent of men prefer doggy style, 30 per cent of women like missionary. How many couples have tried anal sex? Around 20 to 35 percent, compared with about five to 10 per cent a decade earlier. Does everyone give oral sex? In one US study, 91 percent of women did, compared to 79 percent of men. How many partners does the average person have in their lifetime? According to 2013 UK Natsal research, men have 11.7 and women have 7.7. If there was a prize awarded to The Sex Statistic That Least Reflects Reality Today, this wins hands down. More than a few young people of this generation have clocked up 20 partners by the time they reach 25.

"Lawyers representing Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev have failed in attempts to convince a federal judge to suspend jury selection because of last week's attacks in France. Lawyers representing 21-year-old Tsarnaev had argued on Tuesday that the bloody events in Paris that left 17 dead had once again placed the 2013 marathon bombings 'at the center of a grim global drama.' According to the lawyers, a delay would have allowed some time 'for the extraordinary prejudice flowing from these events - and the comparison of those events to those at issue in this case - to diminish.' Scroll down for video . Appeal: Lawyers representing Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev (seen in courtroom sketch from January 5) have failed in attempts to convince a judge  to suspend jury selection because of last week's attacks in France . Comparison: The defense had argued that the bloody events in Paris had once again placed the 2013 marathon bombings that killed three and wounded 260 'at the center of a grim global drama' Legal team: Tsarnaev's lawyers, David Bruck, left, Judy Clarke, center, and Miriam Conrad, right, have asked repeatedly to delay the trial and to move it outside Massachusetts . Jury selection for the trial began last week when some 1,350 candidates filled out questionnaires at U.S. District Court in Boston and will continue on Thursday when the first group of 20 jurors is brought in for follow-up questioning, a process known by the Latin phrase 'voir dire.' 'My detailed review of the juror questionnaires in preparation for voir dire has so far confirmed, rather than undermined, my judgment that a fair and impartial jury can and will be chosen to determine the issues in this case,' U.S. District Judge George O'Toole said in a electronic court filing on Wednesday. Lawyers for Tsarnaev had said that potential jurors had been instructed to avoid media reports about their client's case, but were exposed to reports about the massacre in France. 'Almost immediately after the attacks, the press, politicians, and commentators drew parallels between the French attacks and the Boston Marathon bombing,' the lawyers wrote. In the marathon case, authorities say Tsarnaev and his older brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, planned and carried out the attack as retaliation for U.S. wars in Muslim countries. Three people were killed and more than 260 were wounded when twin bombs exploded at the finish line on April 15, 2013. Stepped-up security: A Boston police officer and K-9 dog partol outside the federal courthouse in Boston on Monday for the first day of jury selection in the trial of Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev . On alert: In the harbor near the courthouse, heavily armed US Coast Guard boats plied the waters . Trail begins: More than 1,350 prospective jurors in the Boston bombing trial were called in to federal court in Boston last week to fill out lengthy juror questionnaires . Tamerlan was killed in a shootout with police days after the bombings. Dzhokhar, 21, could face the death penalty if convicted. In the Paris attacks, which began January 7 on the third day of jury selection in Tsarnaev's trial, two gunmen, brothers Cherif and Said Kouachi, burst into the Paris offices of the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, killing 12 people. A total of 17 people were shot dead in a three-day terrorist killing spree, including four hostages inside a kosher deli. The Kouachi brothers and a third gunman, Amedy Coulibaly, were killed by police in two raids. More than 1,350 prospective jurors in the Boston bombing trial were called in to federal court in Boston last week to fill out lengthy juror questionnaires. The judge will begin questioning individual jurors Thursday. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's lawyers have asked repeatedly to delay the trial and to move it outside Massachusetts, where almost everyone seems to know someone connected to the marathon or personally affected by the 2013 bombings. Federal Judge George O'Toole Jr. has rejected the defense requests. Last week, officials in Boston drastically stepped up security measures in light of the attakc sin France. White SUVs from Homeland Security lineed up bumper-to-bumper in front of Boston's federal courthouse Friday while others periodically circled the block. Boston police officers patroled the perimeter on foot, and a dark special operations van was stationed near the entrance. In the harbor nearby, armed US Coast Guard boats plied the waters, and inside the court building officers with dogs roamed the hallways. Bloody Wednesday: A gunman gestures as they return to their car after their attack on the offices of French satirical weekly newspaper Charlie Hebdo (seen at rear) in this still image taken from amateur video shot in Paris January 7 . Perpetrators: Said (left) and Cherif Kouachi (right) targeted the magazine after it repeatedly published cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed, which some Muslims find deeply offensive . Boston police spokesman Michael McCarthy said his department was not aware of any credible threats. Boston's federal courthouse is used to heightened security, most recently in 2013, when notorious gangster James 'Whitey' Bulger was tried, convicted and sentenced there. Law enforcement officials will be keeping a watchful eye on the demonstrators and onlookers the proceedings periodically have drawn, as well as the hundreds of prospective jurors who have been filing in and out of the courthouse complex. They'll likely also be keeping tabs on social media, where Tsarnaev's supporters and bombing conspiracy theorists have been active. The heightened awareness extends to nearby businesses along the rapidly developing waterfront.","Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's lawyers had argued that the events in Paris had again placed the 2013 marathon bombings 'at the center of a grim global drama'

"Bill Cosby's comedy tour lurches from one disaster to the next with his upcoming show in his home state of Massachusetts canceled, just days after he was heckled about sexual assault allegations at a show in Canada. Officials at the Hanover Theatre in Worcester say the promoter of the stand-up comedy show scheduled for February 6 came to an agreement with Cosby's agent to cancel. 'I do think we are relieved. It's not a situation anybody wanted to be in, but our image in the community means a lot to us and I know that there are those who will be relieved not to see him appear here,' said President and Chief Executive Officer Troy Siebels. Scroll down for video . Bill Cosby's comedy tour lurches from one disaster to the next with his upcoming show in his home state of Massachusetts canceled, just days after he was heckled about sexual assault allegations at a show in Canada . He told The Telegram & Gazette that 1,300 tickets had been sold for the show in a venue that seats 2,300. Cosby, whose tour has 21 dates scheduled between Friday and May 2, has had a home in Shelburne, Massachusetts, since the 1970s. The comedian's recent appearances have drawn protesters as the 77-year-old continues to face sexual assault allegations from more than 15 women, with some dating back decades. He has denied the allegations through his lawyer and has never been charged. Two shows at Boston's 1,200-seat Wilbur Theatre on February 8 are expected to go on as scheduled, although The Boston Globe has reported that there are rumors of further protests at those shows. On Friday night hecklers stood up and chanted repeatedly 'we believe the women' during the third and final performance of Cosby's Canadian tour in London, Ontario. The Woman Abuse Working Group protest the Bill Cosby standup show outside the Hamilton Place Theatre in Hamilton, Ontario, last week . The hecklers were then marched out of the theater as the 77-year-old comedian asked his audience not to react. Ticketmaster is also offering refunds for two shows scheduled for Denver, although organizers are insisting that the performances will go on. 'There are people that are hurting. And this doesn't feel good... this feels uncomfortable,' said Denver Councilwoman Susan Shepherd, who has been vocal about not supporting Cosby. More than 3,000 tickets have been sold for the shows, which are set to take place in downtown Denver on Saturday amid planned protests. Chuck Morris, president of AEG Live, the promotion company hosting Cosby, says he understands the concerns some may have regarding Cosby's visit. Officials at the Hanover Theatre in Worcester say the promoter of the stand-up comedy show scheduled for February 6 came to an agreement with Cosby's agent to cancel . Cosby, whose tour has 21 dates scheduled between Friday and May 2, has had a home in Shelburne, Massachusetts, since the 1970s . But he adds that because the comedian hasn't been charged with a crime, he has a moral obligation to allow the shows to happen. Attorney Gloria Allred plans to be in Buell on Saturday to join a protest planned for outside the theater. Before the protest she is holding what she calls a 'Teach In' with a Cosby accuser at the Crawford Hotel, inviting the public to learn how to 'support alleged victims.'","Bill Cosby's tour lurches from one disaster to the next with February 6 Massachusetts show getting canceled .

"A powerful new anti-bullying campaign sees a group of teenagers read out the heartbreaking social media messages they sent to their friends - who committed suicide after being bullied. The emotional video begins with the students reading sentimental messages from their phones before it is shockingly revealed that they were written to their friends after they had taken their own lives. The thought-provoking 'Too Late' campaign created by Deutsch, N.Y for Champions Against Bullying aims to encourage teenagers to be kind to their peers while they still have the chance. The video opens with a young man reading a message from his phone, which reads: 'You're beautiful and unique in every way.' A teenage girl then follows with her own message, reading: 'Happy 15th to my beautiful best friend. I love you with all of my heart.' Another adds: 'That big smile of yours made my day.' In an heart-wrenching twist, it is then revealed that the messages were written on the real social media accounts of teens who took their own lives after being bullied by their peers. Too late: Teens read messages posted to their friends' social media accounts after they had committed suicide in a new PSA created by Deutsch, N.Y for the nonprofit Champions Against Bullying . Filled with regret: 'Goodnight Jessica. When I wake up tomorrow morning, I'll be thinking of you,' one girl wrote on her friend's social media account after she had taken her own life . The same teenage boy from the beginning of the clip then returns to say, 'Everyone misses you. I just wish you were here to see it. I love you.' The video ends with a reminder for teens to 'Be Nice. Now.' The National Association of School Psychologists estimates that more than 3.2 million youths from sixth to tenth grade are victims of moderate or serious bullying each year. Champions Against Bullying is a nonprofit dedicated to creating a society where children and teens are able live without fear and violence from their peers. Actress and USA Director of the organization Leigh Rachel Faith wrote on the site that she and Founder and Crisis Intervention Specialist Alexandra Penn are proud to announce the heartfelt PSA, noting that the 'response has been incredible'.","The students read postings from real social media accounts of bullying victims who took their own lives in Champions Against Bullying's new PSA .

"Financial problems plaguing Caesars Entertainment and its casino empire in Las Vegas have the company considering a trip to bankruptcy court, possibly as early as Thursday. It doesn't necessarily signal the end of this faux Roman Empire, though. If all goes according to the company's plan, drawn up with its most senior creditors, it should be business as usual for customers - its doors will remain open. Caesars Palace hotel and casino, in Las Vegas is pictured, as they try and find a way of cutting debt . 'Caesars is, in a certain sense, a Nevada version of 'too big to fail,' said Michael Green, a history professor with the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. U.S. casino-hotel companies are dependent on extra cash in a person's pocket, but perhaps none more than Caesars, which waded into the recent economic downturn already burdened by more debt than any of them - a by-product of a buyout in January 2008 that was largely a wager using other people's money. While competitors found fortune in Asia's casino growth as stateside gambling in Las Vegas and Atlantic City waned, Caesars missed out. And as other companies built arenas and shopping districts on the Strip or casino-hotels in newer gambling markets across the country, analysts say Caesars was reluctant to spend. It went private, then public again to raise cash and created new related companies, shifting its properties from one to another to free them up from the debt cordoned off in one spot, its Caesars Entertainment Operating Co. That's the company now headed to bankruptcy court. Regardless of the maneuvers, 'the fundamentals were not there to support the amount of debt that they had,' said Keith Foley, an analyst with Moody's Investors Service. Apollo Global Management LLC and TPG Capital LP did what a lot of private equity firms were doing at the time when money and loans were easy to come by, buying companies with promise — relying mostly on debt — to add to its portfolio. The gambling industry looked promising. The deal to buy Caesars (then known as Harrah's) was first announced in 2006 during the heyday of Vegas tourism and development. But the deal didn't close until January 2008, several months before Lehman Brothers would go bankrupt, shaking the economy to its core. And it was a nearly $30 billion deal with the two firms taking on more than $10 billion of existing debt and relying on several billion more in bonds to pay for the company. The fountain in front of Caesars Palace hotel and casino in Las Vegas is part of the group's lavish design . In between, the company had cut about 200 people from its corporate staff. Before the year was done, Caesars was cutting more staff and looking for new cash to make its interest payments. Among its casino peers, Caesars' empire remains the largest, employing some 68,000 people worldwide at more than 50 casino-hotels, including Caesars Palace on the Las Vegas Strip. While Caesars Entertainment has seen a steady $8.6 billion or so in revenue since 2009, it's been outpaced by Las Vegas Sands Corp., which went all-in in Macau, China, and grew every year to post revenue of $14.5 billion in 2013. Las Vegas Sands made a $2.3 billion profit that year. Caesars lost $2.9 billion. Caesars has lost money each year for the last five years. Still, the company unveiled its High Roller observation wheel and newly renovated hotels on the Strip: The Linq and The Cromwell. It hired headliners for shows at The Colosseum inside Caesars Palace. All the while, it was shifting and shuttering other assets. Last year, the company closed properties in Atlantic City, London and Mississippi and said it would cut its global workforce by less than 1 percent. 'They're going to have to become a little leaner,' said Chris Jones, an analyst for Union Gaming Group. He added that he doesn't expect any more properties to shut down and expects the plan will free up Caesars to reinvest where it hasn't, including the gambling floor. The company faces irked creditors, a few who have tried to force the casino giant into bankruptcy against its will this week. Others have sued, claiming the company ransacked Caesars Entertainment Operating Co. of most of its valuable assets. Caesars called the claims meritless and alleges some of its holdout creditors are hoping for the company's demise in order to win wagers predicting as much. Despite the acrimony, the company says that after months of negotiations it has more than 60 percent of the holders of its first-priority debt on board with its plan. The plan would shed $10 billion in debt from its weighed-down operations division, leaving it with $8.6 billion and winnowing its annual $1.7 billion in interest payments to $450 million. Senior creditors who OK'd the plan would get cash and new debt to make them whole.","Last year the company closed properties in Atlantic City, London and Mississippi .

"California animal control discovered an eight-foot alligator surrounded by the bodies of two cats at a suburban Los Angeles home on Monday. The female crocodile named Jaxson was found in a box with a lid at the home of Laura Mattson, who had been caring for the reptile  for years, possibly decades. 'It was found under foliage and debris. You had to be looking for it to locate it,' said Mark Salazar, of field operations director for Los Angeles Animal Services, who said experts estimate Jaxson is 40 years old. Scroll down for video . Later gator: Authorities discovered an eight-foot crocodile Jaxson being kept at the home of Laura Mattson, who provided a photo of Jaxson among several kittens to show how docile the animal was . Los Angeles Zoo officials impounded and moved the reptile (pictured), estimated to be about 40 years old . Mattson said her late husband Jim brought Jaxson into the family when it was a baby. She lamented the fact that animal control had removed it from the property. 'It's like losing part of my family and plus losing part of Jim. So now I've lost him too,' Mattson told ABC. After finding two dead cats alongside Jaxson, authorities said they believe Mattson was feeding the felines to the alligator, a claim she and her brother deny. 'Now we lost the alligator. And now they're making statements that shouldn't be making because nobody's feeding cats to the alligator,' said Mattson's brother Ron Gorecki. 'We got plenty of money to feed whatever we have to feed,' he added. Mattson explained she cared for several neutered feral cats at her home, telling NBC the alligator had been hand-fed 'hot dogs and chicken for 36 years.' Habitat: The female crocodile, believed to be 37 years old, was found in a box with a lid, where Mattson kept her to keep her from being taken by officers . Housepet: Mattson claimed her late husband Jim brought the gator into the family when it was a baby, and that losing it was like losing a part of her husband . Fed: Mattson's brother Ron Gorecki denied any claim they were feeding cats to the alligator and said Jaxson was part of the family . 'She was so docile, she would let rats eat the hot dogs out of her mouth,' Mattson told the station. Officers still paid a visit to neighbors in the area to ask whether any small pets had disappeared in the past. Authorities had been hunting around the neighborhood of Van Nuys for the animal since 2014, when animal control received a call about an alligator and arrived on Mattson's doorstep. A search of the property came up empty then, but officers returned Monday after a neighbor reported seeing the gator. Mattson refused to allow animal control to enter the home, so officers went to a judge to obtain a search warrant and finally found Jaxson. It is illegal to keep wildlife in Los Angeles without a permit. For the time being, Jaxson will be held at the Los Angeles Zoo while animal control conducts an investigation. Mattson said the animal was only in the box to keep animal services from taking it, but also claimed she had been looking to find a home for Jaxson, and tried calling the zoo, but it was full. 'I understand now it's not legal, but when it becomes a pet, it becomes your family,' her brother told ABC. 'When it becomes your family, you protect the pet and the people involved. That's all there is to it,' he added.","The animal was found in the backyard of Van Nuys resident Laura Mattson .

"A disabled businessman has been banned from building a bungalow on his own land because his garden falls outside the village boundary. Polio sufferer Carl Weininger wanted to rent out his £500,000 house in West Haddon, Northamptonshire and move into a smaller property which would be modified for wheelchair access. But council plans show that, while Mr Weininger's house is in the village, his garden is technically in open countryside and is therefore protected from development. Scroll down for video . Plans: Carl Weininger, pictured outside his home, had hoped to build a second property in his garden that would be modified for wheelchair access. The 63-year-old has no use of his left leg or his right arm . Rejected: Planning officers at Daventry District Council told Mr Weininger that he couldn't build the proposed bungalow (site marked in yellow) on his property (red) as his garden is outside of the village boundary (blue) The 63-year-old  has no use of his left leg and has not been able to use his right arm since a devastating motorcycle crash in 1969. The grandfather-of-one planned to build and move into a specially bungalow in his 9,700sq ft garden - just yards from his own five-bedroom detached house. He was stunned when planning officers at Daventry District Council told him he couldn't because the village of West Haddon's boundary line runs through the middle of his land. 'The logic defeats me. How can my house be in a village yet my garden not be?,' he said. 'It is a long way to another village so my garden is classed as being in open countryside. If it is open countryside then it can't be a garden but it is my garden, it isn't a  field.' Mr Weininger moved into the house in 1993 and his garden was included in the village boundary. But in 1997 the council redrew the boundary line which effectively marked his land as 'open countryside' and therefore protected from development. Space to develop: The grandfather-of-one planned to build and move into a specially bungalow in his 9,700sq ft garden (pictured) - just yards from his own five-bedroom detached house . The ruling means building is banned under rules to stop 'infill' - creeping developments causing villages to merge together. Mr Weininger claims that while has been banned from building on the land, another developer has got the go-ahead for 100 new homes on land just yards away from the 'infill' boundary. He said: 'The line zig-zags round my house yet nobody seems to be able to tell me why it couldn't have been drawn a few metres the other way. 'I asked the parish council and they said there was a consultation but there wasn't a consultation with me. Defeated: Mr Weininger, pictured outside his home, said he would not challenge the ruling legally as it would 'cost him lots and lots of money' 'It is ridiculous. I haven't appealed because I was told I would have no chance because of the policy about the boundary line. 'So much money is wasted by councils on their own salaries and things at the top. I don't blame the planning officer because they are just doing their job. 'I blame the people that made the plan and did it with very little thought other than how much is this going to benefit the council. 'They don't seem to look at people anymore. It's a joke, houses come and go but it is residents that are important, houses don't have feelings.' Mr Weininger said he always planned to build a bungalow eventually because of the injuries caused by the polio and motorbike crash, . He wrote to the council in 2008 after he separated from his wife - leaving him living in the large house on his own. He added: 'I wrote to the council and what I got back to my astonishment was a preordained rule that there was no way I could build in my garden because of the village boundary line. 'I went back and looked at the plans and saw the line went straight across my back garden. 'I bought the house in 1993 and I only would have seen the Land Registry plans which it isn't on. 'I was told categorically that the policy about village confines were instigated and used from 1997.I was told I would have been consulted but I wasn't.' Mr Weininger said that he had expected the 100 homes nearby to receive council approval as 'Daventry District Council has to build so many houses in the next five years and they haven't.' 'The council want the houses because it increases rates, my situation is irrelevant to them, they are not bothered about me. 'I won't challenge it legally because it would cost me lots and lots of money.' Protected: This 2010 map shows the planned conservation area of West Hadden, with Mr Weininger's property marked in red. Building is banned in open countryside to stop villages slowly merging together . He added that he now might be forced to sell his property and move away, but said he did not want to leave the village where his family live. He said: 'All I really wanted was to build a home that would make living more manageable in future years and keep me out of hospital. 'I hate the thought of becoming a burden on the state, but it seems I'm being forced down that road.' A spokesperson for Daventry District Council said: 'The Local Plan, which defines the confines of the village, has been in place since 1997 and no changes have since been made. 'In recent years we have not received any planning applications nor pre-application enquiries for any development at Mr Weininger’s property but if we do so they will be considered on their own merits. 'We understand that West Haddon Parish Council are in the early stages of preparing a Neighbourhood Development Plan for their village and consulting residents further and if they proceed their plan will be subject to a local referendum. 'When the Local Plan was being prepared in the mid-1990s it went through various stages of consultation which included giving local people the opportunity to give their views on the proposals.'","Polio sufferer Carl Weininger wanted to build home with wheelchair access .

"Amanda Berry and Gina DeJesus have written a book about their decade-long ordeal in Cleveland . Amanda Berry and Gina DeJesus, two of the women held captive and sexually abused in a Cleveland home for nearly a decade, have penned a book about their harrowing ordeal. The women, who escaped the home with a third kidnapping victim, Michelle Knight, in May 2013, will release the memoir, 'Hope: A Memoir of Survival in Cleveland', on April 28. In the book, they each describe how they were lured to the home by kidnapper Ariel Castro - Berry in 2003, when she was 16, and DeJesus in 2004, when she was just 14. Following their capture, they stayed hopeful by watching news reports of their families' searches. 'They never gave up, and that gave us strength,' the book says, according to People.com. 'We videotaped news coverage of them holding vigils and replayed those tapes on our most desperate days.' The book also details how Castro psychologically, emotionally and sexually abused them, People.com reported. They recall their daily fear as they were chained to beds, starved and sexually abused - but also how they banded together to celebrate birthdays and the birth of Berry's daughter, Jocelyn, now eight. 'Our story is not just about chains, lies and misery,' they say in the book. 'That was Ariel Castro's world. Our story is about overcoming all that. 'We survived, we are free, we love life. We were stronger than Ariel Castro.' Survivors: Berry, left, and DeJesus, center, wrote about the years of abuse they suffered at the hands of Ariel Castro and how they survived. They are pictured with fellow survivor Michelle Knight last year . The women eventually escaped on May 6, 2013 after Berry ran through the open front door and signaled to neighbors for help. Castro was arrested and pleaded guilty to 937 counts, including kidnapping and rape, and sentenced to life in prison plus 1,000 years. A month later, the 53-year-old hanged himself in his prison cell. The women have since been working to rebuild their lives and reconnect with their families. The three women split $1.4 million in donations collected after their escape. Berry, now 28, and DeJesus, 24, recently visited the White House where they met Obama and Vice President Joe Biden, and in February last year, Ohio Governor John Kasich honored the three women with the state's courage award. Kidnapped: DeJesus, left, was just 14 when she was kidnapped, while Berry, right, was a day shy of 17 . House of horrors: They were kept chained inside Castro's Cleveland home, pictured, for almost a decade until Berry escaped and called for help in May 2013. The house was demolished two months later . Sick: Castro, pictured at his sentencing in August 2013, hanged himself in prison in September 2013 . They have lost contact with their fellow survivor, Michelle Knight, as they try to heal on their own. 'I love them and they love me,' Knight told People last year. 'Hopefully we'll all get back together again.' Knight, who was 21 when Castro lured her to his home in August 2002, released her own book, 'Finding Me: A Decade of Darkness, a Life Reclaimed', last May and it spent five weeks on the New York Times Bestsellers List. DeJesus and Berry have penned their memoir with the help of Pulitzer Prize winners, Mary Jordan and Kevin Sullivan, and it will be published by Penguin. On Amazon, the Kindle version is priced at $14.99, while hardcover is $21.11.

"It is a nightmare we have all face - a cracked screen that means a long wait for a replacement. However, Google has unveiled a new 'modular' handset that allows users to simply slot in new modules - including the screen - themselves. It plans to launch the radical handset, which allows users to add everything from an extra battery to a thermometer, in Puerto Rico this year. Scroll down for video . Google plans to have dozens of modules available for the handset, allowing users to customeise every aspect of it . Each phone . will have a central 'spine' and an endoskeleton - nicknamed 'endo' - . made of ribs that the individual modules will clip on to. There will be three different sized . endos - including mini, medium and large - to rival the existing range of . phones currently on the market, from compacts to phablets. Ara phones will be able run on multiple batteries - when one battery dies, it can be detached and replaced with a full battery module. Larger phones will be able to accomodate either larger, or additional modules, than the mini will. The company will partner with Mexico-based carrier Claro and local carrier Open Mobile as part of a pilot program that will allow people to choose their own hardware based on their needs and interests. It will be sold from free-standing stores that look like food trucks, said Jessica Beavers, a Google marketing executive. She said Puerto Rico was chosen in part because more than 90 percent of households on the island of nearly 3.7 million people use a cellphone and 77 percent of Internet access occurs through mobile devices. 'All of this makes for a truly interesting carrier landscape,' she said at a module developers conference at Google's headquarters in California. 'Mobile devices are a huge part of daily life' in Puerto Rico. The pilot program is still being developed, but Beavers said she envisions stores first opening in the capital of San Juan, followed by Ponce, the island's second largest city. Stores would eventually open in other cities. Google would manufacture and sell the phone frame as well as modules created by individual manufacturers that can be added to it like Legos. Modules would range from a screen to a camera to speakers to even a pedometer, depending on people's needs. 'We want people to walk away and say, 'That was really freaking awesome,'' Beavers said. Google says it's too early to say how much the phone could cost, but it might be in the $50 to $100 range. Google says the handset will allow users to replace their own screen in seconds ashould they break it . The company has had success with its Chromebook computers, which are lightweight, low-priced laptops that require Internet connections to access most programs and other features, but it relies on outside manufacturers for the product. It has had more difficulty selling devices it makes on its own. Google Glass, its Internet-connected eyewear, still hasn't made it to the mass market more than two years after its release to developers and a digital media player called the Nexus Q was scrapped within a few months of its unveiling in 2012. Rafael Leon, a Radio Shack employee in San Juan, said he expects many Puerto Ricans to embrace the modular phone, noting that they are always eager to buy the newest mobile devices and don't mind standing in long lines. 'They always want to be ahead with what's newest, with what's innovative,' he said, adding that despite the island's long economic slump, cellphone sales have always been good. 'You tell them it costs $800 and they're not fazed.' Others took a more reserved stance. Carl Lizarraga, a San Juan engineer, said he was surprised by the announcement. 'Typically, the island isn't used as a testing ground for this sort of project,' he said. 'I'm not planning on buying it yet as at this point it seems more a gimmick than anything else. When the idea is further developed and able to compete with the current flagships, I would consider it.' New modules are simply clicked into the frame of the handset . Google has even shown off a 'night vision' module for the phone . Giancarlo Gonzalez, chief information officer for Puerto Rico's government, said in a phone interview from Google's headquarters that the company approached him and other officials in mid-2014 with their proposal. He said he hopes the pilot program grows into something bigger that will allow programmers in Puerto Rico to develop modules and export them. 'It would represent great technological growth,' he said. Paul Eremenko, the head of Project Ara, said 'The design must overcome the connotations of boxiness and brick-like that people associate with modularity,' he said. Google is working with New Deal Design on the project. The back of the Ara handset allows modules to be quickly removed and replaced. Speakers, cameras, lights, batteries and fitness sensors can all be put on the phone when needed - then simply removed. The prototype handset, which Google showed off for the first time this week - although it failed to load fully. 'It's called the Grey Phone because it's meant to be drab grey to get people to customise it,' Mr Eremenko said. The phones will be able run on multiple batteries - when one battery dies, it can be detached and replaced with a full battery module. Lower-resolution cameras can be swapped with higher-res versions, and users will be also be able to 3D print replacement parts. By printing their own parts, users will also be able to customise them. Google has revealed each phone will have a central 'spine' and an endoskeleton - nicknamed 'endo' - made of ribs that the individual modules will clip on to. Google's much-anticipated modular smartphone could be available in January 2015 for as little as $50 (£30) There will be three different sized endos - including mini, medium and large - to rival the existing range of phones currently on the market, from compacts to phablets. Larger Grey Phones will be able to accommodate more modules than the mini will, for example. Google's kit describes various modules including batteries, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chips, cameras, speakers and more. In theory, any sensor that can be fitted to a module will be able to attach to a device, and while Google will make the shell, these modules will be made by other companies. One of the proposed final designs for the project. Each module clips in and out depending on what feature the user wants. At the developer conference, Google outlined a time frame for development for the modular device, attempting to attract hardware and software developers. The main frame of the Grey Phone will be built to last around five to six years, according to Mr Eremenko, allowing users to upgrade their phones regularly. He added that the basic framework can be used to build any number of devices, beyond a simple smartphone. 'If it can be other things, we encourage that,' Mr Eremenko said but added that Google intends Ara to be 'ultimately a great smartphone first and foremost'. Project Ara was developed as a result of Google's purchase of Motorola and its Advanced Technology and Projects group. It is based on the Phonebloks designs by Dutch inventor Dave Hakkens. It was initially assigned to Motorola, and had been planned to add to the firm's existing range, but Google sold the phone maker to Lenovo in January.","Project Ara consists of frame, screen, Wi-Fi connection and processor .

"Unlike traditional speed cameras, the new gantry devices, pictured, are painted grey, making them harder to spot . Motorists risk heavy fines following the introduction of a new generation of speed cameras on Britain’s busiest motorway. Digital technology has been introduced to catch drivers breaking the 70mph speed limit on the M25 in Kent. It was reported last night that the devices – dubbed ‘stealth cameras’ by critics – have caught almost 700 drivers in just two months. Unlike traditional yellow speed cameras, the gantry devices are painted grey, making them harder to spot for drivers. The same technology is being introduced on a northern section of the M25 and also parts of the M1, M3, M60 and M6. Front and rear-facing cameras are used to verify a vehicle’s speed. And, while conventional devices have to be trained on only one lane at a time, the digital cameras can scan four. They are similar to cameras used during roadworks but do not work on the basis of calculating an average speed over a fixed distance. Motoring groups claim the devices will see thousands of drivers facing at least £100 in fines and points on their licence for straying marginally over the 70mph limit. The Association of Chief Police Officers recommends drivers are not charged unless they exceed 79mph in a 70mph limit zone. Hugh Bladon, one of the founder members of the Alliance of British Drivers, said they did not believe targeting drivers on the motorways was the best way to improve safety and that punishing drivers for exceeding the 70mph limit was often unnecessary. 'The 70mph limit is not a speed that a lot of people bother to observe any more,' he said. 'It was originally brought in as an experiment and was made permanent without any real testing. It was brought in at a time when the stopping power of cars was a bit like stopping an oil tanker, and the maximum speed of most cars was 74mph. We've moved on now, some 50 years later we have cars that stop much more quickly. 'The amount of traffic that exceeds the 70mph limit is enormous. Most people are driving at 80mph on motorways, and these are our safest roads in the country.' Mr Bladon said he did not think using speed cameras on the M25 was appropriate because there are many times, particularly late at night or when there is little traffic, when it is safe to driver faster than 70mph. He also said these should be made more visible, rather than disguised to try and catch drivers out. In the two months since they have been installed on the M25, pictured, almost 700 drivers have been caught breaking the 70mph limit . Where the new cameras will be placed: Several stretches of road are being upgraded to become 'smart motorways', with new speed cameras a part of improvements. Above, a map detailing which will be affected . He added: 'We seem to want to punish drivers rather than help them. Our whole philosophy about speed cameras in this country is wrong. 'In France, for example, if they need to slow traffic down for a particular junction or nasty bend they bit up a great big sign, miles before the camera. We just whack cameras up for no reason whatsoever. 'The idea of a camera should be that you want people to see it and slow down.' Mr Bladon said he believed cameras only looked at a small fraction of the problem and could not test how tired people were or if they had taken drugs or been drinking. He said the best way to make roads safer was to  increase the number of police on the roads. In 2013 the number of people fined for speeding peaked at more than 115,000 - the highest level since 2009. Ministers said the rise was largely due to the increased number of speed cameras that were  in operation for 24 hours a day. In total 115,549 motorists were fined more than £100 that year. It was also announced last year that the maximum fines for motorway speeding that could be imposed by magistrates would rise from £2,500 to £10,000. In 2012-13 the Government collected £284million in speeding fines. Rupert Lipton, managing director of the National Motorists Action Group, said he was 'shocked' officials had decided to use this type of speeding enforcement. He said: 'This is a another missed opportunity. The Highways Agency is introducing so called ‘smart motorways’ but relying on dumb enforcement. It is policing by numbers, by remote control. 'The completely ignored key to road safety is driver training. If drivers who had competed some advanced training ‘earned’ the right to drive at a higher speed on motorways, many millions would take such training, learn proper observation, anticipation and planning in their driving and accident figures would plummet. Drivers would even be prepared to pay out of their own pockets and the benefits would affect all roads not just motorways.' Professor Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC Foundation, told The Times: ‘The law is the law but it needs to be applied consistently. Many constabularies have followed the ACPO guidance. ‘If the new approach is one of zero tolerance then it needs to be equally applied across the network and understood by motorists and police forces.’ The Highways Agency said signs warning about speed cameras should be displayed on every gantry of the motorway where they are used. Studies have shown that nine out of ten drivers admit to breaking the motorway speed limit. The Government had planned to raise the limit to 80mph before the proposals were shelved by transport secretary Patrick McLoughlin two years ago. Brake, the road safety group, has previously said that raising the speed limit would cause more accidents and deaths on motorways. The first cameras were installed between junctions five and six of the M25. Kent police figures showed that 668 speeding offences were logged in just over two months. Until now, cameras have mainly been used to keep drivers below 50mph in sections of the network undergoing roadworks. The Highways Agency, which is responsible for the nation’s main roads, is creating so-called ‘smart’ motorways where the hard shoulder can be used as an additional lane to help ease heavy traffic flow at peak times. A spokesman said: 'Variable speed limits on smart motorways are primarily there to smooth traffic flow, reduce congestion and make journeys more reliable. 'Hundreds of thousands of motorists use this stretch of the M25 every day. The vast majority are sticking to the speed limits and are experiencing better journeys as a result of smart motorways. 'There are clear signs where cameras are in place and the new cameras are more visible than the previous versions.'","A new generation of speed cameras being introduced on the M25 in Kent .

"A man who served time in prison for two cold blooded-murders, and who judges recommended should never be released, has been declared a free man. Francis James Carter, 59, was released from the Southern Queensland Correctional Centre, west of Brisbane, on strict parole conditions on Wednesday,The Brisbane Times reports. A spokeswoman from Queensland Corrective Service's Prisoner Location Line confirmed with Daily Mail Australia that Carter was not in custody. His release has prompted Queensland's Attorney-General Jarrod Bleijie to request urgent legal advice regarding the issue and bring attention to the state's minimum non-parole period of 30 years for multiple murders. Scroll down for video . Francis James Carter, 59, was released from the Southern Queensland Correctional Centre, west of Brisbane, on strict parole conditions on Wednesday . Carter, who has only served 25 years in prison, was first locked behind bars in 1989 after killing a man for speaking to his girlfriend at a barbeque, according to author Paul B. Kidd. Mr Kidd writes in his book, Never To Be Released, that the murder saw the victim beaten to death with a baseball bat before having his throat cut, his fingers removed with a bolt cutter and his body stuffed into a forty-four gallon drum. 'It was one of the most vicious murders I have ever seen,' the officer in charge of the investigation, Detective Senior Constable Craig Hintz, was recorded as saying by Mr Kidd. Less than a year later, Carter was responsible for a second murder, this time while behind bars at the Sir David Longland Correctional Centre in Brisbane. Police forced Carter onto the floor after catching him following his escape from prison in 1991:  He has served 25 years in prison for killing two men . Less than a year after being convicted for his first murder, Carter was one of three inmates who stabbed a fellow prisoner to death at the Sir David Longland Correctional Centre in Brisbane . His victim was Scott Wallace, a fellow inmate who Carter and two other prisoners were convinced had informed authorities of their foiled escape plan. 'Drunk on home-brew and armed with knives from the kitchen, the murderers mutilated Wallace in is cell by stabbing him about the face, head, neck and body at least twenty times,' Mr Kidd wrote. This crime won Carter a second life sentence and the recommendation that he never be released into the public from Mr Justice de Jersey who 'believed Carter would kill again ""on the most trivial of provocation""'. During trial for the murder, the killer managed to lead a prison escape using a home-made ladder which allowed seven inmates to escape for almost a week. His release has prompted Queensland's Attorney-General Jarrod Bleijie (pictured) to request urgent legal advice regarding the issue and bring attention to the state's minimum non-parole period of 30 years for multiple murders . However Carter's criminal history also extends to include armed robberies and an incident in which he assaulted a prison guard in an attempt to take a set of keys that allowed entrance to the sex offender's yard, The Courier Mail reports. In response to Carter's release this week, Attorney-General Bleijie said: 'We have done more than any other government to ensure violent offenders are kept behind bars. 'We are committed to making this state the safest place to raise a family and we share Queenslanders' frustration when serious offenders are released.'

"The brutal practices of China's street trade in cat and dog meat has been revealed in a shocking report on local television. Chinese street traders caught on TV selling fresh animal meat, proudly explained that the animals are 'humanely' drowned by being shoved in a bag and thrown in a nearby river.

Scroll down for video . Horrible: Dogs and cats are kept in cages in order for customers to pick the animal they want, after which it is 'humanely' drowned by being shoved in a bag and thrown in a nearby river . Street food: The cat, as in this picture, is then skinned, butchered and cooked in front of the customer . The traders at the illegal market on the banks of the Xi River in Foshan city in southeast China's Guangdong province say they started drowning the animals to avoid 'distressing customers'. The traders said that people had complained about seeing the animals killed in front of them, and as a result had come up with the alternative to kill them humanely. After a customer has chosen an animal, the cat or dog is put in a bag and thrown in the river to drown. Trader Ming She told local TV: 'We want to prove our customers that what we sell is fresh unlike some of the shops in town, but with no facilities to kill what we sell out of view, the best and most humane thing to do is to throw them in the water.'

After ten minutes in the water, the animal is skinned and can be butchered in front of the customer or even cooked fresh and eaten straightaway. Following the report on local TV, Foshan city council  announced that it planned to crack down on the market, as the meat could be 'unhealthy'. Council spokesman Guang Kang added: 'It may seem as if the meat is fresh because it is alive, but the source of these animals is unknown and many of them could be diseased or unhealthy for other reasons and we would advise people to stay away from them.' He added that inspectors would be visiting the market and closing down the illegal traders which were damaging the reputation of the city.","Chinese street vendors caught on camera selling dog and cat meat .

"The Duke of York was showered in presents during at least seven international trips last year - which included visits to Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. Under-fire Prince Andrew received scores of  gifts from dignitaries and organisations from around the world  - including an Arctic Monkey's CD, ten boxes of mangoes and an empty photo album. During Andrew's  overseas and UK trips he was handed well over 100 presents, which also included clothing, food, many books and a number of scale models. Prince Andrew takes lunch with Prince Turki bin Abdullah of Saudi Arabia during a visit in November last year. The Saudi royal was one of many to lavish gifts on the British prince, handing him a model of the Al Muraba Palace at which the meal was hosted . The 'gift list' reveals Andrew made at least seven trips abroad last year, receiving gifts from local dignitaries . Prince Andrew and other members of the Royal Family published their 'gift lists' today, detailing everything they have been presented with over the last year. Andrew is a full-time working member of the Royal Family and works around the world to promote economic growth and job creation in the UK. Once nicknamed 'Airmiles Andy' because of his penchant for luxury air travel, he has recently focused his activity on promoting entrepreneurship and technology. An Arctic Monkeys CD and wristband was perhaps the most unlikely gift the senior royal received as part of his duties, being given the present by West Yorkshire children's charity, Kidzaware, during a visit in October. Former First Lady Hilary Clinton was the most famous gift-giver to the Duke, sending him a copy of her book 'Hard Choices'. It was one of a great number of volumes the Duke was sent, which included books on the cars of Havana, the 12th Light Dragoons, Kuwaiti Civil Aviation and the 'Golden Age' of Saudi Arabia. He also received a large amount of treats and snacks, with the Prime Minister of Pakistan sending him 10 boxes of mangoes, a fruit which used to convey best wishes in the South Asian country. The Duke was also given some Kentish fudge, a platter of dates from the Saudi Arabian ambassador and salt and pepper shakers from a university training scheme. Andrew was also sent a platter of dates from Saudi Arabian Ambassador - Mohammed bin Nawaf Al-Saud. He was presented with a decorative metal box from the Crown Prince of Bahrain, Sheik Salman bin Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifa. The Crown Prince pulled out of attending the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's wedding in April 2011 following unrest in Bahrain. Human rights campaigners had petitioned against his attendance because of his government's treatment of protesters. Other gifts Andrew received during his official trip to Bahrain last January included a floral display from Sheikh Khalifa bin Salman al-Khalifa - who has been Bahrain's Prime Minister for the last 43 years. He was handed a number of scale models, including many of buildings, aeroplanes, one a Kuwaiti dow and others of a missile, an elephant and a horse. He was also given cufflinks, a number of ties, a necklace, a turban and a scarf. He also got given a personalised mug of himself and a framed section of Lord Nelson's mainsail, the records show.

During the trip he was given a model dow, two photo albums and two books; one about the history of the country and another entitled 'Airport Civil Aviation Yearbook' Prince Andrew visits a school in Bahrain in January. During his visit to the country he received a decorative metal box, a scarf, a trophy, a floral display and a book entitled 'A Celebration of Modern Bahrain' Over the last month, Prince Andrew has come under fire over his past friendship with convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein, who has been accused in court documents of supplying the royal with an 'under-age' girl, widely named as Virginia Roberts. Ms Roberts - now said to be a married mother-of-three in her 30s - alleges that between 1999 and 2002 she 'was forced to have sexual relations with this prince' in London, New York and on a private Caribbean island owned by Epstein. Buckingham Palace has issued a statement strongly denying the allegations, which it says are 'false and without any foundation'. Andrew was not the only royal to release his gift list today. Among the 27 presents Prince Charles was given for Prince George in Canada last May was a pewter teddy, a bag of chocolate coins and a tartan blanket. The Queen received a dressage crop from the Governor General of Canada, a large wooden coffee grinder from a Jordanian ambassador at a 'Dine and Sleep Party held at Windsor Castle' and two hand-crafted tribal arrows from the Society of Colonial Wars in the State of Maryland. She returned from Northern Ireland in June with a miniature 7 inch throne from the Game of Thrones series.

"The last night of Xinran Ji's life can be told in the videos that tracked the Chinese graduate student from the time he left his apartment to study with other students at the University of Southern California until he returned home hours later covered in blood. In between those still frames taken outside his apartment, police found two cameras that captured footage of a group of teens attacking him as he walked home from school early on the morning of July 24, 2014. The brutal footage was shown on Tuesday in Los Angeles Superior Court as a prosecutor made his case for trying three teens for murder in the incident that raised concerns in China about the safety of students abroad and refocused criticisms about security at USC. Smirking: 16-year-old Alejandra Guerrero appears in court on Monday, as one of four defendants being charged in connection with the death of Xinran Ji, who was beaten by a gang with a bat and a wrench . Alberto Ochoa, 17, appears in Los Angeles Superior Court on Monday with attorney Christopher C. Chaney,  in connection to the 2014 beating death of the USC graduate student . Details were murky in the black and white surveillance videos, but they showed Ji being surrounded by a group of people on a dark street and then, in a subsequent video, being chased as he ran for his life. 'You can just see a scrum, it looks like,' Deputy District Attorney John McKinney said during a break in court, describing one of the videos. USC student Xinran Ji managed to crawl home but was found dead in his bed on July 24 . Authorities say Jonathan Del Carmen, 19; Alberto Ochoa, 17; and Alejandra Guerrero, 16, were trying to rob Ji, 24, when he was beaten with a bat and wrench and left for dead. A fourth defendant, Andrew Garcia, 19, is charged, but his hearing was postponed because his lawyer was ill and another defense attorney raised questions about his mental competency. Garcia blurted out obscenities in court on Monday. All four have pleaded not guilty and are being held without bail. Del Carmen and Garcia could face the death penalty if convicted. Ochoa and Guerrero are charged as adults, but they can only face up to life in prison without the possibility of parole if convicted because of their ages. The preliminary hearing that continues on Wednesday included a witness who testified about being robbed by three of the defendants about an hour after Ji's killing. But the brunt of testimony focused on videos and a trail of blood that led from Ji's apartment to two street locations where the confrontation footage was shot. Ji managed to make it home, where he was found dead in bed later that morning. Ji's roommate said she awoke around 3am and heard sniffling, but thought Ji had a cold, so she went back to sleep, Detective Matthew Courtney testified. When she emerged from her room four hours later, she found blood stains and Ji unresponsive and covered in bloody clothing. Courtney and his partner tracked the bloody trail down the street and around the corner, where they eventually found a pair of broken glasses. The detective and other officers went to USC and several other private building owners to gather at least seven videos that showed the attack on Ji or his alleged assailants driving through the neighborhood before or after the crime. 19-year-old Jonathan Del Carmen, left, in court alongside Andrew Garcia, right. Garcia, 19, is charged, but his hearing was postponed because a defense attorney raised questions about his mental competency. Garcia blurted out obscenities in court on Monday . Cameras have become a ubiquitous witness to life around the campus that sits on the edge of downtown Los Angeles and borders neighborhoods with historically high crime. The school and Los Angeles police beefed up security measures, including more patrols on and around campus, after two Chinese graduate students were murdered outside an off-campus apartment in 2012. Video from the location where Ji was first attacked showed a car pull to the side of the road and a group of people surround him in the street. McKinney said one of the men can be seen hitting Ji with a bat. The student is able to get away, and a second camera caught him as he turned a corner with two others running after him, followed by a car. The second video lasts longer, but most of the action is obscured until Ji stumbles to his feet and leans on a car for a few seconds. McKinney said Ji bled the most at that location. He bled the whole way home, arriving at his front door at 12:48 a.m., where the white T-shirt he was seen leaving in appeared covered in blood.

"Kim Kardashian is not shy about her love of waist training, but according to one expert, the reality star's regular use of a corset to shrink her stomach could be affecting her fertility. The 34-year-old, who told Daily Mail Online about her struggle to conceive a second child with Kanye West, took a selfie of her enviable frame strapped into a black waist trainer on Tuesday. But  Dr Sue Decotiis tells us that the practice of wearing a waist trainer or corset over periods to change ones shape is ‘not healthy.' Scroll down for video . Enviable hourglass: Kim Kardashian pictured on Tuesday wearing a waist trainer - but one expert claims  a corset could reduce blood flow to the tissues and prevent them from expanding to accommodate a fetus . Baby body: Kim, who was pregnant with North West in 2013 (left), began wearing a waist trainer last August (right) and has been thrilled with the results . 'Waist training does not reduce the amount of body fat. The small waist circumference may have been a result of the highly constricting corset that reduced blood flow to the tissues and causing atrophy of these tissues.' She adds: 'For pregnancy, these tissues might not be able to expand to accommodate a developing fetus.' Not all medical experts agree however. Dr Lauren Streicher says wearing a corset while trying to get conceive has 'no effect on fertility or early pregnancy.' Kim told Daily Mail Online about her struggle to conceive last Friday. 'It's been more challenging to get pregnant the second time around,"" she said at the E! International Press Junket in Los Angeles. 'When you're not planning it, it happens. It's just how God works. And when you want it so bad, it's not happening... ' Kim explained that she is documenting her battle on the upcoming season of Keeping Up With The Kardashian to help other women, noting that Kanye supports her decision to share the experience. Fertility battle: The reality star said: 'It's been more challenging to get pregnant the second time around' Kim, who gave birth to her daughter North in June 2013, began wearing a waist trainer last August and has been thrilled with the results. Her sister Khloe Kardashian and other celebrities including Jessica Alba, Amber Rose and Blac Chyna have also used a corset to shape their tiny waists. Of course, today's celebrities didn't invent waist training. Women have been wearing corsets throughout history, as far back as the 1500s - even during pregnancy. Kim recently revealed in an in interview Elle UK that she has been battling issues with her fertility long before she started started waist training. 'A few years ago I was told I could never get pregnant.' 'Three different doctors told me the same thing, which is why I wanted to have my eggs frozen,' she recalled.

"Two daredevils trying to scale a dangerous rock face in Yosemite National Park without climbing gear are due to reach the end of their 3,000ft journey tonight. Tommy Caldwell, 36, and Kevin Jorgeson, 30, have been working their way up the sheer face of El Capitan since December 27 - and their only concession to modern climbing techniques are ropes to catch them should they fall. They started climbing the final 11 sections - known as pitches - on the rock face Tuesday night, and are expected to close on the summit by Wednesday evening, a spokesman said. Scroll down for video . Unaided: Kevin Jorgeson (pictured) and Tommy Caldwell have been heaving themselves up El Capitan by their fingertips since December 27. Ropes are attached to stop them falling - but they have no climbing aids to get them up the rock face . Struggle: The men have spent weeks climbing the California peak, which has only razor-thing ledges to grip which have eviscerated their hands . Struggle: The two men have been climbing the El Capitan rock face for some three weeks now. Pictured above is Kevin Jorgeson on January 9 reaching for one of the Dawn Wall formation's many sharp, narrow ledges . Triumph: Jorgeson is pictured here after finishing a particularly grueling segment of the dangerous wall. Neither he nor partner Tommy Caldwell use climbing aids to scale the mountain - but both are attached by ropes to save them should they slip . Home for now: The men are sleeping in tents pegged to the face of El Capitan and ascend every day to where they left off . Their endeavor will be the first ever 'free climb' the segment known as Dawn Wall. The two men, who sleep in tents pegged to the side of the rock face, have struggled for days to reach the final stretch. Jorgeson has recently started out again after tearing the skin from his hands on El Capitan's razor-sharp ledges, which forced him to spend two days resting so he could heal. On Tuesday night the spokesman said: 'We will update you on their progress this evening as best we can, but it is likely that they will finish up the climb tomorrow evening.' The men often start climbing at dusk, because the heat of the day can make their hands sweaty and slippery. Both of them have been training for more than five years to make their bid for the summit. The climbers have been keeping their fans updated intermittently on social media. Earlier this week, after finally finishing a segment from which he had fallen 11 times in seven days, making no progress, Jorgeson said: 'Momentum is a powerful force. When it's on your side, everything feels a bit easier. When it's not on your side, it feels like wading through mud. 'For 7 days, my momentum was halted by Pitch 15. It took everything in my power to stay positive and resolved that I would succeed. Long way down: Caldwell, pictured examining his sore hands, has been climbing with his buddy since December 27 . Sheer wall: The rock face offers little in the way of support, and what ledges there are can slice up the hands of the climbers . 'Now that momentum has returned to my side, I'm staying just as focused and resolved because a lot of hard climbing remains.' The day before Caldwell, who had made faster progress than his climbing mate, posted in support of Jorgeson. He said: 'Today Kevin managed to climb pitch 15 in the most inspired climbing moment of his life. 'It was such an intense and incredible thing to witness. It's not over yet, but things are looking good.

"Britain's cities risk being 'cast aside' and the poor left behind by politicians obsessed with trying to woo Middle England, the Church of England warned today. The Archbishop of York Dr John Sentamu warned 'rampant consumerism and individualism' have acted to eradicate the glue that holds communities together. And the Archbishop of Canterbury claimed that whole towns and regions are trapped in a spiral of economic decline. Scroll down for video . The Archbishop of York Dr John Sentamu warned 'rampant consumerism and individualism' have acted to eradicate the glue that holds communities together . The criticism comes in a book edited by Dr Sentamu, who acknowledged yesterday that the work promotes left-wing thinking. In a strongly-worded attack on the Coalition timed for the start of the election build-up, the Most Rev Justin Welby blamed spending cuts and the failure of government to do enough to support recovery in the regions. In his contribution to the book, titled On Rock or Sand, the Dr Welby said: ‘Our economy appears to be, in one sense, a tale of two cities – one being a growing and constantly improving London and the South East generally, and the other being most, but not all, other cities, alike in that they are each trapped in apparently inevitable decline.’ He said spending cuts have widened the gap and added: ‘The hard truth is that many of these cities are in what appear to be lose-lose situations. ‘Already in decline, the road towards recovery and growth is made even more difficult. 'There are now fewer readily available Government resources able to support economic development in these regions; and also, since the 1980s, the banking system has become more and more London concentrated and consequently out of touch with local needs.' Dr Sentamu's book claims the poor have been ‘left behind’, entire cities have been ‘cast aside’, and that inequality between rich and poor is ‘evil’. The book amounts to a direct challenge to the Prime Minister and the Conservative Party. It compares itself to the notorious 1985 Faith in the City report, which condemned Margaret Thatcher’s government and was in turn dismissed by one of her ministers as ‘Marxist’. In an interview to launch the book, Dr Sentamu told The Daily Telegraph: ‘That sounds extremely left-wing doesn’t it? The truth is it is the theology of where I am coming from. 'This marrying of justice and self-interest is deeply unfashionable in a political scene where parties rush to outdo each other in enticing and beguiling the swing vote of middle England not with a vision of justice but with appeals to individual preference, interest and consumer choice.” He added: While many have benefited from the economic progress of past decades, the consequences of this rampant consumerism and individualism – both economic and social – have been to eradicate the glue that holds communities together. “Astonishingly, this disintegrative process is then expressed in what it means to live a good life.” The Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Rev Justin Welby, said some towns are trapped in a spiral of economic decline due to government spending cuts. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith dismissed the comments as ‘unbalanced and unfair’ Dr Welby’s contribution to the book said: ‘There is a general social assumption that the economy has the power to dictate what is and is not possible for human beings. 'We believe that if we can fix the economy, the fixing of human beings will automatically follow. That is a lie. ‘It is a lie because it is a narrative that casts money, rather than humanity, as the protagonist of God’s story.’ Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith dismissed the Archbishop's comments as ‘unbalanced and unfair’.","Reverend Justin Welby claimed whole regions are in a 'spiral of decline'

"A Republican National Committee delegate from Michigan is under fire for re-posting an essay on Facebook that argues blacks are less intelligent and articulate than whites. The unwanted distraction as the RNC holds its annual Winter Meeting this week is creating new headaches just as the GOP is recovering from the scandal of a high-profile Congressman who spoke to a white supremacist group 12 years ago. Dave Agema, a former Michigan state legislator and one of the committee's two Wolverine State delegates, shared the essay with his Facebook audience on December 31. Blacks, the piece's author wrote in May 2014, 'cannot reason as well. They cannot communicate as well. They cannot control their impulses as well. They are a threat to all who cross their paths, black and non-black alike.' A self-described public defender in the southern U.S. wrote the essay under a pen name, based on what he says were his experiences over the years representing mostly African-American clients. TIME TO QUIT? Michigan RNC delegate Dave Agema has come under fire before for posting inflammatory material on Facebook, but his promotion of a racist essay is bringing opponents out of the woodwork . Allen West, a retired Army lieutenant colonel and former one-term congressman, posted the essay two days before Agema did, allegedly giving the embattled Michigan Republican the idea to share it . THE POST, NOW DELETED: Agema called the 'American Renaissance' magazine article 'enlightening' 'Most blacks are unable to speak English well,' he claimed. 'They cannot conjugate verbs. They have a poor grasp of verb tenses. They have a limited vocabulary. They cannot speak without swearing. They often become hostile on the stand.' 'Many, when they testify, show a complete lack of empathy and are unable to conceal a morality based on the satisfaction of immediate, base needs. This is a disaster, especially in a jury trial.' 'American Renaissance,' a magazine described as a white supremacist publication by the Anti-Defamation League, published the piece in May 2014. The Southern Poverty Law Center includes the publication among its list of 'hate groups.' Agema told his 1,300 Facebook followers that the essay was 'enlightening' and 'a very interesting article by a public defender.' 'We are in a cultural battle,' he wrote. Agema later removed his post from Facebook but returned to defend himself Tuesday morning, saying Allen West, a black Republican politician and retired Army lieutenant colonel, had blogged about the piece two days before him. 'I do support Col West's commentary concerning the authors [sic] article and not the content of the article itself,' Agema wrote. West, a former one-term Florida congressman, had titled his Dec. 29 blog entry about the American Renaissance essay: 'Quite possibly the most racist article you will ever read.' But he, too, defended the writer and his racial observations. 'I’m quite sure the progressive socialist left will criticize me for sharing this article – that’s just who they are – they hate the truth,' West wrote. 'But if there is a war to be fought, it is for the soul of the inner city and the black community.' 'The facts and observations in this are not shocking to me. They are quite well known, but the manner in which the writer so eloquently presents them is quite commendable.' Republicans may find Agema's presence at their Winter Meeting in Coronado, California awkward, especially when the keynote speaker takes the stage at a lunch on Thursday. That would be Ben Carson, the only African-American party member to break into the public consciousness as a possible presidential candidate. Agema's fellow Republicans, including many high-profile GOPers from Michigan, lowered the boom Tuesday. A group of state legislators from Oakland County, Michigan are asking RNC members to 'end our party's long nightmare' by showing the controversial Republican the door. 'While we are disappointed it has come down to this, we believe this course of action is the only way to stop Mr. Agema’s hateful rhetoric from further tarnishing our party,' the lawmakers wrote in a letter obtained by DailyMail.com. 'We urge RNC members, our colleagues and like-minded Michiganders to join us in stepping up and acknowledging that enough is enough.' BLAME GAME: Col. West labeled the essay 'Quite possibly the most racist article you will ever read,' but then went on to praise the writer for sharing 'the truth' DOUBLE TROUBLE: The Agema story emerged just as Republicans finished mopping up the mess caused when Rep. Steve Scalise (pictured) admitted addressing a white-power group more than a decade ago . Paul Welday, the chairman of the the Michigan Republican Party's 14th District committee, wrote in a Detroit Free Press op-ed that 'sadly, there is still a small but vocal faction that sticks by Agema in spite of his repeated broadsides against group after group.' 'They claim he is being ""taken out of context"" or that he is somehow being unfairly mischaracterized for his sincerely held conservative beliefs. Utter nonsense.' 'With every ignorant Facebook post,' Welday argued, 'Agema weakens and divides the Republican Party while reinforcing ridiculous stereotypes spread by its opponents. Rather than strengthen and advance the Republican Party, Agema has done more damage to the GOP and the conservative cause than any Democrat could dream of.' Agema did not respond to requests for comment, but an aide to a Michigan Republican congressman told DailyMail.com Tuesday evening that 'we all wish he would just dry up and blow away.' 'He's an embarrassment, a liability, and just the sort of catnip the Al Sharptons of the world need to paint us all as backward KKK members,' the staffer said. Agema has come under fire before for his social media posts. He shared an article on Facebook two years ago titled 'Everyone Should Know These Statistics on Homosexuals,' which bashed gays for having a 'filthy lifestyle.' Published by the defunct International Organization of Heterosexual Rights, it claimed 50 per cent of suicides and half of big-city murders are committed by gays, that more than one-third of all gays practice sado-masichism, and that 1 out of 20 homosexuals is a child molester. 'I didn't write these words,' Agema would later insist. 'I simply posted them.' Agema drew calls for his resignation in 2013 when he used Facebook to distribute an anti-gay essay . But his post included this warning: 'What is being pawned off on our children and grandchildren in public schools is the story that to be homosexual or lesbian is just another normal alternative lifestyle.' National Journal reports that he has also argued President Obama is secretly a Muslim and praised Russian President Vladimir Putin for his country's iron-fisted anti-gay policies. Agema also 'blamed Satan for dividing the Republican Party,' claimed gay Americans want free health care because they suffer from AIDS, and used Facebook to distribute an inflammatory observation that asked: 'Have you ever seen a Muslim do anything that contributes positively to the American way of life?' He called that piece of writing 'eye-opening.' The Republican Party can ill-afford another race-based stick in the eye. It was just a week ago that Rep. Steve Scalise, the GOP's House Whip, admitted that he unwittingly spoke 12 years ago to a group of white supremacists while he was a state legislator in Louisiana. TIME points out that the Democratic National Committee has its own Agema-style scandal brewing. Terry Bean, a committeeman from Oregon and a major donor to President Obama's campaigns, remains on the party's roster even though he faces criminal charges related to alleged sexual contact he and his ex-boyfriend had with a 15-year-old boy.","Dave Agema, one of Michigan's two delegates to the RNC, shared an essay with his Facebook audience that reeked of anti-black discrimination .

"When it comes to describing sea creatures, a new study suggests popular culture has made people think they are much bigger than they are in reality. Scientists haven't helped in addressing these misconceptions, because up until now, it has been difficult to get exact measurements of many of the world's largest marine megafauna. Now a group of researchers is attempting to address this issue by analysing the body sizes for 25 marine species, including whales, sharks, leatherback turtles, squids and even giant clams. Scroll down for video . The project's goal was to get accurate size measurements for the largest known marine species use that information to build equations to help researchers estimate total length and weight of other species. Pictured are their results . 'Several years ago I noticed that people kept saying that giant squids reached 60 feet in length, which is amazingly long,' said Craig McClain, assistant director of the National Evolutionary Synthesis Center in Durham, North Carolina. 'When I started actually looking at the data, I found that that estimate was actually quite unrealistic.' Real measurements show that these creatures are actually closer to 40 feet long, and even that is extremely rare. Professor McClain teamed up with undergraduate students to study well-known behemoths like the great white shark, giant octopus and walrus as well as more obscure creatures such as the giant tube worm and the colossal squid. The goal was to get accurate size measurements for the largest known marine species in each taxon and use that information to build equations to help researchers estimate total length and weight of other species. In one example, the researchers found that an Australian trumpet snail was reported to be about 35.8 inches, but the correct measurement for that creature is actually about 28.3 inches. Researchers found that while people believe giant squid are around 60 feet in length, they are in fact closer to 40 feet long. Errors in past records may have led to inaccurate measurements and popular culture hasn't helped the matter . Many people believe giant squid are around  60 feet in length. But real measurements show that these creatures are actually closer to 40 feet long. In another example, the researchers found that an Australian trumpet snail was reported to be about 35.8 inches, but the correct measurement for that creature is actually about 28.3 inches. Meanwhile, some reports on the size of the whale shark put the animal's length at 65.6 feet, but its actual size is more likely 61.7 feet, the researchers said. Meanwhile, some reports on the size of the whale shark put the animal's length at 65.6 feet, but its actual size is more likely 61.7 feet, the researchers said. Understanding how large an animal can get and the variation within a species is important for knowing how to conserve these animals and their habitat, researchers said. 'This is the first time anyone has tried to compile anything like this and will set to rest a whole lot of myths about the size of the largest specimens of all kinds of animals,' said co-author Trevor Branch, a University of Washington assistant professor. Professor Branch got involved when he found the students' tweets about their project, then commented on their blue whale blog posts. He pointed them toward a helpful database, and helped analyse the data and interpret the results for the whale species. The paper's authors contacted marine centers and other scientists, and scoured the available literature and data to find measurements for the species studied in this paper. 'Precise, accurate, and quantified measurements matter at both a philosophical and pragmatic level,' McClain said. 'Saying something is approximately 'this big,' while holding your arms out won't cut it, nor will inflating how large some of these animals are.' For the giant barrel sponge (pictured) the research found that mortality rates decrease as size increases. Understanding how large an animal can get and the variation within a species is important for knowing how to conserve these animals, researchers said .","Popular culture has led people to believe giant squid are as big as 60ft in length, but they are only 40ft at most .

"David Cameron said Labour leader Ed Miliband has been 'turned into a total joke' by his energy policy . Labour’s flagship energy price freeze was branded ‘a joke’ last night, as senior figures in the party confirmed it has been reviewed in the light of falling prices. The price freeze, which Mr Miliband pledged would last until 2017, has been thrown into turmoil in recent weeks as a slump in the price of oil saw the prospect of falling energy prices. The Daily Mail revealed yesterday that Labour is conducting a U-turn on the policy, which was launched by Ed Miliband in 2013. It has now been ‘re-branded’ as a price cap, which will allow bills to fall to reflect tumbling wholesale prices. Yesterday E.On became the first Big Six firm to offer a cut in gas prices of 3.5 per cent to its customers, and others are expected to follow suit. Labour’s energy spokesman Caroline Flint yesterday insisted the freeze had always been designed to act as a cap, which would allow prices to be cut. She told MPs: ‘If anyone is labouring under the illusion that the price freeze can be used as an excuse for not delivering price cuts then let me disabuse them of that.’ She explained that Labour would change the law to give the regulator Ofgem the power to force energy firms to cut bills when wholesale prices fall. However the party’s work and pensions spokesman Rachel Reeves confirmed the shift, saying the ‘world has changed’ since the freeze was announced. Miss Reeves acknowledged that the party ‘didn’t use the word cap’ when the policy was launched. She told the BBC’s Daily Politics show: ‘Clearly at the time, prices were going up… The world has changed, and now we’ve got falling energy prices.’ Conservative chairman Grant Shapps seized on the admission as evidence that the policy was in ‘complete chaos’. And David Cameron mocked the Labour leader, saying: ‘He cannot talk about his energy price freeze, because it has turned him into a total joke.’ The policy is still being promoted on the party’s website with an image of an energy bill frozen in a block of ice, with a message stating: ‘Ed Miliband’s energy plan – gas and electricity bills will be frozen until 2017.’ Ed Miliband (right) was pledged that energy prices would be frozen until 2017, and Labour's website still shows an energy bill encased in ice despite falling prices . But critics have pointed out that the policy will backfire if families fear they will be stuck with high bills while prices fall. And experts think the policy proposal may have kept bills artificially high, with firms unwilling to lower prices in case Labour wins the election and fixes bills at the lower level. Fund manager Neil Woodford last night described Labour’s price freeze as ‘good politics, but bad economics’. He added: ‘The proposed price freeze has now led to consumers paying more for their energy than they otherwise would have had to.’","Prime Minister says Ed Miliband can't continue to talk about policy .

"A grieving mother was left sickened after her son's jailed killer was pictured laughing  on Facebook. Jay Whiston, 17, was stabbed to death in a savage attack by Edward Redman, who has since been sent to prison. But just months after the murderer was sentenced, he was pictured on Facebook joking with his brother. Jay's mother Caroline Shearer says the online photo shows why prison is seen as a soft touch by many criminals. Just months after Edward Redman (right) was jailed for the murder of 17-year-old Jay Whiston, his brother posted this picture of them together on Facebook, next to the caption: 'Top day with my brother' Redman (left) received a minimum 17-year sentence for the murder of Jay (right), whose mother has slammed prison authorities after the picture of Redman emerged . The photo was posted online by Redman's brother in November, six months after Redman was jailed, next to the caption: 'Top day with my brother'. It shows Redman, dressed in a white T-shirt, smiling as he puts his arm round his brother. When a friend asked the brother when the picture was taken, he replied: 'Today mate'. Jay's mother Ms Shearer has been left furious by the post and has complained to justice authorities. She said: 'It's disgusting. It's the sort of photo you pay to have taken on holiday. This person is in prison for murder - not for pinching a packet of sweets or not paying his council tax. 'He took my son's life. It's not even a year since he was sentenced. No wonder people aren't scared to go to prison.' Mrs Shearer says she will make a formal complaint and has already contacted Essex police commissioner Nick Alston. The photo of Redman was posted by his brother, who captioned the picture: 'Top day with my brother' Mr Alston's office said they understood the shock Jay's family felt and would support her complaint. Photos of serving inmates in jail can only be released with the prison governor's permission. Mrs Shearer said: 'Apparently you can have photos taken in prison. They shouldn't be put on Facebook or social media, but they obviously didn't give a damn.' She has also written to Secretary of State for Justice and Lord Chancellor Chris Grayling. Redman stabbed Jay in Colchester, Essex in September 2012, at a party which had been advertised on Facebook and Twitter. Jay - described as 'big-hearted' by his family - would have been 20 on Tuesday. Redman, of Colchester, received a life sentence for the murder and was given a minimum sentence of 17 years in jail earlier this year. At Redman's trial, CCTV images were shown which police believe show the moments he realised Jay had died . Redman (left, in red T-shirt) is shown reading messages on his phone before putting his hand to his mouth . At his trial, CCTV emerged from a bus he boarded after the attack, which appeared to show the moment he heard of Jay's death. Redman was shown laughing and joking in the footage, as he reads messages on his phone from friends at the murder scene. His mood suddenly changes as he puts his hand to his mouth, the moment police believe he was told that Jay had died from his wounds. At the end of Redman's trial, Ms Shearer paid tribute to her son in a highly emotional victim impact statement. She said: 'All I know is when you lose a child your heart is literally ripped out. Grieving the loss of your child is the hardest work I will ever have to do. 'It is a war I will never be able to finish fighting - a peak I will never be able to climb. Jay's heart was so big they stabbed him in it - they couldn't miss it.' The Ministry of Justice originally denied that the picture had been taken in prison, but today have admitted that the photo featuring Redman and his brother was taken in jail. A spokesman said: 'There are strict rules on photographs being taken in prison and we are investigating how this image appeared on Facebook. 'We have apologised for the distress and upset caused to the family of the victim in this case and have taken steps to prevent this kind of incident from happening again.'","Edward Redman was jailed for at least 17 years for murder of Jay Whiston .

"Far-right groups in Britain could see a resurgence in the wake of the Paris terror attacks, campaigners have warned. Anti-fascists are worried about the rise of potentially dangerous teenage neo-Nazis. A collapse in support for the British National Party and English Defence League had been seen as part of a decline in Far-Right extremism. Scroll down for video . At war: Paul Pitt, leader of the South East Alliance, says Britain is at war with radical Islam . But a report by campaign group Hope Not Hate said authorities must remain vigilant for ‘lone wolf’ attacks by single fanatics. Although Far-Right groups have so far failed to capitalise on the emergence of Islamic State, it said, ‘as we have seen with events in France in recent days, the situation can change very fast’. It also warned of growing anti-Semitism. The group, which has monitored the Far-Right for a decade, said it had detected several disturbing signs of revival and warned that the openly racist neo-Nazi group National Action is attracting young recruits. The report, by Hope Not Hate chief executive Nick Lowles and researcher Matthew Collins, said: ‘This is probably the most ideological Nazi group to emerge in Britain for decades.’ In October Garron Helm, a 21-year-old National Action supporter, was jailed for sending anti-Semitic tweets to Labour MP Luciana Berger. Extreme: Since the demise of the English Defence League, the Far Right has splintered . ‘This appears to have upped the ante, the attention bringing a new lot of admirers and wannabes from the rest of the Far-Right,’ the report found. It noted that the monitoring group Community Security Trust reported a record 302 anti-Semitic incidents last July during the Gaza conflict. But the most prominent Far-Right groups – the BNP and EDL – have struggled with internal splits and the rise of Ukip, the report found. The BNP, which had 58 councillors and two MEPs, has suffered since leader Nick Griffin was ousted and now has only two councillors. Ukip has ‘steamrollered through their previous heartlands and stolen their voters,’ the report said. It noted that Ukip is not Far-Right and has a ban on ex BNP members, but added: ‘While Ukip is not the BNP and Farage is not Griffin, it is clear that most former BNP voters feel quite at home in the Ukip stable.’ The EDL, which organised a series of high-profile protests against ‘Islamisation’, has also fragmented since the group’s charismatic leader Stephen Lennon, known as Tommy Robinson, quit in late 2013 citing his concerns over the ‘dangers of Far-Right extremism’. The report suggested he could make a comeback, adding: ‘He is the one person currently around who could transform the fortunes of Britain’s Far-Right and anti-Islam groups. ‘We are aware that many people are actively encouraging him to return and we feel there is a real possibility that he will.’ Angry: Colin (pictured wearing sunglasses) is concerned about Islamism and regularly demonstrates . Opposition: Radical Islamists often launch counter-protests such as the one pictured above . Angry: The reasons for joining the Far Right are complex and cover a huge range of issues . Fear: Many join out of fear of immigration, although Roberts says each member has their own line in the sand . However, it found that none of the groups has been ‘able to capitalise’ on issues such as the rise of Islamic State and the Rotherham grooming scandal, with demonstrations still ‘relatively poorly attended’. Mr Lowles said: ‘Our report reveals that, despite otherwise favourable conditions, Far-Right hate networks are really struggling at the moment. ‘For that we should all be thankful, though of course we must not rest on our laurels.’ The report came as a film screened on Channel 4 last night documented the rise of some of Britain’s new sinister Far-Right organisations. Paul Prodromou, a former EDL member and the founder of the South East Alliance, told the programme he believes Britain is at war. ‘I don’t think moderate Muslims exist. The jihadis are killing in the name of Islam,’ Mr Prodromou, who publicly uses the surname Pitt, told the documentary. ‘They’re not doing it in anyone else’s name. If you are Muslim, you are part of Islam. They have no reason to be in this country whatsoever. They are vermin.’ Another Far-Right supporter told the filmmakers: ‘This is the grim reality of England 2015. A country tearing itself apart. ‘I’d be happy breaking their bones . . . I’d be happy hurting them.’ A white supremacist group, the 18 in the name is derived from Adolf Hitler - A and H being the first and eighth letters in the alphabet. Based on the principle of 'leaderless resistance', the group has been connected with a series of murders as well as violent demonstrations. During the 1980s, Combat 18 was linked with the Loyalist movement in Northern Ireland, while in the rest of the UK, it joined forces with football hooligans. Today, it still exists on the fringes of the Far Right, although many in the movement have disavowed it. The group also has imitators in the shape of international ultra-nationalist movements, most notably Greece's Golden Dawn. Frightening: Many claim the UK is at war, leading to fears of violent attacks on ethnic minorities .

"A parish council discussion about geese in the village pond would normally warrant barely a ripple of interest. But police were called when a villager got into a flap amid claims that she was not being allowed to film just such a debate. Sandy Maynard said councillors in Beyton, near Bury St Edmunds in Suffolk, failed to provide a decent vantage point and that when she moved from the designated spot, the chairman’s wife, Mary Wyartt, 71, repeatedly tried to obscure her view. Scroll down for video . At risk: Sandy Maynard and Andrew Nimmons pictured with the village geese in Beyton, near Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk . In a final attempt to exercise her right to record proceedings, she told councillors they would have to call police to stop her – and they duly took up her challenge. Two officers arrived, but took no further action when a member of the public assured them things were under control. Mrs Maynard, 67, a retired secondary school teacher, said: ‘Unfortunately, my camera stopped recording just as [chairman] Roger Wyartt yelled “You can’t film this”. ‘Calling the police was unnecessary and embarrassing. When they arrived, someone ran out and spoke to them and they never came in, although it hadn’t even calmed down at that point. What a waste of police time.’ Mrs Maynard and her partner Andrew Nimmons, 70, a retired farm worker, are concerned about the council’s ‘inhumane’ policy of reintroducing geese to the village green. There used to be ten birds at the spot but all died, the mother of one says, because of problems such as dog attacks, being run over by cars or having inadequate shelter. Blocked: A still from Mrs Maynard's video of the debate on the village geeese . The parish council chairman’s wife, Mary Wyartt, 71, was said to have repeatedly obscured Mrs Maynard's view . The council brought in another 15 birds last summer after a poll in which 78 per cent of locals supported the idea – but three have already died. ‘They should not be putting more animals in a situation where they could be killed,’ Mrs Maynard said. Mrs Maynard and her partner Andrew Nimmons, 70, a retired farm worker, are concerned about the council’s ‘inhumane’ policy of reintroducing geese to the village green . Councillors were forced to accept the filming of meetings last year after a change of law, which led to three members quitting. The incident happened at the meeting of Beyton Parish Council . Last night Mr Wyartt blamed a ‘small minority’ who oppose the reintroduction of geese for disrupting the January 5 meeting. He said: ‘We have been given guidelines from the Suffolk Association of Local Councils. It says the parish council chairman can set a designated filming area. She was not filming from the area we provided. ‘I am quite a big fellow. I could have manhandled her out, but that would have been a bigger headline than the one we are looking at now.’ He added: ‘The filming itself is not the problem – it’s the harassment and abuse caused by cutting it and editing it and putting it on YouTube, which just makes the work of a parish councillor that much harder.’ Suffolk Police said two officers went to the meeting but stood down after being told ‘everything was in order’.","Police were called to a meeting of Beyton Parish Council in Suffolk .

The 19-year-old, who is due to give birth in March, once suggested that Schaefer hire someone to kill her mother for $50,000 before their visit to Bali, prosecutors said . Senior Police Commissioner Djoko Hariutomo told Daily Mail Online in December: ‘If they are both convicted of murder they could face the death penalty. There is evidence here of premeditation.’ The judges and prosecutors are the same in both trials. In their indictments, prosecutors said the couple plotted to kill Mrs von Wiese-Mack because she did not endorse their relationship. Mack once suggested that Schaefer hire someone to kill her mother for $50,000 before their visit to Bali, according to prosecutors. On Wednesday, the couple were brought from holding cells having been transferred to the island’s notorious Kerobokan Prison in December ahead of the court appearance. Their lawyers planned to submit defense pleas when the trial resumes next week. Mack and her mother arrived in Bali on August 4 and stayed in Kuta before moving to the St. Regis hotel in Nusa Dua, where they planned to stay until August 14. Schaefer arrived August 12 and stayed at the same hotel in a room booked by Mack under her mother's name. Prosecutors said that made Mack's mother angry and led to an argument in which Mrs von Wiese-Mack, who was white, scolded Schaefer, using a racial slur.

They said Schaefer then battered her with the iron grip of a fruit bowl. Security camera video showed the victim earlier having an argument with Schaefer in the hotel lobby. The indictment said the couple hired a taxi and placed the suitcase containing the body in the trunk and told the driver they were going to check out of the hotel and would return, but never did. The young couple were arrested on August 13 after checking into another hotel following the gruesome discovery of Mrs von Wiese-Mack outside the St Regis Hotel. Police claim the pair plotted Mrs von Wiese-Mack's murder also because of another argument between Miss Mack and her mother over money. Other evidence submitted to prosecutors included CCTV footage showing the couple speaking to a taxi driver after dropping the bloodied suitcase along with other luggage outside the hotel.

According to a statement Miss Mack has given to police, she had no part in her mother’s murder, but went along with helping her boyfriend move the body out of a sense of duty . Tommy Schaefer puts on his orange prison vest and walks to a cell after his first hearing trial on Wednesday . Bali police Col. Djoko Hariutomo said that officers had questioned 12 witnesses and that their case included information from the FBI. Officers brought the physical evidence to the prosecutors in large sacks, including the iron grip of a fruit bowl alleged to be the weapon used in the slaying, and several computer hard drives containing hotel surveillance camera videos. But the lawyer for the teenager claims that the killing was not premeditated and that she had hid in the bathroom while her mother was bludgeoned to death in her hotel room. According to a statement Miss Mack has given to police, she had no part in her mother’s murder, but went along with helping her boyfriend move the body out of a sense of duty because he was the father of her unborn baby, who is due in March. The account she has given to police - which her lawyer Mr Raja Nasution hopes will result in her receiving a lesser charge - paints a picture of a terrified young woman who waited in terror in the bathroom of room 317 while her boyfriend and her mother had a furious argument which resulted in Mrs Mack being beaten to death. A lawyer for the teenager claims that the killing was not premeditated. Miss Mack stroked her bump during Wednesday's court proceedings after telling reporters that she was having a girl . Tommy Schaefer, 21, is pictured sitting in a courtroom for a hearing in Denpasar, Bali on Wednesday . In December, Miss Mack told reporters from her cell: 'My baby is a girl, she is fine. 'I want her to stay in Bali so she can visit me anytime while I'm in jail.' At the time a police spokesman said that Miss Mack would continue to be under medical observation while in Kerobokan Prison because she is pregnant and due to give birth in March. Mack and her mother had a troubled relationship and von Wiese-Mack had frequently reported that her daughter punched and bit her, according to police reports cited by Chicago media. Von Wiese-Mack had recently moved to a condominium in Chicago. Her husband, and Heather's father, classical music composer James Mack, died in 2006.

"A woman alleged to have been raped by a footballer and his friend in a hotel room said she felt like she had been 'hit by a bus' when police told her about a graphic video they found on the phone of one of the men, a court was told today. Simon Lenighan, 20, was a youth player with Leeds United when he is alleged to have carried out the attack with Nathan Campbell, 24, in August 2012. It is alleged that Campbell then filmed the girl and Lenighan was in the room at the time of the filming. Speaking to police in video interview, she said: 'Nothing really entered my mind, it was just pure shock, being hit by a bus.' Simon Lenighan pictured outside Doncaster Crown court (left) - he was a youth player for Leeds United (right) at the time of the alleged incident in 2012. He is co-accused with Nathan Campbell - both deny all charges . Describing the video, she said: 'A video that had me passed out, not with it, just laid out in the bed.' She said the video was really graphic and showing all parts of her. 'I wasn't really aware what was going on,' she added. Speaking about the days after the alleged attack, the woman said: 'I was just a kind of a shaking mess state for about four days.' She also told the court she had a panic attack while shopping in town and had to be taken home. A court has heard their alleged victim was naked and alone when she was woken up by a chambermaid at the Etap Hotel in Leeds the following morning and had no idea where she was or how she got there. The court heard her mobile phone and money were missing and she assumed she had been raped and robbed. She alerted police who later found the video footage on Campbell's mobile phone, the court was told. Lenighan, of Harrogate, North Yorkshire, denies three charges of rape and one of perverting the course of justice. Campbell, of Bradford, West Yorkshire, denies three charges of rape and one of perverting the course of justice. In the weeks following the alleged incident at the hotel,  Campbell had been in touch with the woman, telling her nothing bad had happened at the hotel, the court heard. The jury was told that Campbell told the woman he had taken a video but it wasn't anything embarrassing - and he asked her to drop the case. He told her all that happened in the hotel room was she had given him oral sex, Doncaster Crown Court heard. The jury earlier heard video evidence from the victim stating that she could not remember anything after being in the club until she woke up the next day in the hotel room. The woman remained calm as she said in the interviews: 'I was put underneath the duvet so the cleaning lady lifted the duvet up and screamed.' Speaking in her evidence, a taped police interview from the day after the alleged incident, she said the cleaner's scream woke her up, adding 'I had no idea why I was there, where I was'. Looking around the room the woman noticed her phone and cash were missing, she told police. 'I just assumed I had been taken back to a hotel, robbed and raped because I had no clothes on,' she said. 'I had never been more terrified before,' she added. An Etap hotel in Leeds city centre where the alleged incident is believed to have taken place - it is now an Ibis . The court heard she quickly dressed before making her way in a confused state to the reception of the hotel in Leeds, where she tried to explain the situation. She said in the evidence that she was in such a state that the hotel asked her to leave, and after an attempt to phone a friend she tried to find a police station, finally being directed to one by a 'street drinker'. Although having a vague memory of the night, the woman said the day after she had bruises on her upper arms, on on her right hip and some pain in her vaginal area. Speaking in the taped interview, the woman said she did remember seeing Lenighan, who was known to her, at the club after 1.15am on August 29 but doesn't remember speaking to him. She described herself as being very drunk that night, on a scale of one to ten she described herself as an eight and a half to nine. She said: 'It was the most drunk I can remember being in a long time.' Andrew Haslam, prosecuting, told Doncaster Crown Court, in South Yorkshire: 'When she woke up she was naked, her mobile phone and money were missing. 'The prosecution say that in that hotel room Simon Lenighan and Nathan Campbell raped her. Simon Lenighan leaving Doncaster Crown court . 'We have a window into that hotel room. That window shows how the defendants treated and continued to treat her.' Mr Haslam said Campbell used a mobile phone to video the woman and the men were heard laughing as they avoided being seen on the camera. The jury saw footage which showed the woman lying naked on a bed and intimate shots of her body. At one point both men are heard using slang words including 'pum pum' and 'batty' and describing the woman as 'looking a bit stretched'. In one section of the video Campbell is heard telling the woman 'ah yeah it hurts too much - calm down'. The court heard Lenighan and Campbell met for the first time on the night of the alleged incident, August 28, as they drank in the Tiger Tiger bar in Leeds. The woman, who knew Lenighan, had also been drinking in the bar and agreed to go back to the hotel, now an Ibis, with the two men. Mr Haslam said friends were concerned for her safety because she had so much to drink, with one describing her as 'very drunk'. After they were arrested both men admitted having sex with the woman but claimed she was a willing partner. Lenighan claimed they started to have sex but he realised she was too drunk and she said no. He told her that he fell asleep and did not know what Campbell was doing. Mr Haslam said: 'The prosecution say that she was so drunk she could not give meaningful and proper consent. 'Drunken consent is still consent but if someone becomes so intoxicated their ability to choose can evaporate, it can be lost.' When Campbell was arrested by police they found the video on his mobile phone. He told police that the woman was the instigator and said that he had vaginal sex with her but said he did not ejaculate in or on her. Mr Haslam told the court the video 'shows the utter contempt to whether she could consent or not'. He added that Lenighan and Campbell knew 'full well that what they did in the room was without the woman's consent'. Mr Haslam said their 'lies' and 'shifting stories' point towards this. He said: 'Simon Lenighan is as you have heard a footballer and at the time he was on the books for the Under 18 team with Leeds United. 'Nathan Campbell was telling other people in Tiger Tiger he too was a footballer, but he was not,' he added. Tiger Tiger nightclub in Leeds city centre where Lenighan and Campbell met the woman . When interviewed by police Lenighan described Campbell as 'weird and arrogant'. 'He said Campbell described himself as a professional footballer with a villa in Ripon,' said Mr Haslam. When the woman rang Lenighan after the incident he told her that he had stopped having sex with her because she was too drunk. After hearing this, the woman said she would tell police that she had consented to what happened. Lenighan was later arrested for rape and interviewed by police. Later, when Campbell found out about Lenighan's arrest, he sent a message to the woman on Facebook which said: 'Are you serious?' Campbell went on to phone the woman and tell her that he was a professional football player and that she was ruining his career. He also told her about the video but assured her it was not embarrassing and he had to take it because he was a footballer and people may try and blackmail him. Mr Haslam said: 'She then started to apologise.' Following these conversations the woman told Campbell that she would tell the police that the investigation should cease. However, Campbell was arrested. Campbell has previously pleaded guilty to a sexual assault of the woman in the hotel room. The trial continues.

"A group of Texas gun owners have attempted to recreate last week's attacks on the Charlie Hebdo offices to see what would happen if one of the murdered journalists had a gun. A dozen volunteers each took turns to participate in the simulation on a set designed to replicate the offices of the French magazine. The volunteers were armed with a handgun firing bullets made of paint. Just one volunteer managed to survive after fleeing the building, two victims managed to take out a single gunman before being killed, while nine people died without injuring either of the attackers. Scroll down for video . Armed: A dozen volunteers took it in turns to be attacked while armed with a handgun and sitting on a set resembling the offices of Paris magazine Charlie Hebdo . Breaking in: The 12 were each attacked by two men with automatic rifles. Only one survived after fleeing the building, two managed to kill one of the attackers, and nine died without injuring either of them . The exercise was organised in Plano by pro-gun campaign group   The Truth About Guns. Volunteers sat in a crowded room mimicking the morning conference at Charlie Hebdo magazine where jihadi brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi  shot nine of the staff. The volunteers in Plano were asked to sit around for a random length of time, before two men armed with automatic rifles comparable to the terrorists' weapons entered the building. The pair, who had a similar level of training to that showed by the Kouachi brothers, were asked to make a small noise on their way in to give the volunteers a chance to prepare. From that point the drama unfolded without a script, with all parties firing marker rounds filled with paint to reveal which people were hit. Truth About Guns member Nick Leghorn told CBS Local: 'It’s interesting to see how people react under stress. It’s not what you’d expect people do.' Brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi killed 12 people when they attacked the offices of Charlie Hebdo magazine a week ago today with Kalashnikov rifles . Nine of Charlie Hebdo's staff were murdered as they took part in morning conference (file image), a scenario the Texas simulation tried to replicate . Of the 12 people to participate, nine were killed in the office without managing to take out either of the attackers, just as the scenario played out with the unarmed journalists in Paris. Only one female volunteer managed to survive the simulation by running from the set, leaving both of the attackers unharmed. Two of the volunteers managed to take out a single gunman, as footage captured by CBSDWF.com shows. However, none of the participants were able to stop the massacre by taking out both attackers. The Kouachi brothers killed 12 people, including three police officers, when they attacked the offices of Charlie Hebdo in Paris a week ago today. Over the course of the next 48 hours the pair were pursued across northern France before being cornered and killed in a print works just north of Paris as they tried to return to the capital. The publication was targeted for its history of publishing cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed, a gesture considered highly offensive to some Muslims. Today the first issue of the magazine to be produced since the attacks, featuring another cartoon of Mohammed on the front page, sold out in France within hours of going on sale. Its usual print-run of 60,000 has been increased to almost five million in the wake of the attacks, which prompted solidarity marches around the world.","Gun group created set replicating inside of Charlie Hebdo's offices .

"After ongoing sightings of a five-metre great white shark, Newcastle beaches will be closed on Thursday for a record sixth consecutive day. One sighting at Nobby's and another at Stockton on Wednesday have forced Newcastle Council life guards to close the beaches for another day, with the council vowing to only reopen after 24 hours without sightings. It comes as a long-standing Aquatic services co-ordinator for Newcastle Council has said the shark which has been spotted, which is believed to be a five metres long and about 1700kg, is the biggest shark to have ever ever been spotted at the beach, reports Sydney Morning Herald. Scroll down for video . Following the sighting of a great white shark at Merewether Beach, the entire coastline remains shut down . Nobbys Beach inspector Scott Hammerton told Daily Mail Australia the beaches were nearly reopened on Wednesday before the first sighting. 'We made it all the way to high-tide at about 3pm. A report came in from a jetski rider of a large shark at Nobby's beach. After that there was another sighting at Stockton. 'Since the council nare calling for a 24 sighting free window it means the beaches are closed again for Thursday.' Mr Hammerton said some surfers are disregarding the closures and hopping into the water. 'We're urging for the public's cooperation, please stay out of the water until we have the can confirm it is safe to be swimming.' Swimmers were forced to evacuate at the weekend following the sighting of a great white shark at a beach . Newcastle beaches have been closed for a fourth straight day following the sighting of a great white shark . Newcastle Council aquatic services co-ordinator Peter Withers, who has served in the area for 37 years, told Sydney Morning Herald it was the biggest shark he had seen in his career. 'We've consistently seen the big one every day. Certainly it's the biggest shark we've ever had and it's hung around longer than any other shark,' he said. A statement released by the council urged nobody to be disregard the closures. 'Our lifeguards emphasise that this great white shark is of a size that has not been seen before around Newcastle. It appears to be nearly full grown at an estimated five metres in length which would make its weight around 1700kg.' Several jet skis and speed boats scoured the water after the shark alarm sounded around 1pm on Saturday . Rob Townsend, life sciences manager at Manly Sea Life Sanctuary, said the shark's behaviour in staying close to the coastline was not unusual. 'It may be hunting eagle rays, which are a favourite food for sharks and are found close to the shore,' he said. 'Great whites are very variable. They spend time in the surf where they are sometimes spotted by lifeguards and then they also have their massive oceanic migration where they travel to South Africa. They are very adaptable.' He added that people were better safe than sorry and should keep out of the water while the shark continues to be spotted. Lifeguards spotted the shark on Monday and are monitoring its progress between Nobbys and Stockton . When asked why the sharks are sticking around on Monday, Mr Hammerton said there are two prevailing theories. 'One idea is that it's a great white sanctuary. They might be coming in close to the shore to offer warm water to give birth and raise their young.' 'The other idea is that the sharks started appeared in line with a cold current on Saturday. There has been a lot of marine activity in the area since then and the sharks may be following suite,' he said. Newcastle City Council beach inspector Mick Body says the closure has been the longest in his memory.","The beaches in Newcastle have been closed for a record six days .

"Neanderthals have a reputation for being lumbering, cavemen with low IQs, but a new discovery suggests they may have been more intelligent than we think. A 60,000-year-old multi-purpose bone tool unearthed in France suggests Neanderthals understood how to use bones to make useful devices. This skill was previously attributed to our species, Homo sapiens, and casts a new light on evolution 250,000 to 28,000 years ago. Evidence of meat butchering and bone fracturing to extract marrow are evident on the tool. Marks (shown in the green boxes) suggest the use of the bone fragment for carved sharpening the cutting edges of stone tools . 'This is the first time a multi-purpose bone tool from this period has been discovered,' said Luc Doyon from the University of Montreal. 'It was long thought that before Homo sapiens, other species did not have the cognitive ability to produce this type of artefact. 'This discovery reduces the presumed gap between the two species and prevents us from saying that one was technically superior to the other.' The production of bone tools by Neanderthals is open to debate. For much of the twentieth century, scientists were reluctant to recognise the ability of this species to use materials like bone in this way. For much of the twentieth century, scientists were reluctant to recognise the ability of this species to use materials like bone in this way. Pictured is a reconstruction of the Neanderthal environment . However, over the past two decades, a numbers of discoveries have indicated the use of hard materials from animals by Neanderthals. 'Our discovery is an additional indicator of bone work by Neanderthals and helps put into question the linear view of the evolution of human behaviour,' Professor Doyon said. The tool was uncovered during annual digs at the Grotte du Bison at Arcy-sur-Cure in Burgundy, France. Extremely well preserved, the tool comes from the left femur of an adult reindeer and its age is estimated between 55,000 and 60,000 years old. Using bones to make tools was not the primary motivation for Neanderthals hunting. Above all, scientists believe they hunted to obtain the rich energy provided by meat and marrow. Evidence of meat butchering and bone fracturing to extract marrow are seen on the tool. The tool, made from reindeer bone was found at the Grotte du Bison at Arcy-sur-Cure in Burgundy, France . Other marks suggest the use of the bone fragment for sharpening the cutting edges of stone tools. Chipping and a significant polish show the use of the bone as a scraper, according to the study. 'The presence of this tool at a context where stone tools are abundant suggests an opportunistic choice of the bone fragment and its intentional modification into a tool by Neanderthals,' Professor Doyon said. Separate research by Leiden University last year also found Neanderthals were anything but the incompetent species that they are often deemed. The researchers pointed to evidence of complex hunting methods that required a group effort and planning in advance. The researchers arrived at their conclusions by conducting a series of experiments in teaching students the art of 'Oldowan stone-knapping'. This is when butchering 'flakes' are created by hammering a hard rock against certain volcanic or glassy rocks, like basalt or flint . The first conversation between our ancestors was about DIY and likely took place between 2.5 to 1.8 million years ago. This is according to an international study which found stone tool-making drove the evolution of language among our human ancestors in the African savannah. It suggests communication among our earliest ancestors may have been more complex than previously thought, and that tool-making helped drive evolution. The researchers, who included scientists at the University of Liverpool and St Andrews, arrived at their conclusions by conducting a series of experiments in teaching students the art of 'Oldowan stone-knapping'. This is when butchering 'flakes' are created by hammering a hard rock against certain volcanic or glassy rocks, like basalt or flint. Oldowan stone-knapping dates back to the Lower Paleolithic period in eastern Africa, and remained largely unchanged for 700,000 years until more sophisticated Acheulean hand-axes and cleavers were developed. In testing five different ways to convey Oldowan stone-knapping skills to more than 180 college students, the researchers found that the demonstration that used spoken communication – versus imitation, non-verbal presentations or gestures – yielded the highest volume and quality of flakes.","The tool, made from reindeer bone, was unearthed in Burgundy, France .

Flu is widespread in 46 U.S. states, up from 36 states in the prior week, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported last week. Six children died from the flu during the last full week in December, bringing the total flu deaths to 26 this season, the report showed. As of the beginning of the new year, the CDC reported for the first time that deaths from flu and pneumonia reached an epidemic level, comprising 6.9 percent of all deaths. That figure slipped slightly below the epidemic level in this week's report, the CDC said. Flu is widespread in 46 U.S. states, up from 36 states in the prior week, according to the CDC. To date, 26 children have died from the flu this season and more than 1,000 across the country have succumbed to the mutated form of the H3 virus. At the end of the year, the CDC confirmed for the first time that deaths from flu and pneumonia reached an epidemic level, comprising 6.9 percent of all deaths. And now, in the midst of a worrisome flu season, health officials are pushing doctors to prescribe antiviral medicines more often. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday sent a new alert to doctors, advising prompt use of Tamiflu and other antivirals for hospitalized flu patients and those at higher risk for complications like pneumonia. CDC officials say a nasty strain of flu is going around that is more dangerous to elderly people and very young children. What's more, officials think the flu vaccine doesn't work well against this particular virus. So 'it's more important than usual' that doctors treat certain patients with Tamiflu or other antiviral medications, CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden said at a press conference Friday. National epidemic: The flu has been reported as widespread in 46 states across the country this season . CDC officials said flu was reported to be widespread in 46 states last week, up from 43 the week before. But there was a small drop in states reporting high numbers of flu-related doctor's office visits. That's one sign that for some areas, the worst stretch of the current flu season may be ending. Flu seasons tend to last about 13 weeks, and CDC data suggests the nation is about seven weeks in, Frieden said. 'It seems we're right in the middle of flu season,' he said. However, while flu may be ebbing in some states, it's increasing in others, and it's not clear whether flu has peaked overall, health officials said. CDC research suggests doctors prescribe antivirals to one in five high-risk flu patients. CDC officials say the number should be higher. When given promptly - within two days of the beginning of flu symptoms - they can shorten the amount of time someone is sick with the flu, a number of studies have found. The drugs also can prevent patients from becoming sick enough to end up in a hospital intensive care unit - or worse, Frieden said. 'Antiviral flu medicines save lives,' he said. The CDC sent an advisory to physicians last month, warning them this could be a potentially bad flu season and encouraging prompt treatment with antivirals. CDC officials said doctors should not wait for test results confirming the flu if they are dealing with an elderly patient, someone who is very sick from the flu, or someone with pre-existing conditions like asthma, diabetes and heart disease. 'Last week was the first week that this particular number exceeded the epidemic threshold, but we've been in a flu epidemic for weeks now,' said Dr. Michael Jhung, medical officer in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Influenza Division. The epidemic has become so bad that antiviral drugs such as Tamiflu have been used and doctors are being urged to prescribe the drug to patients with flu-like symptoms even before tests confirm influenza as the cause. The United States is midway through the 2015 flu season and the CDC's Dr. Thomas Frieden said that some doctors in the United States may not be prescribing Tamiflu because they believe the drugs do not work. Victims: Ayzlee McCarthy, 3,  and Jose Gullapa, 6, all passed away within 72 hours of contracting the flu last month . Victims: New Jersey mother, Nicole Born, (left) and Wisconsin radiology technician Katy McQuestion (right) died from complications arising from the flu in the New Year . Children are among those hardest hit by the flu this year and their health has been compromised by the virulent mutant form of flu that has struck. Shannon Zwanziger, 17, died on December 9 after being struck down with this years mutated H3N2 strain, despite having no underlying health conditions. And experts said the crisis is only going to worsen, with January and February the worst months for flu nationwide. The problem worrying the authorities is the particular strain of flu. This year's dominant strain is the H3N2, which was not targeted by vaccinations this year. It affects children and those over 65 particularly, such as Ayzlee McCarthy, who died three days after developing symptoms at home in Des Moines, Iowa. Ayzlee had no underlying health conditions and was buried on New Year's Day. Another child who died just days after developing symptoms was Jose Gullapa, 6, who passed away in his father's arms on December 20. He had fallen ill just two days before, but was suffering from asthma. Vaccinated: McQuestion, 26, had been inoculated against the flu before she passed away in January but this years strain is proving resilient . Another tragic case of a flu fatality is that of New Jersey mother, Nicole Born, 40, who died after complications from the mutated virus. Nicole has left a seven-year-old and a three-year-old behind and was overcome by the flu within the space of one week. Her family revealed that Nicole was not vaccinated before getting sick and as a result, they have all had the jab. Meanwhile, all the way across the country in Wisconsin, 26-year-old Katy McQuestion passed away from the flu after developing sepsis that caused her to have a heart attack. McQuestion had been suffering from flu-like symptoms for three days and had been coughing and vomiting. Her condition suddenly worsened despite her not having a fever and her family said that even though she had got the vaccine it did not seem to have been sufficient.","Kobi Pickett, 15, passed away on Sunday after the tragic accident .

"Half full or half empty? The answer could predict a person's risk of heart disease and early death . We're told to always look on the bright side of life - and now it seems there's a good reason why. People with a positive outlook on life are twice as likely to have healthier hearts and circulation, researchers claim. Not only that, optimists take better care of themselves. Compared to their more negative counterparts, they had significantly better blood sugar, healthier cholesterol readings and were more physically active. They were also more likely to have a healthier body mass index and less likely to smoke. The researchers, from the University of Illinois, suggested boosting people's mental well being could help tackle poor health. A person is at risk of heart disease if they have high blood pressure, smoke, have high blood cholesterol, are diabetic, do not exercise, are overweight or obese or have a family history of heart disease. Rosalba Hernandez, professor of social work, said: 'Individuals with the highest levels of optimism have twice the odds of being in ideal cardiovascular health compared to their more pessimistic counterparts. 'This association remains significant, even after adjusting for socio-demographic characteristics and poor mental health.' The study published in the journal Health Behavior and Policy Review was the first to examine associations between optimism and heart health in more than 5,000 US adults. Their heart health was measured and scored as poor, intermediate and ideal. The scoring was based on their blood pressure, body mass index, blood sugar readings, cholesterol levels, diet, physical activity and whether they used tobacco. They were also quizzed on their outlook on life and physical health, with researchers asking if they suffered from arthritis, liver and kidney disease. People who were the most optimistic were 50 and 76 per cent more likely to have total health scores in the intermediate or ideal ranges, respectively. The association between optimism and cardiovascular health was even stronger when socio-demographic characteristics such as age, race and ethnicity, income and education status were factored in. People who were the most optimistic were twice as likely to have ideal heart health, and 55 per cent more likely to have a total health score in the intermediate range. Professor Hernandez said: 'At the population level, even this moderate difference in cardiovascular health translates into a significant reduction in death rates.' The study backs up previous findings about the health benefits of being an optimist. Those who with a positive outlook on life are twice as likely to have healthier hearts and circulation, researchers claim. Not only did optimists have a more positive outlook, they took better care of themselves . Researchers at University of Pittsburgh found women who were optimistic were 14 per cent less likely to die from any cause than pessimists. They were also 30 per cent less likely to die from heart disease after eight years of follow up in the study. Optimists also were also less likely to have high blood pressure, diabetes or smoke cigarettes. But don't overdo it: One researcher believes a 'realistic sense of optimism' is key. Sophie Chou, an organisational psychology researcher at National Taiwan University, claims people with this mindset are more likely to be happy and successful than those who are pessimistic or wildly optimistic. A realistic optimist is defined as someone who looks on the bright side of life but has a realistic grasp on the present and what to expect in life. She said realistic optimists use their realism to perform well at work and in exams, while their positive outlook enables them to dodge periods of depression and helps them spot opportunities.","Those with a positive outlook on life twice as likely to have healthier hearts .

"Israel expects the number of . French Jews emigrating to the country in 2015 to reach up to 15,000, following the killings at a Paris kosher grocery last Friday. The number of French-Jewish immigrants was already predicted to rise sharply from last year's record number of 7,000, after more than doubling since 2013. Natan Sharansky, head of the Jewish Agency promoting . emigration to Israel, said his original estimate for 2015 was 10,000 . French immigrants, but is now expecting it to be much higher. The Jewish Agency promoting emigration to Israel, said the original estimate for 2015 was 10,000 French immigrants, but is now expecting it to be much higher after the attack at a Paris kosher grocery (pictured) 'It will probably be much more than 10,000,' he said at a Jewish Agency meeting for French considering emigration. Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Liebermann, at his side, said . about 700 Jews had attended the session during the day. Both men flew to Paris with Prime Minister Benjamin . Netanyahu for a mass protest on Sunday that united world leaders . - including Muslim and Jewish statesmen - with over a million . French to honour 17 victims of Islamist militant attacks. They later attended a memorial service for all the victims . at the Paris Grand Synagogue with Hollande and Prime Minister . Manuel Valls. The victims died in three days of violence that began with . an attack on the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo on Wednesday . and ended with a hostage-taking at a kosher supermarket on . Friday. Four were killed at the Jewish shop. Support: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, seen visiting the scene in Paris, has said that every Jew who wanted to move to Israel would be 'welcomed with a warm heart and open arms' In 2014, 7,086 Jews emigrated from France to Israel, the highest number in the world, up from 3,293 in 2013. France was followed by 5,913 Jewish migrants from Ukraine and Moldova and 4,827 from Russia, Belarus and the Baltic States. A controversial French comedian is facing up to seven years in prison for inciting terrorism with a Facebook joke. Dieudonne M'bala M'bala, a 48-year-old known simply as Dieudonne, was in custody at a police station in Paris. Dieudonne, who has convictions for anti-Semitism, joked that his humour was no different to Charlie Hebdo, comparing himself to terrorist Amedy Coulibaly, who took hostages at a kosher supermarket in Paris on Friday, killing four Jews and a policewoman. 'Tonight, as far as I'm concerned, I feel like Charlie Coulibaly' he wrote. It was a play on words of 'Je suis Charlie' (I am Charlie), the phrase that has become a rallying cry for free speech supporters around the world following last week's massacre. Dieudonne said: 'For a year, I have been treated like public enemy number one, while I seek to do nothing but make people laugh.' But Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve, who visited Paris's Jewish quarter in the Marais last Monday, described Dieudonne's remarks as 'contemptible'. He said Dieudonne faced court action for 'a lack of respect and a willingness to stir up hatred and division.' Dieudonne faces up to seven years in prison and a fine of around £80,000 under France's strict anti-terror laws. In a statement late on Saturday, Netanyahu said an Israeli governmental committee would convene in the coming week to find ways to boost Jewish immigration from France and other European countries 'which are being hit by terrible anti-Semitism'. Netanyahu's said that every Jew who wanted to move to Israel would be 'welcomed with a warm heart and open arms.' 'To all the Jews of France and to all the Jews of Europe, I . wish to say: the State of Israel is not only the place to which . you pray, the State of Israel is also your home,' he said. Roger Cukierman, head of CRIF, the Representative Council of French Jewish Institutions' umbrella group, said after meeting President Francois . Hollande that he was promised army protection if needed for . Jewish institutions in France. 'They told us that all schools and all synagogues will be . protected in measures that, if necessary, extend beyond the . police to the army,' he said. The attacker who took hostages at the kosher supermarket . said he was targeting the Jewish community. The gunman, Amedy . Coulibaly, was killed as police broke the siege. The two gunmen who attacked the weekly Charlie Hebdo, . killing its editor-in-chief and leading cartoonists, belonged to the same Paris-based Islamist militant cell, police said. France has the largest Jewish population in Europe, having . grown by nearly half since World War Two to total some 550,000 . according to CRIF.

"Eight inmates and two corrections officers died Wednesday when a prison bus skidded off an icy West Texas highway, slid down an embankment and collided with a passing freight train, authorities said. The overpass on Interstate 20 was slick with ice Wednesday morning when the Texas Department of Criminal Justice bus left the roadway in Penwell, just west of Odessa, according to Ector County Sheriff Mark Donaldson. An earlier accident on the I-20 overpass may have contributed to the prison bus losing control, Donaldson said. Scroll Down for Video . Fatal crash: Officials investigate the scene of a prison transport bus crash in Penwell, Texas, Wednesday, January 14, 2015. Law enforcement officials said the bus carrying prisoners and corrections officers fell from an overpass in West Texas and crashed onto train tracks below, killing at least 10 people . Devastation: The bus was traveling from Abilene to El Paso with 12 inmates and three corrections officers aboard. It was transporting offenders from the Middleton Unit in Abilene, which houses male offenders and is not a high security unit . The Texas Department of Criminal Justice confirmed the 10 deaths in a statement, adding that four prisoners and one corrections officer were injured. 'It's as bad as you can imagine,' Odessa Fire and Rescue Battalion Chief Kavin Tinney told the Odessa American newspaper. 'In 32 years it's as bad as anything I've seen.' Tiffany Harston, spokeswoman for Medical Center Hospital in Odessa, said four of the injured are in critical condition and one is in serious condition. 'It's with a heavy heart that we mourn the loss of those killed and injured this morning in a tragic accident,' said Brad Livingston, executive director of the Department of Criminal Justice. 'Their loved ones will be in our thoughts and prayers.' Wreck: One of the freight trains carriages has been split open by the collision - revealing the contents that were being transported to Marion, Arkansas . Jason Clark, a spokesman for the Department of Criminal Justice, said the bus was taking the inmates from the Middleton prison in Abilene to the Sanchez prison in El Paso. The prisoners were handcuffed together in pairs. After the accident around 7:30 a.m., the white bus came to rest on its side, next to the railroad tracks, crumpled with heavy damage to its front and undercarriage. The top of the bus was caved inward. The Union Pacific freight train with four locomotives and 58 cars came to a stop soon after. None of the cars derailed, but two containers at the rear of the train were damaged, said Mark Davis, a railroad spokesman. The containers were carrying hundreds of parcels and packages, many of which were strewn along the tracks.

"A devoted mother has had the chance to see her daughter as a young woman - 13 years after she was brutally murdered by her father. Kathy Brant, from Illinois, US, has had a photo of Lindsay Powell - who was killed in a vicious hammer attack at the age of four - aged digitally to imagine the face she would have had at 18. ‘She is absolutely beautiful. Every time I look at her, I feel full of hope,’ the 41-year-old said. Kathy Brant had a picture made of Lindsay Powell as a young woman, digitally aged from childhood snaps . Kathy was a happily married mother of four when her life tragically changed. On February 21, 1997 Kathy's ex-husband Joseph Bradley Powell, known as Brad, instigated a horrifying attack on his wife and children. The couple had been childhood sweethearts. Kathy said: ‘We lived next door to each other and he told me we’d live happily ever after. Then when I was five, his family moved away.’ Over the years she forgot about Brad only to run into him at a bar when she was 18. The couple soon married and shortly after, Kathy gave birth to Lindsay followed by sons, Joey, Anthony and Brandon, who was just a few months old when the attack took place. The new picture of Lindsay Powell as an 18-year-old has given her mother Kathy Brant hope again . ‘It was just after Valentines. Brad had bought me a rose and I will still as in love with him as ever,' she said. 'He’d promised me we’d live happily ever after, and as far as I was concerned that dream had come true.’ Brad’s half-brother, Eric, then 19, visited for one of his regular visits but Kathy had no notion of his real purpose that night. Kathy said: ‘Eric didn’t have much luck in love so he stayed with us often.’ ‘The kids were in bed and we were enjoying a glass of wine when Eric offered to re-fill my glass. The next thing I remember is being hit and then everything went black.’ In fact, Kathy stayed conscious enough to scream as Eric hit her over the head 12 times with a hammer and then a dumbbell, before stabbing her in the neck. Police thought the noise must have disturbed her two oldest children Lindsay and Joey, who got up to see what was happening. ‘Apparently, when they refused to go back to bed, Brad flipped and attacked them with the hammer. ‘My mum told me Lindsay had died when I woke in the hospital. Joey survived but with brain injuries.’ Police later told Kathy that they'd found proof that Brad was having an affair. She said: ‘Brad planned it all but was too afraid to kill me himself. He got Eric to do it. When they tried to get away they crashed their car and the registration plate led officers to our address. Kathy with her sons, from left to right, Joey, Tony and Brandon . Lindsay Powell, who was killed at the age of four, with her brothers, from left, Joey, Brandon and Tony . 'What they found was carnage. Lindsay was already gone. Poor Joey was clinging to life and I was unconscious, my skull caved in. ‘Days later, I held Lindsay’s funeral, lost in grief. I was haunted by one question – why? It didn’t make any sense. Why would Brad want to hurt me and the kids? ‘Focusing all my energies on Joey, I nursed him until he was allowed home a month later. He had a titanium plate fitted into his head. He suffered seizures and brain damage. I promised him we’d get through it.’ It took a year for the case to go to court. ‘Police said they’d found love letters from Brad to another woman,’ Kathy said. ‘Rather than leaving me, he’d wanted me dead. I wanted to scream, but why hurt Lindsay?’ Kathy's husband Joseph 'Brad' Powell (left) killed Lindsay, his brother Eric Sutton (right) attacked Kathy . On 13 February 1998, Joseph Bradley Powell, 25, was found guilty of two counts of attempted murder and one of murder. He was sentenced to 54 years in prison. His brother Eric Sutton was jailed for 47 years on the same charges. Kathy was finally granted a divorce soon after and had Brad’s parental rights revoked. She had received justice but Kathy couldn't cope with the guilt of surviving while Lindsay died and the sheer difficulty of caring for Joey. ‘I tortured myself with every detail. I kept thinking it should be me not Lindsay who was dead. ‘Looking after Joey was very hard and eventually I had a nervous breakdown,’ she said. A friend offered to help her, and now Kathy says she has a great relationship with Joey, 20, Anthony, 19, and Brandon, 17. Kathy releases balloons on Lindsay's birthday to keep her memory alive and mark her life . Brad turned on his daughter Lindsay when she disturbed his brother attacking her mother, Kathy . Her sons have even helped her rebuild her life and she has become an ardent campaigner against child abuse. Kathy commissioned the picture of Lindsay as an adult smiling down on her to help start looking to the future. She said: ‘I sent one of her photos to a professional, who sent back an image of what she might look like today. ‘It hangs proudly on my living room wall. Having her look down on me makes me feel closer to her. ‘It reminds me that things do move on. For Lindsay’s sake, I won’t let Brad ruin my life any more. 'Anyone I can help now means my girl’s life wasn’t lost in vain.’","Kathy Brant's ex-husband Brad murdered Lindsay, 4, in a vicious attack .

"If you've always dreamed of seeing the world's southernmost continent but can't bear the cold, then perhaps these day trips are for you. An airline is offering 12-hour tours over the expanses of Antarctica so passengers can enjoy the view, but there will be no venturing out in the snow because the planes don't land. For a truly unique extravagant experience, the company Antarctica Sightseeing Flights even offers a special New Year's Eve Party flight, where guests will be treated to a live jazz band and arguably the 'coolest' party experience in the world. Antartica Sightseeing Flights offer once in a lifetime day trips to see the southernmost continent from the sky . Currently, the tour company offers flights from five major Australian cities, including Sydney and Brisbane . Operating out of Australia on a private Qantas 747 plane, the unusual tour flies from five Australian cities: Sydney, Melbourne, Perth, Adelaide and Brisbane. But you'll need deep pockets. Prices start from AUS$1,000 (£535), but that is for an aisle seat. For a spot next to the window you'll be parting with $1,999 (£1,069). And if you want to travel Ice Class, with Champagne and lie-flat beds it will set you back $7,999 (£4,280). New Year's Eve Party flights are priced on application. Each of the flights takes anywhere between 12 to 13 hours with planes flying above the continent for about four of those hours - without ever touching the ground. Flights go as low as 10,000 feet, offering spectacular views of major landmarks, such as Ninnis Glacier and Mertz Glacier, as well as the Transantarctic Mountains and the Ross Sea. Each of the flights takes between 12 to 13 hours, with about 4 hours spent over top of Antarctica . Passengers will be able to view the Mertz Glacier (pictured) as well as the Ninnis Glacier from 10,000 feet . The stunning Transantarctic Mountains will also be visible from the plane, like these frozen rapids . Depending on weather conditions, the pilots have several different routes that they can take to ensure the best visibility. The aircraft will also fly 'figure 8's' over these specific points of interest so that they can be viewed on both sides of the aircraft. Unfortunately, however, the low altitude is still not close enough to see any wildlife up close. Experts on each flight will be present to answer all of your questions, as well as to give talks on the environment and the history of the area. Video screenings and live radio link ups with sciences on the research bases will also take place. Experts are on board the flight the entire time to share stories, answer questions and explain video clips . Unfortunately, the 747 won't get close enough for detailed views of the wildlife below . Still, the incredible views will last for over four hours as the pilots fly 'figure 8s.' Pictured: the Ross Sea . During the 12 hour flight, passengers will experience the full Qantas flight service, including two meals, in-flight snacks and complimentary bar service. During all flights, cabins are separated into seven classes, from Economy Class to Ice Class (first class). Flights are classified as domestic, meaning that no passport is required. However, passengers must bring photo ID. Prices begin at AUD$1,199 (£647) per person and the next flight departs from Brisbane on January 18.","Antarctica Sightseeing Flights offers one-day excursions from Australia .

"Before: Leanne Johnson pictured as a schoolgirl in a photograph released by her family . For Pamela Johnson, these pictures tell a story of almost unbearable tragedy. One shows her daughter Leanne as an angelic schoolgirl, smiling and full of hope for the future. The other shows the college student at 26, near-comatose on her bed after taking crack cocaine and heroin – the drugs that would take her life shortly after. Despite the harrowing impact of the images, Mrs Johnson, 67, wants them to be published in the hope that charting her daughter’s decline from happy child to hopeless addict will act as a warning to others of the dangers of drugs. An inquest this week heard how Miss Johnson, a trainee hairdresser, had desperately tried to end her habit and appeared on TV’s Jeremy Kyle Show to talk about her demons. But despite successfully ‘going clean’ after four months in rehab, she went on a secret drug binge when she returned home to Bolton. It would be her last. Her sister Melanie Gatis said: ‘She succeeded in kicking her habit and then embarked on a moment of madness which cost her life. ‘If her story saves one person’s life then Leanne has achieved some form of legacy.’ The Bolton inquest was told Miss Johnson came from a respectable family and had held down a number of jobs after studying at college. But her life began to fall apart when she turned 18 and began a relationship with a man who introduced her to drugs. She became addicted to heroin and crack cocaine – at one stage going through six bags of heroin every day and going missing for several weeks at a time. Another sister Lisa Stevenson told the inquest: ‘She used to just disappear and go and self-destruct but she would eventually come home.’ In May last year Miss Johnson contacted ITV’s Jeremy Kyle talk show in a ‘cry for help’ and was later offered a place on a rehab programme in Luton. At first it was a success and Mrs Johnson said she felt as if ‘I had got my daughter back’. ‘She said she never felt better and had never been happier,’ she added. After: Leanne is pictured under the influence of drugs; her family took these photographs to show her in a bid to shock her into changing her behaviour . Tragic: Leanne's family have released a series of old photographs of her  to warn against the dangers of drugs . Horror: These shocking images, also taken by Leanne's family, show how low she sank due to the addiction which eventually killed her . Help: Leanne went on the Jeremy Kyle Show in a bid to get her addiction under control . Weeping: But she vowed to kick drugs after going on the show and was subsequently sent to rehab . Rehab: Leanne's family praised the show's producers for helping her recover from addiction before she relapsed . But Miss Johnson lost her place on a second stint of the rehab when she broke the rules by drinking alcohol. Just eight days after returning home in September last year she was dead. To the bafflement of her family, Miss Johnson had a ‘blip’ and took a fatal overdose. Sadly, at the time she had been using her mobile phone to download an application form for a hairdressing course. Battle: Leanne, pictured left on a night out, struggled with addiction for eight years . Family: Leanne as a toddler with her mother, Pamela, in another snap from the family photo album . Together: Leanne with her mother, left, and one of her older sisters, right . Adorable: Leanne grew from a happy-go-lucky little girl into a young woman ravaged by drugs . Verdict: A coroner ruled that Leanne's died from misadventure and issued a warning about drug abuse . Her mother found her body in her bedroom along with drug paraphernalia by her side, including a syringe in an ashtray and a crack pipe in her handbag. Mrs Gatis, 43, said: ‘Leanne had a last-minute blip and we still don’t know why. We honestly thought we’d got our sister back.’ Coroner Alan Walsh recorded a verdict of death by misadventure.","Leanne Johnson came from a happy family but turned to drugs aged 18 .

"A schoolgirl has been kicked out of lessons just months before she begins her GCSEs because her shoes were not shiny enough. Mother Tina Curran has blasted Brownhills School in Walsall, West Midlands, after her 15-year-old daughter Jodie Dawes was sent home from school because her smart, black velvet shoes were not 'polishable'. Letters were sent out before the Christmas holiday telling parents that children must wear shiny shoes or face being sent home. Mother Tina Curran (pictured left) has blasted Brownhills School in Walsall, West Midlands, after her 15-year-old daughter Jodie Dawes (right) was sent home from school because her black shoes weren't shiny enough . But Ms Curran argues many families had already bought shoes for their children and could not afford to replace them after the new rules were introduced at Christmas. Headteacher Helen Keenan has hit back saying rules must be obeyed and she would not apologise for maintaining high standards at the school. Ms Curran said: 'My daughter Jodie was targeted by one of the teachers as soon as she turned up last Monday. 'Someone rang us to say that she was not properly dressed for school. She was allowed to stay, but said some children were sent home. A letter given to parents before Christmas introducing the new, stricter uniform rules for pupils . The letter included this shoe guide, which outline what shoes are and are not acceptable in the school . 'But the next day she was sent home. I am going to get her some other shoes, but I'm not happy about it. 'Lots of the mums have been complaining that they can't afford to keep buying shoes. 'If the children are in school what does it matter if they're not exactly the right type of shoe - their brains are not in their feet are they? 'To me the most important thing is that they're in school learning. Jodie is doing her GCSEs this year and shouldn't be missing any lessons.' Mrs Keenan yesterday defended the policy, saying: 'I'm not apologising for our high standards. We have tried to apply the policy sensibly. 'We are not in the habit of sending people home unnecessarily. Only a couple were sent home to change their shoes or get it sorted. 'The problem is parents want to send their children to a good school, with good standards, but when it doesn't suit them some complain.' MailOnline reported in October that Anne Jewer (pictured) was left furious when her son, Bradley, was forced to take lessons alone at Mayfield School in Portsmouth, Hampshire because his shoes were not 'polishable' The school, which caters 700 pupils aged 11-18, was rated 'good' at its last Ofsted inspection in 2013. This case is not the first of its kind. In October MailOnine reported that a 12-year-old schoolboy was being forced to study alone at school because his shoes are not 'polishable'. Bradley Jewer was taken out of regular lessons and was forced to study in isolation because the school said he was wearing the wrong footwear. His angry mother, Anne, said the move damaged her son's education by preventing him from interacting with other children. Staff at Mayfield School in Portsmouth, Hampshire, have removed the year eight pupil from his classes because his black Converse shoes do not meet required standards. Tyler Hawkins, 15, (pictured) was told to colour in the white 'swoosh' and soles on his Nike shoes at Newquay's Tretherras School following new rules . Pupils and parents around the country have reported being shocked at the stricter uniform rules being imposed in Britain's schools after they returned from the summer holidays. In October MailOnline reported around 100 students were sent home just minutes after arriving for the first day of term when staff at The Coseley School, Bilston, West Midlands, told them footwear that was not 'black, leather shoes' was 'inappropriate'. Emma Guthrie, who bought a £20 pair of black formal shoes for her son Lewis, 12, said: 'We had a text about the shoes the day before. But that's no good. 'I think it's disgraceful. What have [shoes] got to do with him looking at a blackboard, reading and writing? 'I'm not going out and buying any more, I'm putting my foot down and he's wearing them.' A few days later, 15-year-old Tyler Hawkins was told to 'colour in' the white 'swoosh' and soles on his Nike shoes with a black marker pen at Newquay's Tretherras School. His mother, Gemma, said: 'Uniforms cost a lot of money as it is. I've got three children and I don't get any help. 'It's annoyed me so much I feel like being a rebel myself and making him buy an orange pair.' Later last month, parents of pupils at Headlands School in Bridlington, East Yorkshire claimed their teenage daughters have been left in tears after teachers told the pupils their trousers were too tight. Jaydee Hart, 13, Chloe Gregory, 14, and Amelia Wileman, 13, were told their uniforms were 'too tight' at their school, Headlands School in Bridlington, East Yorkshire . They said their children have been told by teachers their black school trousers are too tight around the 'calf and bottom areas' and are not part of the school uniform. Sian Hart said her 13-year-old daughter, Jaydee, was among those taken out of class and told her trousers were too tight. She said: 'She has been wearing the same uniform ever since she started at Headlands. She's very skinny and tall and I really struggle to find trousers that fit her.","Jodie Dawes, 15, was sent home after turning up to school in velvet shoes .

"The Blackpool Tower Ballroom is the seaside town's pride and joy. But it takes a lot of elbow grease to keep it sparkling. Last year, the well-known landmark hosted The iconic Blackpool Tower’s 120th Anniversary celebrations and events such as the Carnival Ball, Gold Soul and Lancashire Tourism Awards – not to mention the ultimate ballroom dancing competition, Strictly Come Dancing. So it's hardly surprising that it's in need of a painstaking cleaning and maintenance programme - an annual event which  takes two weeks to complete. This huge task begins with a thorough refurbishment of the dance floor, which since the ballroom opened 118 years ago, has been graced by millions of fox-trotting feet and sees 650,000 visitors each year. A team of maintenance engineers strip back, sand and polish the 120ft parquet floor, consisting of 30,602 blocks of mahogany, oak and walnut. The ballroom’s 14 ornate Edwardian chandeliers are then lowered, and every shard of crystal is buffed. Each of the 1,120 lights must be individually inspected, to ensure their perfect working condition for the coming season. General Manager, Kate Shane, explains: 'Of course it's a colossal undertaking, requiring huge skill, but it's maintenance work such as this that keeps the opulence and grandeur of The Blackpool Tower Ballroom alive. 'Because of the extra funds generated from the balconies fee of £2.95 per person we are now in a position to start Phase 1 work on the upholstery in The Blackpool Tower Ballroom. 'We're incredibly proud of our team, whose dedication and hard work make it possible to preserve this great British building.

"A 63-year-old man in Houston, Texas is on trial for allegedly luring several teenage girls to his home in Friendswood where he paid them hundreds of dollars to perform sexual favors. Michael Wayne McIntosh - known to his victims as 'Money Mike' - faces three charges of sexual assault of a child, and could face up to 20 years in prison if convicted. In opening arguments on Tuesday, McIntosh's defense attorney Charles Thompson took a bold stand in telling the jury that the eight victims are not to be trusted. 'At the end of the day you are not going to find any of these women credible,' Thompson said on the first day of the trial. Scroll down for video . Ring leader: Michael Wayne McIntosh - known as 'Money Mike' to his victims - appears in court on Tuesday as he stands trial for three counts of sexual assault of a child . Den of prostitution: Prosecutors say the 63-year-old man lured high school girls to his home in Friendswood, Texas where he paid them hundreds of dollars to perform sexual favors. Above, the address connected to McIntosh according to public records . He explained that one of the girls, initially arrested for allegedly helping arrange the dates between her friends and McIntosh, is only testifying because the prosecution agreed to drop the charges against her. 'They have cut a deal where she doesn't get into trouble in order win this case,' he said. The prosecution admits that they did agree not to pursue the charges, but that they made no binding agreement. And two of the other victims are currently in the midst of civil lawsuits against McIntosh, with their families seeking $2.5million for emotional damage. 'They thought there was going to be a payday for this, like prostitutes do,' Thompson told jurors. That harsh portrayal was not echoed on the stand when one of the girls testified yesterday. A girl identified as 'Stephanie' said she was 15 at the time when she first met McIntosh in the summer of 2013 through a friend at Ojos Locos Restaurant, and her eyes welled with tears as she was asked to point out in court the grey-haired man in a dark blue suit. Meeting place: One of the girls who took the stand on Tuesday says she met McIntosh through a friend at this restaurant in southeast Houston. She says she later performed oral sex on him in exchange for $300 for books . She said after meeting at the restaurant, she and her four friends reconvened with McIntosh at a gas station where he fueled up their car. They then went over to his house for about an hour, during which he gave all four girls $100. Following a known method by pedophiles, McIntosh did not try to initiate sexual contact with the girls that night. It was only later, when she texted him asking for $300 dollars for books, that he asked her to do him a favor in return. Stephanie says her boyfriend drover her over to McIntosh's house, and waited outside while she went in to meet the old man. He took her into a bedroom and asked her to perform oral sex. She says she remained fully clothed during the brief encounter and quickly made an excuse to leave with her money when it was over. McIntosh allegedly started the ring after becoming close with a 16-year-old girl he met at a local restaurant. Heavy charges: McIntosh faces 20 years in prison if convicted. Pictured above entering court on Tuesday . After befriending her by leaving several large tips of $100 or more, he invited her over to his house, and convinced her to bring her 'easily manipulated' friends. She recruited these girls, between the ages of 14 and 17, from Clear Springs High School and Clear Creek High School. When the meetings turned sexual, McIntosh would pay the girls thousands of dollars, and the girl allegedly took her cut of the cash. When a prosecutor asked one of the victims how she spent her money, she said she used it on food, purses, jeans and a tanning membership. One of the questions that has been charging through this case is how the girls were able to spend so much time at McIntosh's house without raising an alarm with their parents. Some of the victims said they simply lied about where they were. Other aspects of the ring were much harder to conceal. 'There was a time I fell asleep and my mom went through my purse and found a thousand dollars and questioned me about it. I told her I was holding the money for my friend,' said one witness.","The trial for Michael Wayne McIntosh started Tuesday in Houston, Texas .

"Female immigrants being held at a notorious detention centre are treated like animals and sexually abused by staff, a refugee charity has claimed. Women at the Yarl's Wood detention centre in Bedfordshire are being watched by male staff in intimate situations including when using the toilet, Women for Refugee Women (WRW) said in a report. They claim this is despite reassurances from the Home Office that this practice would not be allowed after they explained most of the women at Yarl's Wood are victims of sexual violence. The Yarl's Wood detention centre in Bedfordshire. A report has claimed that some female detainees at the facility have been subjected to sexual abuse . The charity interviewed 38 women who were recently or currently detained in Yarl's Wood, of whom 33 said that they were seen by male staff in the centre in situations including when naked and when using the toilet or bathroom. Six women claimed staff had made sexual suggestions and three alleged they were touched sexually. Seven reported being physically assaulted. One interviewee told the report: 'They spoke to me as if I was an animal, not a human being.' Another, who was on suicide watch in Yarl's Wood, told the charity: 'When you are on suicide watch you ask for a woman when you want to take a shower, they said we don't have enough staff. 'I was on suicide watch and so was my room mate. A man and a woman were watching us. We asked if the man could leave while we went to the toilet and he refused. They didn't respect us.' Women for Refugee Women interviewed 38 women who were recently or currently detained in Yarl's Wood, pictured, of whom 33 said that they were seen by male staff in the centre in situations including when naked and when using the toilet or bathroom . Other findings show 13 - or a third - of the women interviewed said that they were searched by male staff, and 22, more than half, said they were searched by women while being watched by men. Yarl's Wood has faced heavy criticism in the past by human rights campaigners amid reports of sexual misconduct by staff, women being detained for long periods and pregnant detainees being held without justification. Despite troubles faced by the centre, the Home Office recently awarded private firm Serco a £70 million contract to operate the immigration jail for a further eight years. One of the waiting areas inside Yarl's Wood detention centre. The Home Office has said the allegations in the report are uncorroborated . Conservative MP Richard Fuller, who is a member of the current Parliamentary Detention Inquiry panel, said: 'I support a robust immigration policy but no purpose is served by locking up vulnerable women indefinitely in Yarl's Wood. 'Current detention practice is inefficient, unjust and expensive and reform is urgently needed.' The WRW report is being launched at a conference in central London with more than 100 refugee women and supporters . The report also described how more than 70% of the women in the sample said that they had been raped or been victims of other sexual violence before coming to the UK. And more than half of the women were on suicide watch, while 40% said that they self-harmed while inside. Natasha Walter, director of Women for Refugee Women, said: 'This report shows that survivors of sexual violence who come to the UK seeking protection are routinely being locked up and are denied privacy and dignity in detention despite claims to the contrary from the Home Office. 'The behaviour of staff, particularly male staff, in Yarl's Wood detention centre, is adding to the trauma of survivors of sexual violence. 'While Britain is taking steps to try to combat sexual violence at home and abroad and protect victims, the Government cannot allow this to continue. 'Detention has no place in the asylum process. It is expensive, unjust and inefficient to lock up people who have come here to seek asylum. 'Only a minority of women leave Yarl's Wood to be deported; most re-enter British society to continue their asylum claims. Women who seek protection in the UK should be able to live in the community while their claims are considered.' However, a Home Office spokesman said: 'Detention and removal are essential elements of an effective immigration system. 'We are committed to treating all detainees with dignity and respect, and take any allegations to the contrary very seriously. 'As the report itself makes clear, the allegations in this report are uncorroborated — so we have invited Women for Refugee Women to supply details of the cases in question so that they can be investigated fully. 'The latest independent inspection by Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons found that Yarl's was a respectful and safe place.' While Norman Abusin from contractor Serco added: 'We take all complaints seriously and we have strict procedures for dealing with them. They are always fully investigated and, if appropriate, disciplinary action is taken.'","Report says women at the centre have been subjected to abuse by staff .

"Tulisa Contostavlos sobbed in court today after a judge threw out her appeal against her conviction for punching the celebrity blogger she suspected of putting her sex tape online. The 26-year-old former X Factor judge was found guilty of hitting the reality star Savvas Morgan at the 2013 V Festival in Chelmsford as he followed her to a Winnebago for a party. Judge David Radford, sitting at the appeal hearing at Snaresbrook Crown Court today, refused to accept that the singer had not punched him and said she 'lost control'. Tulisa Contostavlos, left, lost the appeal for her conviction reality star Savvas Morgan, right, who she says conducted a 'vendetta' against her. Mr Morgan told the court he did not watch X Factor as he lived in L.A. But the judge said he had the 'greatest sympathy' for Contostavlos and revoked the fines and compensation she had originally been ordered to pay. Mr Morgan claimed that the singer has had a grudge against him since he published a link to a sex tape leaked by her ex-boyfriend, rapper Justin Edwards, in 2012. However, Contostavlos claimed she remained calm during the incident and told the hearing that Mr Morgan had a 'strange obsession' with her and insulted her mentally ill mother. She also said he conducted a 'vendetta' against her after an incident in which she asked security to remove him from a VIP area at the Whisky Mist nightclub in London's Mayfair. Mr Morgan denied the claims and said that when Contostavlos was a judge on the X Factor he did not watch the show as he was living in Los Angeles, where it's not aired. It was put to Mr Morgan, who has joined the cast of The Only Way Is Essex, by Contostavlos' counsel Simon Gledhill: 'To suggest you don't have an interest in X Factor must be a complete lie.' Contostavlos (pictured leaving court during a break today) told the appeal hearing that Mr Morgan had a 'strange obsession' with her and outlined suspicions he was involved in releasing a sex tape of her online . He responded: 'Why must that be a complete lie? There's a lot of celebrity things happening daily that I don't have any interest in.' Following the three day hearing, Judge Radford said: 'The appellant voiced concerns, for reasons that we understand and have some sympathy for that a person who had been a real thorn in her side, did not accompany her friends to the Winnebago where she was planning on passing the night. 'That's why and only why she then said what she said to Mr Morgan - we don't find that she had a drink in her hand or was in any way demonstrably drunk. 'The argument that undoubtedly followed was no doubt a result of pent up feelings about Mr Morgan which were then now doubt expressed in clear terms and she told us and she accepts that she became uncharacteristically aggressive.' The judge said it was likely that she had hit Mr Morgan to the left side of his face, but said: 'We've seen no evidence of any injury or of any pain caused.' He added: 'We do have sympathy with what must have been quite a history of provocation, we accept that she has no previous conviction and this was a very brief moment of loss of control.' Contostavlos shook her head and fought tears at the appeal hearing today as it became clear the verdict would go against her. Judge Radford, sitting with two magistrates, said that a security guard who saw the incident was 'undoubtedly independent' and made clear that he saw Contostavlos strike a blow on Mr Morgan. A woman had also said that what she saw was consistent with a blow having been struck. Contostavlos was last year convicted of assaulting Mr Morgan at V Festival in Chelmsford in August 2013 . The judge said Contostavlos had accepted she became verbally aggressive. 'We find she was not calm, this was a lack of self control - the reasons, we understand - and for a brief moment, we find that she did strike Mr Morgan, before very speedily the incident was brought to an end.' Circumstantial evidence also supported the Crown's case, the judge said. 'It is entirely logical so far as what might be expected to happen given the circumstances of the argument, and the previous history between the parties, that that brief excess of lack of control took place.' The former N-Dubz singer had insisted she had asked Mr Morgan 'diplomatically' to stop following her 15-strong entourage as they headed towards her Winnebago. Mr Morgan had attempted talking with former Sugababe Mutya Buena, a friend of Contostavlos, as they left the festival to turn in for the night. Contostavlos said when Mr Morgan turned towards her Winnebago in the VIP area instead of the main exit she politely told him he was not invited to join the party. The judge said he had the 'greatest sympathy' for Contostavlos and revoked the fines  she had originally been ordered to pay last year . She denied storming up to Mr Morgan aggressively, explaining she only needed to turn around to confront him because of their close proximity. In a 'calm' and 'diplomatic' manner she told Mr Morgan to go away, the court heard. 'I was calm and relaxed until his instant reaction, which was aggressive. I didn't want to get into an argument or confrontation,' she said. Contostavlos said Mr Morgan instantly became aggressive, moving towards her and using abusive language. He called her a 's***,' 'w****,' 'a nobody' and went on to insult her mentally ill mother, the court heard. Contostavlos admitted using terms such as 'b******' and 'd*******,' while keeping her hands behind her back throughout. The incident, which lasted around four minutes, escalated when Contostavlos' personal assistant Gareth Varey confronted Mr Morgan. Eventually Contostavlos was led away by her tour manager towards the Winnebago as the argument continued. Varey, was also cleared at magistrates court of using threatening behaviour during the incident . Mr Morgan was left with a puffy eye, the court heard, but claimed that he had lost the photograph he had taken despite being an avid Instagram user. Contostavlos admitted it was out of character for her to argue, but was adamant she did not become violent. She also claimed he followed her and once turned up outside her hotel room in Los Angeles, and other time he unexpectedly showed up at her 23rd birthday party. She told the court she hoped Mr Morgan would be exposed as a 'liar.' The singer also claimed Mr Morgan had only become famous off the back of the animosity between the two and was why he had a part on reality TV show The Only Way Is Essex. Contostavlos described the release of the sex tape in March 2012 was the 'worst time of my life'. She was also accused of helping to supply cocaine after she was set up by 'Fake Sheikh' Mazher Mahmood, but her trial collapsed. Contostavlos, from Friern Barnet, north London, had the fine of £200 and £100 compensation amounts she was previously ordered her to pay revoked, but she was still ordered to pay £1,500 costs and a £15 surcharge. She managed a wan smile as she left the court building, but did not comment.","Tulisa Contostavlos, 26, attempted to overturn conviction for assault .

"Christmas spending on the internet in December rose by much less than expected amid the delivery chaos caused by Black Friday. Annual spending in the month rose by just five per cent, which was the lowest increase over the festive period since internet shopping took off a decade ago. Despite the disappointing numbers, total retail spending on the web reached a new high of £104billion in 2014, which is the first time it has topped £100bn. Scroll down for video . Christmas spending on the internet in December rose by much less than expected amid the delivery chaos caused by Black Friday, which fell at the end of November (above shoppers pictured at an Asda store in Wembley on Black Friday last November) Annual spending rose by just five per cent in December. The poor figures for the month are thought to have been a result of Black Friday, an event imported from the US (above a shopper in Glasgow on Black Friday) The poor figures for December are thought to have been caused by Black Friday, which fell at the end of November and brought forward a lot of present shopping. The event, which has been imported from the US where it kicks off the festive shopping season, was presented by retailers as a huge success however they are now having second thoughts. For while there was a huge spike in spending, these sales were made on the back of big price cuts which will hit profits. At the same time, it seems the event only brought forward gift purchases that would have otherwise have taken place in December, rather than increasing overall sales. Most important of all was the level of orders that a huge number of household name stores could not cope. Marks & Spencer customers were told they had to wait of 10 days to get their purchases, while the online fashion chain ASOS suspended a large part of its their next day delivery system. Amazon, Tesco, Argos, Boots and a host of other household name retailers faced similar problems. At the same time the courier company Yodel, which works with more than 80per cent of web stores, went into meltdown because it did not have enough couriers to ensure items arrived when promised. Such was the crisis that it suspended taking new parcels into its system for two days to clear a backlog of gifts. With the level of orders on Black Friday, a huge number of household name stores could not cope such as Marks & Spencer, whose customers were told they had to wait of 10 days to get their purchases . The net effect of the chaos was that people were put off shopping online for gifts in December and many opted to ‘click and collect’ rather than gamble on items being delivered. The sales figures were published by the web retailer trade body, IMRG, spending experts Experian and the business consultants Capgemini. They said spending in November and December combined was some 13per cent ahead of 2013. Their study confirmed separate research by the British Retail Consortium and accountants, KPMG, which also highlighted problems created by Black Friday. David McCorquodale, the Head of Retail at KPMG, said: ‘The parcel backlogs caused by the aftermath of Black Friday forced some retailers to renege on their delivery guarantees and this impacted shoppers’ confidence to buy gifts online in December. ‘Having hit the internet hard in November, as Christmas neared closer some consumers chose to shop in store to make sure they had their gifts in their hand and not in the mail. ‘The main factor constraining online is the retailers themselves. Their systems still show signs of strain at peak times and they need to be able to cope from order to delivery.’ Head of retail consulting at Capgemini, Adgild Hop (correct), said retailers need to be cautious about attempts to chase big volume sales around events like Black Friday. He said: ‘Black Friday was unquestionably a success for the value-seeking consumer, but for retailers themselves, its success is not quite as clear. ‘As the Index reveals, spending was brought forward a month earlier, at much lower margins for retailers, as a result of the discounts available to customers in November.’ Despite, these problems, he said: ‘2014 has been an important milestone for the online retail sector, with the £100 billion mark being exceeded for the first time. 'When we consider that almost £1 in every £4 is now spent online, and that a large proportion of the other £3 is influenced by some form of digital interaction, it becomes very clear that retailers need to continue to embrace the opportunity that e-Retail poses.’ The IMRG’s Tina Spooner said: ‘While the five per cent December online growth is lower than expected, the story of Christmas trading online this year is one of compression. ‘The anticipated heavy discounting that was very widely communicated in advance of Black Friday served to concentrate the peak around that day in November. ‘The challenge going forward is that Black Friday has been cemented into shoppers’ consciousness and they will expect the same kind of focused discounting next year. 'As an industry, we will need to work together to understand how this extreme activity spike can best be managed in the interests of both shoppers and retailers.'","Annual spending in the month rose by just five per cent - lowest increase over festive period since internet shopping took off decade ago .

"Janice Manzur, 44, (pictured today) and her daughter Amber, 25, reportedly weigh a total of 43 stone and receive £34,000 a year in handouts and say they'd rather be happy and on benefits than thin . A mother and daughter who reportedly weigh a total of 43 stone and receive £34,000 a year in handouts say they'd rather be happy and on benefits than depressed and thin. Janice Manzur, 44, and her daughter Amber, 25, use mobility scooters as their weight means they struggle to get around, while Janice's home in Kirkcaldy, Fife, has been modified by the council to accommodate her disability. Mother-of-two Janice has been claiming benefits since 2006, while her daughter has not worked for more than two years. Together they reportedly receive around £33,600 in benefits a year, which is the equivalent of someone earning £46,000 a year before tax. But the pair have no plans to diet, and say they are happy being overweight, despite the risks of obesity-related health issues. 'I'd rather my daughter live life on benefits being fat and happy than depressed and thin,' Janice, who weighs 26st, told The Sun's Jenny Francis. As well as her scooter, Janice gets around in a wheelchair-accessible Fiat Qubo car, worth around £15,000, which she gets £200 a month in benefits for. There is a disabled parking bay outside her home and a ramp has been placed outside her house, making it easier for her to access. She is living with a number of weight-related conditions, including diabetes, high cholesterol and angina, according to the newspaper. She says she has tried to lose weight in the past, but was unable to shift the pounds and when she asked a doctor about the possibility of having weight loss surgery, such as a gastric band, was told she was too overweight. She then decided to give up attempts to diet. She was working as a manager in a call centre, but left because of weight-related health problems. After winning a tribunal case where it was argued she could work if she lost weight, she now receives £620 in Employment Allowance and £320 in Disability Allowance every month, as well as £300 for rent. 'I've always been big and I'm too fat to work, so I have a genuine disability. I should be miserable but I'm happy. I know this is the way I'm meant to be.' Her daughter, herself a mother-of-one, is said to get £400 a month in Employment Support Allowance and an extra £430 for the rent on her modified flat - short walk from her mother's home - which has no stairs, a low front door enabling easy access for her scooter and a bath with a seat to help her get in and out. She lost her last job in security after breaking her leg and also gets £85 in disability living allowance and £120 in industrial injuries disablement benefit because she is obese and continues to experience problems with her leg.

'People shouldn't judge me or my mum for how big we are because it's in our genes,' she said. While Janice says she eats ready meals because they are cheaper and more convenient than cooking healthier food, Amber says she does not eat much junk food. Neighbour and friend Steven Hunter, 32, said today: 'I see Amber a lot. She's a nice girl. 'Amber is that bad she can hardly walk. It takes her half an hour to get up the stairs. 'She's never walking. When she comes round to see someone it takes her half an hour to get to the house. 'You can tell it p***** her off.' But another neighbour, who did not want to be named criticised the money given to the pair. 'The amount of benefits they get is ridiculous,' she said. 'My views are people like that should have their benefits cut. It will fall to the NHS to pay for treatment.' Janice says although she is too fat to work she is 'happy', and has no plans to diet . As well as her scooter, Janice gets around in a wheelchair-accessible Fiat Qubo car (similar to the model pictured), worth around £15,000, which she gets £200 a month in benefits for .

'There must be a benefits system available to help those people who require assistance and there are many of them. That is correct and that is why it is there. 'But when it is handed to a family who are happy to exploit it to the degree of £34,000 a year and are refusing to diet the system has gone mad. 'It's very difficult to blame the individuals but what I can blame is the health system which actually allowed this to happen.

"A study has claimed that the fragrance of lavender can have a positive effect on how trustworthy a person seems. The researchers say that the scent of the plant promotes relaxation, which can help create mutual trust between two people. And they say their findings could have important implications in areas such as team sports and negotiations. Scroll down for video . Researchers at Leiden University in the Netherlands say lavender (stock image shown) can make you seem more trustworthy. They asked 60 volunteers to take part in a 'trust' study. Some were given the scent of lavender, peppermint or just nothing. People were more likely to lend money when they smelled lavender . The study was carried out by Dr Roberta Sellaro and Dr Lorenza Colzato from Leiden University in the Netherlands and published in the journal Frontiers in Psychology. Dr Colzato told MailOnline said that the effect was likely due to the calming effect of lavender. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that, from an anatomical point of view, the olfactory nerve is connected to the medial prefrontal cortex a brain region that '“controls” the way we trust others,' she said. Scientific research commissioned by RealPlayer Cloud and conducted with The University of Portsmouth revealed Brits believe we are more trustworthy, friendly and attractive in video than photos. Both sexes perceive people more positively in video, although women are far less positive about their own sex. Men are overtly more willing to see improvements in other men. Videos and photographs of volunteers were used to develop an interactive psychology-driven study of 2,000 UK consumers. Participants were tasked with judging men and women in video and images based on their appearance, trustworthiness, friendliness, and strength, as well as probed on their own online sharing habits. According to the data, men find other men more trustworthy than they do women in video than they do in photo. When women were asked the same question, they again found men more trustworthy than they found other women. To determine the effect of fragrances, the researchers enlisted 60 volunteers. In the research, they exposed one group of test persons to the aroma of lavender, a second group to the aroma of peppermint and a third control group had no aroma. Subsequently, the test persons played a trust game, to measure how much one test person trusts the other. A trustor was given five euros and was free to decide how much of that money he would give to a trustee in each round of the game. The trustor would then receive extra money, but only if the trustee gave him enough money in return. The money transferred to the trustee by the trustor served as an indicator of mutual trust. It was found that people gave significantly more money to the other person when they were exposed to the aroma of lavender than those exposed to peppermint or no aroma. ‘Our results might have various serious implications for a broad range of situations in which interpersonal trust is an essential element,’ said Dr Sellaro. ‘Smelling the aroma of lavender may help a seller to establish more easily a trusting negotiation to sell a car, or in a grocery store it may induce consumers to spend more money buying products. ‘The smell of lavender may also be helpful in sport psychology to enhance trust and build team spirit, for example in the case of team games such as soccer and volleyball.’ The researchers said the aroma of lavender may help a person establish an air of trust in negotiations, for example selling a car (stock image shown). The effect could be due to the calming effect of lavender, and the plant camille may apparently work the same way .","Researchers at Leiden University in the Netherlands say lavender can make you seem more trustworthy .

"Rating: . We're sitting in the gorgeous art deco-style America bar of the newly opened Beaumont hotel when John Cleese and what appears to be his daughter come through the swing doors. 'That's his wife, not his daughter,' says my wife. Then Stephen Fry arrives. No one bothers Cleese or Fry. No ghastly here-I-am-with-a-celeb selfies. Her Maj Angelina could walk in without causing a stir. It's not that sort of place. The Beaumont: Once upon a time it was a car park - but now it is a very glamourous hideaway . What we have is gilt-edged glamour, superb service, outrageously comfortable beds, terrific food, wines that start at less than £20 a bottle - and a doorman called Darvin who represented St Lucia in the high jump at the London Olympics. 'I didn't make it to the final, though,' he says, after kindly pointing out a single yellow line where we can park. The Beaumont used to be a car park. Then along came Chris Corbin and Jeremy King (The Wolsey, The Delaunay et al), and now it's a 75-room hotel and probably the hottest ticket in town. The genius of The Beaumont is that you feel it's been here for ever. The art of the matter: The hotel's most expensive suite is the Antony Gormley-designed 'Room' It's grand but not stuffy, with a distinctly Twenties Anglo-American vibe. No one can walk in here and not feel better about themselves. Indeed, about life in general. We are booked into a classic room, which is the cheapest, but still expensive - £395 with continental breakfast. It exudes quality, albeit of a masculine variety. Marble and chrome bathroom, fabulous lighting with proper switches, mirrors and black and white photographs from the Twenties and Thirties. One thing is missing, especially at these prices. A bath. But everything else soon assuages this grievance. The restaurant is called The Colony. It features a New York hot dog (£9.50), a chicken pot pie (£15.50) and a veal chop for a whopping £38. We order judiciously and manage to keep the bill to just over £100, a bottle of wine included. 'I could do with three nights here,' says my wife. Pull up a seat: The restaurant at The Beaumont does comfort food such as chicken pot pie and hot dogs . Me, too, ideally in a room called Room, which is the suite created by artist Antony Gormley. That will be £2,250 a night to you, Sir. The frill-free, but impeccable, attention to detail continues at breakfast. My croissant is the puffiest and loveliest ever, the jam sublime. A young man at a nearby table looks as if he's being interviewed for some job or other. He'll get it for sure, because The Beaumont says 'yes'. The Beaumont . Brown Hart Gardens . London .

"Thousands of troops stationed overseas could be sent home to help police cope with a Paris copycat attack amid fears they are not prepared for a large-scale bloodbath. Ministers are examining plans to have ‘high-readiness’ battalions stationed across the country to respond to a terror attack within minutes. The infantry units would provide back-up support to armed police and would be especially vital if there is more than one attack at any given time. Scroll down for video . Prepared: French soldiers in Paris yesterday. Ministers are considering the possibility of bringing home British troops to be stationed across the country in readiness in case there are any copycat attacks . Currently there are hundreds of troops on standby for an onslaught by Islamic State fanatics. But there are concerns there are not enough armed police outside London, especially in villages. If there was to be an attack outside the capital, it could be more than half an hour before the police have back-up from the Army. As a result, it is understood various government departments are now looking at having more soldiers stationed in places such as Birmingham, Manchester and Scotland. A senior Whitehall source told the Mail: ‘The country has a force of more than 80,000 troops and they need to be deployed where the threat is. Homeland security needs to be stepped up and as part of that we are looking at where there are gaps. We are looking at bringing back soldiers from overseas.’ The Ministry of Defence last night denied that troops are to be brought home, but senior Whitehall sources insisted the plans were under discussion. Details are not yet clear but it is understood thousands of soldiers could be re-deployed across the UK from overseas. The Army is stationed in more than 80 countries. There are thousands of troops in Germany – a legacy from the Second World War – as well as hundreds in Cyprus and hundreds in the Falklands. Worldwide: British troops are stationed in more than 80 countries, including Cyprus (pictured) David Cameron consulted senior intelligence and security officials on Monday over Britain’s response to the carnage. It is understood he has put the SAS on standby to head off the ‘fanatical death cult of Islamist extremist violence’. The elite soldiers will take part in training exercises in which firearms police will re-create the horror witnessed in France last week. In the plans being looked at by ministers, regular soldiers could also be trained in how to deal with acts of terror in the UK in the event of a similar attack. They would provide the back-up to armed patrols and would be prepared to hunt down the terrorists if a situation arose in which they managed to escape. A source added: ‘The government is recognising the threat could be on British soil. Currently our high-readiness troops are ready to be deployed overseas but we need to make sure we have enough soldiers in the UK. ‘We are looking at sending soldiers to cities such as Manchester, Newcastle, Birmingham or having many more troops stationed in Scotland.’ Massacre: Armed to the teeth, the Kouachi brothers begin their murderous assault in Paris last week . However, an MoD spokesman said: ‘There are no plans to redeploy troops from overseas to within the UK in support of domestic security measures.’ Yesterday Theresa May said paramedics and fire crews had been issued with bullet-proof vests and helmets in preparation for a Paris copycat atrocity. They have also been taught how to work in buildings, airports and railway stations that may be booby-trapped. These units, known as Fire Special Operations Teams and Ambulance Intervention Teams, were set up ahead of the Olympic Games, which were feared to be highly vulnerable to a terrorist attack. It has also emerged security is being offered to moderate Muslims speaking out about the Paris attacks and those working for magazines and newspapers that have circulated Charlie Hebdo images and may be at risk. Earlier this week France mobilised 10,000 troops to protect high-risk sites, such as Jewish schools. It is the first time troops have been deployed within France on such a scale.","Ministers examining plans to reduce military response time to minutes .

"Visitors looking to explore the dark side of Mexico's northern industrial city of Monterrey board a striking blue bus, painted with the faces of local politicians alongside pigs and rats clutching bags of money. The bus stops at 10 city landmarks while a recording plays, detailing how public money has been allegedly misspent and siphoned off at these places - the government palace, state congress and other public buildings. This is the 'Corruptour', set up by the Mexican anti-graft organisation Via Ciudadana in one of Latin America's most affluent cities to expose the abuse of power and misuse of public funds that is rife in Mexico and goes largely unpunished. Scroll down for video . The tour offered by the anti-graft organisation Via Ciudadana is free of charge for visitors to Monterrey . The blue bus is painted with the faces of local politicians alongside pigs and rats clutching bags of money . The group hopes the tour will mobilise Mexicans to hold elected to account and take action against graft. 'The bus tour aims to fight indifference and wake people up and show them... with clear examples the impact corruption has,' said Miguel Trevino, a Via Ciudadana leader and Corruptour organiser. The tallest in Monterrey, that was constructed using public money . 'When you ask people what their top concerns are, they'll answer violence, unemployment and the state of the economy, instead of corruption. But we believe corruption is a national problem, the root cause of our problems and one that is linked to violence.' The free one-hour-long tour, which kicked off just weeks ago, is already a sellout, attracting mostly Mexicans living in and around Monterrey, as well as tourists and local media from across the country, he said. The tour stops at rows of box-like miniscule homes built for poor families without proper urban planning and services, which have since been abandoned. It also swings by the infamous Casino Royale, where 52 people died in a 2011 arson attack that police blamed on drug traffickers. Trevino described the casino as a 'monument to corruption', where people died because exit doors were not working. He called the subsequent investigation flawed. Mexico ranks 106 out of 177 countries in Transparency International's 2013 index based on perceived levels of public corruption, with number one being the least corrupt. Since taking power in 2012, Mexico's President Pena Nieto has sent a raft of legislation to combat graft to Congress, including a bill that would create an authority to investigate political corruption. Via Ciudadana backs constitutional reforms that would allow independent candidates to run for office as a way to clean up traditional politics. The group hopes the tour will mobilise Mexicans to hold elected to account and take action against graft . Here you can see how the group have likened the politicians in Mexico to animals, pillaging money . Ahead of midterm elections in 2015 - when Mexico is due to vote in its lower house, nine state governors and hundreds of local mayors - the group also hopes to spur voter disenchantment with dishonest politicians. During the Corruptour, dirty local politicians are named and shamed, cited by their full names. 'The punishment a citizen can give them in political terms is not to vote for them again,' Trevino said.","Bus painted with the faces of local politicians alongside pigs and rats .

"A notorious police killer has received more than £250,000 in legal aid, helping him to launch a string of ‘absurd’ human rights cases from jail. David Bieber, 48, used part of the taxpayer-funded sum to sue the prison service on four occasions – even claiming that he should be moved to a more comfortable cell. Last night the legal cost racked up by the killer was criticised as ‘ludicrous’ by the widow of PC Ian Broadhurst, the officer he shot at point blank range on Boxing Day in 2003. Speaking from her home in Lanarkshire, she said: ‘It is absolutely disgraceful that someone like him is allowed that amount of public money. David Bieber (pictured left) shot PC Ian Broadhurst (right) dead at point blank range on Boxing Day, 2003 . ‘I genuinely don’t understand why after 11 years this is still going on. I am disgusted.’ Bieber, a former US Marine, racked up a £277,600 bill at the taxpayer’s expense, according to figures released by the Ministry of Justice. But officials say the total amount claimed by Bieber may increase even further as he is involved in on-going legal proceedings. Figures, revealed following a freedom of information request, show the majority of Bieber’s legal aid – £236,620 – was spent on his crown court trial. The rest, more than £40,000, was spent on civil claims about his prison conditions. He acquired some £23,782 in aid for pre-court legal work, while a High Court application for a judicial review cost £16,775.04 of public money. Another case that reached court used £420 in legal aid. The size of the bill will once again raise questions about the ease with which dangerous criminals can access public funds, despite government reforms to cut the bloated legal aid budget. Bieber was given a ‘whole life’ sentence – later cut to 37 years – in 2004 following the murder of PC Broadhurst, 34, who was shot in the chest and head after stopping the killer’s vehicle in Leeds. The steroid-addicted bodybuilder and drug dealer, who was wanted in the US for conspiracy to murder and had fled to the UK under an alias, has been branded one of the most dangerous criminals in the country after trying to escape from prison at least four times. Bieber attempted to have his security category downgraded so he could be moved to a better cell at Frankland Prison (pictured) in County Durham . Traffic policeman Ian Broadhurst, pictured left with his wife Eilisa on their honeymoon in Mexico, September 2001, was killed outside a betting shop in Leeds while on duty . But he demanded to have his ‘exceptional risk’ security category downgraded so he could be moved to a better cell at high-security Frankland Prison in County Durham. He claimed his human rights were infringed. Mr Justice Mostyn, speaking during Bieber’s High Court hearing last year, described his crimes as ‘bestial’ and said his claim was ‘untenable’ and ‘absurd’. ‘Bieber has made numerous applications to the High Court about the conditions in which he is being held,’ he said. ‘All the claims have been funded by legal aid. ‘It is perhaps noteworthy that I have sat in this court, where I usually sit, with litigants in person before me – people who are desperate to see their children – from whom the Government has withdrawn all legal aid.’ Bieber’s legal team yesterday disputed claims that he funded all of his claims with public money as ‘factually wrong’, claiming he paid for one hearing himself. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said: ‘It is cases just like this – where a convicted killer has used taxpayers’ money on speculative court cases to try and challenge their prison status – that made me determined to make big changes to the system. ‘We have now changed the rules to ensure legal aid resources are only available when really necessary.’ Police forensic officers search the scene in Leeds where Ian Broadhurst was gunned down in December 2003 .

"A large fire tore through a nearly 140-year-old prison on Wednesday, forcing the evacuation of more than 200 inmates. There were no reported inmate or staff injuries. The prison in Northumberland County, Pennsylvania, appeared to have been totally destroyed, county officials said. Flames shoot through the roof of the Northumberland County Prison on Wednesday. Dispatchers say the blaze was reported just after 2 p.m. at the nearly 140-year-old jail . The prison sits in the middle of Sunbury, Pennsylvania, in close proximity to homes and businesses, and just two blocks from the Susquehanna River . The cause of the fire was not immediately known. The blaze was reported Wednesday afternoon at the prison in Sunbury, a city of 10,000 residents about 40 miles north of Harrisburg, the state capital. Intense flames and thick smoke shot through the roof. The prison, a stone building with castle-like parapets, was built in the late-1800s and sits a few blocks off the banks of the Susquehanna River in close proximity to homes and businesses. All 208 inmates were initially taken under heavy guard to a nearby church. Commissioner Stephen Bridy said that all inmates were accounted for. Warden Bruce Kovach confirmed that there had been no injuries. The blaze was intense and several sections of roof were seen to collapse as flames leaped higher, and thick smoke hung over the city of 10,000 people 40 miles north of Harrisburg (AP Photo/The Daily Item, Justin Engle) Police vehicles were stationed about one block from the scene of the fire at the prison  as 208 prisoners were evacuated to a local church under heavy guard (AP Photo/The News-Item, Larry Deklinski) County Commissioner Chairman Vinny Clausi said the building appeared to be a 'total loss'. Sunbury Fire Chief Ken Kipple said in a press conference once the fire had been brought under control, that it was challenging  to tackle having to work around law enforcement and evacuations from the secure facility. County officials said the male and female inmates were being moved to separate state prisons nearby, and a neighboring county agreed to house new inmates brought in following the fire. Female inmates have been moved to SCI Muncy in Lycoming County, a state facility that typically houses medium to maximum-security female prisoners, WNEP 16 reported. The male inmates have been moved south to the state facility in Coal Township. Officials are not giving too many details away about the prison transfers as securely moving inmates from one location to another creates a delicate situation.

"Emily Cooper had only just called an ambulance for her pregnant sister who had begun having contractions when a shout from the other room. The baby was already coming into the world - and fast. The whirlwind of emotions that the 24-year-old went through as she then proceeded to deliver her sister's baby on the bathroom floor of her Toowoomba home in Queensland – from panic, to sheer joy and relief – can be clearly heard throughout the 10 minute recording of her phone conversation with an emergency medical dispatch officer. 'I didn't know what to do or think – it was just crazy and so astonishing to see this baby coming out,' the mother-of-three told Daily Mail Australia. Scroll down for audio . Summer Rose Chilly (pictured) was born on Sunday afternoon in her aunt's bathroom after her mother unexpectedly went into labour . Emily Cooper  delivered her sister Liza's daughter with the help of an emergency medical dispatch officer's step by step instructions over the phone . 'She [Ms Cooper's sister, Liza Chilly] was freaking out and in a lot of pain, but there's nothing much you can do. She was overwhelmed with excitement and there were so many emotions going at once. 'The whole time I was just looking at her in disbelief and we were smiling and laughing and crying at each other – it was an amazing experience.' Ms Cooper and her sister, who has two other young children, had been expecting to have a quiet afternoon together on Sunday when a stroll to the bathroom quickly led Liza to realise she was actually in labour. Mum and bub: Summer's birth went smoothly, with paramedics arriving at the scene afterward to assist with the final stages of the birth . At the start of her telephone call to the ambulance, Ms Cooper can be heard telling the medical officer: 'My sister, she's pregnant and she's a week overdue, so she's having some contractions one minute apart now.' Within the first minute of conversation, Ms Cooper was asked if she can see any part of the baby, to which she confidently replied 'no'. Less than 20 seconds later, a loud scream is heard in the background and her sister is heard yelling: 'She's coming!'. 'Yep, she's in labour now and the baby's pushing out right now!' Ms Cooper is heard laughing. 'I see a big…oh, her head!' she added in worried tone. The officer can then be heard instructing her caller how to safely deliver her niece on the bathroom floor. 'With each contraction place the palm of your hand and apply firm but gentle pressure to the baby's head, to prevent it from delivering too fast and tearing her,' she said. 'As the baby delivers, support the baby's head and shoulders and hold its hips and legs firmly. Now remember the baby will be slippery so don't drop it.' Meanwhile Ms Cooper, who is clearly in shock, reports that by two minutes into their conversation the baby's head and arms could be seen, followed by her body and legs less than 45 seconds later. 'The whole time I was just looking at Liza in disbelief and we were smiling and laughing and crying at each other – it was an amazing experience,' Ms Cooper said . Just before the three minute mark, Ms Coopers panicked voice announced: 'She's moving she's moving, she's crying now.' Thirty seconds later, the simultaneous sound of the crying newborn, named Summer Rose Chilly, and a woman can be heard before the officer eventually admits 'the baby certainly does have a very healthy set of lungs – that's terrific'. Paramedics arrived shortly afterwards to assist them with the final stages of the birth and allowed Ms Cooper to cut Summer's umbilical cord. But it was Christine Phillips, the emergency medical dispatcher who provided step-by-step instructions during the birth, whom Ms Cooper believes saved the day. 'We spoke to her at the hospital – she came up with flowers and congratulated us. I wouldn't have been able to do it without her,' she said.

A video showed police officers kicking and Lopez-Soto after he was shot with a stun gun in Beardsley Park in 2011 following a car chase. Morales and Lawlor pleaded guilty in June to depriving Lopez-Soto of his civil rights. Both agreed to resign from the police department. Lopez-Soto is serving five years in prison after pleading guilty to drug and gun charges in 2012. Prosecutors said Morales used his stun gun a second time after Lopez-Soto was effectively incapacitated and Lawlor kicked him several times.

The city recently settled the case by agreeing to pay $198,000 to Lopez-Soto. The victim said in his lawsuit that he was motionless on the ground and not resisting when the officers kicked and stomped him. He said he suffered pain, a bad cut to his lip that left a scar, body and face bruises and a fracture to his hand. Lawlor wrote in a police report that Lopez-Soto struggled with officers after falling to the ground when Morales zapped him with a stun gun. Lawlor said Lopez-Soto was wearing a gun holster on his belt, and officers later found a loaded handgun and drugs in Lopez-Soto’s van.

"A mysterious new polio-like illness has infected more than 100 children in the U.S. in the last five months, and only one has made a full recovery, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports. The CDC reports that the strange illness is now being called Acute Flaccid Myelitis. The illness, which has infected 103 children across 34 states, affects the spinal cord, resulting in a sudden onset of weakness in one or more arms or legs. Illness: A mysterious new polio-like illness, Acute Flaccid Myelitis, has infected more than 100 children in the U.S. in the last five months, and only one has made a full recovery (stock image) According to the  The Transverse Myelitis Association, there have been various incidents of partial paralysis, weakness in limbs, and total paralysis among the cases. Dr. Teri Schreiner from Children’s Hospital Colorado told TMA that many patients have noted facial weakness as well, weakening muscles used to move the eyes, to swallow, and to speak. The illness infects children around the age of seven and while about two thirds of the children who have been observed for the illness have shown improvement, one third have shown no improvement. And, the CDC reports, only one child has fully recovered. Almost all of the children infected were hospitalized, and some were put on breathing machines. Outbreak: Officials are investigating whether the illness is related to the 2014 outbreak of Enterovirus-D68 (stock image) 'Unfortunately, none of the treatments that we use commonly for acute myelitis have shown much effect with Acute Flaccid Myelitis,' Schreiner said. Keith Van Haren, a child neurologist at Stanford University School of Medicine, told The Atlantic that doctors don't know how to treat or prevent the illness. 'It actually looks just like polio, but that term really freaks out the public-health people,' he said. Although officials do not know the specific cause of the illness, the CDC reports that the polio-like illness is most similar to illnesses caused by enteroviruses, West Nile virus, herpesvirus, and the adenovirus. Recommendations: The CDC is working to pinpoint the cause of the illness, meanwhile, officials recommend frequent handwashing, avoiding close contact with sick people, and disinfecting frequently (stock image) Officials are investigating whether the illness is related to the  2014 outbreak of Enterovirus-D68. The Atlantic reports that neurologists say  the illness may be an effect of the enterovirus outbreak, but the link has yet to be proven. Additionally, enteroviruses rarely cause myelitis, the CDC reports, they usually cause mild illness or a form of meningitis.

"Family Feud host Grant Denyer caused an uproar during Tuesday night's episode of the game show when he posed a controversial question about cyclists. As the question 'What is something annoying that cyclists might do?' flashed up on the screen, the cycling community went into meltdown on social media, deeming it 'disgusting' and swearing off the show forever. The premise of the show is to pick the most common answers as decided by a survey, as two families battle it out for the most points. Scroll down for video . Game show Family Feud sent social media into a frenzy on Tuesday night when it asked the question 'What is something  annoying that cyclists might do?' The most popular answer was 'Taking driving lane' as guessed by one of the contestants, followed by 'Cut you off' and the very unpopular 'Everything'. 'Run red light', 'Pull out in front', 'Ride slowly' and 'Ring bell' also made it into the top  answers much to the dismay of cyclists on social media. 'Wear lycra' was the last answer to round out the top eight - a hot topic in the media in recent weeks after a pub banned men wearing lycra from entering their premises. Social media was alight with heated discussion following the airing of the Family Feud episode, with Tim Bates writing on Facebook that he wasn't normally a viewer but now will actively avoid the show. The top answer was 'Taking the driving lane' with 'Wearing lycra' also appearing on the list . Facebook users were very unimpressed with the question, taking to the Family Feud  page to complain . Safe Cycling Australia tweeted that the Channel Ten program was 'bloody pathetic' 'Don't normally watch this show, but turned on to hear ""something annoying cyclists do"",' he wrote. As someone who was recently physically assaulted for nothing more than riding a bike, I'd like to know why Family Feud and Channel 10 are encouraging that sort of stupidity towards cyclists.... The fact the answer ""everything"" was even allowed as an answer is disgusting!' Mr Bates continued. Meantime Rachel Lee said the family game show had just lost a long-term fan. 'So disgusted by the cyclist question - im not watching anymore and i really liked the show.' Trent posted that the move was 'absolutely disgusting' and asked who approved the segment . Sue Chapple pointed out that many children ride bicycles too . 'A purportedly family friendly TV show promoting hate and ill-will towards vulnerable road users. Absolutely disgraceful', Lauren Michelle wrote, demanding a 'formal written and on-air apology'. Twitter was equally unimpressed with the show's question, with @AusCycle tweeting about the episode.

"Reality TV star and multi-millionaire Lord Sugar has laid a complaint with police after he was trolled on Twitter with anti-Semitic messages. As he posted a series of tweets about the Tottenham Hotspur versus Crystal Palace Premier League game on Saturday, he was subjected to a barrage of abuse. Among other insults, several of the messages referred to the outspoken television personality as an 'old Jewish c***' and a 'fat ***'. Scroll down for video . Lord Sugar (pictured), the star of the BBC television show The Apprentice, was subjected to a barrage of . Despite retweeting the messages and making it clear he would be reporting them to police, the barrage of abuse continued. In one instance, after tweeting that the referee had made a bad decision to award a penalty, a Twitter user responded: 'F*** off *** c***. He promptly retweeted the message to his 3.9million followers, as well as to the Met Police Twitter feed, saying it was 'another one to follow up on'. Lord Sugar, 67, has now officially reported the incident to the police, who have confirmed they are investigating. A spokesman for Westminster police said: “Police at the palace of Westminster have today received an allegation of malicious communication, relating to offensive messages on Twitter. 'The messages are alleged to be of a racist and anti-Semitic nature and directed at a male victim. Inquiries continue.' The incident is not the first time Lord Sugar has become embroiled in a controversial Twitter spat. Just over a week ago, the reality TV star and multi-million pound business tycoon became embroiled in a row on the social network after calling a plus-size model 'fatty'. The row unfolded after she sent him a cheeky message on January 4, which said: 'Evening sugar ;-) can I call you that? Lol.' In the first abusive message Lord Sugar retweeted, he responded by  asking the Met Police to investigate . The second message, in which he was called a 'fat jew', was treated in a similar manner . However, one person expressed their shock at seeing the messages and offered some support to the businessman. He replied to the user, confirming he would be laying a complaint with police . He replied: 'yes no problem as long as I can call you fatty,' - which sparked outrage from some her 2,800 followers who branded him 'a bully', 'arrogant' and a 'miserable old goat'. Miss Raouna, who won Miss British Beauty Curve in 2013, was 'absolutely fuming' at his 'cruel' tweet and said she had only sent him a message to get his attention because she was a 'massive fan' of BBC's The Apprentice. Lord Sugar - who has an estimated wealth of £900m, made his fortune in the electronics company Amstrad. He later went on to part-own and act as chairman for Tottenham Hotspur until 2001, when he sold his remaining stake. In recent years he is best known for his role as the star of The Apprentice, a role he has remained in since 2005.","Apprentice star Lord Sugar was subjected to a barrage of abuse on Twitter .

"A suitcase that can charge your mobile phone as well as let the user know it has made it onto the flight with them could soon be on the market. Delsey's new innovation, called Pluggage, was showcased at the CES Innovation awards this month in the US, and the company are now asking the general public what key features they want to see included on the final design. The company's website has set up a section for people to vote on their favourite features, but not all are expected to be included on the end product. Scroll down for video . The company is now asking the general public to vote on what features they want Pluggage to have . These are the options that are up for vote, all of which bring even more use to the suitcase . Some of the more interesting features up for discussion are the auto-weight feature, on-board detection, and the instant battery reload. Many of us have been caught out once at the airport having squeezed in some last-minute items, and thus taking us over the weight limit. By synching the case to the associated smartphone app, the user can be told the exact weight of the luggage. In an ideal world you'd want all these features, but as the old saying goes, don't run before you can walk . As we say our goodbyes to our suitcases, that are destined to for the hold, nightmares of lost luggage at the other end will be extinguished as, again by synching with the app, a notification is sent that the case has made it onto the plane. And the ability to charge your phone via the suitcase is sure to be a popular selection of voters - when you're delayed in the airport or for a transfer, having some form of communication is vital. Other options that are being discussed are an inside lighting system that switches on when the suitcase is opened, flight info on the app that can show the latest news once you've entered your flight details and fingerprint ID which acts as an extra layer of protection when launching the app or opening Pluggage. This may not go down too well with your fellow passengers, but one option is the extendable speaker . A check lock facility that can tell the user if the suitcase has been opened by someone else, an app weather forecast that can tell you the kind of weather to expect at your destination and an inside speaker that pulls out from the case to play your music are some of the other options being looked at.

"Trying to spread cold, hard butter onto soft bread can be a frustrating task. But now there’s a dish that solves the problem by heating up to keep the butter at the optimum consistency for spreading and also cools it in the summer. It plugs into the mains and can be left turned on so that the butter is ready to use at any time. Scroll down for video . Butterly brilliant: David Alfille, 54, has invented a butter dish (pictured) that heats up to keep the butter at the optimum consistency for spreading and also cools it in the summer . David Alfille, 54, came up with the idea after getting frustrated when he couldn't butter his bread on cold mornings without tearing the slice because it hadn't softened enough. His dish, which is six inches (15cm) wide, five inches (13cm) long and four inches (10cm) tall, plugs into the mains and has a dial on the bottom so people can adapt the temperature to suit their needs, warming the spread to between 15 and 23°C. It also has a small fan in the base of the dish, which works like an air conditioner for the spread in hot temperatures, while the butter tray can be removed and cleaned in a dishwasher. The dish has a small fan in its base (shown) which works like an air conditioner for the spread in hot temperatures, while the butter tray can be removed and cleaned in a dishwasher . Warming: The dish heats butter to between 15 and 23°C to keep butter soft enough to be spread onto bread without tearing it. Cooling: A small fan, concealed in the base of the dish, acts like an air conditioning unit to keep the spread cool in the summer - but not as chilled as in a fridge. Power: The dish has a plug to use mains electricity and is designed to be left constantly turned on. Size: The dish is six inches (15cm) wide, five inches (13cm) long and four inches (10cm) tall. Price: £34.99 and £39.99 for a stainless steel version. Mr Alfille, from Ticehurst in East Sussex worked with a design company in Wales to make his idea a reality. It is manufactured in China and the process took two years. ‘It's similar to a mini-fridge but it will heat and cool, he said. ‘With modern technology there's a little plate called a thermo-electric cooler - one side of it gets hot and the other gets cold. ‘What we have done is changed the polarity round so sometimes it heats and sometimes it cools. ‘Generally you would keep the butter at about 18.5°C, or 19.5°C for unsalted butter. But the dish means in winter you can heat it up and in summer you can keep it cooler so it doesn't spread too thinly.’ He explained that he thought of the idea when he couldn’t spread his butter one day. ‘It was really frustrating me and I don't like spreadables, I like real butter and a lot of people do. Mr Alfille, from Ticehurst in East Sussex worked with a design company in Wales to make his idea a reality, which was manufactured in China. The process took two years. The dish (pictured) is designed to be constantly plugged in to the mains so that butter is kept at the perfect temperature all the time . ‘There's a big trend back towards butter, I think something like 70 per cent of the UK still use butter and that has grown four per cent over the last few years.’ Mr Alfille did lots of research and conducted focus groups to get the design right. ‘People don't realise how much technology goes into it. The biggest thing was trying to get all the electronics into something small enough, because we didn't want something massive and unsightly,’ he explained. ‘We wanted something small and pretty that could sit beside your kettle and toaster and look part of the kitchen.’ The dish is available from Mr Alfille’s website  and costs £34.99, with a stainless steel version priced at £39.99. A stainless steel gadget called ButterUp has been invented that looks like a normal knife, but has 21 triangular holes down the blade to 'grate' butter. The tiny strips of butter that are created are easier to spread than a knife loaded with a block of spread, so people can avoid tearing holes in their sandwiches.

ButterUp, is the brainchild of friends Sacha Pantschenko, 29, Norman Oliveria, 27, and Craig Andrews, 48. Mr Pantschenko, from Sydney, Australia, explained: 'This is a time saving gadget because you don't have to wait for the butter to reach room temperate before you use it and stops you from tearing up the bread.' The knife is expected to retail at between £6 to £8 ($10 to $13.30).","54-year-old from Ticehurst in East Sussex created the butter dish .

(Times shown in Paris local) In total 19 people were trapped inside the east Paris store for several hours on Friday last week as armed police surrounded it. Three people were shot instantly, while two groups fled to the basement where they hid in cold storage units in temperatures as low as -3C. One man, known only as Ilan, was pictured wrapping his young son in a coat as they cowered in the basement, fearing for their lives. Meanwhile, upstairs, Coulibaly was explaining to the remaining hostages that he had come from Islamic State and had coordianted his attack with Said and Cheif Kouachi. The brothers had attacked the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo two days previously, and were at that moment also surrounded by armed police in a print works outside the city. After murdering Mr Cohen, Coulibaly ordered some of the other hostages to come up from the freezers, which they did, before ordering one man, named as Mickael B, to call a TV station. Coulibaly  BFM TV, justifying his actions and admitting he had killed a policewoman shot while on duty during a traffic stop on Thursday. Secretly, Mickael then also called police. ‘A policeman told me that we should be ready to throw ourselves flat on the ground when the assault came, which would be soon,’ he said. ‘It was obvious that the terrorist was preparing to die. He said it was his reward. He had a weapon in each hand and boxes of cartridges nearby. He suddenly began to pray.’ It was at this point that the siege came to a dramatic conclusion as the gunman charged at officers as they prepared to detonate explosives at the front of the store. A group of hostages, under instructions from Coulibaly, work together to disable one of the security cameras . The group had to shift several storage bags and use a ladder in order to reach the camera .

Coulibaly was then cut down in a hail of 40 bullets fired by officers who had been on duty for more than 50 hours by that point. The hostages were then freed and were pictured running from the shop, the look of horror clear to see on the face of one man as he sprinted from the scene clutching his young son. Just minutes before officers had also stormed into the print works where the Kouachis were making their last stand, ending one of the bloodiest weeks in recent memory in France. In the immediate aftermath of the attacks solidarity marches were organised in major cities around the country and the globe, with thousands waving banners reading Je suis Charlie - I am Charlie - in sympathy with the journalists that died. Amedy Coulibaly, pictured here in a 'suicide video' taken before the attack, was killed by 40 police bullets as he charged at armed officers as they prepared to set off explosives by the entrance .

"Donna and Troy Harvey watched in horror last months as four cows they had 'raised since they were poddy calves' were killed by a lightning bolt during a severe thunderstorm. The cows were taking shelter under a large tree as the property - in Milbong in southern Queensland - was lashed with wild winds and severe rainfall during the storm. When an enourmous bolt of lightning hit the tree Sulky, Freiser, Arthie and Blackie were killed instantly, despite the tree remaining intact. Scroll down for video .

Focusing on four of her cows taking shelter under a tree, Mrs Harvey holds the shot on her cattle before a huge lightning bolt splits the sky in half illuminating the dark stormy surrounds. The 36-year-old can be screaming out in horror at the realisation she had just lost four cows she and husband Tony had care for since they were very young. Freiser, Arthie and Blackie were also killed instantly by the devastating lightning strike . Tony (left) and Donna (right) here with their daughter Georgia were left heartbroken by the tragic event . The Harvey family had raised the cattle (left) since they were poddy calves . 'It was heart breaking, the moment I saw them all hit the ground... I knew they were dead,' Donna told Daily Mail Australia. 'I balled my eyes out... (It's) very hard when you have put in all the hard work, feeding them twice a day rain hail or shine,' she continued. 'Especially when you have raised them up from babies.' Despite the severe bolt that killed the four cows - Sulky, Freiser, Arthie and Blackie - the tree 'is fine' and still standing weeks after the storm. Donna said she and husband Tony fed and cared for the cows 'rain hail or shine' The storm was so severe it plunged the Milbong property into near total darkness at 1pm in the afternoon . A new addition in the form of a little cow named Boofa has helped the family with the grieving process . The farming family had raised the cattle for almost two years, making it through one of the driest and most difficult spring seasons Donna had seen in 13 years on the property. 'You have to be careful what you wish for, Because I was just saying to my husband days earlier that I wanted to capture a photo of a lightning strike. I certainly did,' she said. The four beef cows are sorely missed in the Harvey household, but a new addition in the form of a little cow named Boofa has helped them with the grieving process. Mrs Harvey said they bought it for their son Ryan to help 'mend a broken heart' and he is smitten with his new friend.","Donna Harvey lost four cows after they were struck by lightning .

"Peter Briggs, 35, admitted assault after grabbing a 14-year-old boy who laughed when he told him off for burping . A surveyor was hauled before the courts after grabbing a teenager who laughed when he told him off for burping. Peter Briggs, 35, seized the 14-year-old by the head outside a railway station cafe after the schoolboy started giggling at his ticking off. The terrified teenager's head banged on a metal post during the 'unprovoked' attack causing a cut which later required gluing. Yesterday magistrates ordered Briggs to do 100 hours of community service. He was also told to pay £200 in compensation to the boy and £145 in costs after admitting assault causing actual bodily harm. His lawyer told the court that he had not been thinking clearly and was shocked and remorseful. The boy and a friend had been sitting outside a cafe at Llandudno Junction Railway Station in Conwy, Wales, when they came to the attention of Briggs, who was sitting at a neighbouring table. James Neary, prosecuting, told Llandudno Magistrates Court that the teenager was burping and prompted Briggs to comment 'that's disgusting.' The commercial surveyor lost his temper when the pair started laughing at his rebuke. The teenager was upset after the attack and raced inside a cafe and Briggs was only stopped from following when a female commuter intervened and blocked his path. Briggs left the scene and police and an ambulance were called to take the boy to a nearby hospital. The teenager, who had been waiting to catch a train to a skate park, sustained a one centimetre cut within his hair in the assault, which was captured on the railway station’s CCTV cameras. Mr Neary told the court that Briggs left because he was ‘embarrassed’. ‘He started to think about what he had done and decided to leave because he was embarrassed,’ the prosecutor said. Briggs was later arrested and he quickly apologised, saying that he was shocked at his own behaviour. Briggs later told police he had been to visit his ill-father and was not thinking straight when the incident took place in July last year. 'At the railway station he was deep in thought and heard the child burp. When he told the boy what he did was disgusting, the child just laughed at him and he got angry,' Mr Neary said. Briggs of Altrincham, Cheshire, was shocked at what he had done and was sorry. 'It's an overreaction by the defendant,' the prosecutor said. The incident happened outside a cafe at Llandudno Junction Railway Station in Conwy, Wales . He admitted the charge of assault causing actual bodily harm when he appeared before Llandudno Magistrates Court. Alex Fitzgerald, defending, said the injury was caused 'recklessly' when Briggs lost his temper and grabbed the boy by the head, intending simply to shake him. But in the heat of the moment, he banged the boy’s head against a metal post, causing a cut. 'There's a huge degree of remorse. He insisted that Briggs, who has a degree in real estate from Sheffield Hallam University, meant to shake the boy, rather than injure him. He did not realise he was injured when he initially left the scene, he added. ‘He’s reacted in a way which for him is completely out of character. There’s a huge degree of remorse,’ Mr Fitzgerald said. Mr Neary said his behaviour was an ‘over-reaction’ and that 14-year-olds were ‘vulnerable’ in public places.

"Jessica Davies, pictured arriving at the tribunal in today with her husband Scott Davies, 34, (right) A police officer who starred in the TV series Motorway Cops was 'bullied and booted off her team' after she warned managers about a fault with the flashing lights on patrol cars, a tribunal has heard. Jessica Davies claims she was moved into an office role after she highlighted the computer glitch that meant the cars' blue lights switched off during high-speed chases. The 34-year-old, who began for the Central Motorway Police Group (CMPG) in July 2009, argued that it could put motorists and officers at risk when they are in pursuit of suspect vehicles. At the tribunal in Birmingham, the panel heard West Midlands Police put her at 'detriment as a result of whistleblowing'. She also claims she was bullied by her superiors and on one occasion was reduced to tears by a sergeant who made a remark about her pregnancy. PC Davies, who became a police officer in 2001, appeared on the BBC TV show under her maiden name Rojek, and showed her as she chased criminals in the West Midlands and Staffordshire. In March 2012 she was involved in a 120mph crash on the M42, which left her off work for two weeks, and she claims officers were not given the right guidance when pursuing suspect vehicles. She told the tribunal: 'I raised concerns that there was a known fault on the Staffordshire Police traffic vehicles. 'This fault means that the computer system resets itself and switches off the blue response lights. This obviously causes a danger to the public. 'I also highlighted that there was no Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) response policy on the unit and that this had been raised by two other officers 12 months earlier. The 34-year-old, who starred in BBC series Motorway Cops, claims she was bullied and kicked off her team . PC Davies (left) says she was moved into an office role after she highlighted the computer glitch that meant the police patrol cars' blue lights switched off during high-speed chases . She has told an employment tribunal that on one occasion was reduced to tears by a sergeant who made a remark about her having a miscarriage . 'I had no problem with ANPR per se, however I was concerned that there needed to be a proper response policy in place so that officers were not moving around at high speeds without cause or guidance. 'It was quite alien to myself that jobs were being put out over the air without any direction as to how I would respond to them bearing in mind I had completed 10 years services whereby I was a response officers where every job I went to was graded. She joined the Central Motorway Police Group in 2009 and was told in January 2014 she was being taken off the team 'due to lack of trust' 'And it really brought it home to me when I was involved in my own police accident in March 2012. 'Some of the officers had raised it formally, other officers it had been just general discussions on breaks. 'The two officers who raised it on more formal channels are no longer CMPG officers.' 'On January 1, 2014 I was contacted by Chief Superintendent Martin Evans who told me that I would no longer be working on the unit upon my return from maternity leave due to lack of trust and confidence and my concerns around ANPR management systems. 'I was shocked, angry and extremely upset, as if my entire world had just collapsed. I also felt and still feel extremely humiliated.' PC Davies, from Tyseley in Birmingham, also told how she was reduced to tears when a sergeant made an 'insensitive' comment to her after she suffered a miscarriage in October 2012. She said: 'I was asked by Police Sergeant Richard Gathergood to work in the control room. 'I pointed out to him that I hadn't even logged into the Oasis account [police incident logs] since my training and in fact I could not even remember how to use the system and would be of no use. 'He then quite insensitively said ""you were there when you were pregnant so you know how it works"". 'This was merely four weeks after my miscarriage and I found the comments to be extremely upsetting and I became increasingly distressed. 'To make matters worse he also commented that I need to be a team player and that he would be telling the control room staff that they couldn't have their annual leave because of me. She appeared on the BBC TV series under her maiden name, Rojek, and was involved in a 120mph crash on the M42, which left her off work for two weeks, during a high-speed chase . 'I broke down in tears in front of him as the emotions of the miscarriage came flooding back. To my dismay I was then accused of overreacting. 'I believe the decision to move me to the control room was made in response to the complaints I had made shortly before. 'To my mind it seemed to be another way to bully and victimise me and felt like a punishment as I had always made it clear I did not want to work in the control room.' The hearing, which is expected to last two weeks, continues.","Jessica Davies, 34, says she was moved to office role after raising concern .

"Two Waseca teenagers charged in a foiled explosives plot at a southern Minnesota school have pleaded guilty. Austin Walters and Colby Radke both pleaded guilty last week to felony possession of explosive material. They were accused of helping classmate John LaDue detonate small 'test bombs' around Waseca, resulting in property damage. All three boys were 17 when they were charged. John LaDue  (pictured being walked into Waseca County Courthouse in June 2014) was the instigator of the planned attack . LaDue is accused of plotting to kill his family and attack his school with firearms and homemade explosives, The Mankato Free Press reported. Police and prosecutors don't believe the two teens were aware of his plot to attack Waseca Junior/Senior High School with explosives and firearms. Waseca County Attorney Brenda Miller said she was pleased with the plea agreement. 'We tried to factor LaDue out of this case and treat them like any other young male who wanted to blow things up,' Miller said. She added: 'We feel LaDue took advantage of them. So, we wanted to treat them like anybody else.' The teens are on probation for 180 days and must perform community service and write letters of apology. Walters will also have to pay restitution for damaging an Oak Park slide and benches on the high school's softball field. Final sentencing will be on Februay 27. The plot was allegedly to attack Waseca Junior/Senior High School (pictured) with explosives and firearms .","Austin Walters and Colby Radke both pleaded guilty to felony possession of explosive material .

"The BBC is locked in a stand-off with MPs over its coverage of Europe. Furious MPs accused director-general Tony Hall of putting the BBC 'above accountability' by refusing to answer questions from the Commons European scrutiny committee about the corporation's alleged bias on the issue. Lord Hall was accused of 'hiding' behind historic rules that mean members of the House of Lords cannot be summoned to answer questions in the Commons. BBC director-general Tony Hall of putting the BBC 'above accountability' by refusing to answer questions from the Commons European scrutiny committee . David Cameron today urged Lord Hall to back down, saying that as a 'general rule' BBC executives should be willing to answer questions from MPs. 'The BBC needs to be, and is, publicly accountable,' he said. Tory MPs said the stand-off raised questions about whether peers should be allowed to run major public bodies. Conservative MP James Clappison said: 'It creates the impression that the BBC holds itself above accountability.' Fellow Tory Jacob Rees-Mogg said: 'It makes it difficult for peers to be put in charge of public bodies if they are going to hide behind their privileges to avoid questioning.' BBC chairman Rona Fairhead insisted Lord Hall could not answer questions about the corporation's coverage of Europe because it might threaten the BBC's independence in the run-up to the election. She insisted he was not using his privileges as a member of the Lords to stay away. Mrs Fairhead said that a number of BBC news executives had already appeared before the committee to answer questions on the issue. And she said she was also willing to discuss the broad issues around the BBC's coverage. David Cameron, arriving back at Number 10 after Prime Minister's Questions this afternoon, has urged the BBC chief to stay 'accountable' But she claimed Lord Hall's position as the BBC's 'editor-in-chief' meant it would be wrong for him to face questions on politically sensitive issues because it could cast doubt on the corporation's 'independence'. She told MPs: 'The director-general did not refuse to come because he is a peer. The question of independence is a very delicate one. 'There is a question of what is an appropriate level of scrutiny by parliament if the BBC is to remain independent.' Under Parliamentary rules, Commons committees can require almost anyone to appear before them to answer questions. Those who refuse risk being found in contempt of parliament, which is punishable by a jail term. Tony Blair, who was dragged to the Commons this week to answer questions about Northern Ireland, is one of a number of reluctant witnesses summoned in recent years. But peers enjoy an exemption from the rules and cannot be summoned. A decade ago, a major review by the former Cabinet Secretary Lord Wilson, reported a 'widespread perception' of 'certain forms of cultural and unintentional bias' in favour of the EU. Mrs Fairhead said a number of changes had been made since, including the appointment of a dedicated Europe editor. Richard Ayre, chairman of the BBC Trust's editorial standards committee, yesterday confirmed it receives numerous complaints about its European coverage - including eight separate cases over the last three years. But he said it had not upheld any complaints on the issue since at least 2007. Lord Hall's refusal to attend was raised with the Prime Minister yesterday. Tory MP Sir Roger Gale called for a review of the exemption for peers, saying: 'Lord Hall, is refusing to give evidence to another Select Committee on the grounds that he is a Member of Parliament. He is also a paid public servant. Is it not time that we reviewed the matter of parliamentary privilege?' Mr Cameron replied: 'The general rule should be that people involved in the senior management of the BBC who are summoned to appear in front of a Select Committee should come, because the BBC needs to be, and is, publicly accountable. I think Lord Hall does a very good job at the BBC, and I am sure he would give a good account of himself, but I will have a careful look at it.' A BBC spokesperson said: 'The Director General never has and never would use his membership of the House of Lords as a reason not to appear before a select committee. 'The BBC is editorially independent and accountable to the BBC Trust for our broad coverage of issues. 'The chairman of the BBC Trust will be appearing in front of the committee and we believe that this strikes the right balance between the BBC's independence and accountability to Parliament.'","Lord Hall was accused of 'hiding' behind historic Parliamentary rules .

"Part of the International Space Station was dramatically evacuated on Wednesday after an alarm warned of a possible leak of toxic ammonia. Crew members in the US section of the station were forced to take refuge in the Russian part of the ISS while the problem was being investigated. But later on Wednesday the crew were able to return to the US modules after it was revealed that the reading was a false alarm, letting the astronauts and cosmonauts return to life as normal. Scroll down for video . Members of expedition 42 (pictured) sample the air in the US segment after initially evacuating to the Russian side of the ISS, due to warnings of a possible ammonia leak . NASA officials are now saying that a sensor problem may have given a false impression of leaking coolant . This picture, taken in November 2014, shows the crew members of Expedition 42. Clockwise from the left: Anton Shkaplerov, Elena Serova, Commander Barry Wilmore, Alexander Samokutyaev, Alexander Samokutyaev and Samantha Cristoforetti . Part of the International Space Station (pictured) was dramatically evacuated Wednesday after a possible leak of 'harmful' ammonia in the US section, forcing astronauts to flee. However, Nasa said the leak was likely just a faulty sensor reading, and the crew were able to move back later on Wednesday . The Russian Space Agency, Roscosmos, had said a possible 'escape of hazardous substances from an air conditioning unit' was discharged into the station's atmosphere at around 8.45am GMT (3.45am EST) on Wednesday. Following an alarm, the six crew members aboard the ISS were told to don masks and take refuge in the Russian segment of the station. They then closed the hatch to the US segment to prevent leaking ammonia - which could be hazardous to the health of the astronauts - from contaminating the rest of the station. By Wednesday afternoon, the astronauts were back in the US part of the orbiting outpost. 'Hey everybody, thanks for your concern,' Italian astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti said via Twitter. 'We're all safe & doing well in the Russian segment.' Ammonia on the ISS is used to cool the station as part of the Active Thermal Control System. It is circulated in loops on the exterior of the ISS and moves through the large radiators on the exterior of the station, releasing heat from them into space. Although extremely useful as a coolant, ammonia is also poisonous to breathe - and thus a potential leak could be a serious health concern for astronauts on board. The 'unscheduled excitement,' as Nasa called it, occurred around 9am GMT (4am EST), well into the station crew's workday. As alarms blared, the astronauts followed emergency procedures in slapping on oxygen masks, taking cover in the Russian quarters, then sealing the hatches between the U.S. and Russian sides. At the same time, flight controllers at Nasa's Johnson Space Center in Houston turned off non-essential equipment. Within minutes, Mission Control gave an all-clear, but sent the astronauts scurrying back over to the Russian side again when there was more evidence of a possible leak of the coolant. The highly toxic liquid ammonia, flowing outside the space station, is used to cool electronics. Flight controllers originally feared it had gotten into the water system running inside. Now, it's believed that a failed card in a computer-relay box was the culprit. 'The American segment on the ISS is currently isolated. The crew is safe and located in the Russian segment,' Roscosmos said in a statement at the time of the discovery. An official added: 'The crew's safety was provided for thanks to the co-ordinated and quick actions of the cosmonauts and astronauts themselves, as well as operative control groups in Moscow and Houston.' The current crew on board the ISS had to take refuge in the Russian part of the station after a possible ammonia leak this morning. Pictured from left to right are Expedition 42 Commander Barry Wilmore of Nasa, Flight Engineer Samantha Cristoforetti of Esa and Flight Engineer Terry Virts, also of Nasa . The crew of the ISS are currently in the Russian modules of the ISS, shown here in red. The US parts of the station, shown in yellow, may have an ammonia leak, causing them to be evacuated - but this has not yet been confirmed. Note the Science Power Platform shown here is an addition to the ISS that was never launched . The entire crew of Expedition 42 are now seeking refuge while ground controllers at Nasa and elsewhere figure out the extent of the problem. Pictured from left to right in this promotional crew photo are Yelena Serova, Barry Wilmore, Alexander Samokutyaev, Anton Shkaplerov, Terry Virts and Samantha Cristoforetti . Construction of the ISS began on 20 November 1998. It supports a crew of up to six, with crews split into groups of three. The station orbits at a height of about 264 miles (425km). It has a total mass of about 990,000 pounds (450,000kg) and has living space roughly equivalent to a five-bedroom house. It completes an orbit of Earth every 92.91 minutes and moves at 17,100 miles (27,600km) per hour. It has now been in space for more than 5,800 days, during which time it has completed more than 92,000 orbits of Earth, and has been continuously occupied for more than 13 years. According to Russian Mission Control an unscheduled spacewalk may have been required to fix the leak - but this is not likely to be needed now. This would not have been the first time an ammonia leak has been fixed by a spacewalk, though. Back in 2013 two astronauts had to plug a leak outside the station. In the event that an evacuation had been needed, the crew would have been required to get into the two Soyuz spacecraft currently docked to the ISS and return to Earth. The chances of this being required, though, were extremely low. The latest emergency comes after recent hints from Russian officials that they could abandon the ISS in 2020 despite a US desire to see the station continue until 2028. Russia is thought to want to end its involvement in the ISS to begin construction of a new space station that it will use as a gateway to the moon and possibly other destinations. Pictured left is flight engineer Terry Virts, who was born in December 1967 in Maryland. He has previously had spaceflight experience on the space shuttle.

"It seems like hipsters are here to stay with the bearded, kale-munching, green juice-drinking members of society creating their own non-conforming offspring. As hipsters breed, it is only fitting that they choose ironic names, inspired by music, art, geographical locations and nature – or sometimes just random letters of the alphabet. When Gwyneth Paltrow announced to the world that her children were named ‘Apple’ and ‘Moses’ the names were considered abnormal. But the kindergarten classes of 2020 are likely to be filled with children with monikers inspired by fruit. They’re the names that make you feel like you haven’t applied nearly enough wit or innovation in the naming of your own children. Beard-twirling, kale juice-drinking hipsters seem to be taking over the baby name game . Here is a list of the names that are most likely to be attached to the cardigan-wearing, thrift-store shopping bubs. Bear, according to Buzzfeed, has frequently been used as a name by celebrities, shared by the sons of both Alicia Silverstone and Kate Winslet. One would think that the prominence of the name amongst celebrities would make it strictly off bounds amongst hipsters. Despite this, it is indeed a favourite name amongst the glasses-wearing, bike-pedalling members of society – especially if it is the ‘spirit animal’ of the parent. Often, the secret to a hipster name is taking a name that is intended for one gender and giving it to a child that is of the other sex. Embracing all things vintage is an important component when naming a hipster child. For girls, names like Edna, Mabel, Edie and Ramona are climbing the hipster charts. There are bouncing baby boys boasting the names Ray, Stanley and Ignatius. But remember – these names cannot hit the top 100 baby names. As soon as they do, they are no longer original, thus cannot be used for a truly hipster baby. Should we named it Edna, Mabel, Edie or Ramona? Ray? Stanley? Ignatius? He'll probably ride a fixie and work as a barista . Names normally used for objects, with Clementine and Pearl frequently used for little girls. Plant and food names are also particularly popular, such as Clover, Juniper, Magnolia and Olive. Amazingly, Kale is even more multipurpose than first thought. It is not just a hipster superfood, used frequently in salads and juices, but is also understood to be a boy’s name . Names that appear to be nicknames, such as Frankie, Lulu are also markers of true hipster names. For hipsters naming their babies it is an opportunity to demonstrated just how cultured and well-read they are. Classic novels are the birthplace of many hipster names. Of course, the books that are used cannot be mainstream favourites, but rather the long-forgotten treasures. The beloved 1960 novel ‘To Kill A Mockingbird’ by Harper Lee has inspired two of the favourite names amongst the hipster community: Atticus and Scout. Gulliver is another hipster pick, naturally spurred from the 1726 text ‘Gulliver’s Travels. Atticus, Scout and Gulliver are among the literary-inspired hipster name choices . Holden and Salinger are two names that should be expected in future schoolyards, both derived from ‘Catcher in the Rye’ – Holden being a character in the novel and Sallnger the surname of the author, J.D. Salinger. If the name begins with an X, Q or Z it is preferable, as they are highly uncommon – which remember, is the goal when naming a hipster child. These names include Xena, Zola, Zeus . Many of the character names from The Simpsons are becoming popular are they now hold a certain irony – so expect to see more people bearing the names Homer, Mo, Maggie and Lenny. Just because hipsters are becoming parents, doesn’t mean they’re not cool. To remind the world of this fact, many children’s names have been inspired by the names of old-school rock stars. The name Elvis is having a resurgence, as is Jagger – a la Mick. Buddy is a nod to Buddy Holly and Everly is used for both baby boys and girls, perhaps in reference to the Everly Brothers. Naming children after geographic locations is a special way for hipsters to commemorate memories - with good times obviously frequently occuring at places such as Arizona, Aspen, India and Brooklyn, which are increasing in popularity. Considering the number of hipster's residing in Sydney however, one can expect Tamarama or Glebe to soon be inked on baby certificates. Some names channel the kind of personality the parents want for their child. Some hipster parents are optimistic, choosing names like Serenity. Others are more daring, gifting their future ratbag with the name Rebel or Truant.","Hipster baby trend includes names like Kale, Scout and Django .
Names adopted from pop culture and literature .
Celeb baby names such as Bear and Brooklyn also very popular ."
"Writer and parenting guru Lenore Skenzay is on a mission to wrestle the simple joys of childhood out of the clutches of overprotective parents. Skenazy, a 55-year-old mother of two from Queens and the founder of the Free Range Kids movement, made headlines in 2008 when she allowed her then-9-year-old son to ride the New York City subway without supervision, earning her the title 'World’s Worst Mom.' Seven years - and one book deal - later, Skenazy is tackling helicopter parenting head on as the host of Discovery Life's new show World's Worst Mom, which premiers January 22. Scroll down for video . Overprotected: Writer and parenting guru Lenore Skenazy, known as 'World's Worst Mom,' is the host of a new Discovery Life show about the pitfalls of 'helicopter parenting' Notorious: Skenazy, 55, made headlines in 2008 when she allowed her then-9-year-old son to ride the New York City subway without supervision . According to the show's description, the 13-part series is 'dedicated to diffusing parental paranoia by helping high-strung, fearful parents to relax and give their kids the freedom they deserve.' In each episode, Skenazy performs interventions with families, pushes boundaries and debunks myths about perceived dangers lurking behind every corner. Skenazy’s theory is that while parents have to be vigilant, they must not keep their children in metaphorical bubble-wrap. According to the 55-year-old mother of two, parents who strive to shield their children from the world are doing them a great disservice by robbing them of independence. ‘Some kids are losing their childhood because their parents are so overprotective,’ Skenazy tells The New York Post. ‘Fear is being shoved down their throats at every juncture.’ One of the anxious, phobia-riddled parents featured on the show is Cayle White, a mother of three from Manhattan's Upper West Side who describes her family as 'paralyzed' by her numerous fears. To put her mind at ease that something might happen to her 11-year-old son, Amadeo, on his way home from school, the sixth-grader is required to call his mother and narrate his journey from the bus stop to their front door. Parenting myth buster: In each of the 13 episodes, Skenazy performs interventions with overanxious families, pushes boundaries and debunks myths about perceived dangers lurking behind every corner . Kept in a bubble: Fearing the worst and following the old adage, 'better safe than sorry,' the parents featured on the show put unreasonable restrictions on their kids . Terrified of deadly E. coli infections, White, an admitted germophobe, would purposefully overcook food and then nuke it in the microwave for good measure to kill off any lingering bacteria. Descending on the White household like a modern-day Mary Poppins, Skenazy goes to work challenging Cayle White's preconceived notions about parenting. In order to prove to the overanxious mom that eating medium-rare steak would not wipe out her entire family, Skenazy hosts a barbecue in the park where Mrs White is banned from coming near the grill. Next, Amadeo White is sent out on his own to walk the family dog in Central Park, using a map to find his way after being asked to forfeit his cell phone to prevent his jittery mom from checking up on him. When he returns home in one piece and with his head held high, Cayle White notes that her 11-year-old seems genuinely proud of his accomplishment. In another episode, Lenore Skenazy visits the Almonte family in Rockland County, New York, to help mom Phyllis overcome her fear of letting her children out of her sight. ‘Sometimes I feel like I’m in a box and nobody can come into it and I’m not allowed out of it,’ 10-year-old Brianna Almonte tells Skenazy on the show. Skenazy’s theory is that while parents have to be vigilant, they must not rob their kids of the joys of childhood . Phyllis Almonte has banned her daughter from taking part in play dates, especially sleepovers, out of concern that Brianna would have to change in strangers' homes. Whenever Brianna needs to use a public restroom, her mom accompanies her into the stall to prevent the 10-year-old from coming in contact with germs. Zach Almonte, 12, is not allowed to ride his bike beyond the family’s driveway because his mother is afraid he could get hit by a car. And even when the kids are playing in their backyard, they are required to stay in contact with their mother via walkie-talkies. ‘I constantly fear that they will get abducted or hurt,’ Almonte, 47, admits to Skenazy. ‘I know what I’m doing is not good, but I can’t help it.’ To cure Phyllis of her phobias, Skenazy organizes a pool party play date for Brianna and then sends Zach off on a bike ride in the park two miles away. Speaking to the Post two years after her encounter with Skenazy, Phyllis Almonte said: ‘Instead of thinking of all the things that could go wrong, I’m thinking about all the things that could go right.’","Lenore Skenazy, 55, made headlines in 2008 when she allowed her then-9-year-old son to ride the New York City subway without supervision .

"An Australian woman's French boyfriend who was gravely injured in the Charlie Hedbo shooting has woken up from the coma he was in for eight days. Simon Fieschi, 31, was in an induced coma after a bullet punctured his lung and spine in the terror attack where two men massacred five of his colleagues in a hail of gunfire at the satirical newspaper's office in Paris. Masie Dubosarky was visiting friends and family in Sydney for Christmas when the attack took place, and flew to be by her boyfriend's side on Friday as he underwent surgery for the gunshot wounds. Scroll down for video . Maisie Dubosarsky's boyfriend Simon Fieschi woke from an induced coma after he was shot when terrorists stormed the Paris office of Charlie Hebdo where he worked . Ms Dubosarky's mother said that she had been by his bedside since she arrived back in the country. 'He is still in the intensive care unit. He has not been allowed visitors apart from family and Maisie,' she told The Daily Telegraph. It is still unclear whether Mr Fieschi will walk again, and his girlfriend expressed both her relief at his lucky escape and fear for his future. She was left fearing for the worst until hearing news on Thursday morning he was alive but seriously injured, as bullet ricocheted off his spinal vertebra and perforated his lung. 'Last night I was so happy because he wasn't dead. Now, realising that he might not walk again... it's kind of terrible. I just wish it wasn't real,' she told Fairfax Media. He will be allowed visitors as he continues to recover, including the survivors of the horrific attack on the satirical magazine. Mr Fieschi, who had been responsible for fielding the large volume of hate mail the anti-Islamic magazine received, started working for the magazine just after the offices were firebombed in November 2011. Ms Dubosarky, whose uncle is former Australian Treasurer Peter Costello, had emailed Mr Fieschi just ten minutes before the attack took place. Ms Dubosarsky met her French boyfriend while on a working holiday in France 18 months ago . Maisie Dubosarsky was in Sydney visiting family and friends when her boyfriend was injured in the attack . The attackers headed straight for the paper's editor and cartoonist, Stephane Charbonnier, killing him and his police bodyguard . 'I don't know when the shooting started but the last email I got from him was 10.39am Paris time,' she wrote on Facebook early Thursday morning. Ms Dubosarsky, who met her French boyfriend while on a working holiday in France 18 months ago,  said that the Charlie Hedbo staff did not consider the threats they received to be imminent. 'They got threats all the time but … none of them thought that their lives were under threat. They were out in public all the time,' Ms Dubosarsky said. She said she had met several of the people who worked at Charlie Hebdo and described them as passionate about free speech. 'They knew they were at the forefront of that. They were attacking everyone – in a sense they were so libertarian they almost had no politics. They went for everybody,' she said. Mr Fieschi's mother visited the offices of Charlie Hebdo this week as the publication worked to resurrect its irreverent and often provocative newspaper. Two brothers and a teenager have been revealed as the three suspects linked to the terrorist attack that left 12 people dead . Firefighters carry an injured man on a stretcher in front of the offices of French satirical paper Charlie Hebdo after the shooting . The cover, released yesterday, featured a caricature of the prophet Mohammed on the cover holding a sign which read 'Je Suis Charlie'. The magazine, which normally sells around 30,000 copies a week, had an initial unprecedented print run of three million. This has been increased to five million after copies were snapped up today. Issues of the magazine had sold out across Paris news kiosks within minutes, appearing on newsstands one week to the day after the assault in Paris by two masked gunmen. They stormed the newspaper office after forcing a female employee who had just arrived to work with her young daughter to open the door. The attackers headed straight for the paper's editor and cartoonist, Stephane Charbonnier, killing him and his police bodyguard. The security had been recruited to protect him after extremists firebombed the offices in 2011 over a satirical cartoon about the Prophet Mohammed. A police officer pleads for mercy on the pavement in Paris before being shot in the head by masked gunmen during an attack on the headquarters of the French newspaper . The gunmen were seen brandishing Kalashnikovs as they moved in on the injured police officer from their vehicle outside the office . A year later, Mr Charbonnier famously dismissed threats against his life, declaring: 'I would rather die standing than live kneeling.' The gunmen said they were wreaking vengeance for the magazine's blasphemous cartoons and jokes about figures sacred to Islam. One killer shouted 'Charlie Hebdo is dead!' following the massacre. A top leader of Yemen's al Qaida branch has claimed responsibility for the attack. Nasr al-Ansi, a commander of Al Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP as the branch is known, appeared in an 11-minute internet video, saying that the massacre at Charlie Hebdo was in 'vengeance for the prophet'. Al-Ansi said France belongs to the 'party of Satan' and warned of more 'tragedies and terror'. He said Yemen's al Qaida branch 'chose the target, laid out the plan and financed the operation'. In the immediate aftermath of the attacks solidarity marches were organised in major cities around the country and the globe, with thousands waving banners reading Je suis Charlie - I am Charlie - in sympathy with the journalists that died. The journalists killed were (l to r) Charlie Hebdo's deputy chief editor Bernard Maris and cartoonists Georges Wolinski, Jean Cabut, aka Cabu, Stephane Charbonnier, who is also editor-in-chief, and Bernard Verlhac .

"The kingpin of a Sydney drug syndicate has been caught planning a $1million meth deal from behind bars - just months before he was due to be released after 15 years in prison. Alex Chan, 64, is one of five men charged over the attempted importation of about three kilograms of methamphetamine into Western Australia from Taiwan. Chan, who was jailed in 1997 on drug offences in connection with the Sing-Ma crime syndicate, was up for parole in just six months. He was moved to a minimum security work camp at Walpole in recent months, allowed to spend time in the community and given access to mobile phones - an apparent model prisoner. Scroll down video .

Police will allege that a 64-year-old man tried to facilitate the importation of drugs from an overseas drug syndicate and was planning to have the drugs sent to several addresses in WA. It's believed the AFP may have had the syndicate and Chan in particular, under surveillance for several months. In a major a joint operation; officers from the AFP, WA Police, Department of Corrective Services, Australian Crime Commission, Customs and AusTrac shared information. They raided premises in four suburbs; Walpole, Butler, Westminster and Ballajura. WA Police, Customs, Corrective Services and AFP officers were among those who worked together to put an end to the drug importation ring bringing meth in to Perth from Taiwan . Chan and three other men - aged 38, 40 and 56 - have each been charged with entering into an agreement to import a commercial quantity of a border controlled drug. Chan was linked to the Sing-Ma crime syndicate during his trial and was originally jailed in New South Wales, until he was moved after six years on compassionate grounds to WA, to be closer to his family. He's been arrested inside the prison and returned to maximum security.

And a 28-year-old man was charged with possession of a prohibited drug with the intent to sell and supply. Three other people were also charged in Taiwan for their involvement. In December, Taiwanese authorities charged a 40-year-old man over an attempt to send about two kilograms of ketamine to the United Kingdom. Earlier this month, a 30-year-old syndicate member and his 24-year-old partner were charged after they allegedly tried to send the 3kg package of methamphetamine into Perth.","Criminal syndicate king-pin Alex Chan caught up in a police sting organising drug deal from behind bars .

"Secret service agents raided a chain of hotels in Istanbul looking for the wife of one of the Paris terrorists two days before the attacks began, it emerged last night. Dozens of officials stormed the Bade Otel in Istanbul looking for Hayat Boumeddiene, the world’s most wanted woman whose husband Amedy Coulibaly went on to shoot dead a policewoman and execute four hostages at a Jewish deli. The agents from Turkey’s National’s Intelligence Organisation (MIT) swooped on the chain’s four hotels on January 5 but the jihadi bride had already checked out and begun her journey to the Syrian border by then. Scroll down for video . Missed opportunity: The Turkish secret service raided the Bade Otel in Istanbul (left) on January 5 - but suspected terror mastermind Hayat Boumeddiene (right) had already checked out on her way to Syria . Lair: Room 102 of the Bade Otel in Istanbul, where Boumeddiene stayed days before agents arrived . Two days after the raid, the Kouachi brothers – Cherif, 32, and Said, 34, who were in the same terror cell as the couple – killed 12 at the Charlie Hebdo magazine offices. The counter-terror operation will now be considered a missed opportunity to capture Boumeddiene, 26, and possibly prevent the terror attacks she is believed to have masterminded. The French are said to have received a number of warnings before the attacks took place. Algerian intelligence sources warned their French counterparts on January 6 of the expected attack on the Charlie Hedbo offices that took place the next day. Boumeddiene arrived at Istanbul’s Sabiha Gokcen airport on January 2 and checked into the budget £40 a night hotel in the city’s Kadikoy district. But she arrived in Sanliurfa, a southern town close to the Syrian border, on January 4. Naim Sonmez, the owner of the hotel chain told how on January 5 ‘dozens of men marched into reception’. He said: ‘One of them took out their identification badge and said, “We are from MIT and we can’t give you any information”. They took everyone out of the hotel. Staff, cleaning ladies. Even customers were taken out of their rooms by the agents. Arrival: Boumeddiene (right) flew into Istanbul on January 2 and was caught on the airport's CCTV footage . Failures: There are questions over whether Boumeddiene could have been detected sooner by authorities . ‘They searched for everything. They took all our records from reception for the previous month. They took all our documents and CCTV. The agents copied our CCTV and then wiped the entire footage clean. It is now blank.’ He said they did the same thing at all four of his hotels. The father, who is in his 50s, said he only realised the significance of the raid when he saw television reports saying that Boumeddiene had stayed in Istanbul before making her way to Syria. Another worker at the hotel added: ‘Staff were interviewed by the officers about two people who were supposed to be staying at hotel.’ A shopkeeper opposite said he noticed a lot of police activity in the area in the days before the raid. The man, who did not want to be named, said: ‘On the day of the raid I saw about a dozen men go inside and more wait outside.’ The Turkish government claims they gave France intelligence relating to Boumeddiene even before they were asked. Marriage: Boumeddiene and her husband Amedy Coulibaly, who killed four in a kosher deli in Paris . Armed: The veiled widow aims a crossbow at the camera in an image believed to have been taken in 2010 . Yesterday the foster family of France’s most wanted woman have told how they desperately tried to block her marriage to Coulibaly but failed because she was ‘deeply in love’ him. The Muslim family cared for Boumeddiene for eight years, after her mother died and her father struggled to cope. She lived at their home, a modest semi-detached house in a poor suburb of Paris on and off between the ages of eight and 17. Previous life: The jihadi couple on holiday before Boumeddiene's commitment to radical Islamism . Speaking from the home yesterday, they told of a ‘normal’ happy child, who enjoyed holidays and nature but who severed ties with them after her marriage to Coulibaly. Last week he shot dead an unarmed trainee policewoman and murdered four hostages at a Jewish deli as part of a coordinated terror strike in Paris. Boumeddiene, now 26, is suspected of helping plan the attacks, and is now thought to be in Syria with Islamic State fighters. Her foster family last night pleaded with her to come home. Speaking for the first time, her foster brother, now in his 30s, said the family had done everything possible to block the marriage to Coulibaly, a petty criminal who converted to Islam and became radicalised while in prison. ‘We tried everything to avoid this wedding and did everything to convince her not to marry this man,’ he said, adding: ‘She was very in love I think. The family said the last time they spoke to Boumeddiene was in October, when she called to congratulate her foster parents on their recent pilgrimage to Mecca. Meanwhile, it emerged yesterday Coulibaly’s hatred of police may have stemmed from an incident in 2000, when his best friend, 19 year-old Ali Rezgui was shot five times as they tried to flee from officers after attempting to steal motorbikes from a garage in the Parisian suburb of Grigny. Coulibaly suffered ‘profound guilt and anger’ in the aftermath, the dead boy’s lawyer said.","Dozens of officials swept on Bade Otel chain in Istanbul on January 5 .

"A man giving doctors a demonstration on how 3D printers can assist surgery collapsed with a kidney stone - then made a model of his own organ to help his operation. John Cousins, who owns a 3D printing services company, was giving a talk on the medical uses of the technology at Bournemouth Hospital. But during the demonstration in October last year he passed out in agony and was rushed to the facility's own A&E department for scans. After doctors removed his appendix that afternoon, they said Mr Cousins would need a further operation to extract a kidney stone. John Cousins used his firm's 3D printing software to make a model of his own kidney before having surgery to remove a stone from it. The model cut the operation time significantly and helped guide surgeons . Scans revealed the stone was big - 3.5cm - and shaped like a stag's head (left picture, left of centre). Mr Cousins was able to work from images taken by surgeons to make the model . Scans revealed the stone was big - 3.5cm - and shaped like a stag's head. While waiting for the second operation, which was conducted on Monday, Mr Cousins used his  3D printer technology to make a model of his kidney. He said: 'While I was lying in the hospital bed I thought ""hang on, we could utilise the technology"". 'I talked it all through with the surgeon and we decided we would try and create a model of my kidney.' And surgeons at Southampton General Hospital did end up using the fake organ as a guide during the op. Medics say having the plastic kidney slashed an hour from his two-hour kidney stone removal operation on Monday. Mr Cousins, 46, of Southampton, Hampshire, said: 'While giving the demonstration, I collapsed on the floor in excruciating pain. They took me to the A&E and found I had appendicitis and a kidney stone. 'They operated to remove the appendix that afternoon and as I was recovering and talking to the consultant I thought, hang on, we could utilise the 3D technology here.' He printed a model of his own kidney containing the inch-long stone, which was caused by a build-up of blood waste products in his kidney. Mr Cousins was able to work from images taken by surgeons  - such as X-rays and MRI scans - to make the model in just over four hours. Mr Cousins used his printer  to produce a multi-coloured plaster of Paris kidney that can be opened up to reveal the stone inside. Southampton General Hospital has agreed to trial the process with 21 other patients to monitor the usefulness of the technology . Mr Cousins printed a model of his own kidney, complete with the inch-long kidney stone it contained. To create an object from a 3D printer you can either create a design of it on an computer with 3D software or a scan of the object. The printer will then create the different layers and connect them together to create a 3D object. Mr Cousins was able to work from images taken by surgeons to make the model, such as X-rays and MRI scans. He used his printer - a ProJet 660 - to produce a multi-coloured plaster of Paris kidney that can be opened up to reveal the stone inside. This took just over four hours. While 2D images are currently used to to plan the operations, surgeons believe up to an hour can be cut off procedure times by using 3D models to give medics more detailed briefings on the operation ahead. Time can also be saved on explaining the procedure to patients and hopefully increase their approval of the operations.

"There may be many things we don't understand about the universe, but one thing we can be certain of is that the speed of light cannot be exceeded. Right? Not necessarily, according to one scientist. He claims that a certain effect may be capable of producing the illusion that 'spots' of light travel faster than lightspeed. And his research says that when this occurs, the spots produce a phenomenon known as a 'photonic boom'. A scientist from Michigan Tech University studied faster than light effects. Dr Robert Nemiroff said a laser swept across the moon (telescope laser shown) will appear to break light-speed. This is because it will move from one end to the other before light on the surface could make the same journey . The controversial study was carried out by physics professor Dr Robert Nemiroff from Michigan Tech University, and he recently presented his research at the 225th meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Seattle. He claims that if you shine a powerful enough laser pointer on the moon from Earth and sweep it across the surface, the 'spot of light' could appear to move faster than the speed of light. This is because, in this hypothetical scenario, if another person standing on a moon attempted to shine a light across the moon at the same time, it would take longer. When a plane travels faster than the speed of sound, the sound waves it creates are unable to propagate away as normal and instead build up, creating a sonic boom of noise. A similar effect can also be observed with regards to light, emitting something known as Cerenkov radiation in the process. Note that this is different to the 'photonic boom' effect described by Dr Nemiroff. The Cerenkov radiation effect occurs when something travelling at, or near, the speed of light in a particular medium - such as air - moves into a medium where the speed of light is slower - such as water. In air, the speed of light is about 984 million feet (300 million metres) per second. In water, however, it is less at 738 million feet (225 million metres) per second. This means that if particles move from air to water they can break the speed of light in the water. The moment they do this they slow down to the new speed, but in the process release a particular type of radiation - known as Cerenkov radiation. The effect occurs in nuclear reactors, which are encased in water. When neutrinos leak out, they slow from the speed of light in air to that in water. In the process they emit Cerenkov radiation, which appears as a blue glow. 'The stream of particles (photons) from your laser pointer can sequentially impact the moon so that another light beam - confined to the surface of the moon - could not keep up,' Dr Nemiroff told MailOnline. In his paper he explained that, although light takes about 0.0116 seconds to cross the moon, a person standing on Earth can sweep a laser pointer across the moon's surface in less time. Such sweeps in the universe are known as 'superluminal sweeps' - superluminal meaning faster than light. And when this spot first strikes the moon, Dr Nemiroff said it can create a flash to an observer, which he calls a photonic boom. Although not the same as a sonic boom, this would be an indicator that the spot is moving faster than the speed of light. Dr Nemiroff further explained that the 'spot' moving across the moon is not actually a physical object - so it is not breaking any laws of physics. 'Each photon that strikes the moon is unconnected to other photons that strike the moon,' he said. But while the photons in the beam move at the speed of light, the spot itself seems to move faster. 'Nothing physical is moving faster than the speed of light,' he added. 'In this sense, the superluminal motion inherent in a photonic boom is an optical illusion brought about by the timings of unrelated photons striking - and being scattered by - the moon. 'One analogy is the sonic boom as when a supersonic airplane flies by overhead, people at different locations will hear the sonic boom at different times.' This graphic reveals the effect in action. It takes light about 0.0116 seconds to cross the moon, said Dr Nemiroff, but a person can sweep a laser pointer across the moon's surface in less time . The laser effect is only a trick - but it could reveal hidden details.When the light first hits the object it creates a 'photonic boom'. Comparing this to the sweep of light over the surface could reveal properties of the object it is striking. For example, sweeping light over an asteroid thousands of times could reveal its mass . While the laser beam on the moon analogy might seen simplistic, it is actually relevant to other events in the universe. Namely, pulsars, rapidly rotating neutron stars, may sweep their own beams across cloud of dust and gas and creating the superluminal effect. 'The photonic boom effect has never yet been identified as such out in the cosmos,' Dr Nemiroff said. 'One reason is that no one has thought to look for it. The research says the effect probably occurs and should be looked for.' When a superluminal sweep occurs, it is thought to start with a flash known as a 'photonic boom' - so-called because they are analogous to sonic booms and breaking the sound barrier. The crux of Dr Nemiroff's research is that by comparing these sweeps with the scattering of the beam, characteristics on the origin of the beam - and the object it is striking - can be observed. For example, to reveal the size and surface features of asteroids passing near Earth, a laser beam could be swept across the rock's surface thousands of times a second. Each sweep would create a photonic boom and, recorded with high-speed cameras, could map out major features on the asteroid. A similar phenomenon is observed in pulsars shining on dust clouds (illustration shown). Pulsars are rapidly rotating neutron stars that emit beams of light, and the glow they create on dust clouds has been observed by astronomers. The sweeping motion could appear to travel faster than light, according to Dr Nemiroff . Dr Nemiroff said photonic booms could be observed in the universe, such as in Hubble's Variable Nebula, pictured. Here, he said shadows cast by clouds moving  between a bright star may reflect dust and move so fast that they might create photonics booms visible for days or weeks . The physics that create a photonic boom is tied to the faster-than-light sweep speeds of the illuminating spots and shadows. Specifically, a flash is seen by an observer when the speed of the scattered spot toward the observer drops from above the speed of light to below the speed of light. The phenomenon is possible only because the spots contain no mass and so cannot only move faster than light, but decelerate past the speed of light without violating Einstein's theory of special relativity. The effect hinges on the interplay between the time it takes for a sweeping beam of light to cross an object, and the time it takes for the light beam to traverse the depth of the object. 'Photonic booms happen around us quite frequently - but they are always too brief to notice,' said Dr Nemiroff in a separate press release. 'Out in the cosmos they last long enough to notice - but nobody has thought to look for them!' When neutrinos leak out of nuclear reactor, they are travelling above the speed of light in water and briefly break the 'light barrier'. As they slow, they release something called Cerenkov radiation, which appears as a blue glow. Pictured is the glow from the Idaho National Laboratory's Advanced Test Reactor (ATR) core . Photonic booms should not be confused with the well-known Cerenkov radiation, which is emitted when an object breaks the speed of light in a particular material. The speed of light is different in various mediums - for example, it moves slower through water than it does in air. So, if a particle moving at the speed of the light in air moves into water, it produces the radiation as it slows to below light speed. This effect can be observed in nuclear reactors, which are kept underwater.","Scientist from Michigan Tech University studied faster than light effects .

"A reality TV star has spoken for the first time about terrifying encounter in a hotel room where she sexually assaulted by a stranger. Tanya Bardsley, 33, who appears in ITVBe's The Real Housewives Of Cheshire and is married to Stoke City footballer Phil Bardsley, said she woke up to find a man touching her - and had no idea whether or not she had been raped. The incident happened in March 2013 when the couple stayed in a hotel after attending a family birthday party. Tanya went to bed early leaving her husband to carrying on partying with his friends. The WAG said her husband, Stoke City footballer Phil Bardsley, pictured, has helped her come to terms with the incident which happened in March 2013 . Ordeal: Real Housewives star Tanya said she woke up in a hotel room to find a strange man touching her . 'Phil left the hotel room leaving me there in a drunken, comatose sleep. I woke up in a hazy state to find a strange man at the side of the bed touching me,' she told The Sun. 'I screamed for him to get out. I then rang Phil, who quickly came with a car full of friends and he rang the police. I was badly shaken up.' Wigan-born Tanya was taken to hospital where she had a number of 'distressing' examinations to find out if she had been raped. She said: 'Lucky for me, the tests came back that I hadn't been raped, just sexually assaulted. Thoughts kept going through my head - how many other girls might have been targeted?' These thoughts led to mother-of-three Tanya to waive her right to anonymity as a victim of sexual assault by sharing her ordeal in her self-published book, Just A Girl Who Got It All. Tanya, second from left with her Real Housewives of Cheshire co-stars, said she was 'badly shaken up' by the sexual assault which took place in 2013 . The 33-year-old said she's angry and disgusted that there was not enough evidence to prosecute her attacker . She also worked with the police to have her attacker prosecuted - but nobody has been brought to justice due to a lack of evidence. A man who worked at the hotel admitted he had been in Tanya's room while there was a 'Do Not Disturb' sign on the door. Tanya said she felt 'sick' when she heard he had 'admitted to coming over and moving my sleeping naked body' during a police interview. But he denied committing sexual assault. 'Months went by waiting for the police to get forensics back and for the case to go to the Crown Prosecution Service to decide if there was enough evidence to go to court,' Tanya explains. 'After five months of it hanging over my head, the CPS came back and said there wasn't enough evidence.' Let it go: Tanya, top left with her co-stars on This Morning, said she's had to move on from the assault because 'being angry was only harming me and those close to me' Rags to riches: Tanya went from being a single mother working in a call centre to living in a £2.7million mansion after winning a modelling competition and marrying a footballer . Tanya said the decision left her feeling 'angry and disgusted that this man would get away scot-free.' The mother-of-three, who has a daughter from a previous relationship and two sons with Phil, said her husband has been 'her rock' helping her come to terms with what happened. But she said it has taken time to move on. 'At first I was angry and bitter... I had to keep reminding myself that my being angry was only harming me and those close to me... so I just had to let it go,' she said. Tanya's book reveals her rags to riches tale, going from being a was a single mother working in a call centre to a WAG living in a £2.7million mansion in Cheshire's affluent 'Golden Triangle.' Cover girl: When Tanya appeared on the front of FHM magazine, her edition outsold Jennifer Lopez's . Reality TV: Tanya is one of the stars of ITVBe's new show about the women living in Cheshire's affluent 'Golden Triangle' She met Scotland international Phil after becoming an FHM model - a role she won after submitting a picture of herself to their 'High Street Honeys' competition. She writes in her book: 'I had always wanted to be a model travelling the world and being on the front cover of magazines, earning lots of money for my daughter Gabriella to have a nice life.' She added:' I never believe I could become a model as I was 5ft 3 and I was sure there were millions of girls better looking.' But after winning the FHM competition, her front cover outsold Jennifer Lopez's and she's regularly appeared in the magazine's 100 sexist women in the world list. Now she's set to find greater fame on TV show The Real Housewives Of Cheshire, which started this week on ITVBe.","Tanya said she was attacked when she fell asleep drunk in hotel room .

"Shamin Husen, 30, claims she was bullied by her manager Talib Hussain, as he banned her from attending prayer and had to ask to go to the toilet . A 'bullying' Royal Mail boss made staff seek permission to go to the toilet and timed how long they went for, an employment tribunal was told. Somali-born Shamin Husen claimed she was bullied by manager Talib Hussain at the parcel depot in Langley, Berkshire, and is suing the Royal Mail for discrimination on religious grounds. The 30-year-old told the panel in Reading that she was banned from attending prayer while other Muslims were not challenged and felt she was singled out and picked on. In her witness statement, she said: 'Talib was horrible. He bullied me, harassed me, intimidated me and victimised me most of the time.' Mrs Husen claimed she was made to feel like she could not go to the toilet because her manager would time how long she was gone. The tribunal heard that she first encountered problems with Mr Hussain in December 2013, when he stopped her from using the bathroom at the depot, which is the main office responsible for sorting all parcels coming into the UK from Heathrow airport. Representing Royal Mail, Bridget Tokhai said: 'You claim Mr Hussain stopped you when you went to the toilet and monitored how long you were in the toilet. You say this was all part of him maintaining a watch over you. 'On what basis, apart from the fact that you are a woman and a Muslim, were you made to feel discriminated against?' Mrs Husen, from Hounslow, replied: 'Because he would not stop men visiting the toilet.' The tribunal heard that Mr Hussain asked everyone to tell him when they were leaving the work area, whether it was for a smoking break, a comfort break or to attend prayers. The 42-year-old said he had simply tried to change the 'holiday camp' atmosphere of his section of the depot when he took on the role of manager in October 2013. 'When I came to the manual packets section, it had no standards,' he told the tribunal. 'I went about inputting very, very, basic standards. People should come to work on time, should go to breaks on time and should inform the manager if they are leaving the work floor. 'That's all I wanted to implement. I did continue to get resistance from my staff.' Mrs Husen said she was challenged when she returned from a toilet break because he believed she had been gone for around 20 minutes. Ms Tokhai said: 'Mr Hussain says in his statement he would make a mental note if someone was absent from the floor. That is not the same as keeping a watch over someone excessively, is it? 'He is entitled to ask the question if he believed you were away for too long. He didn't stop you from going to the toilet.' Mrs Husen, who joined the company in 2007 and worked as a manual sorter at the Heathrow Worldwide Distribution Centre, replied: 'He did.' She claims she was subjected to sexual and religious discrimination by Mr Hussain and the Royal Mail group. Ms Tokhai said: 'What the evidence suggests is that Mr Hussain did not single you out. You were all expected to tell him when you left the floor.' One month later, in January 2014, Mr Hussain allegedly stopped Mrs Husen on her way to prayers. Ms Tokhai said: 'You say you were not able to perform prayers even though other Muslims were going without asking permission. She worked as a sorter at the Royal Mail depot in Langley, Berkshire, which is the main office responsible for sorting all parcels coming into the UK from Heathrow airport . 'What else, apart from the fact you are a woman and a Muslim, made you feel discriminated against?' She replied: 'I was the only Somali, the only Muslim, in that area.' Mrs Husen agreed that the reason she was challenged on that occasion was because she had failed to let Mr Hussain know where she was going. To this the defence questioned whether this was a reason for him to challenge her and Mrs Husen agreed it was 'but he did not ask others and others did not ask permission.' Ms Tokhai said Mr Hussain had not singled her out based on her sex or religion. When pushed on whether this was correct, Mrs Husen replied: 'Yes.' The tribunal also heard Mr Hussain allegedly gave Mrs Husen 'unreasonable' targets, however, Ms Tokhai said: 'You were not the only one who was challenged for your performance. 'Others were challenged and they were not Muslim employees,' which Mrs Husen agreed with. In March 2014, Mr Hussain allegedly isolated Mrs Husen from her colleagues by moving her to a different department. The tribunal heard it was common practice for staff to be moved around and Ms Tokhai said: 'He did not move you to isolate you, he moved you because an extra pair of hands was needed. Your sex and religion has nothing to do with it.' However, Mrs Husen, disagreed with this comment and maintained that her gender and religious beliefs did come into it. Denying the claims, Mr Hussain said he had never prevented people from going to the toilet, instead asking his staff to let him know when they were leaving the floor for any reason. 'I asked everyone to notify me when they wanted to leave the work floor,' he said. 'It wasn't only for prayers. I didn't ask people to come to me and say, ""Please Sir, can I go to pray?"" 'As a manager, I need to know where my staff are. I would be held responsible for the whereabouts of my staff. 'I'm not concerned with how long people had been in the toilet, it was knowing where they were.' He stressed that the depot was a high-security operation, with access controlled biometrically with fingerprints and swipe passes, in which he needed to keep tabs on his staff. One of his employees at his previous position at airline caterer Gate Gourmet had died in a toilet and wasn't found for six hours after failing to tell colleagues where he was going, he added, which gave him 'alarm bells' if people were gone for a long period of time. James Khalid, representing Mrs Husen, said: 'Women have complained about you and said you are a bully and that you hate women - that you are a misogynist. 'It's not just one person, or two people, it's a collection, and I'm saying Mrs Husen bore the brunt of it. You harassed her on the basis of her race and religion on a daily basis. 'You stopped her from going to pray, you stopped her from going to the toilet. The effect was to stop her from performing her cleansing for prayer.' Mr Hussain rubbished the claims as 'ridiculous' and 'vicious lies,' saying he himself was a devout Muslim who prayed five times a day, and had only stopped Mrs Husen to question her movements when she hadn't told him where she was going. He said: 'I pray in order to earn rewards. If I help someone else pray, I take a share of that reward. 'By stopping someone from praying, I'm committing a sincere, deep sin. I find it ridiculous that someone can say I stopped someone praying. Mr Hussain, who took the role as manager at the depot in October 2013, denies the claims saying he has never prevented anyone from going to the toilet . 'I would just like to know the reason (for leaving the floor), and then I let them go on their merry way. 'Mrs Husen took very strong exception to the fact that I had the gall to even question her movements. I believed I was only doing her job as her manager.' Mrs Husen continued to work alongside Mr Hussain under investigation until he left the parcels section on June 22, 2014, during which time she alleges he continued to harass her. However, he said he was advised by his line manager to be careful and avoid communicating with her. The tribunal heard that a number of other members of his staff of around 20 had made formal complaints about his management techniques, criticising his brusque manner. He countered: 'What they found problematic was that I managed them. People of all religions. 'I received complaints from all races, religions and genders.' The manager was dismissed from Royal Mail on November 7, 2014, when his 12-month trial period had ended, and currently has an appeal in process to try and reinstate his position. Mr Khalid suggested he had lost his job because of his bullying manner towards his employees, which Mr Hussain denied, saying: 'The reason given in my dismissal letter was at the 12 month trial period review, because of unsatisfactory performance, my employment was being terminated.' He added that 52 per cent of the employees at the sorting centre were Muslim and he would have been 'lynched' if he had been found stopping people going to pray. 'These allegations are false,' he said. 'If they were true, I would really have been concerned for my safety. 'If someone had been stopped from going to the toilet, there would be outrage throughout the plant. It is unheard of.' Judge Andrew Gumbiti-Zimuto said: 'You say you were moved several times because of your sex and your religion. 'Do you accept when you were moved there was a legitimate need for you or someone else to be moved at that time?' Mrs Husen replied: 'No. There was a procedure which was not being followed.' Government guidelines say workers have the right to one uninterrupted 20 minute rest break during their working day, if they work more than 6 hours a day. The tribunal continues.","Shamin Husen, 30, claimed she was bullied by manager Talib Hussain .

"BBC political editor Nick Robinson labelled Russell Brand a 'sanctimonious t***' after the comedian refused to speak to him for a radio show. The BBC man approached Brand for a comment ahead of a programme he was making about democracy - but was turned down by the self-styled revolutionary, who allegedly called in security guards. Witnesses to the snubbing have now said Robinson resorted to 'colourful language' when he was denied access to Brand. Scroll down for video . The BBC's Nick Robinson was said to have been left furious after Russell Brand refused to speak to him after appearing on Question Time last month . The political journalist sent an angry tweet out soon after the snub, but was said to have used more 'colourful' language after Brand allegedly called in security . The incident happened after Brand's appearance on the BBC's Question Time show, filmed in Canterbury last month. Robinson is said to have approached Brand and asked for a contribution to his Radio 4 programme, called 'Can Democracy Work?'. A witness told The Sun that Robinson was left 'clearly furious' after Brand refused to speak and called the comedian a 'sanctimonious t***'. Shortly after the incident, Robinson tweeted: 'Dear @rustyrockets (Brand's twitter handle), why refusing to be interviewed for @BBCRadio4 'Can Democracy Work?' series? Time for selfies last night but not Qs. Pity' Neither man had comments on the incident on Twitter this morning. The first show of Robinson's three-part radio series aired yesterday, in which he criticised Brand's attitude to politics. It played a recording of Robinson confronting Brand as he posed for selfies with fans, then shouting: 'Why are you so worried about doing an interview about democracy Russell?' as the comedian retreated. Following Brand's claims that he wouldn't run parliament because he didn't want to become a politician, Robinson also said: 'In one respect Russell Brand is already like them; he doesn't like answering awkward questions.' In the programme, former Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair revealed he has read Brand's book, Revolution, but is unclear how the comedian's ideas could be implemented. He told Robinson: 'I've studied a lot of what the Russell Brand stuff really means. But I suspect if you implemented that, or tried to implement that, I literally don't know what it means.' Robinson has previously attacked Brand's call for people not to vote in elections in his book, Revolution . The BBC has repeatedly invited Brand to talk on Question Time, Newsnight and on numerous Radio shows . Robinson has previously said he is an 'unapologetic believer in elections' after his German Jewish grandparents had to flee both the Nazis and then the Communists in China. The 51-year-old told Radio Times that politicians are not all the same and are not all in it for themselves, and 'it does make a difference whether you vote or not and who you vote for'. He also used the TV listings magazine to attack 39-year-old Brand, who has an estimated fortune of around £9million. He said: 'Are you listening, Russell Brand, and admirers of the man with the most manicured chest in Britain? 'You see I've got a bit of a beef with Brand. More than anyone I can remember in recent times he has energised, excited and enthused people about some of the great issues of our time. 'And yet Brand continues to tell people that all politics and all politicians are corrupt or venal or a waste of time. 'These days he pretends that he's only ever argued that there's no one worth voting for, but not very long ago he wrote in the New Statesman – 'I will never vote and I don't think you should, either'.' Brand's recent book Revolution encouraged people not to vote in order to bring about a collapse in government. He has discussed his views on Newsnight and had a stylist straighten his chest hair before appearing on Question Time.","Journalist approached controversial comedian for comment last month .

Executives from the two companies, which are working with . advisers, met last week to discuss a potential transaction, the . source said, asking not to be identified because the . conversations are private. Shares of Blackberry jumped as much as 30 percent on heavy . volume in afternoon trading in New York. The offer price would imply an enterprise value of $6 . billion to $7.5 billion for BlackBerry, assuming conversion of . $1.25 billion of convertible debt, according to the documents.

The partnership will wed BlackBerry's . security platform with the South Korean company's own security . software for its Galaxy devices. Representatives for BlackBerry declined to comment while . Samsung could not be immediately reached for comment. Last month the ailing firm launched the Blackberry Classic, a handset based on its hugely successful Bold phone. It hopes 'loyal customers' - who include Kim Kardashian and Barack Obama, will save the firm following disastrous sales of its touchscreen handsets. BlackBerry CEO John Chen introduces the company's new phone, the BlackBerry Classic, during a news conference in New York. Pioneered in 1999 with the launch of the RIM 950, BlackBerry changed the culture by allowing on-the-go business people to access email wirelessly. Then came a new generation of competing smartphones, and suddenly the BlackBerry looked ancient. Apple showed that phones can handle much more than email and phone calls. Blackberry was late in overhauling its operating system to compete. BlackBerry now holds a small fraction of the U.S. smartphone market after commanding a nearly 50 percent share as recently as 2009. Instead of apps, cameras and screens, the $450 Classic focuses on keyboard, security and battery life . With the Classic, BlackBerry is courting its core customer, the business user. The physical keyboard is something traditional BlackBerry users prefer because they find it easier than touch screens to type with. The company is also emphasizing battery life and security. 'A lot of people say the Classic is aiming for loyal customers. And that is true,' CEO John Chen said at the gadget's launch event, tellingly held in New York City's Financial District. But he also invited people who haven't used a BlackBerry 'especially people who are young,' to try the BlackBerry Classic. The handsets have a legion of loyal fans. 'I love a BlackBerry,' Kardashian West admitted to the Code Mobile conference earlier this year. 'Every time I say that, people are horrified that I have a BlackBerry, and I don't understand that reaction.' 'BlackBerry has my heart and soul, I'll never get rid of it,' she said. 'I do have an iPhone, and I use that for photos, but if you have an email and you need to type fast, you need to have that keyboard.' The BlackBerry Classic is available for sale starting Wednesday for $449 in the U.S. and 499 Canadian dollars in Canada through Amazon.com and BlackBerry.com. It will come later to AT&T and Verizon. 3.5' Square touch display . 8MP Rear camera . 16GB Internal storage . 35key Backlit keyboard . Despite the endorsement, speaking at the APEC CEO summit in Beijing, BlackBerry CEO John Chen said he was not interested in hiring the reality TV star.

Blackberry was late in overhauling its operating system to compete. BlackBerry now holds a small fraction of the U.S. smartphone market after commanding a nearly 50 percent share as recently as 2009. The company is trying to stay relevant on making hardware even as it tries to transform into an enterprise security and consumer software company. Whether the Classic will sell enough to keep it in the hardware business is unclear. BlackBerry's director of marketing and enterprise Jeff Gadway demonstrates the company's new phone the BlackBerry Classic . 'It's going to be a niche product based around enterprise, based around security and pockets of the world where there is still strengths.

"Growing numbers of students are shunning British universities such as Oxford and Cambridge and opting to study abroad as they search for value for money, headteachers have warned. With UK institutions now charging fees of £9,000 a year, some independent schools say that more and more students are taking up offers from overseas universities, especially those in the U.S. They add that many universities abroad offer more contact time for students with their lecturers than most universities in the UK. Headteachers have warned that students are shunning British universities such as Cambridge, pictured, in favour of studying abroad . It comes as the deadline for applications to British universities via UCAS approaches tomorrow. Keith Budge, headteacher at Bedales School, a boarding school in Hampshire, told the Independent there had been a 'discernible increase' in students wanting to study abroad. He said: 'We had nine per cent of our students accepting offers from abroad. 'It has been at just about five per cent for about six or seven years.' While Richard Harman, head of Uppingham School in Rutland told the newspaper that one of his pupils had opted to go to Stanford University in California rather than Cambridge. In November it was revealed that record numbers of British students were choosing American universities amid concerns over rising fees and the quality of degree courses. More than 10,000 young people attended institutions in the United States - which offer generous scholarship schemes - during the 2013-14 academic year. This was an eight per cent rise on 2012-13 - the largest year-on-year increase in a decade, according to a report released by the Institute for International Education (IIE). Richard Harman, head of Uppingham School in Rutland, said one of his pupils opted to go to Stanford University, pictured, rather than Cambridge . The top five US universities hosting UK students in 2013-14 were Harvard, Columbia, New York, University of California Berkeley and Yale. Meanwhile last year, an analysis of figures on Government website Unistats, found that some students get fewer than half the hours of lectures, seminars and tutorials than others studying the same subject at different universities in Britain. In 2012, Anthony Seldon, Master of Wellington College, Berkshire, warned that students were being forced to seek courses on the other side of the Atlantic because institutions in this country were stuck in a ‘malaise’. He said British universities provided less contact time with lecturers and displayed only a ‘perfunctory interest’ in sport and the arts.","Headteachers say more students are opting to go abroad for university .

"Is #pot2blame for criminal behavior? HLN's Nancy Grace thinks so. But to argue the other side of the debate, she brought in an unlikely adversary - the rapper 2 Chainz. Grace invited the 37-year-old 'I'm Different' rapper on HLN to speak his piece about why marijuana should be legalized. In a 50-minute segment, the two went back and forth in a heated debate. Grace was well prepared to back up her opinion that marijuana should not be legalized. #Pot2Blame: In what may be the most entertaining marijuana debate ever televised, HLN's Nancy Grace (left) sat down with rapper 2 Chainz (right) Tuesday night to debate the legalization of marijuana . Heated: Grace invited the 37-year-old 'I'm Different' rapper on HLN to speak his piece about why marijuana should be legalized. In a 50-minute segment, the two went back and forth in a heated debate . Grace illustrated her case with footage of marijuana-related crimes, 2 Chainz smoking, and even tackled 2 Chainz 'Feds Watching' lyrics . She showed the rapper footage of several recent cases involving marijuana, including parents who forced their toddlers to spoke the substance. Grace repeatedly urged the rapper to look at the footage of a man forcing a two-year-old to smoke marijuana as she argued that people cannot be trusted to act responsibly with the drug. 'That's what makes me keep arguing about this, 2 Chainz,' the former prosecutor said referring to the disturbing footage, 'people like this.' 2 Chainz -- born Tauheed Epps -- was ready with a reply. 'These people are imbeciles,' the rapper responded calmly.  'You can't use this case to define a community.' 'We still cool:' 2 Chainz posted on Twitter that he and Grace are 'still cool,' and said that Fox's Bill O' Reilly is 'up next' 'You're on:' Grace took the heat to Twitter and even insulted the rapper's Rolex -- but, thankfully, not his two chains . The journalist said that though she is not labeling what 2 Chainz called the 'stoner community,' the legalization of pot would only lead to more disturbing cases of the substance being misused. The rapper, who Grace noted graduated from college with a 4.0 GPA, countered that the benefits of legalizing marijuana far outweigh the risks. 'If we got half of the states legalizing pot, if the rest of the community legalizes pot that frees up taxpayers' money,' 2 Chainz said, 'that'll allow us to do something with this extra, with these funds, from fixing potholes in the street to building stadiums. I'm down with that.' Attacking from every angle, Grace showed footage from the rapper's Twitter feed which featured him smoking marijuana. After showing footage from one of the rapper's music videos, she asked about his lyrics. Instagram: The two spoke their piece on air and the rapper posted a friendly photo of the two on his Instagram page . She said that though some of the lyrics are 'incredible,' some of his other lyrics glorify a lifestyle that small children should not be exposed to. The rapper was unfazed. 'I'm a great father, I just feel like, you know, everybody should basically take care of their own,' the father-of-two responded. 'It's about governing your own household, it's about taking care of your own property, it's about having some kind of structure.' Grace was adamant and even went as far as to quote 2 Chainz 'Feds Watching' lyrics in a hilarious display.

"A size 22 woman who was told she was too fat to have a baby after five years of trying to fall pregnant was finally able to conceive naturally after losing seven stone. Janette Pincott, 31, who suffers from Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome, and her husband Justin, 38, wanted nothing more than to become parents and applied for IVF. However, Janette, of Croespenmaen, near Cardiff, was told that at 21 stone, she was too overweight to undergo the treatment, dashing the couple's hopes of ever having children. Janette Pincott (pictured left with her husband Justin, and, right, after losing weight) was told that at 21st (left) she was too obese for IVF to be effective, so determined to have children she went on to lose 7st . Just six months after the birth of Charlie, pictured left, Janette discovered that she was pregnant with her second child Zachary who is now one-year-old, right . After hearing the devastating news, the mother-of-two made every effort to change her lifestyle, swapping greasy takeaways for fresh vegetables and soon started to lose weight. She also took up running, taking part in regular 5km runs. Janette dropped six dress sizes and was a slim size 10 - and, against the odds, went on to conceive and give birth to two baby boys.  In February 2012 Janette gave birth to her first son Charlie, now two. Amazingly, six months later she fell pregnant again. Her son Zachary, now one, was born in April 2013. Janette and Justin met each other on a night out in 2004, and, after a whirlwind eight-month romance, they bought a house together and made the decision to start trying for children. 'We spent five years trying, and it was just not happening. I was devastated,' Janette said. Janette (pictured with Justin) suffers from Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome meaning it was a struggle for her to achieve a child naturally, but Janette's weight meant she couldn't rely on medical help . Janette, pictured after losing weight, swapped her diet of chips and pizza for fresh fruit and salad . 'Every time I had to look at another failed pregnancy test I would cry - I was heartbroken. I wanted a child so badly, but I had no control over it.' Anxious that her dreams of a large family would never be realised, Janette, who works in a call centre, turned to medics for help. But she was faced with further disappointment after she was told that at 21 stone she was too obese for the IVF to be effective. Janette said that this was the final push she needed to finally start to lose weight. In 2011 after losing her first stone Janette was shocked to discover that she had fallen pregnant without the help of IVF. She is pictured here with her first child Charlie, now two . Janette said she knew she was overweight but she had never expected it to effect her ability to have a baby . 'When I came back from the doctors, I looked at a photograph of myself and decided I needed to go on a diet. 'I knew I was overweight but I never thought it would stand in the way of me getting pregnant. 'Doctors were telling me I was overweight but I didn't realise how disgusting I looked until I saw a picture taken at a recent party. 'I thought ""how on earth did I let myself get like that?"" I knew I had to do something immediately if I was to have a child.' Not only did her weight loss see her appearance dramatically change Janette was finally conceived the children she had always wanted. In 2011, after losing her first four stone, Mrs Pincott was shocked to discover that she had fallen pregnant without the help of IVF treatment. 'I didn't expect the weight loss to help me conceive naturally, but I kept taking pregnancy tests every month in the hope we would strike gold,' she said. 'I locked myself in the bathroom and hoped for the best. When I saw that the test was positive I nearly fell off the toilet - I took ten pregnancy tests to make sure. Breakfast: Janette would skip breakfast . Lunch: Cheesey chips and gravy from a chip shop . Dinner: A large Dominoes pizza for dinner . Snacks: Chocolate muffins and crisps . Breakfast: Porridge . Lunch: A whole wheat pasta and quorn salad . Dinner: A ham salad . Snacks: Janette snacks on fresh fruit throughout the day . 'Because I don't have periods I have to take a pregnancy test every month. Until I had my first scan at 12 weeks I didn't believe it.' Janette says that becoming pregnant once was a surprise enough and she was completely startled to find out she was expecting a second child. 'The second pregnancy was an even bigger shock than the first. We'd spent all that time trying but I couldn't get pregnant - then when I lost the weight it happened naturally without the need for IVF at all. 'It's a miracle. The doctors said that me losing weight probably helped me to conceive naturally, so I'm very proud of what I achieved. 'Your weight can have an effect on your fertility - I lost weight and I think it helped me get pregnant. 'I was eating unhealthy food and I was eating massive portions - once I had my diet under control the weight fell off.' Janette who now weighs 13st 5lbs, is determined not to slip back into bad habits and plans to take part in the Cardiff Half Marathon this year.","Janette Pincott had dreamed of having children with her husband Justin .

Tuite was not charged over the chase  but she faced court on a raft of unrelated offences. Whilst the 22-year-old man remained on the run, Tuite was arrested on the day of the toddler's tragic death. She was remanded in Darlinghurst, in possession of drugs methamphetamine (ice) and buprenorphine, near where the Audi had been dumped. Magistrate Les Mabbutt refused her bail application after hearing of Tuite's own reign of terror. Police prosecutors detailed her own personal crime spree over the past 18 months, including offences ranging from aggravated robbery, serious assault, stealing, possession of housebreaking equipment and providing police with more than 20 false names and information. Detectives working on the Constitution Hill case had been pursuing the 22-year-old suspect for a week and arrested him yesterday . Her distraught family have reached out to Tuite, assuring her they still love her and are devastated by the problems that drugs have allegedly brought into her life. ‘I love her so much,' her mother cried in an interview with 9News. 'Katie, don’t ever think I don’t love you,’ her mother pleaded in tears. Katie’s sister-in-law Samantha said they know there was still a chance the 23-year-old could turn her life around. 'We didn’t want it to be like this, we want her to change her life and start doing good,' she told 9News. 'We all know that she’s got the potential to do it.' Tuite's mother also cried when explaining how devastated she feels after the tragic death of toddler. ‘I’m so sorry… I wake up in the morning and see those baby’s eyes in my eyes,' she said. On Wednesday, Tuite, sporting tattoos on her arms and prison greens, appeared by video link at Central Local Court from inside Silverwater Jail, where she will remain until her next court appearance, set down for January 29. Lawyers for Tuite applied for bail but police prosecutors claimed 'the defendant's record extends over the last 18 months from August 29 last year and since there have been continuous offences. [She] continues to make choices with further undesirable people'. Magistrate Mabbutt said: 'The range of the offences [she has been charged with] are grave matters, the accused has a length history and has outstanding matters, the offences overall have to be considered serious. 'The accused has a history of violence,' he stated, adding that the offences would most likely lead to 'full-time custody' if she was found guilty. Magistrate Mabbutt went on to deny Tuite's bail application. Distraught friends of the toddler's family visited the house following her death last Friday .

"A woman has been put into isolation at Northampton General Hospital with a suspected case of Ebola, it has emerged. The hospital released few details about the patient last night but it is believed she had recently travelled abroad. A spokesman for the hospital said: 'I can confirm that we have a suspected case of Ebola. It is a female adult. She will be in isolation if she is suspected of having the illness.' Scroll down for video . The woman has been placed in an isolation unit at Northampton General Hospital (pictured) with what is suspected to be Ebola . The hospital spokesman said she was unable to provide further details about the identity of the woman or how she may have contracted the illness. It comes just two days after it was revealed the condition of Pauline Cafferkey had improved - the 39-year-old nurse was struck down by the virus after returning from Sierra Leone in west Africa. In recent months Northampton General Hospital has attempted to reassure the public it has plans in place to manage cases of Ebola in the event of an outbreak. A spokesman said: 'We have robust systems and processes which will ensure we are able to identify and isolate a patient who presents with symptoms of Ebola or any other infectious disease. 'We have sufficient supplies of personal protective equipment, and access to expert testing and advice. Pauline Cafferkey (pictured) was a volunteer with Save the Children in Sierra Leone but only became ill with Ebola after having returned to Britain . 'We would like to reassure local people that the risk of infection in the UK remains very low. 'Nevertheless we are being extremely vigilant and taking all appropriate measures to ensure we are fully prepared. Our plans are being kept under continuous review and amended as the situation changes.' Miss Cafferkey had been a volunteer with Save the Children at the Ebola Treatment Centre in Kerry Town but only became ill when she returned to Britain just after Christmas. After taking an experimental anti-viral drug and receiving blood plasma transfusions from a European Ebola survivor at the Royal Free Hospital in north London, her condition improved. A hospital spokesman said Monday: 'The Royal Free Hospital is pleased to announce that Pauline Cafferkey is showing signs of improvement and is no longer critically ill. 'She remains in isolation as she receives specialist care for the Ebola virus.' David Cameron welcomed the news during Prime Minister's Questions at the House of Commons. He said he was sure everybody was thinking of her, adding: 'It is very good news that she is out of critical care, but there is still a long way to go.' He was responding to Conservative Nicola Blackwood, who said: 'I'm sure the whole House will want to honour the bravery of NHS Ebola volunteers and welcome the news that nurse Pauline Cafferkey is off the critical list.' She also raised the work going on in Oxford to develop a vaccine, which the Tory leader called 'vitally important'. He added: 'The minister for government policy is leading the work on this and making sure we do everything to try and cut through some of the bureaucracy that otherwise would be in place so that we can develop a vaccine fast.' There are currently no specific drugs to cure Ebola, nor any approved vaccines to prevent the disease. Two experimental vaccines are currently being trialled on human volunteers in the UK, US, Mali and Uganda. Experts expect to see the first results of those trials early next year. The Royal Free Hospital is the only High Level Isolation Unit in the UK to house two high-security containment beds. They are located inside isolation 'bubbles' - specially-designed tents with controlled ventilation allowing medics to provide clinical care while containing the infection. Three other hospitals - The Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen University Hospital, Newcastle upon Tyne Royal Victoria Infirmary and Sheffield Teaching Hospitals - are designated centres for escalation if more patients are diagnosed with Ebola. There are around 50 other designated Ebola beds at these three centres. Around 45 per cent of those infected in the current outbreak have survived without treatment. ZMapp, developed by US biotech company Mapp Biopharmaceutical Inc, is manufactured in the leaves of genetically modified tobacco plants. The process could yield 20 to 40 doses a month. Evidence suggests that effective treatment with ZMapp requires three doses of 15 milligrams per kilogram of body weight. It is thought the blood of those who have survived the disease may contain antibodies, which can prove effective in fighting the disease. The nurse, from Cambuslang, South Lanarkshire, had volunteered with Save the Children at the Ebola Treatment Centre in Kerry Town, Sierra Leone, before returning to the UK. Save the Children has launched an investigation into how she was infected, but admits it may never establish the exact circumstances. She flew back to the UK via Casablanca in Morocco. Her temperature was tested seven times before she flew from Heathrow to Glasgow and she was cleared to travel. She later became feverish and followed advice given to her at Heathrow to contact local services and was admitted to an isolation facility at the Brownlee unit in Gartnavel Hospital, Glasgow, at 8am on December 29. After a blood sample tested positive for Ebola, she was transferred in a military plane to the Royal Free Hospital by 8am on December 30.","Woman believed to have recently been abroad has been placed in isolation .

"There are calls for outspoken MP Fred Nile to resign after he said the only 'man' inside the Lindt cafe siege was gunman Man Monis. The Christian Democrat MLC told Sunrise this morning: 'Usually men try to protect the women but it looks like the men were trying to protect their own skins. 'Where were the men? The only ""man"" really there was the man with the gun.' Asked about his remarks in an interview with Daily Mail Australia, Rev. Nile said he 'misspoke'. 'I wanted to say he was a cowardly man. I left the word cowardly out. '(He was) hiding behind the shotgun. I was certainly not complimenting him.' Scroll down for video . 'The only ""man"" really there was the man with the gun': Reverend Fred Nile made controversial remarks on breakfast program Sunrise this morning . Reverend Nile, pictured, had argued that the men who fled the Sydney siege should not receive bravery awards. Scroll down for video . Gunman: Man Monis held 18 people hostage for more than 16 hours at the Lindt cafe in Martin Place . In a follow-up tweet, he said: 'The terrorist was a coward. The real Man was the man WRESTLING with the gun.' Rev. Nile had already sparked controversy earlier this week by declaring that none of the men who fled the Lindt cafe should receive bravery awards. Around 10am on December 15, Man Monis held up 18 people and kept them hostage for more than sixteen hours at the Martin Place cafe. He forced many of them to hold the black Islamic Shahada flag in the cafe's window throughout the ordeal. Two people - barrister Katrina Dawson and cafe manager Tori Johnson - were killed at the siege's bloody end. Mr Nile told Fairfax Radio earlier this week that Ms Dawson and Mr Johnson should be the only hostages given awards. ‘They should get recognition for what they suffered as hostages but I don't think they should get bravery awards,’ Mr Nile said. Victims: Tori Johnson (left) and Katrina Dawson (right) were killed during the siege . New South Wales MLC Fred Nile believed that male hostages who fled the Sydney siege should not receive bravery awards . 'Even the men who fled leaving women behind': This tweet posted by Fred Nile's team sparked controversy earlier this week. He later expanded on his remarks in an interview with Fairfax Radio . Terrifying visage: Man Monis was pictured by Channel 7 cameras lingering in the cafe window early on in the siege . ‘Maybe they could have done something more to protect the women. ‘Normally bravery awards are given for an act of bravery - that somebody actually does something. They haven't done anything.’ Mr Nile also argued that it would only lessen the worth of bravery awards to provide them to those male hostages who fled. Fellow state MP Alex Greenwich this morning tweeted: ""The only man inside the Lindt Cafe siege at Martin Place was the man holding the gun"" - He should resign for this comment'. 'Fred Nile has offended the Christian values he allegedly represents by using this tragedy ahead of an election & cruelly insulting victims'. Men and women flee the Lindt Cafe in Martin Place during the Sydney siege last December . Mr Nile said the male hostages that fled the from siege did not deserve bravery awards . During the siege itself, the ABC reported Rev. Nile was among many Sydney residents to gather near Martin Place, a short walk from NSW State Parliament. Prime Minister Tony Abbott earlier this week requested Governor-General Sir Peter Cosgrove support a push to honour the victims, surviving hostages and emergency services with bravery awards. Thousands of people, including the Prime Minister, Premier and Rev. Nile, laid flowers at Martin Place after the siege. A coronial inquest examining the siege presided by State Coroner Michael Barnes will begin later this month, on January 29. NSW Premier Mike Baird has announced that a permanent memorial will be established in Martin Place by the first anniversary of the siege. It will include a permanent garden.","Fred Nile on Sydney siege: 'The only man really there was the man with the gun'

"Jo Coburn accepted £2,500 from Brent City Council for holding events about £54million budget cuts . The presenter of the BBC’s Daily Politics is being paid £2,500 by a Labour-run council – for chairing meetings on how to cut its budget by £54million. Residents expressed astonishment that Jo Coburn had received such a fee from cash-strapped Brent Council. The 46-year-old mother of two, who presents the weekday current affairs programme on BBC2, chaired two consultation meetings at the council’s civic centre in Wembley, north-west London, on Tuesday. Her involvement came hours before her director-general, Lord Hall, reminded the corporation’s staff to act ‘without fear or favour’ yesterday. Sujata Aurora, a community campaigner who attended one of the council meetings, said: ‘With the greatest respect to Jo Coburn, is there no council officer who’s capable of chairing a couple of meetings? It seems that yet again Brent Council has a very skewed sense of priorities. ‘We’ve already had a 25 per cent increase in councillor allowances, £100,000 spent on an opening ceremony for the civic centre and £700,000 spent on laying granite outside the civic centre … they’ve got to get a grip on spending money on ridiculous things like this when they’re cutting services to vulnerable people.’ A TaxPayers’ Alliance spokesman added: ‘At a meeting to discuss savings, it does seem strange to spend a four-figure sum to bring in a chair, despite Jo Coburn’s undoubted experience as a well-regarded broadcaster. ‘The council has to provide a far fuller explanation of why this spending was approved, particularly in the context of a multi-million-pound savings programme.’ Cuts proposed by the council for the next two years include pulling funding to youth services, shutting a sports centre and cutting back on children’s centres and respite care. A day care centre for disabled residents is also under threat. The council claims it has been forced into the cuts by central government, which has cut its funding by half. The BBC will not give in to ‘naked bullying’ from its critics, Tony Hall said yesterday. The corporation’s director-general insisted that as May’s election approaches, his organisation must cover political issues ‘without fear or favour’. Referring to the BBC’s next Charter Review in 2017, which will see the licence fee come up for renegotiation, Lord Hall told staff: ‘There may be some – I hope only a few – who try and use the impending Charter Review to influence our coverage of politics in this most sensitive of political years. 'We will never let that happen, because to do so would betray the public and the ideals of the BBC.’ He admitted: ‘We will get things wrong – it’s inevitable – and we will reflect and put things right where we have. But we will never confuse justifiable complaints with naked bullying.’ He called on the corporation’s workers to help make the case for the BBC by ‘spending every penny’ of the £145.50 licence fee ‘as if it were your own’. Council leader Muhammed Butt said: ‘Ms Coburn is a powerful independent voice and an expert chair. 'She will bring a wealth of knowledge and experience to look carefully and objectively at the budget savings proposals being considered by the cabinet, and to provide honest and independent advice on the whole budget process. This is in addition to hosting two consultation events with the public. He added: ‘It is extremely important for councillors to get the views of residents, community groups and voluntary groups when making difficult budget decisions imposed on us by severe reductions to our government grant. 'For this we are paying £2,500 which I believe represents value for money, considering the importance of the council having to save £54million.’ A BBC spokesperson said: ""Jo was an independent chair for these events, during which she questioned and cross examined council members remaining neutral and impartial, just as she does in her role on the Daily Politics. Acting as a neutral chair of a public debate is not a breach of BBC editorial guidelines.'

"They're showered with gifts wherever they go but not all the items presented to the Royal Family are quite what most would imagine. Among the more unusual items  lavished on the royals, which were revealed in a list released by Buckingham Palace, were tins of tuna, model missiles and a supermarket's worth of mangoes. Many of the mangoes were presented to Prince Andrew, who is famously fond of the fruit, although Princess Anne was also given a box of 100 by the president of Pakistan, Mamnoon Hussain. Scroll down for video . Global giving: The Royal Family has received items from all over the world, some unusual . Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall received the largest number of gifts, amassing 176 over the course of the year, followed by the Earl and Countess of Wessex who were given 136. The Queen was presented with 102 different items, Princess Anne got 135 presents and Prince Andrew was gifted with 107. Prince Philip got the fewest gifts and was presented with just 19, among them a gold brooch and silver spoon from the Lord Mayor of London and joint present of a case of beer from the Cotleigh Brewery and Go Commando charity. Many of the more unusual gifts were picked up during overseas tours, with the Duke of York being presented with a model of a dhow boat during his visit to Kuwait in May and a miniature Volkswagen Beetle in Germany in June. During their tour of Mexico and Colombia at the end of October, the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall were presented with a total of 43 gifts, among them a pair of maracas, a poncho and a packet of dried beef. A gift fit for a Queen! Her Majesty is presented with a wooden plaque by Sierra Leonese athletes in Glasgow . Presents: Prince Charles was given a considerable number of gifts in Mexico including a packet of dried beef . He definitely liked it! In Colombia, Charles was given a traditional sombrero vueltiao (pictured) The Earl and Countess of Wessex were the recipients of some of the most eccentric gifts, with the couple handed a jar of passion fruit jam by a well-wisher in Barbados last January and several tins of canned fish during a trip to Brandt Louie in Canada in December. Also given to the Wessexes was a biography of Usain Bolt which was presented to them by the Jamaican sprinter himself, and a stone which was given to them by a well-wisher during a visit to the Clearwell Caves in Gloucestershire. Some of the most impressive gifts were presented to the Queen, including a 15-piece set of Sèvres porcelain handed to the monarch by President François Hollande of France during her visit to the country in June. The French premier also presented the Queen with a set of Hermès photo albums containing pictures of Her Majesty during previous visits to France, a white porcelain sculpture of a horse and a copy of the French edition of the London News dating from 1843 and featuring Queen Victoria. More unusual items included a model of the infamous Iron Throne of Game of Thrones fame, a book about the Eurotunnel and a silver box containing soil from World War I battlefields. Many of the gifts presented to the Queen came from ambassadors and were given as the diplomats presented Her Majesty with their credentials. Such gifts include a Bumbung Perak Pahat Tumbuk jewellery case presented by Major General Dato Paduka Seri Haji Ami of Brunei Darussalam, a silver tray from Cambodia's Meas Kim Heng and a sculpture of a Bengal tiger from High Commissioner Mohamed Mijarul Quayes of Bangladesh. Tempting though keeping some of the gifts might be, Buckingham Palace is at pains to point out that none of the royals are allowed to keep the presents for themselves. 'Official gifts are not the private property of the member of the Royal Family who receives them but are instead received in an official capacity in the course of official duties,' explains a palace source. 'Perishables such as food may be personally used or consumed, while other gifts may be used or displayed  in royal residences and on royal estates or become part of the Royal Collection.' Lavish: President François Hollande of France gave the Queen a 15-piece set of Sèvres porcelain . Miniature: During a visit to the Game of Thrones set in Belfast, the Queen was given a model Iron Throne . All official gifts presented to the Queen automatically become part of the Royal Collection and are either displayed in the royal palaces themselves or are loaned out to museums and galleries. Some gifts, however, have had to find more permanent homes, among them the animals presented to the Queen over the course of her reign. These include several horses, among them Burmese who was presented to the Queen by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and ridden by Her Majesty at the Trooping the Colour from 1969 to 1986. More exotic animals are given to London Zoo, among them jaguars and sloths from Brazil, two black beavers from Canada  and a seven-year-old bull elephant called Jumbo which arrived in the UK from Cameroon in 1972. Presents from Kuwait: During his most recent trip to the Gulf state, Prince Andrew was given a model dhow . Unusual: During a visit to Canada in December, Edward and Sophie were given tins of fish .

"Comedian Al Murray has revealed he plans to stand for Parliament at the general election  - against Ukip leader Nigel Farage. The 'Pub Landlord' said he will stand in Thanet South, Kent, for his newly-formed Free United Kingdom Party. Explaining his decision to stand, The Pub Landlord said: 'It seem to me that the UK is ready for a bloke waving a pint around, offering common sense solutions.' Scroll down for video . The 'Pub Landlord' said he will stand in Thanet South, Kent, for his newly-formed Free United Kingdom Party . His comment will not be lost on many of those familiar with Mr Farage who is often pictured during impromptu lunchtime photocalls with a drink in his hand in a pub. Oxford-educated Murray has created an action plan in the guise of his patriotic character, in which he promises: 'I pledge that the UK will leave Europe by 2025 and the edge of the Solar System by 2050. Common Market sense. 'In the meantime Greece to be bought and operated by Kent County Council. Couldn't be worse. Someone to do the bins at least.' In a video posted online he explained: 'Let it be known that like many of the Parliamentary hopefuls in the forthcoming election, I have no idea where South Thanet is - but did that stop Margaret Thatcher from saving the Falkland Islands? No.' Murray, 46, is standing in a constituency which the Conservative Party won from Labour at the previous election in 2010. It is already the focus of huge attention due to Mr Farage's decision to stand there as UKIP experiences a surge of support and now has two Parliamentary seats.

His decision to stand comes two years after fellow comic Simon Brodkin - known for his character Lee Nelson - handed in nomination papers to stand in a by-election at South Shields, for David Miliband's former seat. He went on to withdraw later the same day. Other proposals include his pledge on law and order: 'Unemployment causes crime: I propose to lock up the unemployed. Common sense.' And on the hot topic of immigration, he says: 'Of course the reason they are coming here is because this is the greatest country in the world. The only way to stop them is for a government to change that and make things a whole lot worse. Look no further. 'However, in the meantime, we brick up the Channel Tunnel. With British bricks. Probably have to get some Poles in to do it. Common sense.' In his online address, Murray explains: 'The reason I'm standing is because the system is broken, we all know it is. You hear people saying 'you shouldn't vote'. Well you should vote boys and girls, you should vote for me.' He also promises '1p a pint', although 'crisps will remain at the current price'.

"House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is set to appoint a Muslim lawmaker to the Intelligence Committee, congressional aides said Tuesday, giving him access to some of America's most closely held secrets in the war on terror. The move will come as the world is still grappling with an al-Qaeda death squad's massacre last week of journalists at the French satire magazine Charlie Hebdo, executed because they had published a cartoon of the Muslim prophet Muhammad. Rep. André Carson has attracted suspicion for his public statements, including a 2012 Islamic Circle of North America convention where he said America's schools should be modelled after Qur'anic madrassas. Moments later he warned undercover law enforcement skulking around the event looking for 'secret meetings' that 'Allah will not allow you to stop us.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Rep. Andre Carson told a Muslim conference in 2012 that American schools should follow the model of Islamic madrassas and warned undercover law enforcement that 'Allah will not allow you to stop us' FRIEND OF BARACK: President Obama took Carson with him on Air Force One in May 2011 when he spoke about transportation policy in Indianapolis; he's a reliable voice on the Democratic party's left flank and one of only two Muslim members of Congress . Carson, a former police officer, represents Indiana's 7th District, an urban area that includes most of Indianapolis. He is one of only two Muslim members of Congress, the other being Minnesota Democrat Keith Ellison. Voters sent him to Congress in a 2008 special election following the death of his grandmother, who held the seat before him. He was already a member of the House Armed Services subcommittee on intelligence, and once worked for the Department of Homeland Security’s 'Fusion Center' – a data-sharing hub that merges intelligence collected by the CIA, the FBI, the Pentagon and the Justice Department. But his elevation to the House Intelligence Committee, first reported by Politico, will cause rumbles among lawmakers who charge that the U.S. government – particularly the Obama administration – has studiously avoided linking Islam with the steady stream of deadly attacks that plague Europe, Africa and the Middle East. At the 2012 Islamic convention in Hartford, Connecticut, Carson said that 'America will never tap into educational innovation and ingenuity without looking at the model that we have in our madrassas, in our schools, where innovation is encouraged, where the foundation is the Qu'ran.' 'And that model that we are pushing in some of our schools meets the multiple needs of students.' He drew applause when he acknowledged the presence of undercover federal law enforcement in the audience – agents who were drawn to the event because of the high concentration of Muslim leaders. 'There are over 7 million Muslims in this country,' Carson told the crowd. 'And while we are under attack, we cannot retreat.' 'It's unfortunate that there are those who are thinking that, at this convention right now, we're having secret meetings, that we're plotting to destroy this country. But I say to those who are here undercover: Allah will not allow you to stop us.' After the speech made headlines, Carson's office released a statement saying he was misunderstood – and meant his remarks as a broad endorsement of religious education. 'Faith-based schools throughout this country have excelled because of innovative instructional methods and a willingness to engage different learning styles – whether visual, auditory, or kinesthetic,' he said. 'While I do not believe that any particular faith should be the foundation of our public schools, it is important that we take note of the instructional tools these schools utilize to empower their young people. Christian, Jewish, and Islamic schools have experienced notable success by casting off a one-size-fits-all approach to education, and this is a model we must replicate.' Carson was raised in a Baptist family, attended parochial schools, and converted to Islam as an adult in 1998. MADAME MINORITY LEADER: Nancy Pelosi, a former House speaker and the chamber's highest ranking Democrat, has reportedly decided to give Carson a slot on the all-knowing intelligence committee . Although he was quick to backtrack on his advice about madrassas, Carson has never publicly addressed his comments about violent extremism and law enforcement's ability to stop it. Carson's press secretary did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In a Huffington Post interview two months ago, he reflected on his time as a police officer assigned to track terrorism and conduct counter-intelligence. 'What I learned is that in the U.S., as in the UK, it is impossible to fight the threat of global terror without help from Muslims,' the congressman said. 'But there is a problem with institutional bigotry.' Carson also claimed that 'xenophobia has become exacerbated because of extremist elements [within Islam], but I still say that Muslims have to take control of our own destiny and to reclaim our destiny we have to engage in a political process.'","Indiana Democratic Rep.

"An ambulance crew left the body of a dead man on the floor rather than take it to a mortuary, so they could finish their shift on time, an inquest has heard. James Harrison collapsed and died in a Cambridgeshire street in the early hours of September 24. The crew - who were due to finish their night shift at 6am - arrived at the scene at 5.30am, after he was found by a milkman. They were unable to save him, an inquest held in Chatteris,Cambridgeshire, heard today. Instead of extending their 15-hour shift to transport Mr Harrison's body to the mortuary at Addenbrooke's hospital, the crew took him to nearby Ely ambulance station and left the body to be collected by an undertaker. The undertaker never arrived and it was not until after 8am that another ambulance crew was sent to take him to hospital. The ambulance crew, who were from across the border in Norfolk, claim they were told by colleagues it was 'common practice' in the Ely area to leave deceased bodies at the ambulance station - providing there was police consent. An inquest into the death of James Harrison, 32, found his body was taken to Ely ambulance station and left overnight after he died and collapsed in a Cambridgeshire street on September 24 . David Glenton, centre, attended the incident along with first responder Dharamendra Narotam, left . Opening the inquest, coroner William Morris rejected an application from lawyers for the East of England Ambulance Service to restrict the inquest to the death itself and not the circumstances which followed. He said it was in the public interest to consider the 'indignity, distress and possibility of forensic evidence being compromised' by the delays. Mr Morris concluded that Mr Harrison's death was an accident, the result of taking a cocktail of prescribed anti-depressants and insomnia medication. Paramedic Steve Hibbitt, who investigated the incident, said crews in that area had failed to take bodies straight to hospital on seven previous occasions. On two occasions bodies had been left on the floor and on five occasions in the back of an ambulance. The inquest heard paramedics David Glenton and Ann-Marie Poole from 30 miles away in Downham Market, Norfolk, attended the incident along with first responder Dharamendra Narotam. Mr Harrison was pronounced dead at 5.53am - just before Mr Glenton and Ms Poole were due to finish their shift. Despite the fact they were already working overtime, the pair said they were happy to transport the body to hospital, Mr Hibbitt said. But Mr Narotam suggested the body could be left at the ambulance station and collected later. Mr Glenton did not question this decision. He told the inquest: 'He made it sound like it was common practice.' Mr Hibbitt added: 'The crew were not familiar with this procedure but were advised it was a normal local practice and several bodies had been left in this way before. 'The responder did not feel he was doing anything inappropriate and that he was doing something respectful by covering him in clean sheets.' James Harrison's family are pictured leaving today's inquest in Chatteris, Cambridgeshire . The inquest heard the ambulance crew were due to finish their 15-hour shift but were prepared to take Mr Harrison's body to the mortuary at Addenbrooke's Hospital (pictured). But instead, a colleague told them it was 'common practice' to leave bodies at the station . East of England ambulance chiefs were accused last night of risking patients’ lives to meet response time targets. The trust may have hastened the deaths of dozens of desperately ill people by downgrading emergency call-outs to non-urgent. This freed them from hitting a response time target of eight minutes. East of England Ambulance Service admits that 8,324 patients had their cases reclassified in this way in a two-month period last year. At least 57 were not taken to hospital and died. Some of those downgraded had a terminal illness or a ‘do not resuscitate’ order. It emerged last night that another major ambulance trust – Yorkshire – is also suspected of recategorising thousands of urgent cases. Managers made the calls ‘non-urgent’ when they realised ambulances were not going to reach patients inside the eight-minute window. Denise Burke, of the Norfolk-based campaign group Action on Ambulances, said: ‘They are playing Russian roulette with patients’ lives. ‘What is most shocking with East Anglia is the way patients who were near the end of life were treated. They were deciding on patients’ quality of life and whether they died then or in dignity a few months later. ‘Any of those families will be questioning whether their loved ones’ lives could have been extended by a few months.’ An internal investigation by East of England Ambulance Service found that in January and February last year managers agreed to downgrade calls involving terminally ill patients. Rather than being sent an ambulance within eight minutes, these patients were made to wait between 20 and 50 minutes. And in some cases ambulances crews were not sent at all and relatives were just given advice on the phone. The guidance had not been approved by the trust’s most senior management and was flagged up by concerned staff. Anthony Marsh, the ambulance service’s chief executive, said he immediately launched an investigation and ordered the reversal of the changes. He explained it was not ambulance service policy to do this but it was not uncommon for local crews to follow different and sometimes outdated procedures which also depend on police and coroner's practices. 'This may be due to lack of knowledge of accepted practice but may also be due to staff taking short cuts,' he said. Mr Narotam said police agreed with the decision to leave the body at the station. He said: 'I suggested that that we move the body out of the public eye and place it at Ely Ambulance Station if they were happy with that. 'There were many police officers of different ranks on duty. 'I mentioned that in the past we had removed deceased bodies back to Ely Ambulance Station without any problems. 'It was agreed with the police that we would do that. On arrival I opened the garage doors so the ambulance could back up to it. 'I put out clean sheets on the garage floor so we could out the deceased body bag onto it and covered it. 'At no point was the deceased left alone. 'The ambulance crew finished their shift at 6am. I believe the crew would not have had an issue had they have been asked to drop the body off at the mortuary. 'I was planning on taking the body to the mortuary but the day shift crew started at 8am so they were dispatched to take the body.' Mr Harrison's family were not informed about the incident until it was reported by the press when a whistle-blower claimed the body had been left by bins at the station. Mother Diane Harrison said she knew her son was on prescribed medication. She added: 'I was extremely shocked to learn he was dead. 'He would have not have done this on purpose, he would not have left me on my own.' Tracy Nicholls, director of clinical quality at the East of England Ambulance Service, said: 'We apologise wholeheartedly to the family for the distress this incident has caused - it should never have happened. 'The trust has carried out a full investigation into this matter and it is clear that incorrect decisions were made and the trust's procedures were not followed. 'As a result of this we immediately sent out an instruction to staff that such a practice is not acceptable and must not happen.' The members of staff involved are subject to an ongoing investigation, she added.","James Harrison collapsed and died in a Cambridgeshire street at 5.53am .

"Despite smartphones getting thinner and faster, they still fall foul of bad reception. But a new Reach79 case claims to solve the problem of signal dropping out, by up to doubling a device’s signal strength. This is possible thanks to a thin gold antenna that is built into the plastic case to provide better coverage, faster data speed and longer battery life, the Californian company claims. No more black spots! A new case by Reach79 claims to solve the frustrating problem of reception dropping out, by up to doubling a device’s signal strength. It contains a gold antenna and is currently available for the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus handsets . The iPhone case was unveiled at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, where its makers claimed it’s the first one that can optimise a smartphone’s performance. ‘Powered by patented antenna technology, Reach79 cases are the first performance-enhancing smartphone cases designed for speed,’ said David Vigil, CEO of the Encinitas-based firm. ‘Each case is embedded with a micro-thin, gold-plated antenna that works to increase your smartphone’s signal strength so your phone can do more for you.’ A thin gold antenna is sandwiched between two layers of plastic, one with protective rubber cushioning (pictured). The metal shows through the outer plastic layer to make a pattern. The combined antenna system creates superior signal reception, which enables the device to work more efficiently, the company claims . The antenna inside each case is engineered to automatically join together with an iPhone's antennas, through a process called ‘passive coupling’. The idea is that this combined antenna system creates superior signal reception and transmission, which enables the device to work more efficiently. The case costs $60 (£40) for an iPhone 6 and $70 (£46) for an iPhone 6 Plus. More colours and cases for other models are planned to launch . The multiplying effect is intended to work when the phone is held to the ear or in the hand, not when it is left lying on a surface. Tests have shown that the case improves a phone’s signal strength by an average of 1.6 times, doubling it at peak performance. But when Walt Mossberg of Recode tested the case for a week in a variety of locations around Washington DC, he experienced mixed results. ‘Roughly half the time it seemed to help, sometimes by a little and sometimes by a lot. And roughly half the time it made no difference at all,’ he wrote. ‘On a few occasions, it actually degraded the performance of my iPhone 6.’ The company concedes that the case’s performance depends on the phone, its carrier and location, but that consumers should see benefits including faster data speeds for web browsing and streaming music, for example, and wider coverage for less dropped calls. It also claims that because the smartphone doesn’t have to work as hard to maintain signal, its battery will last longer. The case, which weighs 1.27 ounces (36g) is made from thin plastic with a rubbery cushion around its edges and claims to offer protection against drops up to 6.6ft (two metres). Cut-way sections expose the gold antenna which is sandwiched between the plastic layers. The case is currently only available for the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus and costs $60 (£40) and $70 (£46) respectively. It comes in black, but more colours will be added this spring as well as cases for other handsets. When the Reach79 case, which contains a gold antenna, is snapped on, the phone and the case are instantly paired together to form a combined antenna system with improved signal strength. The case uses a common antenna engineering trick known as the ‘aperture coupled patch’ to transfer energy from the iPhone’s antenna to connect with the gold-plated antenna inside the case. The technique is indirect way of feeding the antenna in the case because there’s no electrical connection. A ‘hole’ in the Reach79 antenna directs energy from the iPhone into the antenna in the case, which is engineered to resonate at mobile phone frequencies, so the coupled energy is re-transmitted.","Protective plastic case contains a thin gold antenna to boost reception .

"Paramedic Richard Senior (pictured) and colleague Andrew Rowley were suspended for a year after boasting about their sex lives to female colleagues . Two paramedics have been banned from working for 12 months after subjecting female colleagues to lewd comments and sexual antics. Richard Senior repeatedly asked a lesbian paramedic ‘when am I going to be your sperm donor?’ He also tried to set up a ‘foursome’ involving the same woman and her ex-partner, a disciplinary hearing was told. The former Club 18 to 30 holiday rep ‘crossed the line’ by boasting about his past sexual conquests at meal breaks as well as with patients. He also openly displayed a ‘sexually explicit’ photograph on the home screen of his mobile phone showing him involved in a sex act. Senior made matters worse by breaking rules concerning the use of sirens and blue lights during call outs, the Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC) Conduct and Competence Committee was told. Ambulance service policy was to use the sirens and lights on emergencies unless instructed otherwise by the control room, but he repeatedly used his discretion by telling colleagues to turn them off. In one call-out, Senior drove at just 30mph without lights or sirens only to discover ‘a non-serious incident actually turned out to be serious.’ Andrew Rowley, a paramedic also based at the ambulance station in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, was accused of making a host of rude and distasteful comments and gestures towards colleagues. He allegedly behaved like a bully by telling a newly qualified medic she was ‘useless’ - causing her to have time off with stress. Senior (pictured), who with Rowley was based in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, also openly displayed a photograph showing him involved in a sex act on the home screen of his mobile phone . When the lesbian colleague – described as Colleague A - was mistaken for a man by an elderly patient, Rowley told her ‘it doesn’t matter…I’d still do you.’ The men were said to be ‘worse when they were together.’ They were split up and given final written warnings by Yorkshire Ambulance Service bosses following complaints in 2013. But the healthcare regulator’s disciplinary committee this week suspended them from working as paramedics for 12 months. Senior, who has worked for the ambulance service for nine years, had five misconduct allegations against him found ‘proved.’ His behaviour was a ‘serious departure from the standards expected of a Paramedic’ and the panel expressed concern that he failed to show remorse or understand his ‘attention-seeking’ behaviour crossed professional boundaries with patients. The panel described Rowley’s behaviour as ‘bullying and intimidatory.’ His offences were said to be ‘serious and not isolated incidents.’ Rowley, who worked for the ambulance service for 10 years, had four allegations against him ‘proved.’ He continued to deny most of the accusations but had quit the profession and no longer worked as a paramedic. Senior, 43, of Dewsbury, refused to comment when contacted at home yesterday. The panel heard that he boasted about the number of women he ‘had had’ during his time working as a holiday rep. One witness said Senior discussed his former jobs with patients – who were ‘always female’ – and chatted about his ‘sexual conquests.’ A West Yorkshire ambulance. Rowley allegedly behaved like a bully by telling a newly qualified medic she was ‘useless’ - causing her to have time off with stress (file picture) The paramedic was heard to make ‘noises of a sexual nature’ during his recollections of life as a Club 18 to 30 rep. He denied the inappropriate conversations, but told the panel patients often asked him about his pre-paramedic career and when he mentioned his work as a holiday rep they tended to make assumptions about his sex life and prowess. Another female colleague told the hearing how Senior made comments about visualising her breast feeding when she returned from maternity leave and telling her ‘I don’t know why I never banged you when you were younger.’ Detailed evidence was given about his inappropriate behaviour towards Colleague A. She was said to be embarrassed by his references to her sexuality as she didn’t like talking about her private life. Commenting on claims he repeatedly suggested a foursome, Senior said it was Colleague A who made the suggestion at his 40th birthday party when they were both drunk. Witnesses recalled another incident in which Colleague A was the subject of his inappropriate comments. Senior was taking a regular male patient into a hospital accident and emergency department. This patient had previously made comments about liking Colleague A and Senior allegedly said to her ‘it’s not such a bad thing he’s after you, it might get you back on the fellas.’ Publicly drawing attention to her sexuality was said to cause her ‘much upset.’","One witness said Richard Senior also discussed sex life with  patients .

Afterwards, they took a plaster cast of a large footprint they said they found in the snow. Eyewitness Ludmila Hristoforova who spoke to local television said: 'The creature was big, looking like a bear, but not a bear. From the door we've seen something big and shaggy.' Homeowner Andrei Kazarian said: 'I heard footsteps and we were pretty sure there was no one else around because we knew for sure everyone else was inside the house.

"After indicating to confidantes last week that he'd changed his mind and now want to compete in the 2016 contest for the Oval Office, former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney set to work this week shoring up donations in already-announced GOP candidate Jeb Bush's backyard. Romney has been reaching out to top Florida fundraisers, theTampa Bay Times reports, trying to woo them away from fellow establishment Republican Bush, the former governor of the Sunshine State. He'll also make an appearance at the Republican National Committee's winter meeting in San Diego, California. Bush is still the only GOP politician to have ceremoniously announced that he is gearing up for a presidential bid. Rand Paul's hiring on Tuesday of a campaign manager cleared up any remaining doubts that the Kentucky Senator is planning to get in, however, and Chris Christie's reported plans to launch a political action committee suggest that he's building up a campaign infrastructure, as well. Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, right, hugs N.J. Gov. Chris Christie on the floor of the House Chamber at the Statehouse in Boston before inaugural ceremonies for Charlie Baker earlier this month. Romney recently indicated that he may compete in the 2016 contest. Christie will presumably enter the race, as well . OUT: House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Paul Ryan. Ryan, left, the party's last vice presidential nominee, said this week that he will not seek the presidency in 2016 and will work to shape GOP policy as head of the powerful House panel. IN: Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul. Paul hired a campaign manager for his not-yet-announced presidential bid on Tuesday, all but confirming that he'll seek the GOP nomination in 2016 . These days the list of high-profile Republicans vying for the presidency is longer than the list of those who aren't. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, former California Sen. candidate Carly Fiorina, outgoing Texas Gov. Rick Perry, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, who resigned from Fox News earlier this month, have all indicated interest in participating in the GOP bloodbath next year. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, reelected in November to his second term after overcoming a recall early on in his first, may also make a play for 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. He has hired at handful of top Republican campaign staffers ahead of a possible bid. Definitively not running are Ohio Sen. Rob Portman, South Dakota Sen. John Thune and Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan. Ryan was floated as a possible 2016 candidate after playing second string to Romney in 2012 as his running mate. But once he was officially offered the gavel of the powerful House Ways and Means committee for at least the next two years with an option to stay on as chairman for two more years after that, speculation died down, and on Monday he formally withdrew himself from consideration. Despite losing the presidency to Barack Obama in the 2012 general election after having failed in 2008 to make it past the GOP primary, Romney remains Republican primary voters' first choice in early states such as Iowa. A poll conducted by Gravis marketing this month found that 21 percent of registered Iowa Republicans would pick Romney all over again as the GOP nominee if their state's caucus were held now. Bush came in second with 14 percent, Walker in third with 10 percent, Huckabee in fourth with nine percent, Rand Paul in fifth with eight percent, and Cruz was close behind with seven percent. Christie and Rubio made up the rear with five and four percent, respectively. A telling 18 percent said they were still undecided about who they would support a year out from contest. Republican Party officials seem less than enthused about a third Romney run than the average voter, however. 'I would be surprised if he gets much traction,' Mark Lundberg, chairman of the Iowa's Sioux County Republican Party, told the New York Times. Matt Moore, chairman of South Carolina's Republican Party, warned that Romney would have to start from scratch in his state and shouldn't expect a coronation. 'South Carolina Republicans want Governor Romney to make his case compared to our other talented candidates,' Moore said. 'No one is going to hand the nomination to Governor Romney on a silver platter.' New Jersey Governor Chris Christie gives the annual State of the State address on Tuesday in Trenton, New Jersey. Christie's repeated references to America's place in the world and Washington politicians have politicos believing that Christie has already made up his mind about running for president, too . A presumed candidate, Christie has said he won't make a final decision about a 2016 bid until this spring. But references to America's place in the world in his State of the State address on Tuesday have politicos believing that Christie has already made up his mind, too. 'America’s leadership in the world is called into question because of a pattern of indecision and inconsistency,' Christie told his constituents. 'During this time of uncertainty, it seems our leaders in Washington would rather stoke division for their own political gain,' he added, taking a not-so-subtle jab at his potential GOP challengers who hail from the U.S. Senate. As head of the Republican Governor's Association Christie was able to mask his national travel as part of his political responsibilities. Chairman no more, having handed stepped aside in November to make way for Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam, Christie is left with fewer explanations, besides his presidential ambitions, for travel outside his state. Today he is in South Carolina - a key presidential primary state - and Friday he will visit Iowa. Coupled with a New York Times report that that Christie will soon launch a PAC and news that the RNC's fundraising chief is leaving the national party to join Christie's political operation, the New Jersey governor's candidacy is now all but certain. Paul's recent moves leave little to the imagination about his plans in 2016, as well. Yesterday the freshman senator hired GOP strategist Chip Englander to oversee his political operation and serve as manager on his forthcoming presidential campaign. 'America has intractable problems and it’s going to take a transformational leader to fix them,' Englander told the Washington Post. 'Senator Paul is going to be the bold, transformational figure in this race.' Englander most recently served as campaign manager on Bruce Rauner’s successful campaign for Illinois governor. A half dozen other respected political operatives have also joined the staff of Paul's PAC in the last several months. FLORIDA FACE-OFF: Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush has already confirmed that he's gearing up for a presidential bid. That presents a problem for fellow Floridian and Sen. Marco Rubio, who's also interested in running next year . Today Paul is skipping an annual retreat for GOP lawmakers for events in New Hampshire, another significant primary state. With plans to sit out the confab, Paul amped up his attacks this week on fellow Republicans also eyeing the presidency. In an interview with Politico Paul said it was 'silly' for Rubio to say he was the 'chief cheerleader of Obama’s foreign policy' because he agreed with the president on the easing of tensions with Cuba. 'We could ask the same [of Rubio,' Paul said. ' ""Is he the biggest cheerleader of Obama’s immigration policy?"" That’s childish.' Paul accused Bush and the presidents in his family who came before him, father George H.W. and brother George W., of favoring 'more Washington control.' 'He’s been a proponent of Common Core, a proponent probably of a much bigger government — a Big Government Republican who believes more things should be occurring in Washington rather than decentralization,' Paul said of Jeb. Romney, he said, 'wasn’t able to attract a big enough constituency to win, and there was every opportunity to win last time.' 'Time for some fresh blood,' Paul told the Daily Signal. Speaking to Politico Paul said, 'I think he could have been a good leader of the country. But I think many people are going to say, ""He’s had his chance."" ' If Paul seeks the presidency it will complicate his reelection to his Senate seat as Kentucky law does not currently allow candidates to appear on the ballot for two separate positions at the same time. Paul told Politico that the 'most likely option' would be for the state GOP to change its presidential primary to a caucus so that he could compete in both races. Should Paul win the GOP nomination for president, he'd have to do additional maneuvering to stay on the ballot as a candidate for the U.S. Senate, as well, in case he loses the general election. That's a problem his team has another year to solve, though, should it even come to that.","Mitt Romney may run for president after all; he's set to work shoring up donations in already-announced GOP candidate Jeb Bush's backyard .

"Fresh off the back of last week’s Consumer Electronics Show, the latest wearables are now on display in Tokyo. Among these high-tech gadgets is the AirScouter headset that beams images straight onto the wearer’s retina, which creates the illusion they are looking at a 13-inch display. Fujitsu is using the expo to showcase a ring that lets wearers write notes in thin air using just their fingers, while Anicall’s Tsunagaru tag helps pet owners track and location their animals.

Built-in sensors and a GPS unit track the animal’s steps, and owners can use a smartphone app to locate their pet if they're lost. Anicall didn’t reveal pricing information, but said the device will go on sale in Japan in March. It is not known if it will also be available globally. Yamaha is using the expo to showcase a prototype pair of pianist smart gloves made using a flexible nanomaterial.

Data measured by the meter syncs with a smartphone app, and includes maximum and minimum blood pressures, both average and real-time values, pulse rate and pulse wave information. The meter uses photo transistors to detect LED light reflected on a finger. It then converts pulse wave data obtained from the light into a blood pressure value. Professor Omata is hoping to sell the device later this year and is developing a new device that can breast cancer using similar light technology.

"A 54-year-old Massachusetts woman has been charged with replacing a statue of the baby Jesus with a severed pig's head on Christmas Day. The homeless woman was arrested after being photographed defacing the doors and walls of another church on December 30. Amarillis Cermeno will be arraigned on Friday in Haverhill District Court on charges that include larceny, destruction of a place of worship, and malicious destruction of property, Lieutenant Robert Pistone said at a press conference. WARNING: GRAPHIC IMAGE . 54-year-old homeless woman, Amarillis Cermeno (pictured), appeared in court in December having been caught defacing another Haverhill church by writing the number of the devil - 666 -  on its walls . Church-goers were shocked to discover the pig's head in the center of the Nativity scene outside the Sacred Hearts Roman Catholic parish church on Christmas morning. It was initially feared that it was a hate crime . It is alleged that the homeless woman found the pig's head while rummaging in garbage for food in the town of Haverhill, Massachusetts, and left it in place of the figure of the baby Jesus in the early hours of Christmas morning outside the Sacred Hearts Roman Catholic Parish church. It was initially feared that the act was a hate crime. However, Cermeno was arrested on December 30 after she was caught writing the number 666 – identified in the New Testament as the number of the devil – on the doors of a local Spanish-language Baptist church. Brian Bly, a neighbor, tried to get Cermeno's attention, and told CBS Boston that he photographed her as she walked away having written the number '666' some 15 times in black marker on the outside of the church. When cops apprehended her a short while later, Cermeno swung a large metal crucifix at them, authorities say. While she denied any knowledge of the pig's head and missing baby Jesus, the crucifix was traced back to the Sacred Hearts church and the desecrated Nativity scene. Officials say they believe that Cermeno's motivation is likely to be the result of a mental condition. Speaking at Haverhill police headquarters, Pistone said: 'We are confident that this crime was not a crime of hatred, but rather the act of an individual who appears to be mentally ill.' Brian Bly (left) snapped photos of Cermeno (right), after witnessing her deface the  Baptist church. She swung the crucifix she is pictured holding at police - it was found to be from the Catholic church's Nativity scene . Haverhill Mayor James J. Fiorentini, said: 'People in the community were shocked by this, that it was a desecration of one of our holiest places.' 'We are all very glad that this isn't what it originally appeared to be. It doesn't appear to be [an act by] a hate group. We don't have that kind of people in our community.' Describing the discovery of the pig's head on Christmas Day and the subsequent media coverage, Reverend John Delaney said: 'We were shocked. Horrified. Saddened.' He added: 'Now, we can pray for this woman.' Cermeno is undergoing a court-ordered mental health evaluation which will take at least 20 days. Cermeno was apprehended after being caught using a black marker pen to write the number 666 on the walls and door of a Haverhill Spanish-language Baptist church . Pistone declined to say if the statue of Jesus had been recovered, and few other details were given about the investigation. Cermeno had recently been seen preaching to passersby, had visited the police department to share her views on religion with officers, and had been noticed begging outside of the courthouse. Pistone noted that Cermeno had attended services at the Roman Catholic church on December 14 and 21 without incident. 'I do not believe she is anti-religion,' he said. 'I believe, at times, when mentally ill people go into crisis mode, certain behaviors become evident.'","WARNING: GRAPHIC IMAGE .

"Police in the Philippines admitted today they had blundered in trying to end the hostage drama that resulted in eight tourists being shot dead by a crazed gunman as they sat in terror on a hijacked bus. Commandos fired dozens of bullets into the bus and struck at its windows with sledgehammers as they tried to storm it, but were forced to wait outside helplessly for more than an hour as the  maddened hijacker used the tourists as human shields.

"After squishy leaves, falling trees, and the wrong kind of snow, rail bosses are facing a bizarre new hazard caused by the 70mph winds battering Britain – trampolines on the line. The growing popularity of trampolines in family back gardens is posing a real problem for services when there is a severe gale. And the current stormy weather has put them on alert. Network Rail said it had cleared five trampolines from lines in Scotland over the weekend amid garden debris and 400 fallen trees on the tracks. Virgin Trains which operates the main West Coast line between London and Scotland said it encounters a handful of such cases a year in high winds. The company urges people to tie their trampolines down so they don't blow away . And they are bracing themselves for more as the bad weather moves south into England. Virgin Trains which operates the main West Coast line between London and Scotland said it encounters a handful of such cases a year in high winds, and they are not alone. Network Rail admitted: ‘It can be a serious problem.’ ‘We’d urge people to tie your trampolines down’ as a precaution. That goes for any other loose garden materials too,.’ Garden trampolines can vary in size from mini bouncers to quite substantial though usually lightweight aluminium structures with side safety netting. But they can catch like a sail in the wind and fly over fences and hedges. A Virgin Trains spokesman said: ‘I’d hate it to be characterised as trampolines on the line. But we do have cases of those small trampolines being caught by a gust of wind, blown out of gardens and onto the track. It is a problem. 'You just have to go on Google Earth or look out of a train window and you can see how many of them there are in the nation’s back gardens. We might get two or three such incidents a year if there’s a high wind. Someone has to remove them so it causes delays.’ Network Rail said it had cleared five trampolines from lines in Scotland over the weekend amid garden debris and 400 fallen trees on the tracks . After storms in January 2012 the Association of Train Operating Companies reported: ‘Some rail services have been disrupted owing to incredibly strong wind and localised flooding overnight and this morning. 'Hundreds of fallen trees and debris including ripped off roofs and children’s trampolines have been removed from tracks.’ In December 2013 weary travellers on the 7am ScotRail service from Glasgow Queen Street station found their journey halted after five minutes because of a trampoline that had blown on to the line became stuck. It coincided with severe wind and rain that affected services as trains ran at half speed before being suspended. The driver told passengers: ‘We’ve stopped because we’ve collided with a trampoline.’ The website rail.co.uk notes: ‘High winds bring their own problems such as debris from gardens blowing onto the track. It is not unknown for ripped off roofs, garden sheds and children’s trampolines to land on the lines or overhead wires.’ In Ireland in December 2013 a trampoline caught by the winds caused damage to overhead rail lines near Blackrock in Dublin. Another trampoline blown on to a rail track was struck by the 7.10am Waterford to Dublin train at Kiltorcan. A Virgin Trains spokesman said: ‘Leaves on the line is a well-known problem. The issue is not the leaf but the concentration of leaf mulsh which makes the track slippery. 'There are machines which spray the track to retain traction. Sand can also be used to improve grip, It’s less of a problem than it was. ’Network Rail have been doing a good job clearing trees from the side of the track to reduce the risk of them being blown over onto the line. Sometimes they have to negotiate with private land owners who may or may not agree, Some demand heavy payments.’ A spokesman for Virgin Trains which runs the West Coast mainline and has won the contract to run the East Coast line from next year said: ‘Heavy winds are a real problem for the railways and it is often the case that household items are blown from people’s gardens onto the tracks and overhead lines. ‘Last year we experienced 4 or 5 incidents of trampolines being blown onto the track. Large items like this pose a particular issue as, even if they don’t bring down the lines, the power will still have to be switched off before they can be removed from the track.’ Network Rail said: ‘Strong winds bring challenges for the railway as they can blow debris, branches and trees from the trackside and neighbouring land onto the track, increasing the risk of a derailment. ‘Unsecured items such as garden furniture and trampolines have in the past been particularly problematic and so we would urge people living next to the railway to secure all items on their property to reduce the risk of them blowing onto the tracks, causing potential damage to trains and delays to the travelling public.’","Debris, branches and trees found on tracks can cause trains to derail .

"Finding out that the father of your children is cheating on you is heart-breaking, but when the person he is doing the dirty with is your own mother, the deceit is enough to shatter your world. Kylie, 26, from Sheffield is still struggling to come to terms with the betrayal of the two adults she loved most in the world, after learning that they conducted an affair behind her back that lasted at least two and a half years. The mother-of-two has now told her story in a new Channel 5 documentary called Wedding Disaster Specials which airs tonight at 8pm, in an attempt to help others who may be going through a similar situation. Scroll down for video . Kylie, 26, from Sheffield is still struggling to overcome her mother's betrayal. Her mum admitted recently that she had long affair with her daughter's fiancé. The relationship took place while Kylie was pregnant . Kylie first met her partner, who we shall call Dean, just over five years ago on social media. The pair started messaging each other daily and it wasn't long before romance blossomed. Dean and Kylie first met face-to-face at her 21st birthday, which took place in a pub in Sheffield. She said: 'He made me smile, he made me laugh, I felt like I was walking on a cloud constantly. 'From there we ended up in a relationship.' Just five months later, the couple had moved in together and for the first three years of their relationship, everything ran smoothly. For Kylie's 24th birthday, which also marked three years to the day since she and Dean got together, they held a party at the pub where they first met. During the party, which was attended by all of her family and close friends, Dean surprised her by getting down on one knee and asking her to marry him. Kylie being proposed to by her now ex-boyfriend on her 24th birthday . Kylie said: 'I had never been so happy to share that moment with people I held close. It was a very good night. 'And then, two or three weeks later, we found out we were pregnant. 'I felt like I had it all, the man I love and a baby on the way - everything felt like it was falling into place.' But soon afterwards, Dean's behaviour started to change and he became more controlling. He would demand to know wherever she was going and would call her phone every hour on the hour, sometimes turning unannounced if she was out with friends to check on her. According to Kylie, his drinking also increased and he would become argumentative, picking fights at any opportunity. She turned to her mother, who we shall call Shirley, for support and Shirley started to come over to the house on a regular basis. Kylie said: 'My mum managed to calm him down, she had an amazing effect on him. 'I used to look forward to her coming around because she was my only female friend and I could talk to her about anything from shopping to twinges in my pregnancy and relationship problems.' Kylie with her mother, who recently admitted to having an affair with her daughter's boyfriend . When Kylie's baby arrived, her mother started staying over on a regular basis to help out. But a few weeks after the birth, she became suspicious after discovering her mother and boyfriend watching a porn DVD together. She said: 'I'd gone to bed early, my daughter woke up about 12 for a bottle so I gave her one and I heard a DVD on the TV, which I thought sounded like it was a porn DVD. 'When I came through the door, I saw it was a porn DVD and that my partner and my mum were sat on the settee watching it. 'When I confronted them, they said it was something that had just started and they had put the wrong DVD in. 'They said that I was insecure and paranoid because I've just had a baby and that I was imagining things. 'The next morning it was as though nothing had happened. 'I spoke to my friends and they said, ""Are you sure? Your mum has been happily married for 27 years."" 'I convinced myself I was believing things that weren't happening. I went to the doctors and they put me on antidepressants. 'But the tablets made me quite drowsy and having a newborn in the house meant it wasn't safe for me to be on my own.' The drowsiness from the tablets meant her mother was around the house constantly to help out. Kylie put her worries to the back of her mind though, especially after her next round of big news a couple of months later - that she was expecting again. This time it was a baby boy. Kylie with her ex and their two children . After the child was born, Kylie and Dean started to argue, with one row ending with him throwing a colander at her. Kylie kicked him out, but her mother convinced her that the relationship was worth another try. She said: 'My mum was such a strong believer in him that I thought if she can believe in him, surely I should. 'So we went for a meal and laughed and joked about things and it was as though we had gone back to the begining of our relationship. 'I took him back and he moved back in. Things were fantastic. 'He was the person I fell in love with, he was fantastic around the kids, they loved having him back home. 'It was just magical. 'We went on our first holiday to Blackpool, it was our first holiday as a family and it was brilliant. We sat on the beach and had chips and ice cream. 'At that point I thought this is what families are supposed to do. 'I thought everything was perfect and my mum was right to believe in him.' Kylie on a family holiday to Blackpool . But then Kylie's mother started to visit the house regularly again and Dean became quiet and withdrawn. After a conversation with Shirley about his mood swings, her mother said she would deal with Dean and convinced her daughter to join a gym. But one day, while Kylie was at the house, she noticed he mother's mobile phone lying around and decided to take a look. She said: 'I thought I would have a look on her phone, just to ease my mind more than anything. 'There was one message from him to her saying, ""I'll do you tonight,"" and there were no other text messages. 'At that point I decided I wouldn't go to the gym, I'd come back instead and catch them out. 'When I got home, it took me at least 15 minutes to get back into the house because his keys were in the door. Kylie with her ex in happier times . 'When I eventually managed to get into the house, my mum was in the shower and he was in his boxer shorts. 'I didn't want it to be true, I mean, she was my mum and he was my lifetime partner who I thought I would settle down with and get married to.' After that, Dean and Kylie split up, but her mother continued to deny anything had happened. Then three months ago, Shirley finally confessed. Kylie said: 'I was actually sat at the table with children and my mum was sat across from me. 'She was on her phone and then she looked at me and said, ""I've got something to tell you and you're not going to like it - me and him have been sleeping together."" 'If the children weren't there, I'd have slapped her.' Kylie with her sister, who is acting as a shoulder to cry on . The next day a letter dropped through her door from her solicitor, it contained a confession from Dean that he had been sleeping with her mother for four years. Kylie realised that the only reason her mother had told her the truth was because she knew she was going to get found out through Dean's confession the next day. She said: 'I couldn't believe that my mum did the ultimate betrayal. 'My mum was my best friend, hopefully she might get back there. But once you break that trust, it's hard to get it back.' When Channel 5 contacted Kylie's mother, she said she had an-off relationship with her daughter's ex for two and a half years but denied watching porn with him and claimed nothing happened on the night that Kylie came back to the house to catch them out. Kylie's ex said he did not want to take part in the programme. Wedding Disaster Specials: He Left Me For My Mother...

"The Girl Scouts' new health conscious cookie options have been put to the ultimate taste test by two children recruited by Grub Street to review the recently-launched recipes. Earlier this month, the Girl Scouts announced the launch of three new cookie flavors - Trios, Toffee-tastic and Rah Rah Raisin - the first two of which are gluten-free, while the other contains a healthy mix of raisins, oatmeal and Greek yogurt. But do the healthier cookie alternatives measure up to the high standards set by their predecessors? According to Grub Street's budding taste testers - one of whom is the daughter of New York Magazine's own food critic Adam Platt - the answer is a resounding no. Cookie creations: The Girl Scouts announced earlier this month that they were adding three new flavors to their cookie line-up . Sweet treat: The gluten-free Toffee-tastic flavor is described as being 'buttery with sweet, crunchy golden toffee bits' Less than impressed: Grub Street's young food critics were unimpressed with both the Rah Rah Raisin (L) and the Trios (R) cookie flavors . Upon tasting one of the gluten-free Trios, which are made with real peanut butter, chocolate chips and whole grain oats, Penelope Platt and her classmate Julia Millard Williams, both 11, were quick to deliver their - overwhelmingly - negative reviews of the treat. 'It doesn't even look very appetizing to me,' Julia explained, before even tasting the cookie. 'It's weirdly shaped.' Penelope on the other hand, at least waited to sample the baked delight before deeming it to be 'rigid', with an odd texture that crumbles bizarrely in your mouth. Both girls also pointed out that the Trios aren't packaged in the traditional Girl Scout cookie boxes, but instead are wrapped inside a plastic pouch. Moving on to the Rah Rah Raisin cookies, which are described on the Girls Scouts website as 'new hearty oatmeal cookies packed with plump raisins and Greek yogurt-flavored chunks', the girls were again left wanting in terms of flavor and ingredients. Classic: Two of the new flavors come packaged in the traditional Girl Scout cookie boxes . Odd one out: For some reason, the Trios are sold in plastic pouches . While Julia described the cookie as 'okay', Penelope revealed that she wasn't sure raisin and oatmeal really worked as a flavor combination; both girls were unable to taste the Greek yogurt. 'I was expecting to bite into a gooey raisin, but there was something else — maybe white chocolate?' Penelope added. 'It definitely tasted like a health cookie, or a cereal cookie.' Both Penelope and Julia were big fans of the iconic Thin Mints, arguably the most popular cookie sold by the Girl Scouts, which was also the only one that both girls were able to recognize. When it came to some of the other classic cookie flavors however, the results were equally underwhelming, with both girls insisting that the peanut-butter based Tagalongs were too salty, while the Trefoils were too 'lemon-y'.","The Girl Scouts introduced three new health-conscious cookie flavors to their line-up earlier this month .

"The secret of a squirrel’s hibernation could hold the key to preventing Alzheimer’s. Other devastating conditions, from Parkinson’s to Huntington’s could also be avoided or delayed, thanks to a British breakthrough. Scientists from the Medical Research Council in Leicester have shown how a deep hibernation-like sleep cools down the brain and protects it from degenerative diseases. A deep hibernation-like sleep cools down the brain and protects it from degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's (pictured) and other devastating conditions such as Parkinson’s and Huntington’s disease . The discovery could lead to a drug that stops a host of crippling illnesses in their tracks. Given in middle age, it could keep the brain healthy for longer. The work is still at an early age but Alzheimer’s charities described it as exciting and said it could have ‘wide-reaching benefits’. Researcher Giovanna Mallucci got the idea for her research after hearing what happens to the squirrel’s brain when it hibernates. When the animal’s body temperature drops to conserve energy during its long winter slumber, connections between brain cells are broken. This stops messages being sent from cell to cell and helps put the brain into a deep sleep. When the creatures come out of hibernation, the cell to cell connections, called synapses, reform, and work so perfectly that the squirrel can remember exactly where it hid its stash of nuts. Older people with memory problems can boost their brainpower with fish oil supplements, say researchers. Healthy people with mild memory deficits of events in their past life, so-called episodic memory, had improved recall after six months of treatment. A new overview says the omega-3 fatty acid DHA has most benefit for people with existing memory problems, particularly when they are coping with physical or mental stress. Experts believe supplements rich in DHA from fish oils or other marine sources might slow or prevent mental decline as it is found in reduced amounts in people with Alzheimer’s disease. Dr Carrie Ruxton, independent public health nutritionist who reviewed the latest evidence for supplements manufacturer Equazen, said oily fish consumption was falling. With broken synapses a classic early feature of neurodegenerative diseases in people, Professor Mallucci decided to see if she too could fix them. To mimic the effects of hibernation, she took healthy mice and gave them a drug that cooled them down to the 16-18c of a hibernating squirrel and put them in a deep sleep. The synapses in the mouse brains broke up – then reformed when the creatures were warmed up again. Crucially, levels of a protein called RBM3 rose. In contrast, mice in the very early stages of an Alzheimer’s-like illness were unable to reform their synapses when coming out of ‘hibernation’. And they did not make more RBM3. However, when these mice were given an injection that raised levels of RBM3, the brain connections reformed. The improvement was even more dramatic in mice genetically engineered to succumb to a CJD-like illness. These animals remained healthy – and even lived longer than usual. Together, the experiments show RBM3 to fix broken synapses – something that should keep brain cells alive. If RBM3 also keeps human synapses healthy, a drug that increases levels could keep Alzheimer’s and other degenerative diseases at bay. Professor Hugh Perry, a Medical Research Council neuroscientist, said: ‘We now need to find something to reproduce the effect of brain cooling. The discovery could lead to a drug that stops a host of crippling illnesses in their tracks - and given in middle age, it could keep the brain healthy for longer . ‘Just as anti-inflammatory drugs are preferable to cold baths in bringing down a high temperature, we need to find drugs which can induce the effects of hibernation.’ The researchers caution that such drugs are a long way off. But say if they work, it may be possible to give them from middle-age to delay or even prevent a range of crippling brain diseases, including dementia. The discovery, reported in the journal Nature, also helps explain why medically-induced hypothermia protects the brain. For instance, artificial cooling is used to prevent brain damage in babies deprived of oxygen at birth. Dr Eric Karran, of Alzheimer’s Research UK, said: ‘This research is at an early stage and will need exploring further in humans before we know whether it could be developed into an effective treatment for diseases like Alzheimer’s. ‘There is currently a desperate lack of effective treatment options for people with dementia. ‘Research to uncover the key biological mechanisms keeping brain cells healthy is important, as it provides more avenues for investigation in the search for treatments that could make a real difference to people’s lives.”","Secret of a squirrel’s hibernation could hold the key to preventing disease .

"Moving video has captured the incredible moment that Alex McKinnon has a life changing breakthrough, standing for the first time after suffering a devastating spinal injury on the footy field. After 10 months of intense rehabilitation, this is the moment that so many had been desperately hoping for after the 22-year-old was warned he would likely never walk again. Celebrating with a grin and a fist pump, it's clear that no one is more excited than 22-year-old McKinnon. The former Newcastle Knights forward was diagnosed a quadriplegic after suffering a catastrophic tackle in Round Three of the 2014 NRL season in a match against Melbourne Storm. However, he refused to accept the bad news, vowing that he would walk his fiancée Teigan Power down the aisle. Scroll down for video . McKinnon's supportive fiancee Teigan Power has constantly been by his side since his accident, so it was only fitting that she was the one to share in his joy as he stood for the first time . Newcastle Knights player Alex McKinnon continues to inspire as he has stood up on his own for the first time . McKinnon's supportive partner has constantly been by his side since his accident, so it was only fitting that she was the one to share in his joy as he stood for the first time. The 22-year-old beams with happiness in the video as he stands steadily, his arm around his fiancée's neck for support. He strokes her hair affectionately as they relish in the incredible achievement, defying all medical expectations. Ms Power wraps her arms around his waist in the video and looks up at him proudly. The future is bright for the incredible young man, whose positivity and perseverance has been an inspiration for so many Australians, inspiring the #RiseForAlex movement which pledges to offer ongoing and emotional and financial support through his struggles. He is set to commence a new role with the Knights on January 27, allowing him to be involved with Rugby League again and rejoin his mates at the Newcastle club. Alex McKinnon commented on his amazing progress through a statement from the Newcastle Knights on Wednesday. 'I remain on the Gold Coast, where I have been for approximately three months as I continue rehabilitation at Making Strides,' McKinnon said. 'I am in the final stages of my current rehabilitation program on the Gold Coast. 'When aided to stand up out of my chair, I am now able to stand for a short amount of time with assistance. 'I am set to return to Newcastle in the coming weeks to commence my new role with the Knights. 'Thank you as always, for the well wishes and encouragement.'

He fist pumps, grins and strokes his fiancee's hair gently . Newcastle Knights coach Rick Stone earlier revealed McKinnon's impressive achievement. 'He's just finished in his rehab and he actually stood up unabated the other day ... he stood up on his own which is a terrific sort of step for Alex,' Stone said. Stone later clarified his statement, explaining that McKinnon can stand with assistance. McKinnon has been determined from the very beginning to make a full recovery and last July the NRL's Rise For Alex round raised ove $1.4 million towards that goal. Stone said spoke about McKinnon's new position with the club, explaining that his promising career with the NRL will also involve spending one day a week in the commercial area. 'That's going to be a great opportunity for Alex to get his teeth into something he really loves, footy,' he told Sky Sports Radio. 'He's inspiring young men and everyone in the club will be really happy to see him back.' Ever the optimist, McKinnon proposed to Teagan just days after getting the devastating news that he will never play his beloved game of football ever again. McKinnon proudly announced the engagement on Instagram at the time. 'This girl is my soldier, I am truly overwhelmed with the support and wishes from everybody in the rugby league society and the community at large. Your ongoing support will never be forgotten,' he wrote. 'PS. When life throws you struggles respond with a smile. So happy to announce Teigan and my engagement.#throughthickandthin #iwillwalkherdowntheisle.' McKinnon will take on an active role in recruitment at the Newcastle Knights club this year . The horrendous news rocked the entire NRL community - but no one more than former Knights coach Wayne Bennett. The normally stoic man, who is now the Brisbane Broncos coach, revealed he lost interest in football in the weeks after one of his players Alex McKinnon suffered a devastating spinal injury that ended his career. 'I was very confused with myself, very confused. I didn't feel as emotional as I thought I should and then it dawned on me that I was living a lie and not letting my emotions come through because I couldn't afford to. 'But I've shed a lot of tears since about him...and I suppose I'll shed some more. 'It's good to get it off my chest.' Bennett said what he wanted for McKinnon now was for him to be happy. 'I saw a bit of myself [in him] when I was younger,' he said. 'I like his style and how he carried himself and I'm really proud of him.' Former Knights coach Wayne Bennett shed a lot of tears following McKinnon's tragic accident . Speaking at the launch of the NRL's 'Rise For Alex' round in July last year, it's not entirely surprising that McKinnon has achieved  the impossible when all he could think about was focusing on walking again. His goal is to resume a normal life as soon as possible - adding that although his recovery was going to be a slow and long process he was prepared to give it his best shot. 'As much as I would love to get home and get back to my family and get back to Newcastle and get on with my life, I want to walk again,' he said. 'You see a lot of stories about people who get on with their lives and don't walk again. My focus is to get as much back of my movement as I can and I am slowly improving. 'For example, when I first got diagnosed I was a C4 - all that is shoulder movement. Nothing else. No fingers, no movement in your legs, or anything like that. 'I am slowly progressing with the movement, I am a C7 now.'

"A second ambulance trust suspected of secretly downgrading emergency calls last night admitted it had reclassified 11,000 patients. Yorkshire Ambulance Service said some 10,918 calls were re-categorised as less serious last year – 30 a day. It follows a report that revealed how the East of England Ambulance Trust changed the status of 8,324 calls in a two-month period last year to meet response times. It was accused of hastening the deaths of 57 terminally ill patients by downgrading 999 calls so ambulances either arrived too late or not at all. Scroll down for video . Ambulance staff have downgraded almost 11,000 emergency calls in Yorkshire  last year (file photograph) In Yorkshire, whistleblowers claim urgent cases are being re-categorised once it becomes clear paramedics will not arrive within the eight-minute target set for the most serious cases – leaving some patients waiting up to 50 minutes. One whistleblower told the Wakefield Express: ‘Some absolutely major calls are being graded as green [less serious] because they know they are not going to get to it.’ Another paramedic said: ‘They are playing with lives on a daily basis.’ The ambulance service – which serves a population of five million – is under pressure to meet targets as it attempts to become a cherished ‘foundation trust’ with less State control. Figures reveal how 348 of 722 life-threatening ‘Red 1’ calls were reclassified as less serious ‘Red 2’. That meant patients still had an eight-minute response target but a delay is factored into the timing. Another 374 calls were downgraded to ‘green’, meaning a response time of between 20 or 50 minutes – or simply advice over the phone. Union Unite – which uncovered the figures – said more than 500 staff and members of the public have now complained to the Care Quality Commission watchdog. Len McCluskey, General Secretary of the union, said: ‘There needs to be a thorough investigation into allegations that the service could be gambling with people’s lives. Senior management at the Yorkshire Ambulance Services have a record of systemic failure, incompetence and are mired in allegations of cover-ups.’ Tory MP Charlotte Leslie, who sits on the Commons health select committee, said: ‘Politicians of all parties need to grow up and realise targets are damaging.’ Paramedics claim control room staff are instructed to ring patients back if it becomes clear the ambulance is not going to reach them on time. Staff then carry out a phone assessment where it is ‘agreed’ that callers are not critically ill so an ambulance is not needed as quickly. A grandfather spent nearly three days in a cramped hospital stock room because no space was available on a ward. Michael Steel, 63, right,  was squeezed into a storage area filled with medical supplies and lit by a glaring fluorescent strip light. He struggled to sleep because of constant interruptions as staff came in to grab equipment or move his bed to reach a drugs cupboard. Mr Steel, who was being treated for an inflamed liver, also claimed other patients were left to go hungry by overstretched nurses. He helped feed and comfort some, including one severely ill man who died as he held his hand. ‘It beggars belief that something like this can happen in this day and age – people don’t believe it when I tell them,’ he said. The retired salesman was admitted to Princess Alexandra Hospital in Harlow, Essex, twice last month. The second time he was moved to the 12ft by 10ft stock room and given intravenous antibiotics. The hospital trust has apologised to Mr Steel, saying it was struggling with an ‘unprecedented number of emergency patients’. It rejected the hungry patient claims. However, the Yorkshire trust insists that patients are only called back when it might be ‘beneficial’ and they are then offered the most ‘appropriate care’. At the East of England Ambulance trust, managers agreed beforehand that certain calls involving terminally ill patients would not be deemed as serious – forcing them to wait up to 50 minutes or simply receiving advice over the phone. Yesterday David Cameron described the actions of the ambulance service in East Anglia as ‘clearly wrong’. He told MPs: ‘The change was made without the knowledge of the trust’s board. As soon as it was found out, the chief executive reversed the decision and ordered an independent investigation. The investigation found there had been no harm to patients. I think it is important to put this in context.’ However, campaigners dispute the finding of the investigation and say terminally ill patients may have had precious extra time with loved ones had ambulances been dispatched.","Whistleblower said Yorkshire Ambulance Service downgraded 11,000 calls .

"It could help us find Earth like planets - and even spot a 'second Earth'. High in the Chilean desert, the Next-Generation Transit Survey (NGTS) has begun automatically scanning the skies . The project is a wide-field observing system made up of an array of twelve telescopes, each with an aperture of 20 centimetres. Scroll down for video . The Next-Generation Transit Survey is made up of an array of twelve 20cm telescopes, and will focus on discovering Neptune-sized and smaller planets, with diameters two and eight times that of Earth. It will search for transiting exoplanets — planets that pass in front of their parent star and hence produce a slight dimming of the star's light that can be detected by sensitive instruments. The telescopes will focus on discovering Neptune-sized and smaller planets, with diameters between two and eight times that of Earth. The new facility, built by a UK, Swiss and German consortium, is located at ESO's Paranal Observatory in northern Chile and benefits from the superb observing conditions and excellent support facilities available at this site. The telescope has now achieved first light. 'We needed a site where there were many clear nights and the air was clear and dry so that we could make very accurate measurements as often as possible — Paranal was the best choice by far,' says Don Pollacco of the University of Warwick in the UK and one of the NGTS project leads. The telescopes are designed to operate in a robotic mode and it will continuously monitor the brightness of hundreds of thousands of comparatively bright stars in the southern skies. It is searching for transiting exoplanets and will reach a level of accuracy in measuring the brightness of stars — one part in a thousand — that has never before been attained with a ground-based wide-field survey instrument. The telescopes are designed to operate in a robotic mode and it will continuously monitor the brightness of hundreds of thousands of comparatively bright stars in the southern skies. The discoveries of NGTS will be studied further using other larger telescopes, including the ESO Very Large Telescope. One goal is to find small planets that are bright enough for the planetary mass to be measured. This will allow planetary densities to be deduced, which in turn provides clues about the composition of the planets. It may also be possible to probe the atmospheres of the exoplanets whilst they are in transit, researchers hope. The Next-Generation Transit Survey (NGTS) is a wide-field photometric survey designed to discover transiting exoplanets of Neptune-size and smaller around bright stars. NGTS will survey brighter stars than NASA's Kepler mission, and will therefore find the brightest exoplanets of Neptune and super-Earth size, providing the prime targets for characterization by telescopes such as the VLT, E-ELTand JWST. Bright targets provide the key to understanding planetary structure and evolution, as well as atmospheric composition. NGTS is sited at the European Southern Observatory's Paranal Observatory in Chile, home of the VLT, which meets strict requirements for low water vapor and excellent photometric conditions. This is the first telescope project hosted, but not operated, by ESO on Paranal, and strengthens the synergy with ESO's telescopes. Before it was built, the ESO demonstrated all key technologies using a prototype system, which operated on La Palma during 2009 and 2010, and at the Observatoire de Geneve from 2012-14. During the transit some of the star's light passes through the planet's atmosphere, if it has one, and leaves a tiny, but detectable, signature. So far only a few such very delicate observations have been made, but NGTS should provide many more potential targets. The NGTS data will flow into the ESO archive system and will be available to astronomers worldwide for decades to come. Peter Wheatley, one of the NGTS project leads from the University of Warwick, concludes: 'We are excited to begin our search for small planets around nearby stars. The NGTS discoveries, and follow-up observations by telescopes on the ground and in space, will be important steps in our quest to study the atmospheres and composition of small planets such as the Earth.' The discoveries of NGTS will be studied further using other larger telescopes, including the ESO Very Large Telescope. ESO operates three unique world-class observing sites in Chile: La Silla, Paranal and Chajnantor. At Paranal, ESO operates the Very Large Telescope, the world's most advanced visible-light astronomical observatory and two survey telescopes. VISTA works in the infrared and is the world's largest survey telescope and the VLT Survey Telescope is the largest telescope designed to exclusively survey the skies in visible light. ESO is a major partner in ALMA, the largest astronomical project in existence. And on Cerro Armazones, close to Paranal, ESO is building the 39-metre European Extremely Large Telescope, the E-ELT, which will become 'the world's biggest eye on the sky'. The telescopes will focus on discovering Neptune-sized and smaller planets, with diameters between two and eight times that of Earth.","Next-Generation Transit Survey  is  made up of an array of twelve 20 cm telescopes .

"David Cameron was accused of making excuses by Nick Clegg last night as he plunged plans for TV debates between party leaders into further chaos. The Prime Minister indicated he would take part in a head-to-head with Ed Miliband and a five-way clash adding Mr Clegg, Nigel Farage and Green leader Natalie Bennett. But he appeared to reject broadcasters’ demands for a third debate featuring only him, Mr Miliband and Mr Clegg, dismissing the Lib Dems as a ‘minor party’. David Cameron, pictured, has said he won't participate in a three-way debate with Labour and the Lib Dems . During Prime Minister’s Questions, the Labour leader claimed Mr Cameron was ‘frit’ – a dialect word for ‘frightened’ once used by Margaret Thatcher. Mr Clegg, sitting next to the Prime Minister, was seen to shout, ‘Excuses, excuses’ at him, while Labour MPs made a chorus of chicken clucking noises. But Mr Cameron accused Labour and the Lib Dems of ‘running scared’ over the inclusion of the Greens, who are biting into the vote of both parties. Tory strategists said including the Greens – whose membership has doubled since September and is on course to overtake Ukip’s in weeks – was a ‘simple matter of fairness’, given the party regularly outpolls the Lib Dems and beat them in last May’s European elections. Broadcasting sources said that if the Greens were included, it would be difficult to refuse the Scottish Nationalists a place. With the SNP on course to win far more seats than Ukip or the Greens, Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has threatened legal action unless her party is allowed to participate. During the last General Election, then Prime Minister Gordon Brown, right, held a debate with Nick Clegg, left and David Cameron, centre, and TV companies want a similar format during the forthcoming campaign . It is far from clear whether Labour would take part in a TV debate in which it could be undermined by the Greens in England and the SNP in Scotland. Senior broadcasting figures are understood to have discussed whether to ‘empty-chair’ Mr Cameron if he refuses to take part, as Labour is demanding. Roger Mosey, the BBC’s former editorial director, suggested it would be possible to leave a spare lectern where the Prime Minister would have stood. ‘Those who are willing to put themselves on the line should be allowed to do so,’ he wrote in the Guardian. ‘Those who don’t can watch at home and see what an empty chair looks like over 90 minutes of prime-time television.’ Ofcom says ‘due weight’ must be given to the major parties in election campaign coverage. But some senior broadcasters are concerned about the sway the regulator has over election coverage, after it declared earlier this month that it regards Ukip as a ‘major party’. Senior politicians suggest the terms of the TV debates should be negotiated by an independent commission, as with US presidential clashes. Miss Bennett last night wrote to Mr Miliband, Mr Farage and Mr Clegg. She revealed that ITV has not yet decided who should take part and urged the three leaders to agree that she should be included. Labour strategists have long been counting on the TV debates to boost their chances – and Mr Miliband said Mr Cameron was using the Greens as a ‘pathetic excuse’ not to take part. He said it was for broadcasters and ‘not for any party leader to decide who is in the debate’, adding: ‘However he dresses it up, everyone knows he is running scared.’ But Mr Cameron told MPs: ‘I’m all for these debates, but you cannot have two minor parties without the third minor party. Why is [Ed Miliband] frightened of debating the Green Party?’ A Downing Street source said the Tories had made no final decisions about TV debates and various formats were still ‘up in the air’.","David Cameron wants a head-to-head debate with Labour's  Ed Miliband .

"Airbus has begun talks with a European regulator to make ejectable flight recorders available on its two largest models. The announcement means the company's  A380 and new A350 aircraft could be the first commercial planes to use such technology. The European company also hinted that in the future, it could expand the use of these ejectable recorders, which combine voice and data recordings, even further - to new versions of its A330 and A320 jets. Airbus has begun talks with a European regulator to install ejectable flight recorders on its two largest models. Pictured: Airbus A380 . The talks with the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) comes in the wake of the December 28th AirAsia tragedy, where the data recorded was recovered but the voice recorder is still missing. An ejectable recorder would make it easier to recover evidence in such cases. Already used in military planes, ejectable or 'deployable' recorders separate from the tail during a crash and float, emitting a satellite distress signal. 'Airbus is working with EASA and other stakeholders to advance the approval of such a solution industrywide,' a spokesman for Airbus said, adding that there was no indication when the devices might come into use. 'In the future, applicability for our other aircraft products could likewise be considered, but presently, we have decided to focus on the A350 and the A380.' EASA declined to comment. The talks with the European Aviation Safety Agency come in the wake of December's AirAsia tragedy . Though the data recorder was recovered from the AirAsia flight, the voice recorder is still missing . After being recommended by investigators following the Air France A330 jet crashed in 2009, ejectable recorders have recently been gaining support at the United Nations' International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO). A proposal recommending that new commercial aircraft certified after 2016 be equipped with them is to be heard by ICAO's Air Navigation Commission this month. If approved, following a three-month consultation among 191 member states, it would likely appear in a new package of ICAO standards in 2016, possibly coming into effect from around 2021. That said, ICAO's standards are not always implemented by all member nations. Ejectable recorders are already popular in military aircraft as they emit a satellite distress signal in a crash . Airbus also hopes to add ejectable, or deployable, recorders to their largest A350 models (pictured) Such an initiative could also benefit existing military suppliers including Finmeccanica's DRS Technologies, which is pushing for ejectable black boxes in commercial aircraft. However, not all countries appear ready to back the technology, which is seen as only one way of recovering evidence on crashes over water. Others include rolling out lower-frequency locator beacons, under an already approved ICAO standard, that would make black boxes easier to find. Some officials fear that relying solely on ejectable flight recorders would take attention and resources away from the search for deep-water wreckage and bodies that can also help solve air crashes and ease the suffering of families. Boeing has taken the opposite stance over the use of deployable recorders, arguing that the majority of its black boxes are recovered within 30 days, also citing instances where these alternative recorders have failed on military aircraft.","Company in talks with European regulator about ejectable flight recorders .

"Officials say a school bus carrying a driver and 45 students from a North Carolina middle school has overturned, injuring 15 of the children. Gaston County Schools spokesman Todd Hagans said the N.C. Highway Patrol determined that a compartment door above the driver fell open, creating a distraction before the accident Wednesday afternoon.

He did send a tweet from the account @InvictusLondon to promote tickets sales that read: 'Hope everyone will get behind #invictusgames. Great opportunity to support and thank the men and women who have given so much. Harry.' But he said it's a double-edged sword for him and his family as it can be an additional invasion of their privacy. He said: 'I would love to get involved and go on social media and if it was for causes like this (the Invictus Games) I really would. 'The issue for myself and my family, put quite simply, is that it's very hard for me to tweet about the Invictus Games and tweet about something that means a lot to me, whereas I at the same time really quite hate Twitter by the invasion of privacy. I think you all understand what I'm talking about.’ Despite being part of the iPhone generation, the princes and Kate are not up-to-date with the times as their grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II. Beaten them to it: The Queen sent her first Tweet in October 2014 . She has already sent her first tweet from her @BritishMonarchy account that has been providing 'updates, pictures and videos from Buckingham Palace about the work and activities of The Royal Family and the institution of Monarchy' since April 2009. In October 2014, the Queen used the account to tweet about her visit to the Science Museum in London. She wrote: 'It is a pleasure to open the Information Age exhibition today at the and I hope people will enjoy visiting. Elizabeth R.' The Royal Foundation of The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry was legally established by princes in September 2009 and became fully operational in 2011.

"She's done: Rosie Perez reportedly will not be returning to The View at the end of her month-long hiatus to perform on Broadway . Rosie Perez will be leaving The View after less than a season, insiders revealed Wednesday. Currently on a month-long leave to perform in Broadway's Fish in the Dark, the 50-year-old actress has said she will not return to the show, according to Variety. Her departure comes at a reportedly tumultuous time for The View, which insiders said recently may not be back for a 19th season. Perez was added to the show last minute and joined two other incoming hosts--Rosie O'Donnell and politico Nicolle Wallace. The shakeup came amid plummeting ratings and after show creator Barbara Walters' retirement. While ratings stabilized, sources told Variety that Perez never quite got the hang of the show's signature hard news/soft news chat format. The source said the stage and screen actress never quite got the hang of reading a teleprompter. What's more, network insiders revealed to Daily Mail Online on Tuesday that the long-running talk show could end after this season, amid struggling ratings and infighting among the talk show hosts. The show is suffering some of its lowest ratings ever with its new team of Whoopi Goldberg, Rosie O'Donnell, Nicolle Wallace and Rosie Perez. Now under the umbrella of ABC News, the network is considering the possibility of ending the show and replacing it with an extended version of 'Good Morning America.' 'The brass at ABC feels like they've tried to do everything possible to breathe new life into this show,' said the insider. They moved it from ABC Entertainment Daytime to the ABC News division, that was having so much success with Good Morning America. But in spite of the changes, nothing seems to be helping the sluggish ratings for the show. 'They're ready to abandon ship at this point,' the source told Daily Mail Online. When contacted by Daily Mail Online, a show spokesperson denied any plan by ABC to end the show. Tough times: Her departure comes at a reportedly tumultuous time for The View, which insiders said recently may not be back for a 19th season . ABC News is winning in the morning show wars with GMA and the network hoped that the magic of that team could rub off on The View. Despite multiple changes to the set, a new show introduction, a shift to softer topics and adding guest co-hosts to the show, ratings still have still declined. 'ABC feels it's exhausted their options with The View and now it's time to expand the existing franchise, GMA. They feel that since GMA is already beating NBC's Today during the first two hours of the broadcast, why not extend the morning broadcast,' the insider revealed. In 2012, following the cancellation of talk show The Revolution, ABC launched a test show called Good Afternoon America, the network's first extension of GMA. The temporary summer series hosted by Lara Spencer and former GMA anchor Josh Elliott performed well in the ratings for ABC and the network said then that it would consider bringing it back. 'The idea to bring back Good Afternoon America is something that's strongly being considered. They believe the success of GMA could carry over right into that 11am slot that The View currently holds,' another insider said. Spencer, who previously hosted the news magazine series The Insider, has been itching to do that show again because she likes the pop culture-oriented format. The show is suffering some of its lowest ratings ever with its new team of Whoopi Goldberg, Rosie O'Donnell, Nicolle Wallace and Rosie Perez . The way they were: The show originated with Walters, Meredith Vieira, Star Jones, Joy Behar and Debbie Matenopoulos.It went on to have Sherri Shepherd, Elisabeth Hasselbeck, Lisa Ling and Jenny McCarthy join the panel series. O'Donnell signed on to moderate the show in 2006, but departed the show after a heated on-air altercation with Hasselbeck in 2007 . There's internal talk that ABC would use one of the newer GMA contributors Ryan Smith or T.J. Holmes as her co-anchor on the re-launched show. 'They plan on shooting some test shows in the coming weeks to freshen up the Good Afternoon America concept. They plan to shoot a few pilot episodes following GMA going off air and retooling the show just in case they need to have it ready for a late summer launch,' the source revealed. Canceling The View would be costly for ABC, as Goldberg has one more year remaining on her contract and her pay-or-play agreement would require she be compensated her $5 million a year salary whether the show aired or not. 'Whoopi is the winner either way. She's wanted out of this contract for years and begged to be let go during the show overhaul last summer. To get paid to just go home would make her very happy,' the source offered. The View launched in 1997 and became successful in the 11am time slot on ABC, a time period that no other morning show had been able to perform well in. The show originated with Walters, Meredith Vieira, Star Jones, Joy Behar and Debbie Matenopoulos. It went on to have Sherri Shepherd, Elisabeth Hasselbeck, Lisa Ling and Jenny McCarthy join the panel series. O'Donnell signed on to moderate the show in 2006, but departed the show after a heated on-air altercation with Hasselbeck in 2007.

"The United States aims to use new sanctions imposed on North Korea over the cyber attack on Sony Pictures to cut off the country's remaining links to the international financial system, a senior U.S. Treasury official said on Tuesday. Daniel Glaser, assistant secretary for terrorist financing at the U.S. Treasury Department, said past sanctions had already discouraged 'hundreds' of overseas banks, including China's major commercial banks, from doing business with North Korea. New sanctions announced by President Barack Obama on January 2 provided 'a tremendous amount of flexibility' and the goal was to identify remaining financial institutions that allowed North Korea access to the global system, which could face sanction themselves, Glaser told a House of Representatives briefing. Daniel Glaser, (left) assistant secretary for terrorist financing at the U.S. Treasury Department, said past sanctions had already discouraged 'hundreds' of overseas banks from doing business with North Korea. He said sanctions announced by President Obama (right) have provided 'a tremendous amount of flexibility' 'We could target any North Korean government agency; we could target any North Korean government official ... we could apply sanctions with respect to any individual or entity who is providing them, in turn, material support,' he said. Ed Royce, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, called for use of the full scope of the new sanctions announced after U.S. authorities said North Korea was behind the Sony attack. 'The significance of this new Executive Order may come from the broad power it gives the president to target anyone who is a part of the North Korean government, or is assisting them in any way … that is if the administration chooses to use it to its full advantage,' he told the briefing. 'We need to step up and target those financial institutions in Asia and beyond that are supporting the brutal and dangerous North Korean regime.' When challenged by Royce about 'a number of small banks' still doing business with North Korea and the need to choke off the country's access to hard currency, Glaser replied: 'That's exactly what we are trying to do.' The Interview stars James Franco and Seth Rogen (pictured). Ed Royce, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, called for use of the full scope of the new sanctions announced after U.S. authorities said North Korea was behind the Sony attack . Royce said he hoped a bipartisan bill he sponsored that would label North Korea 'a primary money laundering concern' would be passed by the Senate this year. At a news conference at the United Nations in New York, North Korea's Deputy U.N. Ambassador An Myong Hun reiterated his country's position that it had nothing to do with the Sony hacking and said the United States should provide evidence. Long-standing international sanctions have sought to push North Korea to end its nuclear weapons program, but while they have slowed the program, they have not stopped it. The country's main economic ties are with China and, according U.S. government reports, its tiny economy has supported itself with money-making scams ranging from counterfeiting $100 bills to illicit arms and drug sales.

"A treasurer stole more than £300,000 from community services in a small town to pay her mortgage, redevelop her kitchen and pay for skiing trips. Anne Yaman managed to avoid prison for months after she forged a series of sick notes from medical professionals claiming she was too unwell to attend court, and even hoodwinked a judge. The fraudster fiddled the accounts of the Bentham Development Trust in North Yorkshire, which she had access to and even caused a community bus service to go into liquidation, costing 15 people their jobs. She also abused her position as treasurer of a youth cafe to steal money to cover up her fraud. Anne Yaman has been jailed for four years after she stole £131,000 from a charity community organisation to fund ski holidays and pay her mortgage, and also deceived a judge with a string of fake doctor's notes . Yaman, 63, was sentenced to four years in prison by Judge Jonathan Rose. He said: 'You are a person who has proceeded with wicked determination, forged documents, and stolen money for your own selfish ends and with no care for those who would be so badly hurt, your only thoughts were for your own greed.' After she pleaded guilty to fraud Yaman further evaded punishment by forging a series of eight sick notes on headed notepaper to avoid attending court. Matthew Bean, prosecuting, told Bradford Crown Court that Yaman secured a job as office manager with the Bentham Development Trust (BDT), a registered charity, in 2008. The trust, which had an annual turnover of £400,000 and ran the Little Red Bus service to help children and the elderly get around the rural community. As office manager she had access to two HSBC accounts, and in November 2011 a local kitchen contractor contacted the trustees after he was paid with a charity cheque for private work he had done on Yaman's home. An investigation found Yaman had been forging the signatures of the trustees David Alder and Robert Sloane to write cheques to herself. She had also stolen £94,000 by transferring funds to her personal accounts via online banking. Yaman was sentenced to four years in prison for the frauds and the deceptions at Bradford Crown Court . Yaman used the money to pay off her Visa credit card, give money to her son, pay her mortgage and service a personal loan, as well as buy kitchen appliances and pay for two £3,000 ski-ing holidays for her and her Turkish husband. As well as being office manager of the BDT, Yaman was treasurer of Bentham Youth Café and the Low Bentham Victoria Institute. She abused her position to take money from these organisations to prop-up the BDT accounts and conceal her fraud. She had also not been paying VAT totalling £159,000 between 2009 and 2011 and had used this money to keep the trust solvent. To further cover her tracks Yaman acted as a bogus accountant to falsify accounts for 2009, 2010, and 2011 and did not forward £63,555 trust employees were due in PAYE to HMRC. When she was arrested the BDT's accounts were frozen and the Little Red Bus went into liquidation. At a hearing last summer Yaman, who moved to Seaford, East Sussex, pleaded guilty to three charges of fraud, three charges of false accounting and theft between January 2009 and November 2011. She was due to be sentenced in July last year but used deception again to avoid coming to court. Judge Jonathan Rose was hoodwinked by Yaman's forged letters and said she carried out the fraud and deceptions with 'wicked determination' Officials at Bradford Crown Court received a GP's letter on headed notepaper from the Old School Surgery explaining Yaman had serious heart and problems and claiming she was too ill to attend court. Judge Jonathan Rose received a series of eight letters over the next few months, excusing her from hearings which caused them to be adjourned. These letters were produced on official doctors' headed paper, including from the Brighton and Sussex University NHS Trust, and signed by named cardiac consultants, doctors and surgeons excusing Yaman's attendance on serious health grounds. But all the letters were false and had been forged by Yaman. Judge Rose eventually became suspicious and in December she was arrested in Sussex and admitted forging the documents and pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice. Yaman had previously been in prison in the U.S. for 18 months in 1982 for an offence of larceny - a common law offence for taking a person's property unlawfully. Philip Wakeham, defending, said Yaman had stolen from the BDT to fund 'a better lifestyle' and had used some of her money after she married a man from Turkey. He said she forged letters because she was scared of going to prison. Yaman was sentenced to three years in prison for the theft, fraud and false accounting and a further 16 months for perverting the course of justice. Sentencing Judge Rose told Yaman: 'You are a person who has proceeded with wicked determination, forged documents, and stolen money for your own selfish ends and with no care for those who would be so badly hurt, your only thoughts were for your own greed.' He told Yaman she had caused the destruction of a charitable enterprise and her crimes have had 'devastating consequences' on its employees. Judge Rose said the medical letters had been 'forged with no little skill'.","Anne Yaman was office manager for charity Bentham Development Trust .

"He sparked outrage amongst Jewish groups after releasing a pig-shaped balloon featuring the Star of David was released into the sky during a concert in Belgium. And now rock star Roger Waters, who has urged others to boycott Israel, has earned himself another enemy - Israeli model Bar Refaeli, who has demanded he stop using her image in his concerts.

Roger Waters has demanded a boycott of Israel - but used Israeli model Bar Refaeli in his concert's footage . Israeli model Bar Rafaeli tweeted to the rocker telling him to stop using her image . She told him that if he wanted to do a . boycott - which he says is aimed at highlight the Jewish state's 'apartheid and racist foreign policies' - he should boycott it fully. The 28-year-old posted to the outspoken rocker: 'Roger Waters, you better take my picture off of the video art at your shows. If you're boycotting - go all the way.' Her response is a stark contrast to her reaction in 2011 when she saw a picture of herself being used in one of Mr Waters' concerts. 'Crazy thing... Went to the Roger Waters show in Paris, and saw a pic of myself on the wall!!! #respect!!! I'm honoured [sic],' she tweeted, the Daily Telegraph reported.

As well as the Star of David, it also featured symbols of organisations and regimes from around the world. The balloon provoked a furious reaction from Israeli groups as well as fans from the concert. As reported by ynetnews.com, Alon Onfus Asif, an Israeli living in Belgium, said: 'I had a lot of fun, until I noticed the Star of David, on the inflatable pig. 'That was the only religious-national . symbol which appeared among other symbols for fascism, dictatorships . and oppression of people. 'Waters crossed the line and gave expression to an anti-Semitic message, beyond all his messages of anti-militancy.' Waters is a known activist and has previously pushed for the boycott of Israel.

'I have often come under attack by the pro Israel lobby because of my support for BDS, (Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions) which I won't go into here, anyone interested can access a speech I made at The United Nations on the 29th November last year. 'However I will say this, in a functioning theocracy it is almost inevitable that the symbol of the religion becomes confused with the symbol of the state, in this case the State of Israel, a state that operates Apartheid both within its own borders and also in the territories it has occupied and colonized since 1967. 'Like it or not, the Star of David represents Israel and its policies and is legitimately subject to any and all forms of non violent protest. 'To peacefully protest against Israel’s racist domestic and foreign policies is NOT ANTI-SEMITIC.' Pink Floyd achieved international acclaim with their progressive and psychedelic music.

"First it was the headquarters of Sony Pictures, then it was the Xbox and Playstaion networks, followed by the social media accounts of U.S. Central Command. Now it seems hackers have turned their sights to smaller targets after a traffic sign in downtown Los Angeles was altered to say: 'Read a f****** book.' Drivers at the interchange between South Hope Street and 4th Avenue in were left doing a double-take after the blunt message appeared on a digital sign placed next to road works. Blunt: Hackers targeting a Wifi-enabled road sign in downtown LA managed to change a message warning of possible traffic delays to say 'Read a f****** book' instead . A spokesman for Traffic Management Incorporated, which is in charge of the sign, confirmed that it had been hacked and had its initial message about possible journey delays changed. The spokesman said it is possible to connect to the sign over Wifi, so the hacker could have been using a laptop or smartphone to change the message. A second sign further down the road was also changed to carry the same offensive message . But she added that it was also possible to walk up to the sign and change the message manually. Journalist Daina Beth Solomon, who initially tweeted an image of the sign, confirmed that another one a few blocks away had also had its message changed. However the offensive message has now been cleared from both of the signs. Hackers have been hitting the headlines recently after a series of high-profile attacks hit corporations and government agencies. Sony Pictures had a set of confidential employee details and embarrassing email exchanges between senior staff leaked in the run-up to Christmas. The hack, which means Sony Picture's network is still out of action, was though to be carried out by cyber-spies working for North Korea. The movie-house was in the midst of launching The Interview, a film depicting the assassination of dictator Kim Jong-Un, when the attack took place. On Christmas Day Sony was targeted again, along with Microsoft, by a group known as the Lizard Squad, who knocked the Playstataion and Xbox online networks down for several days. The anonymous group brought the systems down just as millions of gamers were trying to play on the new consoles they had just been bought for Christmas. High-profile hackers have hit the headlines in recent months, including just two days ago after the social media accounts of U.S. Central Command were taken over by people claiming sympathy with ISIS . The group said it had performed the attack for a laugh, and to teach people the value of spending time with their families during the festive holidays. Islamic State affiliated jihadis also broke into the social media accounts of the U.S. Central Command on Monday night, changing images to black flags associated with radial Islam. They also posted several videos containing content sympathetic to ISIS, as well as publishing the addresses of serving American soldiers.","Wifi-enabled sign next to roadworks had message changed after hack .

"The United States is warming fastest at two of its corners in the Northeast and the Southwest, a new  temperature record analysis has revealed. Northeastern states - led by Maine and Vermont - have gotten the hottest in the last 30 years in annual temperature, gaining 2.5 degrees on average. But Southwestern states have heated up the most in the hottest months: The average New Mexico summer is 3.4 degrees warmer now than in 1984; in Texas, the dog days are 2.8 degrees hotter. Tourists walk close to misters to keep cool as they walk along The Strip during a heat wave in Las Vegas. An Associated Press analysis of federal temperature records shows Nevada's capital city, Carson City, has warmed the most in the last 30 years than any other city in the nation. Las Vegas came in sixth. To determine what parts of the country have warmed the most, The Associated Press analyzed National Climatic Data Center temperature trends in the lower 48 states, 192 cities and 344 smaller regions within the states. Climate scientists suggested 1984 as a starting date because 30 years is a commonly used time period and 1984, which had an average temperature, is not a cherry-picked year to skew a trend either way. The trend was calculated by the NCDC using the least squares regression method, which is a standard statistical tool. The contiguous United States' annual average temperature has warmed by 1.2 degrees since 1984, with summers getting 1.6 degrees hotter. But that doesn't really tell you how hot it's gotten for most Americans. While man-made greenhouse gases warm the world as a whole, weather is supremely local. Some areas have gotten hotter than others because of atmospheric factors and randomness, climate scientists say. 'In the United States, it isn't warming equally,' said Kelly Redmond, climatologist at the Western Regional Climate Center in Reno, Nevada. 'Be careful about extrapolating from your own backyard to the globe.'For example, while people in the East and Midwest were complaining about a cold winter this year, Redmond's Nevada and neighboring California were having some of their warmest winter months ever. To determine what parts of the country have warmed the most, The Associated Press analyzed National Climatic Data Center temperature trends in the lower 48 states, 192 cities and 344 smaller regions within the states. Climate scientists suggested 1984 as a starting date because 30 years is a commonly used time period and 1984, which had an average temperature, is not a cherry-picked year to skew a trend either way. Ten-year-old Easton Martin, of Mesa, Ariz., stops to cool off in a misting fan while walking along The Strip with his family in Las Vegas, one of America's warmest cities. The trend was calculated by the NCDC using the least squares regression method, which is a standard statistical tool. All but one of the lower 48 states have warmed since 1984. North Dakota is the lone outlier, and cooled slightly. Ten states - Maine, Vermont, New Jersey, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Delaware, New Mexico, Connecticut and New York - have gotten at least 2 degrees warmer in the past 30 years. Since 1984, 92 percent of the more than 500 cities and smaller regions within states have warmed and nearly two-thirds of them have warmed by at least a degree. The analysis of federal temperature records shows Carson City has warmed the most than any other city in the nation in the last 30 years. The average temperature in Carson City has risen 4.1 degrees since 1984. Boise, Idaho, came in second, posting a rise of 4 degrees. Las Vegas, known for its sweltering summers, was sixth, with an increase of 3.4 degrees. But it's the boost in summertime heat that really makes Carson City stand out. The average temperature for June, July and August has soared 6.8 degrees over the last three decades, 2.2 degrees higher than second-place Boise and 2.4 degrees above third-place Las Vegas. The summertime average is up from about 68 degrees to nearly 75. The regions that have warmed the most have been New York's St. Lawrence Valley, northeastern Vermont, northern Maine, the northeastern plains of New Mexico and western Vermont, all of which have warmed by more than 2.5 degrees. Cities - where data is a tad more suspect because they are based on a single weather station and readings can be affected by urban heating and development - see the greatest variation. Carson City, Nevada, and Boise, Idaho, are the cities that have seen the most warming - both year-round and in summer - since 1984. Both cities' average annual temperatures have jumped more than 4 degrees in just 30 years, while Dickinson, North Dakota, has dropped the most, a bit more than 2 degrees. Cities - where data is a tad more suspect because they are based on a single weather station and readings can be affected by urban heating and development - see the greatest variation. The Southwest warming, especially in the summer, seems to be driven by dryness, because when there is little water the air and ground warm up faster, said Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist at Texas Tech University in Lubbock. 'Heat and drought are a vicious cycle that has been hitting the Southwest hard in recent years,' Hayhoe said. And in the Northeast, the temperatures are pushed up by milder winters and warm water in the North Atlantic, said Kevin Trenberth, climate analysis chief at the National Center for Atmospheric Research. And less snow on the ground over the winter often means warmer temperatures, said Alan Betts, a climate scientist at Atmospheric Research in Pittsford, Vermont. The Southeast and Northwest were among the places that warmed the least. In the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic, industrial sulfur particle pollutants from coal burning may be reflecting sunlight, thus countering heating caused by coal's carbon dioxide emissions, said Pennsylvania State University professor Michael Mann.","Northeastern states  led by Maine and Vermont - have gotten the hottest in the last 30 years in annual temperature, gaining 2.5 degrees on average .

"A Latvian migrant was caught trying to smuggle his wife into Britain in a suitcase after she was twice refused entry to the UK. Bogden Croitor of Stanmore, London, had been given permission to live in Britain but officials twice refused to allow his Moldovan-born wife to join him. The 30-year-old travelled to Calais in October 2013 to spend the weekend with his wife in the French port town. Bogden Croitor was discovered trying to smuggle his Moldovan-born wife into the UK after customs officials stopped his car for a routine stop and search at Dover, pictured . Canterbury Crown Court heard how Croitor said his wife spoke of how she should join him in the UK and suggested hiding in his luggage. However, when entering the UK at Dover, customs officials stopped his car for a routine  search. They then found his wife hiding in his bag. Natasha Spreadborough, defending, said Croitor’s wife had made numerous applications for a visa but had been refused each time. Judge Adele Williams sentenced Croitor to 14 months jail suspended for two years. She told him: 'You could have absolutely no complaint if I had sent you to prison straight away because those who commit this offence normally always go to jail immediately. Croitor was sentenced to 14 months jail suspended for two years after appearing at Canterbury Crown Court, pictured . 'But I take the view that the way you committed this offence does have extraordinary mitigating circumstances attached to it.' Croitor was also given 100 hours of community service and ordered to pay £400 costs. It is thought he has returned to his home London after receiving the sentence while his wife has been deported to France.","Latvian migrant Bogden Croitor, 30, given permission to live in the UK .

"An animal charity has launched a spoof website which, upon first inspection, appears to let users 'exchange' their dogs for puppies. The Toronto Humane Society's thought-provoking campaign, dubbed PuppySwap, advertises a subscription service which allows pet-owners to browse through breeds, order puppies and then trade them in as soon as they get older and 'less cute.' 'PuppySwap isn’t real', the website admits. 'Unfortunately, pet abandonment is.' Scroll down for video . Puppy Swap: The Toronto Humane Society has launched a spoof website which, upon first inspection, appears to let users order a puppy and return it (pictured) once it grows up, in return for a new one . Pick me! The fake site advertises a subscription service which allows pet-owners to browse through breeds before picking their temporary 'new best friend' The tongue-in-cheek website features fake reviews from customers on specific breeds. For a King Charles Spaniel, one reads: 'They grow up way too fast. Great for the short term.' Similarly, a review on a Golden Retriever reads: 'Can't go wrong with a classic. On my fifth one already.' In an ad for the website, the chirpy voice-over states: 'The moment your puppy grows up, becomes a bother or gets less likable, simply log back into your account and swap out your old best friend for a brand new one.' Fake: 'PuppySwap isn’t real', the website admits after its initial sell (pictured). 'Unfortunately, pet abandonment is' Making a point: Users can browse breeds for puppies based on their 'social likability' and 'cute factor' According to the Toronto Humane Society, 180,000 animals enter Canadian shelters each year. Tragically, 40per cent will never leave. 'Help us spread the word,' says the website. 'Pet ownership is for life.' The ad, which has been seen over 80,000 times since it was uploaded to YouTube last week, has fooled a fair few viewers. Not just for Christmas: The tongue-in-cheek website features fake reviews from customers on specific breeds . 'What a f*****g stupid idea!! What's next? Baby swap? Then what the f**k will happen to the dog? How about its feelings? Just wrong in so many ways,' one commenter wrote. Others, who managed to watch the ad until the end, at which point all becomes clear, were more complimentary of the viral marketing effort. 'Great satire piece on a horrible thing humans do,' one surmised.","The spoof website was created by the Toronto Humane Society as part of an awareness campaign .
A staggering 180,000 animals enter Canadian shelters each year, many abandoned by their owners, and 40% of them will never find homes .
The fake site allows users to 'order' puppies online and then swap them when they grow up to be 'less cute'"
"A Florida sheriff's office inadvertently announced its trust in dogs. A rug in the lobby of the Pinellas County Sheriff's Office building was a sight to see. Not because of its forest green color or its yellow sheriff's emblem. But because it read 'In Dog We Trust.' The rug, placed at the building's entrance, should have read 'In God We Trust.' But a small typo quickly changed an age-old adage to a tribute to dogs. Rug: The Pinellas County Sheriff's Office inadvertently displayed a rug (photographed) at its building entrance that read 'In Dog We Trust' The $500 rug was removed from the lobby Wednesday after being there for months once a deputy noticed the mistake, ABC reports.
