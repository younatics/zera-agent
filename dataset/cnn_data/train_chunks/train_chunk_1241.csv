"The acting deputy U.S. attorney general in charge of overseeing 'public integrity' prosecutions testified Friday that he doesn't know who's in charge of the criminal investigation of Lois Lerner, the former IRS official at the center of the tea-party targeting scandal. David O'Neil, whose job atop the DOJ's criminal division puts him in charge of public corruption prosecutions, told Ohio Republican Rep. Jim Jordan that he also doesn't know how many prosecutors are assigned to the case, or how many attorneys from his division are working on it. Asked to identify the lead agent in the Lerner investigation, O'Neil would only answer, 'I'm sure that we can provide that information to you.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Rep. Jim Jordan has asked the Justice Department seven times for information about who is leading the Lois Lerner IRS investigation, but so far has received no information . Acting Assistant Attorney General David O'Neil said Friday that he's in charge of the DOJ division overseeing public-corruption prosecutions, but didn't know who is in charge of the Lerner probe . Republicans are incensed that . DOJ trial attorney Barbara Bosserman – a partisan who has contributed . nearly $7,000 to President Barack Obama’s campaigns and other Democratic . party coffers, has reportedly been appointed as the probe's point person. They have demanded the appointment of a special counsel to take over, passing a House resolution on May 2 that claimed the Obama administration has a 'conflict of interest' and that 'statements and actions of ... the Obama Administration in connection with this matter have served to undermine the Department of Justice's investigation.' Twenty-six House Democrats joined every Republican in voting yes. Jordan told MailOnline Friday afternoon that O'Neil's testimony 'is even further proof as to why a special counsel is needed to get to the bottom of the IRS scandal.' 'The DOJ investigation has been a joke, as evidenced by Mr. O'Neil's unfamiliarity with even the most basic details of the work being done by the division he oversees.,' Jordan said. 'We are talking about the IRS violating the First Amendment rights of Americans, and we deserve a real investigation that helps us deliver justice.' Lerner was found in contempt of Congress this week. She is accused of carrying out a politically motivated scheme to hamper conservative nonprofit groups' ability to raise money during the 2010 election cycle by slow-walking their applications for tax-exempt status. Jordan blitzed O'Neil, a former New York prosecutor, with questions about the 'investigation of targeting of conservatives by the Internal Revenue Service' during a hearing about U.S. marijuana policy. But he refused to concede that Jordan's description accurately reflected what the DOJ is investigating. 'I would disagree with that characterization. I don't – uh –,' he said, reiterating his objection a second time barely a minute later. Robert Mueller, then the director of the FBI, testified in 2013 that he also didn't have answers, and promised to provide them to Congress. So far, House Republicans have come up empty. Lois Lerner ran the IRS Exempt Organizations division until her retirement in late 2013, and is accused of leading an effort to hamstring tea party groups because of their political philosophy . An exasperated Jordan fumed at O'Neil that 'we've asked you seven times. We've sent seven different inquiries to the Department of Justice, and each time they can't tell us anything.' 'I oversee the public integrity section,' O'Neil said during a House Oversight subcommittee hearing, adding that 'yes,' he is involved in the case. He claimed there are 'numerous career federal prosecutors that are on that investigation.' But when Jordan asked him how many are in that group, complaining that he has 'been trying to get this answer now for 11 months,' O'Neill conceded, 'I can't tell you that answer sitting here today.' O'Neill also suggested that the Department of Justice is unlikely to appoint a special counsel. 'No,' he said. 'A special counsel is not warranted.' When the House found Lerner in contempt, it referred her to Attorney General Holder for prosecution, prompting an aide to a Texas Republican to call it 'the slime probing the slime.' The female staffer told MailOnline that 'if Holder ever opens the Lerner file ore than once, I'll strip naked on the National Mall and sing the president's favorite Al Green song.'","Attorney General Eric Holder has resisted calls for a special prosecutor in the IRS tea-party targeting case, insisting that his agency should handle it .

"A full one in five teen births is to an adolescent mother who already has one or more children, an alarming new report reveals. According to a Vital Signs report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 365,000 U.S. teenagers between the ages of 15 and 19 gave birth in 2010, and of those young women, 67,000 were repeat births. The study further states that while most new teenage mothers used contraception in the postpartum period, only 22 percent of them used a method of birth control considered to be highly effective at preventing another pregnancy. Baby maybe: A new study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that 18 percent of babies born to teen mothers in 2010 were their second or third child . The CDC states that the explanation for these statistics is complex, saying that the numbers vary based on socioeconomic status, geographical location, ethnicity, and education levels. For instance, Hispanics, American Indians, and blacks are all more likely to have a repeat birth than white teens. Those in states with the lowest health insurance coverage – Mississippi and Texas – were also highest for most teen birth rates. Having multiple children at a very young age can be harmful for both mother and baby, experts said. ‘Repeat births can negatively impact the mother’s education and job opportunities as well as the health of the next generation,’ CDC director Tom Frieden, M.D., M.P.H., said in a release. ‘Teens, parents, health care providers, and others need to do much more to reduce unintended pregnancies.’ Young women who have children in their teens are less likely to finish high school, go to college, or get a job, the CDC said, adding that children born to teenagers also are at a greater risk for health problems. Every additional child born to a teenage mother further limits her chances to succeed, the report says. Of the 365,000 teenagers who gave birth in 2010, 8,400 of them were third births, and 1,200 were fourth or higher. Factors: The study showed that education, ethnicity, and geography all played a role - Hispanic and black teens were nearly twice as likely to have more than one child in their teenage years . However, the report also notes that teen births, on the whole, are down to 31.3 live births per 1,000 women in the same age range – a record low. Leslie Kantor, the vice president of education for Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said in a statement: ‘When young mothers postpone a second birth, they have greater educational and job opportunities.’ She continued: ‘The best way to prevent teen pregnancy is by investing in effective sex education, encouraging teens to talk to their parents, and ensuring access to birth control.’ More than 365,000 teenagers ages 15-19 gave birth in the U.S. in 2010. According to Bedsider.org, many young people have misconceptions over how pregnancy happens, with a full one in six surveyed thinking that they cannot get pregnant simply because they have not yet conceived after having sex. The organization encourages parents of teenagers to talk to their children about practicing safe sex and the most highly-effective forms of birth control. Birth control implants and intrauterine devices (IUDs) are considered the most effective long-term birth control methods, as they are more than 99 percent effective in preventing pregnancy. The pill, condoms, patches, injection rings, and diaphragms are all less effective, and are more likely to be used improperly by teenagers. Most states in New England, including Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts, have some of the lowest teen birth rates in the country. Conversely, Texas, Oklahoma, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Arkansas have some of the highest – greater than 20 percent in those states. A study appearing in last month’s issue of ‘Contraception’ journal reported that most women have inaccurate perceptions about the safety and effectiveness of IUDs. The study, which was led by clinical assistant professor Lisa Callegari of the University of Washington, show that both ParaGuard and Mirena are more than 99 percent effective for up to seven years. Both are more cost effective than the pill after three years' use.","Of the 365,000 teenagers who gave birth in U.S. during 2010, 67,000 of those were repeat births .

"Obama administration officials told a gathering of all 100 U.S. Senators on Wednesday that they were kept in the dark about Saturday's prisoner swap because the Taliban warned that they would kill Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl if any information about the plan leaked to the public. But Georgia Sen. Saxby Chambliss, the senior Republican member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, says he and California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, his Democratic counterpart on the committee,  were told 'months and months' in advance when the Obama administration was planning to kill Osama bin Laden. 'It was like they didn't trust Dianne and me,' Chambliss said during an interview on the Fox News Channel, describing his frustration with being kept out of the loop on the Bergdahl hostage swap. 'And yet the two of us knew about the bin Laden event leading up to the takedown of bin Laden for months and months and months,' he said. Yes to the al-Qaeda raid, no to the Taliban trade: Sen. Saxby Chambliss told Fox News that the Obama administration briefed him and other Senate Intelligence Committee leaders about the Osama bin Laden kill raid 'months' in advance, and there were no public leaks . Navy SEALS killed terror mastermind Osama bin Laden in his Pakistan bedroom in 2011; senators were briefed 'months and months' in advance, Chambliss said so finds it hard to fathom that he wasn't trusted with plans for Bergdahl's release (right) 'It's just very puzzling about why they didn't notify anyone in Congress about what was going on,' Chambliss added, referring to the negotiations for Bergdahl's release. U.S. Navy SEALS killed bin Laden, the global leader of the al-Qaeda terror network, May 2, 2011 in a covert nighttime raid on his Abbottabad, Pakistan compound. No information about that operation became public until President Barack Obama announced the news in a triumphant White House event. The Associated Press first published an account of Wednesday's closed-door Senate meeting where lawmakers heard explanations from from the White House about why the Obama administration chose to carry out negotiations for Bergdahl's safe return in secret. Deputy National Security Adviser Tony Blinken delivered the presentation, according to two Senate staffers. He told senators that that the administration moved quickly and sought no congressional approval for the release of five Taliban terrorists from the Guantanamo Bay prison because of the Taliban's death threat against Bergdahl if the deal wasn't kept quite. A Senate Republican aide told MailOnline that few on Capitol Hill believe that rationale. 'It's a flimsy argument,' he said, requesting anonymity because he is not authorized to speak to the press. 'We have an intelligence committee that meets in a hermetically sealed room. If you can't trust them with the most sensitive information about what the White House is up to, we may as well pack it in and become a monarchy.' 'It's just so much BS. Now we're all going to wonder even more what the White House isn't telling us.' Big guns: Chambliss (L) is the Senate Intelligence Committee's vice-chair and ranking Republican while Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinsten (R) chairs the committee; then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton promised both that they would have 30 days' notice if anyone was transferred out of the Guantamano Bay prisoncamp . Deputy National Security Advisor Tony Blinken briefed all 100 senators on Wednesday, citing a Taliban threat to execute Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl if negotiations were leaked to the public as the reason for a hurried prisoner exchange without putting Congress in the loop . The Fox News interview with Chambliss first aired Wednesday on Greta van Susteren's evening program, and portions were re-aired Thursday afternoon. Van Susteren asked him if the White House also explained why the Senate wasn't notified about the 5-for-1 hostage trade 'five minutes before it went down.' 'I mean, why they didn't pick up the phone at the White House and call you and Senator Feinstein? It would have taken about 30 seconds.' Chambliss was on the same page. 'That was my question to Tony [Blinken],' he responded. 'You guys knew this was going down several days out,' he recalled telling Blinken. 'Why didn't you pick up the phone, particularly since Secretary Clinton had written to Senator Feinstein and me and said, ""We understand the law is we have to give you 30 days notice before the transfer of any Guantanamo detainee. We assure you we will give you that notice"".' 'My comment back to the administration,' Chambliss concluded, 'is that I'm not gonna believe anything they tell me from now on. ... 'How in the world can we trust the administration on anything they tell us?' Another Republican, Iowa Sen. Charles Grassley, demanded Thursday that Justice Department tell Congress whyis counseled the White House to move ahead with the Taliban trade in the absence of congressional input. 'Unfortunately, this is the latest instance in which the President has chosen to act unilaterally, without regard for Congress’s role, and contrary to a law he recently signed,' Grassley wrote to Attorney General Eric Holder. Obama signed the annual Defense Department authorization bill in December, which included the 30-day congressional notification requirement. 'The public deserves a full and transparent accounting of why the Administration believed it could disregard the law,' Grassley insisted.","Georgia Sen.

"Supermarkets throughout the UK are selling halal and kosher meat from animals that have not been pre-stunned before having their throats cut. It recently emerged that British retailers and restaurants are quietly switching to halal meats in their products and meals, leaving customers opposed to the practice - seen by some as causing unnecessary suffering to the animal - in the dark. Asda, Sainsbury's, Tesco and Morrisons all sell meat from non-stunned animals produced by specialist halal suppliers, such as the London-based Haji Babab Halal Meats. British supermarkets are selling halal meat, where animals are not stunned before they are slaughtered. Pictured, chickens after ritual slaughter in a halal abattoir in Burgundy, France . Both halal and kosher slaughter involve a religious ritual in which the throat is cut. But some animals are not stunned beforehand, leaving them in pain. A spokesperson from Tesco said: 'We offer a range of products to meet the needs of customers from all communities. 'As part of our commitment to provide our customers with a choice, we sell a range of frozen, chilled halal meat and convenience products in areas where there is a demand for them. 'All halal products we sell are clearly marked as such, to enable customers to make informed decisions about their purchases.’ A spokesman from Morrisons said: 'All halal and kosher products are very clearly labelled so there can be no mistake' Last week the Mail reported that all the major supermarkets are selling New Zealand lamb killed according to halal ritual without providing labels. Tesco says that by supplying halal products they are meeting the demands of their customers . Sainsbury's said: 'We do sell a selection of branded halal and kosher products in some stores, all of which is very clearly labelled' 'In New Zealand it is common for lamb to be blessed however we have never requested this and all of the meat we sell is from animals stunned prior to slaughter so it would be wrong to label our own-brand meat as halal,' a spokesman for Sainsbury's said. 'All of the own-brand meat we sell, . including New Zealand lamb, is from animals stunned prior to slaughter. Under no circumstances would we ever sell own-brand meat from an animal . that has not been stunned. 'We do sell a selection of branded halal and kosher products in some stores, all of which is very clearly labelled.' Graphic: Last month, undercover investigators secretly filmed inside a halal abattoir near Banham, Norfolk, as more than 100 sheep appeared to writhe in agony after being ritually killed . A statement from the British Retail . Consortium, which speaks on behalf of the industry, said: 'British . retailers know that animal welfare standards are a key issue for their . consumers. 'All own brand meat from major UK supermarkets comes from animals that have been stunned before they are killed and all our members have confirmed all their own brand fresh meat is from animals that have been pre-stunned before slaughter. 'However, we understand there are some customers who want meat from animals that have been slaughtered in accordance with strict religious protocols and in relevant stores meat produced by specialist producers is available with clear certification that is branded halal and kosher certified meat produced by specialist companies.' Separately, many restaurants such as Pizza Express, and KFC are selling halal meat – mainly chicken – without printing the information on menus. 'Permitted': Halal foods are those that Muslims are allowed to eat or drink under Islamic Shari'ah . The Conservative MP Philip Davies, who is leading calls for a new labelling law, said: ‘There is overwhelming public support for this change. People should be able to make an informed choice about what they are buying.’ Fast food giant Subway has removed ham and bacon from almost 200 outlets, and switched to halal meat alternatives in an attempt to please its Muslim customers. It has confirmed turkey ham and turkey rashers will be used instead in 185 of its stores, where all the meat will now be prepared according to halal rules. The chain, which has around 1,500 outlets across the UK, explained its decision by saying it had to balance animal welfare concerns with 'the views of religious communities'.","Major retailers across Britain selling meats from Islamic butchers .

"Forget muffin tops and crows feet, women are now seeking cosmetic surgery to banish signs of ageing on their hands. Cosmetic surgery clinics have . reported an 18 per cent increase in enquiries in the past month of . people having anti-ageing procedures on their hands. The new cosmetic surgery trend, which sees women having dermal fillers and laser resurfacing to reduce the signs of ageing, has been dubbed the banishing of 'Madonna Mitts' after popstar Madonna, 55, who has 'anti-aged' almost every part of her body but often resorts to fingerless gloves to cover her hands. Surgery trend: There has been a new wave in women seeking cosmetic surgery to banish their 'Madonna Mitts', the treatment has been named after the singer who famously covers her hands . As the years pass, skin on the hands thins, causing veins to become more prominent and liver spots to appear. While make-up can disguise tell-tale signs of ageing on the face, it's more difficult with hands - which is why it's often said that hands are the best indicator of age. Speaking about the latest cosmetic trend, a spokesman for the Transform clinic, which has seen an 18 per cent increase in the number of anti-ageing hand procedures perforemed, said: 'Our hands are exposed to the sun more frequently than other parts of the body and a failure to apply sun cream to hands as regularly as we do the face makes them susceptible to sunspots and accelerated aging. 'With the hot weather this summer we have experienced a marked increase in inquiries from women complaining of sunspots on their hands, along with the skin becoming thin and crepey. 'Hand rejuvenation is becoming increasingly popular, with dermal fillers volumising and smoothing the skin, encouraging the production of collagen to provide a youthful look. 'Laser resurfacing of the hands is also on the rise thanks to its ability to improve sun-damaged skin and reduce the appearance of sunspots.' The Private Clinic on Harley Street also offer a treatment to rejuvenate the hands and have seen a surge in enquiries. Their procedure takes fat from one part of the patient's body and injects it into the hands. It is done while the patient is awake and is designed to give long term rejuvenation benefits to the hands. Dr Dennis Wolf, fat transfer specialist at The Private Clinic, performing fat transfer to the hands on 57 year old Rosetta Citton. Before and after: Dr Dennis Wolf, fat transfer specialist at The Private Clinic, performed fat transfer to the hands on 57-year-old Rosetta Citton . Sandy Benson, 54, also had similar surgery at Transform because felt she was being . constantly aged by her hands, which over the years have lost their . youthful look so opted for the surgery. She said: 'Madonna is a great example of a woman who is trying to take care of herself in her 50s just like me. 'I can completely sympathise that her hands are the bit that gives it all away. 'My hands were thin and veiny and just looked much older than the rest of me. 'I'd abused them over the years and never taken care of them and as I got older they slowly got worse. First sign: While make-up can disguise tell-tale signs of ageing on the face, it's more difficult with hands - which is why it's often said that hands are the best indicator of age . 'Your hands are difficult part of your body, there's not a lot you can do with them to help and they're always exposed. 'I tried lots of creams, but they never worked. You can slather it on all you like but it doesn't put back the plumpness or elasticity. 'Your hands tell the story, everywhere else was fine as I could work on that by going to the gym and taking care of myself but my hands had driven me mad for quite a while. 'I do sympathise with Madonna, it's terrible when you work so hard and this one thing keeps letting you down. 'For me it got to the point where I would wear long sleeves and be pulling the cuffs down over my wrists because I don't like them. 'I would often fold my wrists in as well so people couldn't see my hands.' After doing nearly a year's worth of research Sandy opted for X fillers and decided to go to Transform and banish her ageing hands. The procedure- where filler is injected into the skin- takes around 30 minutes to be completed and claims to give instant results. And now Sandy believe her hands look even better than Madonna's. She said: 'Now I'm much more confident, I don't hide my hands away as much as they are better. 'I'd even say better than Madonna's now.' Dr Dennis Wolf, Joint Medical Director and fat transfer specialist at The Private Clinic of Harley Street, said: 'It is common for women, as they grow older, to lose weight in their hands, which means that veins and wrinkles can become more evident. Prolonged exposure to the sun will also speed up the ageing process. 'And while treatments like laser resurfacing to target the signs of ageing, or traditional fillers to make the hands appear fuller and healthier, can offer effective results, these can really only ever offer a temporary solution. Surgery: Dr Dennis Wolf performing Fat transfer to hands, which is done while the patient is awake and is designed to give long term rejuvenation benefits to the hands . 'A more long terms solution is fat transfer – a technique which is fast becoming one of the most popular for hand rejuvenation purposes. The procedure uses advanced technology to produce a pure and effective fat graft, which means that fat can safely be taken from one area of the patient’s body, such as their thighs or stomach, and injected into the hands. 'The fact that the procedure is minimally invasive is also an important factor. Many patients have careers which do not allow for them to be away from work for long periods of time. Fat transfer is a walk-in, walk-out procedure and one which is performed under local anaesthetic, so patients can undergo treatment without too much disruption to their lives. 'Over time I expect to see procedures such as this continue to grow in popularity, as women decide to invest further in different aspects of their appearance, later into life.'","18% increase in women having hand surgery .

"Arsenal are baulking at the total cost of a swoop for Real Madrid midfielder Sami Khedira. Having landed marquee signing Alexis Sanchez, the Gunners will now turn their attentions to signing a holding defensive midfielder. Khedira, who has just 12 months let on his contract at Real, features highly on Arsene Wenger's midfield hit list. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sami Khedira goes for the swimming trunks look in training . Head boy: Sami Khedira is on Arsenal's radar but the Gunners could baulk at the £20m-plus asking price . Moving on: Khedira could play alongside Mesut Ozil next season and, right, the German in action against Brazil . The club have made enquiries to gauge . the cost of a deal for Khedira. And despite the German remaining a . target, the financial outlay attached to the deal has cast doubt on a . potential move. The 27-year-old could cost in-excess of £20million despite the fact he has just 12 months left to run on his Madrid contract. In addition, Khedira is understood to want at least £150,000-per-week, a package that would make him Arsenal's best paid player. Arsenal have the financial capacity to complete such a move but committing £60million (including wages) to land Sanchez has taken a significant sum out of Arsene Wenger's transfer budget. Star man: Chile international Alexis Sanchez completed his £30million move to Arsenal on Thursday . Likewise, the Gunners have also agreed to pay Newcastle £11million for right-back Mathieu Debuchy. And with a new goalkeeper, centre-back and striker still on Wenger's radar, a move for Khedira could prove a step too far. Wenger is also hugely interested in Bayer Leverkusen midfielder Lars Bender. And a move for the Germany international is likely to have less strain on the club's finances. Gunners chiefs have already made contact with Leverkusen executives about their interest in Bender. Should a move for Khedira or Bender not materialise, Arsenal will turn to Southampton's Morgan Schneiderlin in their search for a new central midfielder.

"Average flaccid penis length is 3-4 inches; Jonah's is 8 inches . Has people stop him in the street and has received offers from porn industry . Was stopped at security for fear he was carrying a bomb in his pants . Jonah Falcon is something of a celebrity in his home city of New York for one very big reason: he is the owner of the world's largest penis. Measuring eight inches when flaccid and an impressive 13.5 inches when erect, the 41-year-old's XL asset hit the headlines recently when the huge bulge in his trousers caused a security alert at San Francisco airport. Today the well-endowed American told  This Morning that the experience was nothing new for him and that he doesn't see his over-sized appendage as anything special anymore. Scroll down for video . Proud owner: 41-year-old Jonah Falcon is the proud owner of the world's largest penis, measuring in at 13.5 inches . He said: 'I was amused. What was the worst that was going to happen? Would I have to pull it out for them? 'I have been doing that all my life. It was more annoying that I had a two hour delay.' Jonah, who is 5ft 9 and has size ten feet, realised from a young age that he was different from the other boys. The average length of a flaccid male organ measures in at 3-4 inches; Jonah's is double that at a staggering 8 inches in length. How big? Holly and Phillip struggle to get their heads around the size of Jonah's penis on the show . Depending on temperature, his penis can grow up to 13.5 inches when erect, something that has often taken his friends by surprise. He said: 'I went to a mostly Jewish school, and I was the only one who was uncircumsised so I always thought that was what my classmates were fascinated by.' Attention seeker: Jonah enjoys wearing tight cycling shorts to draw attention to his golden package . It wasn't under the age of nineteen that Jonah began putting his proud parts to the test. 'I was pretty promiscuous. I am an actor and an only child so very much a show-off. 'At baseball camp, people made a big deal out of it so then I just went hog wild,' he said. Up until the age of 25, Jonah was ruled by his surprisingly large penis, sleeping with lots of men and women: 'I was trying to boost my own self-esteem and when I learnt that then I crashed and got burnt out, gaining weight I stopped caring.' When it comes to relationships, Jonah, who has been single since 1996, finds that the women who stick around the longest are the older, more experienced one's.

'I am extremely into foreplay. 'I am a performer, when the other person gets excited and enjoys then I am happy. 'I do have to be turned on, patience is the key, don't expect me to get up immediately,' he said.

"The drive-by shooting of a female teacher 200 metres from her school in Pakistan yesterday has sparked calls for protection of the girl pupils being taught there. Shahnaz Nazli, 41, was on her way to the all girl's school where she worked in Shahkas, near the country's volatile tribal belt on the Afghan border, when two men on a motorcycle pulled up and opened fire. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack but there has been a strong Islamist militant movement against girls being educated in the region. Shot dead: Mother-of-one Shahnaz Nazli was gunned down by two men on a motorbike just 200m from the school where she worked in Shahkas near a volatile region on the Afghan border . The death of Ms Nazli, who was married with a young son, at the school near the town of Jamrud in Khyber tribal district, between the northwestern city of Peshawar and the Afghan border, has led to a petition for the government to do more to protect girls and teachers attending school. Local government official Asmatullah Wazir said: 'The teacher was killed after unknown gunmen on a motorbike shot her and fled. 'We have arrested 18 suspects in an operation to find the culprits.' Northwest Pakistan has been a hotbed of militant activity along the Afghan border with the Taliban banning all girls in the region from attending school. This latest attack comes after the attempted murder of teenage women's rights campaigner Malala Yousafzai by Taliban soldiers opposed to female education last year. Victim: Ms Nazli's death comes after the attempted murder of 14-year-old womens' rights campaigner Malala Yousafzai as she made her way home from school in Swat, northwest Pakistan, last year . The 14-year-old was heading home in a school van in the Swat Valley, a Taliban stronghold, when masked men stopped the vehicle. They demanded that the other girls identify Malala, who had written vocal pieces supporting women's right to an education. When they identified Malala, the militants shot her in the head and neck. Close to death, she was flown to Britain for treatment, and surgeons at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham saved her life. Fight for survival: Malala Yousafzai, survived a gunshot to the head after being flown to the UK for emergency surgery at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham . She had a five-hour operation to fit a titanium plate over her damaged skull. She also had a cochlear implant fitted as her injuries had left her partially deaf. Malala left hospital in January and started lessons at the fee-paying Edgbaston High School for Girls in Birmingham earlier this month. The schoolgirl's plight attracted international attention, and she became a symbol of the battle for girls' education around the world. Malala's school fees are being paid by the Pakistani government which has vowed to do more to fight for women's rights. Inspiring: Malala Yousafzai now lives in Birmingham and attends the Edgbaston High School for Girls .","Shahnaz Nazli, 41, was gunned down by two men on a motorcycle yesterday .

"A New Jersey woman has been arrested for killing a 22-year-old student who died after having her buttocks injected with silicone. Tamira Mobley, 28, was charged with assault and manslaughter on Monday by police investigating the homicide of Tamara Blaine. Miss Blaine, who had a young son, was found foaming at the mouth in a pay-per-hour Manhattan hotel last July. Victim: Tamara Blaine died after suffering a seizure in a New York hotel, where police believe she had gone for butt enhancement injections . Booking: Security camera footage shows Tamira Mobley arriving at the Liberty Inn hotel with Blaine in July 2013 . The young mom was rushed to hospital where she later died. During an autopsy, the medical examiner noticed puncture wounds on her buttocks. Dangers: A spate of deaths and serious injuries have been recorded as women seek out butt injections . Miss Blaine's death was ruled a homicide in October. Police believe she had gone to the Liberty Inn Hotel on July 8 last year to get butt injections. Security camera footage showed Mobley arriving at the pay-per-hour hotel with Miss Blaine on the day she died. Records show the 28-year-old also paid for the room on her credit card, and was at the hotel when police arrived, according to the New York Post. Mobley has admitted being with the victim on July 8, but she denied injecting her with silicone. Miss Blaine, from Brooklyn, had been . going to college part-time while caring for her young son,  Amari . Bermudez, who was born shortly after she graduated high school. When . police and emergency crew arrived at the Liberty Hotel, which describes . itself as a 'rendezvous for romance', she appeared to be suffering from . a seizure. The autopsy revealed two puncture wounds and traces of silicone were found in the young mom's blood. The injuries could not have been self-inflicted, the medical examiner said. There has been a concerning rise in the number of women seeking black-market injections, where silicone or other industrial-type fillers are injected to create a bigger butt. Many of the procedures are carried out by people with no medical training, and the injections can cause death or serious injury.","Tamira Mobley charged with manslaughter over death in July last year .

"Jese and James Rodriguez shot Real Madrid four points clear at the top of La Liga on Wednesday night as they beat Sevilla 2-1 despite a late goal from Liverpool loanee Iago Aspas. Carlo Ancelotti’s team took the points at a price with three key players ruled out of Saturday’s Madrid derby – first Sergio Ramos hobbled off hamstrung, then James Rodriguez, who had scored the first, went off with a metatarsal injury, and Marcelo was then booked meaning he will be suspended for the next game if Real are unsuccessful with a planned appeal. Sevilla also lost a player before the break with keeper Beto taken to hospital after clashing with Karim Benzema. Despite losing their keeper and going 2-0 down in the first half Sevilla made it difficult for Real with substitute Aspas reminding his manager Unai Emery and Liverpool coach Brendan Rodgers, that he knows where the goal is. James Rodriguez scored the goal of the game as Real Madrid beat Sevilla 2-1 during their La Liga encounter on Wednesday night .

Subs not used: Navas, Hernandez, Carvajal, Borges. Goals: Rodriguez 12, Jese 36 . Booked: Varane, Marcelo, Isco . Sevilla (4-3-3): Beto (Rico Gonzalez 35); Figueiras, Carrico, Kolo, Navarro; Krychowiak, Iborra, Mbia; Deulofeu (Vidal Parreu - 54), Bacca (Iago Aspas 67), Vitolo . Subs not used: Suarez, Andujar Moreno, Arribas, Munoz Munoz . Goals: Aspas . Booked: Figueiras, Carrico, Navarro, Mbia, Vidal Parreu, Vitolo . Referee: Ignacio Iglesias Villanueva . Attendance: 65,500 . Sevilla started the game brightly with Vitolo denied in a one-on-one with Casillas inside two minutes. Ramos then overstretched in a challenge and had to hobble off holding his hamstring. Madrid took the lead four minutes later when  Rodriguez had the time and space to allow a Marcelo cross to bounce in front of him before heading it home. It was Rodriguez’s eighth league goal which is more than Angel Di Maria managed in any of his four seasons at Real Madrid. The Colombian has banished all lingering doubts that Real Madrid were wrong to replace one with the other last summer. Sevilla were by no means out of the game and when Vitolo slipped a pass through for Vicente Iborra the midfielder might have equalized but instead hit the post. With Sevilla’s next attack he again found space unmarked but this time his shot was saved by Casillas and Carlos Bacca couldn’t reach the rebound. Having already seen Ramos go off Madrid lost James Rodriguez to a right foot injury that Madrid will hope is not a metatarsal break. Jese was the logical change. The next man down was Sevilla keeper Beto who was flattened by Karim Benzema. The Portuguese keeper felt the full force of the Frenchman’s knee as both went for a Jese cross inside the six-yard box. For the second game running the Sevilla keeper was unable to finish a game and just as last weekend; he was replaced by substitute goalkeeper Sergio Rico. The first thing Rico had to do was pick the ball out of the back of the net. Bacca gave possession away and Isco took over spraying it wide right to Benzema whose intelligent pull-back was intended for Jese. Isco almost intercepted it but let it run for the substitute who drilled it past Rico. Bale then fed Alvaro Arbeloa and his pull-back was fired just wide by Benzema. Sevilla had the chances to be ahead but could easily have found themselves 3-0 down. It was little wonder they were losing their heads. Diogo Figueiras was booked for hacking down Jese and Fernando Navarro followed him into the book for a foul on Bale. Real were dealt a blow before Rodriguez's opener though when defender Sergio Ramos (right) appeared to pull a hamstring . The Spain international (centre) had to walk off the pitch injured on nine minutes and was replaced by Nacho . Raphael Varane was then booked for handball as Real did their best to coast to half time. Bale had been left alone by the boo-boys in the first half and he wowed the crowd inside the Bernabeu with a delightful scooped pass that played in Sami Khedira only for the German to squander the chance. The ridiculous debate about the effectiveness of a player who has won four trophies in less than two seasons scoring in three finals will continue, but most sensible Madrid fans accept Bale’s enourmous contribution. M’bia kicked, and trod-on, Khedira just before the break and was lucky to only be booked – the last thing Madrid needed was a third enforced first half change. The second half started with Real looking to finish Sevilla off as soon as possible. Bale created, but then missed, the first chance cutting in from the right and with Benzema in space to his left the boo boys had their chance but never took it. The extent to which the abuse aimed at Bale should not be taken seriously can't be underestimated – moments later Jese smashed a shot against the frame of the goal from a tight angle with other options on and there was nothing but applause for the local boy. Bale the serial trophy-winner remains the outsider; Ronaldo had the same problem not so long ago. Real doubled their lead on 36 minutes when substitute Jese (left) finished from close-range against Sevilla . The 21-year-old wheeled away in celebration after scoring Real's second goal of the night on Wednesday .

Beto (left) is looked after by Benzema but is soon replaced by Rico Gonzalez after the head injury . Gareth Bale (left) was a constant menace to the Sevilla defence throughout the match at the Santiago Bernabeu . Bale was suffering at the hands of the opposition and Fernando Navarro should have seen his second yellow of the night when he up-ended the former Tottenham man. Madrid were now in full flow and Benzema failed to finish a sweeping move down the left that involved Jese and Marcelo. Sevilla brought on Liverpool loanee Aspas and with ten minutes left he pulled a goal back for the visitiors. Sevilla’s man of the match Vitolo dribbled along the byline from the left and Aspas tapped in from inside the six-yard box. The striker grabbed the ball from the back of the net and charged back up for the restart. Madrid had been showboating with only Vitolo’s dive over Arbeloa’s leg, for which he was booked, their only chance. The late goal meant Ancelotti’s team had to nervously count down the last few minutes but they held out. Aspas had proved a point, but Real Madrid had taken all three. Iago Aspas (far right) celebrates his strike for Sevilla as he pulled one back for the visitors on 80 minutes .

"A fragment of a child's skull dating back some 1.5million years offers some of the earliest evidence that early humans were hunters who ate meat regularly, scientists say. The piece of bone discovered in the Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania, has signs of nutritional deficiencies commonly caused by a lack of meat in its owner's diet, suggesting early man needed meat to thrive. The discovery by a team of researchers led by Manuel Domínguez-Rodrigo from Complutense University, Madrid, suggests early human ancestors began eating meat much earlier in history than previously believed. 'Needed for survival': An analysis of a fragment of human skull dating back 1.5million years shows deficiencies caused by a lack of meat, which suggests that meat was an important part of the diet of early man . The skull fragment identified is thought to belong to a child somewhat younger than two and shows bone lesions that commonly result from a lack of B-vitamins in the diet. Previous studies have suggested that early hominids ate meat, but whether it was a regular part of their diet or only consumed sporadically was not certain. Now, the researchers suggest that the bone lesions present in this skull fragment provide support for the idea that meat-eating was common enough that not consuming it could lead to anaemia. Nutritional deficiencies such as anemia are most common at weaning, when children's diets change drastically. The research suggest that the child may have died at a period when he or she was starting to eat solid foods lacking meat. Developmental problems: This fragment of a child's skull discovered at Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania, shows the oldest known evidence of anaemia caused by a nutritional deficiency . Alternatively, if the child still . depended on the mother's milk, the mother may have been nutritionally . deficient for lack of meat. B vitamins are a group of water-soluble vitamins which play vital roles in healthy cell metabolism. Once regarded as a single vitamin, later research showed they are distinct chemicals which often coexist in the same foods. B vitamins are found in whole unprocessed food, with processed carbohydrates like sugar and white flour containing much less than their unprocessed counterparts. Lack of B vitamins causes a range of problems ranging from acne to anaemia. Good sources include whole grains, potatoes, bananas and lentils. But vitamin B12 in particular is only available from animal sources, making deficiency a concern for those unable or unwilling to eat meat. Both . cases imply that 'early humans were hunters, and had a physiology . adapted to regular meat consumption at least 1.5 million years ago', say . the researchers. The . evidence that early man ate meat as an integral part of his diet comes . as leading scientists are beginning to warn that the entire world may . have to become almost entirely vegetarian to handle spiralling . populations. Researchers . from the Stockholm International Water institute warned in August that . animal-based food will have to drop to just 5 per cent of our total . calories by 2050. 'There . will not be enough water available on current croplands to produce food . for the expected 9 billion population in 2050 if we follow current . trends and changes towards diets common in western nations,' the . researchers warned. It . is believed that if current population growth continues, there could be . an additional 2billion people alive by 2050. Humans currently get about . 20 per cent of their protein from animal-based products. The latest findings were reported in a paper published yesterday in the open access journal PLoS ONE.

"Diana Dudas, the British woman swept away in Spain after flooding in town of Vera Almeria . The picture from Facebook, shows Diana . Dudas,  the 'lovely, very warm, very caring' British expat who went missing amid severe flash flooding in Spain. The 52 year old was reported missing in the town of Vera, Almeria, after . torrential rain hit the area leaving at least 10 others dead. Her friend Genny Sutcliffe, 56, said Mrs Dudas had a Spanish husband, Javier, and had lived in Spain for many years. She said: 'I was told that her body . was found washed up in the lagoon. I’m not sure exactly when it was that . she went missing, but the heavy rain started on Thursday night.' Mrs Sutcliffe said she did not believe Mrs Dudas had any children, but had other family living in the UK. She had her own holistic therapy clinic and hairdressers in the town and had just written a book. Mrs . Sutcliffe added: 'She was absolutely lovely, very warm, very caring and . with a great sense of humour. We are absolutely devastated.' A woman surveys the damage in the city of Vera in Almeria, Spain, as the death toll in the wake of severe flooding in the south of the country reached nine . Floods: Torrential downpours in the Spanish regions of Murcia and Andalucia have already claimed nine lives . She said her own home had not been affected by the flooding as she lived on higher ground. Speaking of where Mrs Dudas went missing, she said: 'The devastation in that area is horrendous. 'I saw a house that had a car that had been swept into its front garden and a car in its back garden. 'A lot of people aren’t going to be able to return to their homes for months.' A spokeswoman for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said it was looking into the incident and liaising with local authorities. An extensive search was launched for Mrs Dudas after her husband reported her missing. Hundreds of people have been evacuated from their homes after torrential rain led to flash flooding in the Andalucian provinces of Malaga, Almeria and Murcia. She is thought to have vanished during torrential rain on Friday morning as she headed for work at her health salon in Vera.

Dozens of roads have been closed and two motorway bridges have collapsed. Jackie Broad, 58, said her home in Mojacar, Almeria, was too high up to be flooded but she had seen cars get washed away by raging torrents of water. She said: 'The river at the bottom of our road has burst its banks. There was a lot of water, in some places up to the roofs of shops and houses.

"Being overweight in your 30s triples the risk of dementia in later life, warn researchers. A new study shows that being fat in your ‘midlife’ years is likely to accelerate the loss of memory and other brain skills. Oxford University researchers found the age at which a person is obese is a key factor – with the highest risk of developing dementia found in those who are very overweight in their 30s. They say the risk of dementia may be raised or lowered depending on the age when weight gain runs out of control. Being fat in your 'midlife' years increases the risk of dementia, a new study has shown . The increased risk of dementia fell the later in life obesity was diagnosed, according to the study of almost half a million people. Those who were obese past age 70 were no more likely to develop dementia than those who were not obese. The researchers looked at English hospital records from 1999-2011, during which 451,232 of those admitted to hospital were diagnosed with obesity. The small time span means that although only 19 people who were obese in their 30s in the study went on to develop dementia, they did so at a relatively young age – while still in their 40s or early 50s. The rate was more than three times higher than would be expected by this age, when compared to the rates for other age groups. For those in their 40s, the equivalent extra risk fell to 70 per cent, for those in their 50s it dropped to 50 per cent, while those in their 60s had a 40 per cent extra risk, according to the study published online in the Postgraduate Medical Journal. Obese people in their 70s were neither more or less at risk of developing dementia, while those in their 80s were 22 per cent less likely to develop the disease. Study leader Professor Michael Goldacre, of Oxford University, said: ‘Despite the study limitations, there is nonetheless an age effect that is striking and consistent with other studies. It cannot be lightly ignored, given the prevalence and importance of both obesity and dementia.’ Jacob Catley, 14, pictured modelling a pair of 44-inch waist school trousers at Just School Wear in Nottingham . Shops are stocking school uniforms in size XXXXXXXXL – in an ‘appalling’ sign of the growing childhood obesity crisis. It comes as researchers warn the age at which someone is obese is a key factor in the risk of developing dementia. Blazers up to a 56in chest and trousers up to a 46in waist are available from stockists ahead of the school year – nearly double the national average waist size for an 11-year-old. The latest government figures reveal one in ten reception pupils and one in five Year 6 students are classed as obese. Tam Fry, from the National Obesity Forum, said their research showed that in the next 15 to 20 years, 50 per cent of the UK population will be overweight. He said: ‘It really is an appalling situation we find ourselves in and very disturbing that we are seeing school uniforms going up to waist sizes of 50 inches. ‘Unfortunately, a significant amount of adults do not eat properly and this is passed down to their  children. Something drastic needs to be done to combat this.’ Nationally the average waist size of 11-year-old boys and girls is 27.5in – which is 3in more than in 1978 for boys and 4in more for girls. The obesity crisis has seen supersize school uniforms flying off the shelves, with PE kits also available in sizes up to XXL. The growing concerns for Britain’s children are highlighted by NHS guidelines that suggest even adult men with a waist of 37in or more could experience weight-related health problems. Lisa Phillis, sales director at supplier Just School Wear in Sherwood, Nottinghamshire, said: ‘Over the past five years we have been supplying many more larger uniforms. ‘A few years ago we were seeing average waist sizes of 26 to 28in. ‘Now the norm is around 30in for a senior boy. But we do have up to 46in.' Experts do not know exactly why obesity impacts on the risk of dementia, although hardening of the arteries and high blood pressure play a role. Previous research has also shown that abdominal obesity has a particularly harmful effect on the brain, probably because it is ‘metabolically active’, releasing more of the acids that raise heart disease risk, along with factors that increase blood pressure and blood sugar. Dr Clare Walton, of the Alzheimer’s Society charity, said: ‘The finding that people who are obese in their 30s are three times more likely to get dementia is striking, but it is difficult to draw firm conclusions from a study where only 19 of the 451,232 people observed were obese in their 30s and went on to develop dementia. Given the growing body of evidence that being overweight in mid-life rather than in later years seems to be the bigger risk factor for dementia, it is never too early to start making healthy lifestyle choices.’ Dr Eric Karran, director of research at the Alzheimer’s Research UK charity, added: ‘One limitation of the study is that the data for obesity came from hospital admissions so it is hard to gauge the risk in people who were obese but did not need to be hospitalised.’","Being fat in 'midlife' years likely to accelerate loss of memory and brain skills .

"Rare Andy Warhol paintings of Elvis Presley and Marlon Brando will hit the auction block at Christie's in New York City later this year, and are expected to fetch a rather nice sum. Triple Elvis (Ferus Type) and Four Marlons rate among Warhol's most famous portraits. The monumental paintings, each nearly 7 feet high, have never appeared at auction before and could bring a combined total of $130 million when they go up for bid on November 12. Christie's said they are being sold separately, and estimates for each were not yet available. Scroll down for video . The Godfather: Andy Warhol's Four Marlons, a silkscreen that shows the Hollywood actor on a motorcycle and black leather jacket, an image that's repeated four times . All shook up: Triple Elvis (Ferus Type), which is going on the auction block at Christie's in New York this November . The Elvis, executed in ink and silver paint in 1963, depicts the rock 'n' roll heartthrob as a cowboy, armed and shooting from the hip. The Brando silkscreen, created three years later, shows the Hollywood actor on a motorcycle and black leather jacket, an image that's repeated four times. Both are being sold by German casino company WestSpiel, which acquired them in the late 1970s for one of its casinos. 'Given the current strength of the market, especially for works by Andy Warhol, it is now the right moment to part from these works,' WestSpiel director Lothar Dunkel said in a statement. Warhol produced a series of 22 images of Elvis. His Double Elvis (Ferus Type) sold for $37 million at Sotheby's in 2012. The appetite for Warhol works appears unstoppable. Last fall, his Silver Car Crash (Double Disaster) sold at Sotheby's for $105.4 million, an auction record for the artist. 15 minutes plus: Warhol has seen his paintings increase drastically in price at auction over the past few years . Record: Last fall, Warhol's Silver Car Crash (Double Disaster) sold at Sotheby's for $105.4 million, the most ever paid for one of his works . It is still not known who purchased the painting. Brett Gorvy, Christie's international head of post-war and contemporary art, said Warhol loved repetition and used it 'both as a way of creating a narrative ... and a way of really commenting on society.' The repetition in Triple Elvis, also had a cinematic feel, said Gorvy, adding, 'You have that sense of cinematic motion of ultimately the gun shooting while it's a static image.' Gorvy called the Brando extremely rare, with only one other four-times Brando in the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art in Copenhagen. A Double Marlon sold at Christie's for $32.5 million in 2008.","Two rare paintings done by Andy Warhol will go on auction November 12 at Christie's in NYC .

"Arrested: Amber Fellenbaum, 21, has been charged with child endangerment for allegedly witnessing the beatings of 3-year-old Scott McMillan but doing nothing to stop them . A third person has been arrested and charged in connection to the beating death and alleged torture of a 3-year-old boy in Pennsylvania. Jillian Tait, 31, and Gary Lee Fellenbaum, 23, were charged Thursday with murdering Tait's son, Scott McMillan in what Chester County District Attorney Thomas Hogan has referred to as 'an American horror story'. The couple allegedly hung little Scott by his legs, tortured him for weeks and smashed his head into the wall before beating him to death. Police arrested Fellenbaum's wife, 21-year-old Amber Fellenbaum, who allegedly witnessed the beatings but did nothing to stop the violence. The woman has been charged with child endangerment for failure to call police. Photos taken by investigators inside the trailer home they shared with Fellenbaum's 21-year-old estranged wife, Amber, and three children have now been released. They show the mattress where the youngster died, the whips that were allegedly used to beat him and holes in the wall where Fellenbaum is said to have repeatedly smashed the youngster's head. A bent, metal curtain rod was also found, which attorneys believe was another item used during the child's relentless torment, which is believed to have lasted for weeks before his death. The pair from Chesco, Pennsylvania, are said to have gone car shopping, bought pizza, had sex and took a nap as Tait's unresponsive  son lay dying. The torture included being beaten with blunt objects, tied to a chair with electrical tape and several punches to the face and stomach. When his body was taken to the emergency room, nurses are said to have wept at the sight of his injuries. 'American horror story': Scott McMillan, three, was tortured for weeks and beaten with a frying pan until he eventually died, prosecutors in Pennsylvania have said . Arrested: Jillian Tait, 31, and Gary Lee Fellenbaum, 23, were charged Thursday with murdering Tait's son. Officials said they had sex and went to order pizza as the boy lay dying . Torture tool: The Chester County District Attorney came across a horrifying scene when they entered the pair's trailer home in Pennsylvania. This is one of the whips that was believed to have been used to strike Scott . Sickening: Investigators found holes in the wall where Fellenbaum had allegedly smashed Scott's head . Death bed: The mattress where Scott was put on after Fellenbaum allegedly beat him until he was unresponsive is covered in blankets and clothes. The pair had sex and ate pizza as Scott lay there dying . 'This is just evilness,' Chester County District Attorney Thomas Hogan said at a press conference on Friday. 'It is an unspeakable act of depravity.' He also said that Tait's elder son also showed signs of abuse. 'It is going to take us years to put him back together again physically and mentally,' he said. They are accused of laughing as the boy was hung upside down and whipped, striking him repeatedly with a frying pan, and eventually beating him to death. The abuse had been going on for months, but the beatings and violence intensified between Sunday and Thursday last week. Announcing the charges on Thursday, Hogan said: 'Let me tell you about an American horror story. Little Scotty McMillan is dead. 'Over a three-day period… he was systematically tortured and beaten to death. He was punched in the face and in the stomach, he was scourged with a homemade whip, he was lashed with a metal rod, he was tied to a chair and beaten, he was tied upside down by his feet and beaten, his head was smashed through a wall and at the end of that he had bruises on top of bruises all over his body.' 'When his body went into the emergency room our ER nurses — who see a lot of terrible things — when they saw his body, they wept.' Holding back tears he said: 'Say a prayer for little Scott McMilan. The brief nightmare that was his life is over.' Weapon: A bent curtain rod was also found, which attorneys believe was another item used to hit the boy . Sickening: Another whip, put together using electrical tape which was also used to tie Scott to chairs, was found on the floor in another part of their home . Pain: Prosecutors said Scott had gone through weeks of torment, but the torture intensified last week when the youngster refused to eat his breakfast . Hogan concluded that his team would be seeking the death penalty as the victim was under 12 and there are allegations he had been tortured. The couple met working at Wal-Mart and last month moved in together, along with Fellenbaum's estranged wife and three children — Tait's six and three-year-old sons and the Fellenbaums' 11-month-old daughter. The six lived in a mobile home park in West Caln Township, Chester County, about 35 miles northwest of Philadelphia. The three adults told authorities 'that Scott McMillan had been punched and beaten with blunt and sharp objects, whipped, taped to a chair with electrical tape and beaten, hung up by his feet and beaten, and suffered other acts of violence,' police said in affidavits released Thursday. Amber Fellenbaum, 21, was charged with child endangerment for allegedly failing to help the toddler. She ultimately called 911 Tuesday night, authorities said. Scene: The pair were living in a trailer with Fellenbaum's estranged wife and three children — Tait's 6- and 3-year-old sons and the Fellenbaums' 11-month-old daughter . By then, Scott had been unresponsive for hours, and had been put in a shower for more than 30 minutes by his mother and her boyfriend, investigators said. When the boy failed to awaken, they placed him on an uninflated air mattress and went out shopping, authorities said. Fellenbaum had severely beaten the boy for refusing to eat toast both Monday and Tuesday morning, authorities said. The 'discipline' included throwing him against a wall, knocking him off a chair with a punch and then taping him to the chair to keep him upright for more beatings, police said. It was not immediately clear if any of the adults have lawyers. Tait told police that she also took part in the abuse and saw the scars on her younger son, court documents said. Her older son also showed signs of abuse, authorities said. She and Fellenbaum are being held without bail after their arraignments Thursday. They are scheduled for a preliminary hearing on November 14. When authorities searched their home, they only had one picture of Scott. Prosecutors also showed off pictures of the weapons that were used. Included in the items were a makeshift whip, a curtain rod, an aluminum strip and photos of holes in the wall where Fellenbaum slammed Scotty and his 6-year-old brother's heads into the wall, according to NBC Philadelphia. Horrific: The couple met working at Wal-Mart and only moved in together last month along with Fellenbaum's estranged wife and three children . On the night that the youngster died, Tait told police that she and Fellenbaum left Scotty on the mattress so he could sleep then went out to pick up pizza for dinner. At that time, Tait told police that she and Fellenbaum engaged in sexual activity then she took a nap, according to investigators. After waking up around 7:30 pm Tait said she found Scotty wasn't breathing so she screamed for someone to call 911. Amber Fellenbaum then called 911 and medics arrived. A judge denied bail to both Fellenbaum and Tait at a Wednesday arraignment. Hogan announced a total of 16 charges against Gary Fellenbaum including first- and third-degree murder charges, homicide, endangering the welfare of a child, assault and reckless endangerment. Tait faces 15 charges including the most serious murder charges, according to court records. According to Chester County's Daily Local News, Fellenbaum picked on the younger boy because he didn't know what was happening and tried to resist. The older boy, who was six, tried not to irritate Fellenbaum any more by struggling. In a statement to investigators, Tait admitted that  she participated in the assaults on the brothers. An affidavit states: 'During one incident, Gary hung Scott and (his brother) up by their feet one at a time and beat the boys while they were hanging upside down'(Tait) stated the she and Gary were laughing during the incident.' Amber Fellenbaum, 21, Gary's estranged wife, was was charged with child endangerment for allegedly failing to help the toddler. Her mugshot following her arrest is right . Scott had been unable to eat the breakfast of toast and cinnamon sugar that Fellenbaum made for him and kept spitting it out. She said she and Fellenbaum tried to force the toast into his mouth but that he still would not eat. Fellenbaum, angry at the child, began punching him in the stomach and face, and took him to his room where the two continued punching him. At some point, she said, Fellenbaum picked the child up by his back and slammed him into a wall, according to the affidavit. On Tuesday, when the child woke up he had very red, swolen face. Again he didn't eat breakfast, so Fellenbaum said he was being disrespectful. He then punched him so hard that the boy fell off of his chair. Fellenbaum then put him back on the chair as he squirmed, took out some electrical tape and tied the boy's feet. He also strapped his arms to the posts of the chair so they were elevated. Fellenbaum began punching Scott again, causing him to vomit and become unresponsive, according to the police documents. The pair, according to the affadavit, then tried to wake the boy up. Failing to do so they allegedly put him in a bath of ice cold water and changed his closed. Fellenbaum is believed to have seen this as another sign of disrespect, so put the boy on the mattress and left the house to go and collect pizza. When they returned he will still unresponsive, so Tait said she ate some of the pizza then had sex with Fellenbaum. Hogan added that there had been no warning signs to suggest the boys were being abused. Scott was a student at Rainbow Elementary School, but staff members never reported suspicious bruises or injuries. However, Scott had not been at school for two weeks.","Jillian Tait, 31, and Gary Lee Fellenbaum have been charged with murder .

"Drink-drive crash: Tracy Watts was four times over the legal alcohol limit when she crashed her sports car . A police officer is facing jail after she admitted crashing a sports car while four times over the drink-drive limit after binge drinking on a bottle of vodka. Tracy Watts was arrested after crashing her MG TF into a bollard along Southend seafront, Essex, while heavily drunk. Watts admitted she had drunk a bottle of vodka when questioned by cops at the scene of the early evening crash. The 31-year-old appeared at Southend Magistrates’ Court today wearing a black suit, white blouse and sky blue jumper. She hung her head as she appeared in the dock and pleaded guilty to a single charge of drink-driving. Watts, who worked as a WPC for City of London Police, was warned she faces up to six months in jail when sentenced. Lead magistrate Roger Harbidge said: 'This makes for very disturbing reading and it is only good fortune you did not injure anyone else. 'You must understand a custodial sentence is very likely in this case.' Watts will now have to wait to discover her fate while a full probation report is prepared. The court heard how Watts collided with a bollard along Eastern Esplanade, in Southend, at around 7.15pm on March 26 this year. Police and an ambulance rushed to the scene where Watts admitted to officers from Essex Police that she had consumed a bottle of vodka before the crash. No other people were injured and Watts was rushed to a local hospital and a blood sample was taken. She recorded a blood-alcohol level of 320mg of alcohol in 100ml of blood - four times over the UK drink-drive limit of 80mcg per 100ml. Watts, from Shoeburyness, Essex, resigned from her role as a City of London police officer less than a fortnight after the crash. Crash site: The seafront in Southend, Essex, where Tracy Watts crashed her car in March. Today she admitted drink-driving and warned she faces jail . Miss Bo-Eun Jung, mitigating, said her client had underlying drink problems and was working to deal with them. She told the court: 'My client has underlying psychological and alcohol problems which are being looked at.' Watts was given unconditional bail and received an interim banning order meaning she is disqualified from driving until the outcome of the case. She is due to be sentenced at Southend Magistrates’ Court later this year.

"The Nepalese embassy on one of London's most exclusive streets could be sold for more than £100million - sparking anger among Gurkhas. The exclusive property is situated in Kensington Palace Gardens in west London which is one of the world's most exclusive roads with homes rarely coming onto the open market. The potential sale has sparked anger among . the Nepalese in the UK and abroad, because of the close links between Britain and Nepal. If the property is put up for sale, it is bound to spark interest from some of the world's richest people. Exclusive property: The Embassy of Nepal on Kensington Palace Gardens which could be sold for more than £100million . Billionaire's row: The privately-guarded road by Hyde Park is one of the most exclusive streets in Britain . Nepalese government officials have sent a committee to London to explore the option of selling 12A Kensington Palace Gardens. The guarded street, dubbed 'Billionaire Boulevard', is home to embassies, ambassadors and a number of top businessmen. Number 12A, built in 1865, was gifted to the Nepalese in 1937 as a thank you for the heroic help from the Gurkhas to the British armed forces. Soldiers regard the Victorian Villa as a priceless part of their history. Nepalese foreign ministry spokesman Arjun Thapa said they have not yet decided whether to sell the property. 'I want to make it clear to you that the government has not taken any . decision, so it all depends on the recommendation of the team,' he told the BBC. 'Better to die than be a coward' is the motto of the world-famous Nepalese Gurkha soldiers who are an integral part of the British Army. They still carry into battle their traditional weapon - an 18-inch long curved knife known as the kukri. After suffering heavy casualties in the invasion of Nepal, the British East India Company signed a peace deal in 1815, which allowed it to recruit from the ranks of the former enemy. Following the partition of India in 1947, an agreement between Nepal, India and Britain meant four Gurkha regiments from the Indian army were transferred to the British Army, eventually becoming the Gurkha Brigade. Since then, the Gurkhas have loyally fought for the British all over the world, receiving 13 Victoria Crosses between them. More than 200,000 fought in the two world wars, and in the past 50 years they have served in Hong Kong, Malaysia, Borneo, Cyprus, the Falklands, Kosovo and now in Iraq and Afghanistan. They serve in a variety of roles, mainly in the infantry but with significant numbers of engineers, logisticians and signals specialists. The name 'Gurkha' comes from the hill town of Gorkha from which the Nepalese kingdom had expanded. The exclusive Number 12A Kensington Palace Gardens was given to Nepal as a thank you to the Gurkhas who served in the British armed forces. They . pay a nominal £1,000 a year rent on the crown lease, but the mansion - . which has remained untouched for half a century - requires more than . £5million in essential repairs. The rundown property, which backs onto Palace Green, has been described as a 'national embarrassment' in its current condition. Toilets don't flush, the roof needs . repairs and visa applicants are greeted by the sound of pressure cooker . whistles from upstairs. But . despite the 32,000 square foot property's dilapidated state, there is . likely to be a bidding war the moment the property is officially made . available. Trevor Abrahmsohn, from Glentree Estates, sold Bernie Ecclestone's house on Kensington Palace Gardens to Lakshmi Mittal in 2004. He . is familiar with the Nepalese embassy but believes it will need tens of . millions spent returning the property to its former glory. The . agent said: 'The building has the most remarkable, majestic . entertaining reception overlooking the garden. The entrance hall and the . grand staircase are quite extraordinary. For sale? The Nepalese government have sent a committee to London to consider selling off the exclusive property . 'It . is evident that in its heyday this property was one of the grandest . mansions in the capital but very little has been spent on it in the . interim and it does appear to be stuck in a time warp. 'The property will probably need considerable restoration and refurbishment that could mean anything up to £40 million. 'With . all the embassies in the road, security is probably higher than any . other private road in the UK. This is why it is so sought after amongst . oligarchs who crave their privacy and protection. 'The mansions in the road are surrounded with sizeable gardens and that is unique in central London. 'Of course, once you exit this road you are literally in the centre of London. 'Since . there are very few properties in this road available at any time, of . the few people able to afford it, there could certainly be a bidding . war.' Gary Hersham, director . of Beauchamp Estates, added: 'The house is spectacular and worth £100 . million-plus. There will be no shortage of interest.' With . house values on Kensington Palace Gardens standing at around . £6,000sq/ft, a fully restored 12A could be worth around £180 million. However, . any potential sale will be met with disgust by the proud Nepalese, who . regard the four-storey mansion as an enormously important part of their . nation's history. Heritage: The exclusive No 12A Kensington Palace Gardens was given to Nepal in 1937 as a thank you for the work of their Gurkhas in the British armed forces . It was the country's first embassy and the lease was extended for another 99 years in 1980. Major Tikendra Dal Dewan, from the British Gurkha Welfare Society, described the mansion as 'precious'. He said: 'We understand the government sent a committee of seven to look at the property but no decision has been made yet. 'There is a strong emotional side to the story. We have had a relationship for 200 years with the UK through the Gurkhas and this is a unique building to us. Exclusive address: The guarded street, dubbed 'Billionaire Boulevard', is home to embassies, ambassadors and a number of top businessmen . 'It is a very precious thing to us and we have written to the ambassador about it and strongly aired our views. 'We want to pressurise the government to change their decision. It is a unique bond that we have with the UK, and no other countries have the same relationship.' Kensington Palace Gardens is owned entirely by the Crown Estate so only leasehold sales are possible. The road is next to Kensington Palace, the residence of the the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, and has some of the world's most impressive homes. Exclusive: A 12-bedroom mansion on Kensington Palace Gardens which was bought by Britain multi-billionaire steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal . Embassy street: The Russian Ambassador's official residenence on Kensington Palace Gardens . Despite making up just 29 properties, it is estimated the total value of the properties is in excess of £3.4billion. The entire 2,600 properties in the Cotswolds town of Chipping Norton, in comparison, make up just one sixth of the value of Kensington Palace Gardens. It has the Russian, Lebanese, Romanian, Slovakian, Czech and Norwegian embassies along with the ambassadors' homes of a number of countries. The Saudi royal family, as well as the Sultan of Brunei have homes as does Russian oligarch Len Blavatnik and Foxtons founder Jon Hunt. The Mittal family own several homes.","Run down embassy in Kensington Palace Gardens needs urgent repairs .

"Extraordinary: The clips show inhabitants of Colditz in a more relaxed light, joking around and smiling for the camera . Colditz may have been a notorious Nazi prisoner of war camp, but a newly-unearthed film shows its inmates and guards still found time to fool around. The extraordinary footage – the only . known film of prisoners and guards inside the camp – was found . 70 years after it was shot. It will be screened for the first time on Channel 4 tonight. The clips show inhabitants of the camp in a more relaxed light, joking around and smiling for the camera. The grainy colour film also shows prisoners gathered for a roll call in the isolated Renaissance  castle, which formed the most secure prison camp in the Third Reich. Colditz, . near Leipzig, Dresden, and Chemnitz in the state of Saxony, was built . on the side of a cliff above the Mulde river in the 11th Century. It . gained international fame as a prisoner of war camp during the Second . World War for 'incorrigible' Allied officers who had repeatedly escaped . from other camps. The . castle housed around 500 Allied officers, among them the legendary . Battle of Britain pilot Sir Douglas Bader, and was meant to be . impossible to escape from. But Allied officers made a series of . daring attempts and by the end of the war it boasted one of the highest . records of successful escapes. The castle only received its first Americans in August 1944. They were 49-year-old Colonel Florimund Duke - the oldest American paratrooper of the war - Captain Guy Nunn, and Alfred Suarez. They were all counter-intelligence operatives parachuted into Hungary to prevent it joining forces with Germany. When U.S. troops liberated Colditz in April 1945, 31 prisoners had successfully reached home after more than 300 attempts. Twelve Frenchmen made it home, 11 Britons, seven Dutch and one Pole. Captured on film: Rare footage of guards fooling around at Colditz will be shown on Channel 4 . At one point during the film, a group of four officers is seen laughing as they cross the bridge leading to the castle entrance. One produces a pistol and waves it at the others, one of whom responds by drawing his sword. In another scene an officer is shown gazing out of a castle window and doffing his cap to the camera. Two officers are also seen out and about in the East German town, with one offering a Nazi salute whilst his colleague laughs. Scroll down for video . Fooling around: A still from newly-discovered film showing first moving pictures from inside the infamous Colditz Prison . Unearthed: The grainy colour film also shows prisoners gathered for a roll call in the isolated Renaissance castle . The new documentary tells the story of one of the most infamous prisoner of war camps of the Second World War . The most infamous of the more than 100 PoW camps in Germany was of course in Colditz Castle. Officially . known as Oflag IV-C, it was used to house Allied soldiers who had . already been recaptured after fleeing from other camps, and was supposed . to be escape-proof. Instead, . many of the highly motivated men there dedicated all their waking hours . to finding new ways to outwit their German captors, meaning it was left . with one of the highest escape rates of all. Outrageous . schemes included manufacturing German uniforms, dropping out of windows . 100ft high, and even building a glider in the loft. Among . the prisoners were Desmond Llewelyn (pictured above), who resumed his . acting career after five years in Colditz and achieved fame as Q in the . James Bond films. Other . well known POW records to be released include that of Viscount George . Henry Hubert Lascelles, who was seventh in line to the throne at the . time of capture, and imprisoned in Colditz from 1944 until the end of . the war. Some of the daring . escapes from Colditz have also been immortalised in TV's 1970s Colditz . series and on film in The Colditz Story. More sinister footage shows hundreds of prisoners lined up for a roll call and exercising in the yard, walking in twos and threes. The footage was shot by Walter Langar, a logistics and supply officer, who spent several weeks at Colditz early in the war. It was bought by memorabilia collector Karl Hoeffkes, who alerted the castle authorities when he recognised the footage. Tom Cook, the director, told The Daily Telegraph: 'It is very unusual to see German officers having a laugh. 'This is the first time the film has been broadcast anywhere in the world. 'It is the only known film footage of prisoners at the castle and is a very exciting find. 'Although Colditz is well-documented through still photography, we have never before been inside the castle in such a way with film.' The film will be shown at 9pm today on Channel 4 during the documentary Escape from Colditz which also features the story of one of the most audacious escape plots. Prisoners managed to construct a glider from materials including bedsteads, floorboards, cotton sheets and porridge and planned to fly out of the camp. Now, 67 years later, a team of engineers . has attempted to reconstruct and launch the Colditz Cock, as it was . known, and lay the mystery of whether it would have worked to rest. In total there were 186 Allied escape . attempts before the camp was liberated on April 16, 1945. The first of . 11 Britons to make a 'home run' was former Northern Ireland Secretary . Airey Neave, who disguised himself as a German officer and walked out of . the camp during a theatrical production through a trap door prisoners . built under the stage. History is remade: The glider after crash-landing in front of the castle . There was one major difference between the original (pictured) and the replica - the Forties glider was built to carry two prisoners, but in 2012 a polystyrene dummy, nicknamed Alex, sat in the cockpit while the aircraft was steered by remote control . Prisoners of war: Some of the British servicemen who were held in Colditz . The . glider, though, was never tested because the castle was liberated by . the Americans before the prisoners had a chance to try. Sixteen . British prisoners had built the two-man glider behind a false wall in . the prison attic, in a space just 20ft by 7ft. Forty more acted as . lookouts. They fashioned . tools from bedsteads and iron window bars and made the wing spars from . floorboards, the glider skin from cotton sheets and the control wires . from electric cable. The finished glider spanned 33ft 9in and was 19ft . 7in long.

"Begging for forgiveness: Gary Oldman has issued a grovelling apology over his controversial new Playboy interview . Gary Oldman has made a grovelling apology after saying Hollywood is a 'town run by Jews' in his now infamous Playboy interview. The Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes star made the comments as he claimed Mel Gibson was being unfairly ostracised over his anti-Semitic rants, while also complaining that political correctness 'is c**p.' And after he was attacked over his choice of words by the Anti-Defamation League, he issued his fawning apology, in which he hailed Jews as 'the chosen people.' In a statement addressing the 'gentlemen' of the organisation, which was printed on Deadline, he wrote: 'I am deeply remorseful that comments I recently made in the Playboy Interview were offensive to many Jewish people. 'Upon reading my comments in print - I see how insensitive they may be, and how they may indeed contribute to the furtherance of a false stereotype. 'Anything that contributes to this stereotype is unacceptable, including my own words on the matter.' The 56-year-old Dark Knight Rises star went further as he tried to distance himself from his statements in the forthcoming edition of the pornography magazine, insisting he is a huge admirer of the contribution Jewish people have made to showbusiness. He said: 'If, during the interview, I had been asked to elaborate on this point I would have pointed out that I had just finished reading Neal Gabler’s superb book about the Jews and Hollywood, An Empire of Their Own: How the Jews invented Hollywood. 'The fact is that our business, and my own career specifically, owes an enormous debt to that contribution. 'I hope you will know that this apology is heartfelt, genuine, and that I . have an enormous personal affinity for the Jewish people in general, . and those specifically in my life.' He then finished by begging for forgiveness, going as far as to say he is unworthy of using a Hebrew greeting meaning 'peace be upon you.' The working class actor, who is the son of a welder, said: ''The Jewish People, persecuted thorough the ages, are the first to hear God’s voice, and surely are the chosen people. Scroll down for video . Oldman's controversial interview has derailed his tour promoting Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes . 'I would like to sign off with “Shalom Aleichem”—but under the circumstances, perhaps today I lose the right to use that phrase, so I will wish you all peace.' Gary, who is in the middle of promoting his forthcoming Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes film, caused outrage after claiming Mel Gibson is 'all right,' despite the actor's previous use of anti-Semitic and racist epithets. He also claimed the current vogue of political correctness was rife with hypocrisy. The Dracula star insisted: 'Mel Gibson is in a town that’s run by Jews and he said the wrong thing because he’s actually bitten the hand that I guess has fed him - and doesn’t need to feed him anymore because he’s got enough dough. 'He’s like an outcast, a leper, you know? ''But some . Jewish guy in his office somewhere hasn’t turned and said, “That f***ing . kraut” or “F*** those Germans,” whatever it is? We all hide and try to . be so politically correct. That's what gets me.' Gibson, . 58, made anti-Jewish slurs when he was arrested for suspected . drink-driving in Malibu in 2006, two years after his film The Passion Of . The Christ was criticised for depicting Jews negatively. 'He's alright': Gary claimed 'everyone' has used racial slurs like Mel Gibson and should forgive him . His words prompted an angry backlash, with antisemitism group the Anti-Defamation League's national director Abraham H. Foxman saying: 'He should know better than to repeat and give credence to tired anti-Semitic tropes. 'Mel Gibson’s ostracization in Hollywood was not a matter of being ""politically incorrect,"" as Mr. Oldman suggests, but of paying the consequences for outing himself as a bigot and a hater. 'It is disturbing that Mr. Oldman appears to have bought into Mr. Gibson’s warped and prejudiced world view.' He also added the assertion Jews control Hollywood is, 'an anti-Semitic stereotype based on the ""Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion,"" the 19th Century anti-Semitic forgery that suggested Jews conspire to control major industries such as banking and finance.' The apology is the latest piece of backpeddling from the English star's camp, with his manager Douglas Urbanski earlier saying: 'This notion that he's defending Mel and Alec is preposterous. Gary Oldman would not defend hate speech or any divisive speech. The piece lacked a kind of balance on that regard.'

"Former Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick has been convicted of corruption charges today, ensuring a return to prison for a man once among the nation's youngest big-city leaders. Jurors found Kilpatrick guilty of a raft of crimes, including a racketeering conspiracy charge. He was portrayed during a five-month trial as an unscrupulous politician who took bribes, rigged contracts and lived far beyond his means while in office until fall 2008.

The government presented evidence to . show he got a share of the spoils after ensuring that Ferguson's . excavating company was awarded millions in work from the water . department. Business owners said they were forced to hire Ferguson as a subcontractor or risk losing city contracts. Separately, fundraiser Emma Bell said she gave Kilpatrick more than $200,000 as his personal cut of political donations, pulling cash from her bra during private meetings. A high-ranking aide, Derrick Miller, told jurors that he often was the middle man, passing bribes from others.

"Astronomers recently spotted seven galaxies that appeared around 13.1 billion years ago - 700 million years after the Big Bang. Where the galaxies came from initially confused the experts because they seemed to appear almost out of nowhere, very rapidly. But now the team behind the observations suggest the previously hidden cluster of stars appeared when a cosmic 'fog' cleared. These colour composite images from the Subaru Telescope show the seven galaxies found in the study, as they would have looked 13.1 billion years ago - but their sudden appearance is a bit of a mystery. They have a red colour due to the effects of cosmic expansion on their light . The latest discovery, published in the Astrophysical Journal, was made by a team of astronomers at the University of Tokyo using the Subaru Telescope in Japan. Although earlier galaxies have been spotted by the Hubble Space Telescope, the telescope is significant as it looks for a particular type called Lyman-alpha Emitters (LAEs). The universe was born in the Big Bang some 13.8 billion years ago. In its earliest epochs, it was filled with a hot 'soup' of charged protons and electrons. As the newborn universe expanded, its temperature decreased uniformly. When the universe was 400,000 years old, conditions were cool enough to allow the protons and electrons to bond and form neutral hydrogen atoms. That event is called 'recombination' and resulted in a universe filled with a 'fog' of these neutral atoms. Eventually the first stars and galaxies began to form, and their ultraviolet light ionised (energised) the hydrogen atoms, and 'divided' the neutral hydrogen into protons and electrons again. As this occurred, the 'fog' of neutrals cleared. Astronomers call this event 'cosmic reionisation' and think that it ended about 12.8 billion years ago - about a billion years after the Big Bang. The timing of this event - when it started and how long it lasted - is one of the big questions in astronomy. LAEs were primitive, low mass galaxies and are among the oldest types known in the universe. They are thought to have been the progenitor for modern, Milky Way-type galaxies. Using the telescope, the team, led by graduate student Akira Konno and Dr Masami Ouchi, were looking to find the role LAEs played in an event called 'cosmic reionisation'. When the universe was 400,000 years old, conditions were cool enough to allow the protons and electrons to bond and form neutral hydrogen atoms. That event is called 'recombination' and resulted in a universe filled with a 'fog' of these neutral atoms. Eventually the first stars and galaxies began to form, and their ultraviolet light ionised - or energised - the hydrogen atoms, and 'divided' the neutral hydrogen into protons and electrons again. As this occurred, the 'fog' of neutrals cleared. Astronomers call this event 'cosmic reionisation' and think that it ended about 12.8 billion years ago - about a billion years after the Big Bang. The timing of this event - when it started and how long it lasted - is one of the big questions in astronomy. To investigate this cosmic reionisation, the Subaru team searched for early LAE galaxies at a distance of 13.1 billion light years. 'At first we were very disappointed at this small number,' Mr Konno said. 'But we realised that this indicates LAEs appeared suddenly about 13 billion years ago. 'This is an exciting discovery. We can see that the luminosities suddenly brightened during the 700 to 800 million years after the Big Bang. What would cause this?' The latest discovery, published in the Astrophysical Journal, was made by a team of astronomers at the University of Tokyo using the Subaru Telescope (pictured) in Japan. Although earlier galaxies have been spotted by the Hubble Space Telescope, Subaru is significant as it looks for Lyman-alpha Emitters (LAEs) In the team's analysis, they suggest neutral fog that once filled the universe began to clear about 13 billion years ago, which resulted in LAEs suddenly appearing for the first time. Shown left is a distant LAE and right is what one might look like from up close . According to the team's observations, one reason that LAEs appeared very quickly is cosmic reionisation. LAEs during the time of cosmic reionisation became darker than their actual luminosity due to the presence of the neutral hydrogen fog. In the team's analysis, they suggest the possibility that the neutral fog filling the universe was cleared about 13 billion years ago and LAEs suddenly appeared in sight for the first time. 'However, there are other possibilities to explain why LAEs appeared suddenly,' said Dr Ouchi, the principal investigator on the programme. 'One is that clumps of neutral hydrogen around LAEs disappeared. Another is that LAEs became intrinsically bright. 'The reason of the intrinsic brightening is that the Lyman-alpha emission is not efficiently produced by the ionised clouds in a LAE due to the significant escape of ionising photons from the galaxy. 'In either case, our discovery is an important key to understanding cosmic reionisation and the properties of the LAEs in early universe.'","Astronomers recently found galaxies that seemed to appear from nowhere .

"Jailed: Kelly Harrison, 30, was sentenced to 27 months in prison for actual bodily harm and false imprisonment . A drug-fuelled girl gang who turned on their friend torturing her for four hours, threatening to cut off her fingers, pour acid in her face and dump her body in a river has been jailed after they posted pictures of the horror attack on Facebook. Terrified Becky Miller, 21, was tied . to a chair, and was slashed, burned with a cigarette lighter and kicked . in the ordeal in Birkenhead, Merseyside, which has left her scarred for life. Her four tormentors laughed as their victim screamed and begged to be freed and at one point the mother-of-one was told she would . 'never see her baby again' because her body would be dumped in a river. She was also made to clean-up her own blood from the floor after being punched in the nose. Liverpool Crown Court heard the four girls were so obsessed with . Facebook they instantly posted shocking photos of the crime on their . social networking sites. But their pride over what they had done became part of their downfall after the images were used to help put them behind bars. Unemployed Jocelyn Keating, 21, her . cousins Ashleigh Gray, 20, and Kelly Harrison, 30, and Marie Frank, 22, . showed no remorse when they appeared in the dock. They have been jailed for a total of seven years for actual bodily harm and false imprisonment. The attack in February last year has left Miss Miller afraid to go out and needing psychiatric counselling. The court heard that trouble flared on a 'night in for . the girls' which descended into a fight after several hours or snorting cocaine and drinking vodka and brandy. After the attack Miss Miller only managed to escape after a row broke out between the gang and she fled, cowering behind a car. Former shop-owner Harrison had invited Keating and Gray to her £175,000 flat in East Float Dock in Birkenhead where, with Frank, they spent the evening drinking and taking drugs with Harrison's four-year-old daughter Precious was asleep in another bedroom. Miller arrived at the flat when Harrison and Gray picked her up from Liverpool when they were returning from picking-up more cocaine for the second time that night. Jurors heard how Harrison's sister, . who was not named in court, complained she had been 'jumped' while on a . night out, blaming Miller for the attack. After spending several hours drinking and taking drugs 'the atmosphere changed' for the worse at around 3:30am and there was a fight between Miller and Jocelyn Keating. Attackers: Jocelyn Keating, 21,  left, was jailed for 22 months, whilst Marie . Frank, 21, right was sentenced to 20 months, both for actual bodily harm and . false imprisonment of Becky Miller, 21, at a house party in . Merseyside . Prosecution counsel Mr Neville Biddle QC said: 'Miss Miller was begging to call a taxi and to be allowed to go home. 'But she was punched in the nose by Ashleigh Gray who made her clean the floor of her own blood before Jocelyn Keating dragged her around the floor. Kelly Harrison then slapped her and she heard someone say 'cut her fingers off'. 'There was an attempt to tie her up and she was told she would never see her baby again and one of the 'fellas' was coming round to pour acid on her face. 'Keating then took pictures and posted them on Facebook before she and Gray burned the jacket and her hair. Miss Miller told police 'they just kept burning me and burning me'.' As the attack continued Miss Harrison and Miss Frank laughed as threats were made on their victim's life, as she screamed and begged them to let her go. Frank was reported to have said: 'If I kill you I would get away with it because I'm a schizophrenic.' Miss Miller managed to escape at 7:30am when an argument erupted between her tormentors, she fled the flat and cowered behind a car where she used a mobile phone dial to 999 but before police arrived another resident came to her aid. Miss Miller was too scared to go near to the flat but when officers arrived they arrested the four women, despite their attempts to clear-up incriminating evidence. Crime scene: The four-hour ordeal took place at Kelly Harrison's flat in East Float Quay in Birkenhead . In the 16 months since the attack she has been too frightened to go out socially and is scheduled for psychiatric counselling. Each of the defence counsels told Judge Graham Morrow QC that the four felt 'remorse' for what took place and pleaded for leniency, saying they had troubled pasts. At their trial Miss Harrison and Miss Frank were convicted on charges of causing actual bodily harm and false imprisonment. Miss Keating, Miss Gray, pleaded guilty to similar charges. Sentencing them Judge Morrow QC said: 'Keating and Gray did most of the attacking and Frank did the least but Harrison it was your flat and your daughter was there. 'Each of you embarked on a campaign of mindless and atrocious violence which forced your victim to genuinely fear for her life. I can sum-up your crime simply - you tortured her. 'While you witnessed Miss Miller giving evidence I saw that you showed no emotion. There is only one sentence to impose and that is a custodial one.' Keating, who pleaded guilty, was jailed for 22 months, while Gray was sentenced to 21 months detention in a Young Offenders Institute. Harrison was jailed for 27 months and Frank was sent down for 20 months. A restraining order was also imposed prohibiting any of them, friends, or agents from contacting their victim Miss Miller for five years.","Becky Miller was tied to a chair, slashed, burned with a cigarette and kicked .

"Sir Bruce Keogh's Government report has called for tighter laws surrounding cosmetic surgery including the introduction of insurance . The British Association of Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS) is to start offering insurance to patients who undergo plastic surgery with accredited surgeons. Until now, no insurance policy for cosmetic surgery and the associated complications existed in the UK. The move comes after a Government enquiry into cosmetic surgery were published last month. Medical director Sir Bruce Keogh called for new laws to overhaul the £2.3billion sector. Two of the key demands cited in the report was for insurance to be provided by clinics and information for patients about the success rates of their surgeons. BAAPS represents the vast majority of NHS practitioners and is the only plastic surgery society to conduct a yearly audit of the procedures performed by its members. It worked with specialist insurers Lloyd’s of London to create a policy that would safeguard all patients of surgeons who are part of the association. Because all BAAPS surgeons are covered by the insurance, patients do not need to take the insurance out themselves. The price of cover will be included in their quote for the surgery. The new ‘Aesthetic Surgery Commitment’ or ‘ASC’ policy covers corrective treatment of all the most common complications of surgery, such as infection or bleeding, but also – a world first – capsular contracture, an abnormal reaction of the body to breast implants. Up to one in ten women who undergo breast enhancement may develop this condition, but historically would have had to pay for corrective surgery themselves. Sir Bruce Keogh's Government report has called for tighter laws surrounding cosmetic surgery including the introduction of insurance . BAAPS President Rajiv Grover said: ‘In line with Sir Bruce Keogh’s recommendations for more safeguards in the aesthetic surgery sector, we are [launching] a truly innovative insurance package that will further protect our patients. ‘No procedure is risk-free and ASC covers all common complications, so people undergoing surgery with BAAPS members can enjoy peace of mind that they will be looked after, in the unlikely event of any problems.’ The most popular surgical procedures are included in the policy including tummy tucks, eyelid surgery, arm lifts, breast augmentation, ‘moob’ reduction (gynaecomastia), liposuction, facelifts, pinning back ears and fat grafting. Common complications such as infection, haematoma (bleeding), seroma (build-up of fluid), nerve injury and others are also covered. Many conditions can develop a month or longer after the procedure is undertaken – and in the case of capsular contracture, it could be several months - so the policy automatically activates on the twenty-ninth day after the op and remains live for two years, as during that initial period hospitals would cover any complications.","British Association of Plastic Surgeons offering world-first insurance .

"Australia are desperately seeking a new coach for their European tour following Ewen McKenzie’s shock resignation on Saturday. The Wallabies are due to fly north on Friday but their preparations were plunged into crisis as McKenzie abruptly ended his turbulent reign by quitting shortly after Australia succumbed to an agonising 29-28 defeat by New Zealand in Brisbane. His position had appeared untenable as the Australian RU were thought to have begun discreetly sounding out potential replacements for the former Queensland Reds coach, who took over last summer. Ewen McKenzie handed in his resignation as Wallabies coach hours before his side's clash with New Zealand . Australia were leading the All Blacks 28-22 with seconds remaining before Malakai Fekitoa's late try . Kurtley Beale has been at the centre of several scandals in the Wallabies set-up over the past few weeks . He had been under siege after suspending maverick back Kurtley Beale for sending offensive texts about the Wallabies’ team business manager Di Patston, who promptly resigned. McKenzie was then forced to deny having a personal relationship with Patston. Bill Pulver, the ARU chief executive, blamed McKenzie’s departure on a media campaign against him. Australia are weeks away from games against the Barbarians, Wales, France, Ireland and England, and 11 months before the World Cup where they will be grouped with England and Wales. Former South Africa coach Jake White and Waratahs’ Michael Cheika are potential successors but Pulver said: ‘I don’t even know who can get on a plane on Friday.’ Australian Rugby Union boss Bill Pulver criticised the media's behaviour towards McKenzie in recent weeks .","Ewen McKenzie quit his role as Australia head coach hours before team's 29-28 defeat against New Zealand in Brisbane .

"Andy Murray has paid tribute to the fans who have helped him to the brink of sporting history today at Wimbledon. As he prepares to step out on to Centre Court shortly before 2pm to face Novak Djokovic in his quest to become the first Briton to win the men’s singles in 77 years, he said: ‘It is a shame the stadium isn’t bigger.’ On his way to the final, especially in the latter rounds when he has lost crucial points or sets, Murray has been reminded of the formidable weapon that the faith of 15,000 people brings to his armoury. Title shot: Andy Murray is hoping to become the first British Wimbledon champion since Fred Perry in 1936 . Don't choke! This  was Novak Djokovic getting a tweak from his physio . yesterday, but the world No.1 can expect  to be stretched much further . by Murray this afternoon . ‘When I am on the court the support . has been unbelievable at the end of matches,’ he told The Mail on . Sunday. ‘That is what you need if you want to try to win these events.’ Many neutrals were won over by Murray’s tearful address to the Centre Court following his defeat by Roger Federer last year. Now he hopes to harness that . heartfelt support as he faces an equally dangerous opponent in his bid . to become the first British champion since Fred Perry in 1936. ‘When . you are on the court you are obviously just in the moment,’ he said. ‘You know what is going on in the crowd, but there so many other people . out there, loads of people obviously just queue to watch on the hill. It . is just a shame that the stadium isn’t bigger.’ It will be tough conditions for both . Murray and Djokovic out on centre court as temperatures are set to soar . to 30C (86F) in west London. Murray-mania sparked a late rush for tickets yesterday – with one seller asking nearly £84,000 for a pair. Prices for debenture seats on legal secondary ticketing websites have soared way past their normal levels – peaking with that high of £83,785 on Viagogo. That is also a record for the firm. A pair of tickets to sit in Block 318 – just behind the Royal Box – hit £71,703 on website Seatwave, including a £10,800 booking fee. Thermometers at Heathrow and Kew . Gardens in the capital nudged 28.1C (82.6F) yesterday, but those . temperatures are set to be put in the shade today. Matt Dobson, a forecaster with MeteoGroup, said: 'We are looking at temperatures of between 26C (78.8F) and 29C (84.2F) across many inland parts of England and eastern Wales, and we could just see 30C (86F) likely in west London. 'Yesterday was the hottest day of the year so far, and it is fairly comfortable that we are going to beat that today, with the favourite spot to do so being west London and the Thames Valley.' Murray will, as always, be driven . from his £5.5 million mansion in Oxshott, Surrey, to the All England . Club at about 10.30am by friend Rob Stewart in his VW Polo, oblivious to . the queues as he enters at a sidegate near the practice courts. En . route, he may well listen to his pre-match ‘relaxing’ playlist, which . as he revealed last week features You’re Never Over by Eminem, Drunk by . Ed Sheeran, Maggie May by Rod Stewart and AC/DC’s You Shook Me All Night . Long. The . 2011 champion Djokovic is likely to be listening to his favoured early . Oasis tracks when he travels in an official car with tinted windows from . his rented accommodation. The . 26-year-old Serb is under no illusions about which player will be . receiving the most support: ‘It’s normal to expect the crowd to be on . his side,’ he said. ‘He’s . a local hero. He has a big chance to win Wimbledon after a long time . for this nation. I know I’m going to be playing against one of the . biggest tennis players in the world in the last five years. I’m ready . for it.’ Making history: If Murray, pictured left, wins today's final, he will be the first British player to lift the men's trophy since Fred Perry, pictured right, in 1936 . Getting prepared: Andy Murray trains with coach Ivan Lendl at the All England Club yesterday ahead of the men's singles final this afternoon . Under pressure: Andy Murray swelters in the sun during a training session yesterday - but temperatures are expected to soar even higher to 30C during the final this afternoon . Murray beat Djokovic in last September’s US Open final. Djokovic later admitted the Scot deserved to win. Murray declared himself better . prepared mentally for today’s final than he had been for his clash with . Federer 12 months ago. ‘I definitely feel calmer,’ he said. ‘Hopefully . when I get on the court I will be a bit fresher mentally. ‘Any tennis player wants to win Wimbledon, and the closer you get to it the more you are  going to think about it. ‘But . the most important thing is that you aren’t looking ahead. At no stage . of the match can you get too ahead of yourself – against most players . that is dangerous, against someone like Novak that is even more . dangerous. I am going to need to earn every point tomorrow.’ Murray's girlfriend Kim Sears will be . sitting in the player's box on centre court to cheer him on, along with . members of his family. And, despite the 'Curse of Cameron', . the Prime Minister will also be attending the match while Downing Street . will fly the Scottish Saltire to mark the occasion. Fans: Andy Murray signs autographs for fans after a training session yesterday at the All England Club in Wimbledon ahead of today's final . Home support: Butchers from David Bennett and Sons Butchers in Andy Murray's home town of Dunblane, Scotland, get ready to cheer on the tennis star in today's final . A string of stars have seen their hopes of glory fade following previous endorsement from the Tory leader. Earlier this week, the PM sent his . best wishes to Britain's number one female player Laura Robson, 19, . shortly before her fourth-round exit. Last summer he arrived at Wimbledon for the finals, where Murray was defeated by Roger Federer, and he followed this with a series of visits to Olympic events where British medal hopefuls lost out. Murray’s support will, of course, . spread much further afield than SW19. The British TV audience is likely . to be higher than the 16.9 million who tuned in for last year’s final . and is tipped to break the Wimbledon all-time record of 17.3 million. Tens of millions more will tune in from around the world. Former . British Davis Cup captain John Lloyd believes Murray’s success in last . year’s US Open has set him on a roll  and the Wimbledon title will be . the start of a succession of honours for the 26-year-old. He said: ‘I am convinced that Murray . will be knighted at some stage in his life. Winning Wimbledon will just . accelerate the honour being bestowed on him.' 'As Wimbledon champion, Murray’s fame . would spread across the world to make him the second most recognisable . British sportsman after David Beckham. The title will have that much . effect.’ They are known as the Queens of the Centre Court, though neither have struck a single ball. While  their partners slug it out, glamourous blondes Kim Sears, above right, and Jelena Ristic, respective partners of Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic, will today do battle in the fashion stakes. So far during this tournament Kim has worn outfits from Ted Baker, Whistles and Zara – all of which have experienced a subsequent surge in demand. Sales of a £25 ASOS dress Jelena has worn courtside have also rallied afterwards. Jelena, 27, insists the rivalry remains friendly and both couples get on well. She said: ‘Kim and Andy are really nice and there is no negative energy between Novak and Andy. They are gentlemen.’ Murray, 26, is expected to land a . raft of new sponsorship deals if he emerges triumphant today and stands . to rake in up to £15 million a year. The boost to his finances could put . him just behind Lennox Lewis and David Beckham as one of the top earning . British sports stars in history. The Scot, who won his first grand . slam at the US Open last year, was ranked at number 32 in The Sunday . Times Sports Rich List 2013 with an estimated fortune of £32 million. Victory against Novak Djokovic today would land him £1.6 million in prize money. Nigel Currie, director of the sports . marketing agency brandRapport, said the British number one could then . profit from a series of lucrative new contracts. 'If Murray wins at Wimbledon, it . means he is not a one-hit-wonder,' Mr Currie said. 'With Roger Federer . beginning to show his age and his form perhaps fading, and Rafael Nadal . with injury worries, it could mean that Murray and Novak Djokovic will . be the main two for the next few years. 'If you're number one or two in the . world of tennis, which is such a global sport, the marketing . opportunities are fantastic. Murray could secure some really big deals . with the biggest brands. 'He's reported to be earning £8 . million or £9 million off court at the moment. We could see that edging . up to £15 million if he wins at Wimbledon.' Giving back: Andy Murray spends time signing autographs for fans after a training session at the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club yesterday . Andy Murray's battle against Novak Djokovic is set to shatter the all-time Wimbledon TV viewing figures record. Last year’s final between Murray and Roger Federer pulled in a peak of 16.9 million viewers for BBC1. That fell short of the all-time record of 17.3 million when Bjorn Borg beat John McEnroe in five sets in 1980. But today’s final is expected to beat that – and hundreds of thousands more fans will tune in live via the internet. Sales of champagne are expected to reach new levels at Wimbledon this year. Up to 25,000 bottles of Lanson champagne, priced from £67 to £74, will have been quaffed by the end of today’s final – 15 per cent more than last year. Paul Beavis, managing director of Lanson International UK, said: ‘We sold 10,000 bottles in the first week of the tournament which was well up on 2012. ‘it has certainly helped that Mr Murray has been doing so well.’ It was a great start to the weekend sport yesterday as the Lions beat Australia in Sydney to win the series.

"For millions of years, asteroid Bennu has been assaulted by the gravity of planets as it hurtles through space. Now a new animation, dubbed 'Bennu's Journey', follows the rough life of the asteroid and how it could reveal the origin of the solar system. It also depicts the Osiris-Rex mission, which will be launched in late 2016, arrive at the asteroid Bennu in 2018, and return a sample of Bennu's surface to Earth five years later. Scroll down for video . This is an artist's concept of the impact that created the asteroid Bennu. Scientists think Bennu formed when some of the rubble from a collision like this coalesced under its own gravity . The Nasa video follows the success of Esa's Rosetta mission, which last week captured the imagination of the public after it made a successful landing on a comet. Unlike comets, which are made up of ice, dust and rocky material, asteroids contain metals from when the solar system first formed. 'We are going to Bennu because we want to know what it has witnessed over the course of its evolution,' said Edward Beshore of the University of Arizona. 'Bennu's experiences will tell us more about where our solar system came from and how it evolved,' said Professor Beshore. An artist's concept of the young Earth being bombarded by asteroids. Scientists think these impacts could have delivered significant amounts of organic matter and water to Earth . 'Like the detectives in a crime show episode, we'll examine bits of evidence from Bennu to understand more completely the story of the solar system, which is ultimately the story of our origin.' This mission is a precursor to a bigger mission, where Nasa will attempt to capture an asteroid and bring it into the moon's orbit. The video opens with an establishing shot of the galaxy and moves in to a nebula - a vast cloud of gas and dust ejected from the explosions of dying stars. From observations of other star-forming regions in our galaxy, scientists have a good idea of the basic outlines of how our solar system came to be, according to Professor Beshore. The animation shows a star disrupting material in the nebula, causing part of it to collapse under its own gravity and form a disk of material surrounding the infant sun. 'We are going to Bennu because we want to know what it has witnessed over the course of its evolution,' said Edward Beshore of the University of Arizona. Pictured is a concept image of asteroids being pulled in by the gravity of a planet . This is a conceptual image of a nebula. Nebulas are vast clouds of gas and dust ejected from the explosions of dying stars. Scientists think the solar system formed when a nearby exploding star disrupted material in a nebula, causing part of it to collapse under its own gravity . Within this disc, bits of dust are flash heated to molten rock and solidify to become chondrules - some of the building blocks of the solar system. How did water come to exist on our planet? Most scientists are of the opinion that it didn't begin here on Earth, instead being transported from elsewhere in the solar system, but whether it came from an asteroid or a comet was a mystery. That was one of the key questions Esa was hoping the Rosetta mission would solve when it arrived at comet 67P in August and it may now have an answer that could be verified by the Philae lander on the surface. Using the Rosetta Orbiter Spectrometer for Ion and Neutral Analysis - or Rosina - the spacecraft 'sniffed' the comet's atmosphere as it remained in orbit and analysed its composition. It found that water in the comet's atmosphere had a different ratio of deuterium-to-hydrogen than water on Earth. This may be the final nail in the coffin for the theory that comets brought water to Earth - and it may have finally proven that we have asteroids to thank for allowing life on our planet to thrive. Chondrules are shown in the animation as they clump together via electrostatic and gravitational forces to become asteroids and planets. They also may make up a large part of the material in Bennu. 'On planets like Earth, the original materials have been profoundly altered by geologic activity and chemical reactions with our atmosphere and water,' said Professor Beshore. 'We think Bennu may be relatively unchanged, so this asteroid is like a time capsule for us to examine'. By studying the sample collected from Bennu, the Nasa team will be able to examine some of the most pristine material to be found in the solar system. Bennu may also harbour organic material, which could give scientists an inventory of the materials present at the beginning of the solar system. Unlike Esa's Philae probe, which can only study comet material onsite, the Osiris-Rex will bring the material back to Earth. 'By bringing this material back to Earth, we can do a far more thorough analysis than we can with instruments on a spacecraft, because of practical limits on the size, mass, and energy consumption of what can be flown,' said Professor Beshore. 'We will also set aside returned materials for future generations to study with instruments and capabilities we can't even imagine now.' The early solar system is thought to have been chaotic. Giant impact craters throughout the inner solar system indicate there may have been a 'late heavy bombardment' by asteroids around 4.1 billion to 3.8 billion years ago, right around the origin of life on Earth. The video shows one theory for this. The massive 'gas giant' planet Jupiter began to migrate inward closer to the sun due to gravitational interactions with the outer gas giant planets. Jupiter's gravity disrupted the asteroid belt, tossing many asteroids closer to the sun, where some collided with the terrestrial planets, including Earth. This asteroid bombardment may have been a significant source of organic matter and water for the early Earth. By studying the sample collected from Bennu, the Nasa team will be able to examine some of the most pristine material to be found in the solar system. Pictured is an artist's impression of an impact on Jupiter's moon, Europa . Measurements reveal that Bennu's density is less than that of rock, so scientists think the asteroid may have voids in its interior. An  asteroid like this is called a 'rubble pile' -- a loosely bound collection of boulders, rock, and dust . After this bombardment, things calmed down a little, but massive collisions still happened occasionally, like the one the video shows happening between an asteroid and a planet about one billion years ago. The Osiris-Rex (Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, Security and Regolith Explorer) mission aims to address basic questions about the composition of the very early solar system. The probe will spend more than two years at the 1,760 ft (500 metre)-wide asteroid, named Bennu. It plans to return an asteroid sample to Earth to reveal the origins of volatiles and organics that may be the seeds of life. Scientists also hope the mission will accelerate technology that will soon enable humans to mine asteroids for precious metals. The spacecraft, scheduled for launch in September 2016, will arrive at the asteroid in October 2018. It will travel 406,618,624 miles (654,389,243 km) to reach the asteroid. Scientists think a collision like this may have resulted in the birth of Bennu and the video illustrates the asteroid forming as some of the rubble from the collision slowly coalesces under its own weak gravity. Measurements reveal that Bennu's density is less than that of rock, so scientists think the asteroid may have voids in its interior, according to Beshore. An asteroid like this is called a 'rubble pile' -- a loosely bound collection of boulders, rock, and dust. Bennu is also quite dark. Like an asphalt road on a hot day, it absorbs most of the sunlight that hits it and later radiates this energy away as heat. This radiation gives Bennu a tiny push, called the Yarkovsky effect, which gradually changes its orbit over time. The animation shows how the Yarkovsky effect causes Bennu to migrate until it encounters a so-called gravitational resonance with the planet Saturn. Regular tugs by this resonance eventually push Bennu into the inner solar system, where it has repeated close encounters with Venus and Earth. These encounters pull apart the rubble pile that is Bennu, turning it inside out and reshaping the asteroid. Because Bennu comes close to Earth, there is a tiny chance – about 1 in 2,500 – that it could hit Earth late in the 22nd century, according to Professor Beshore. 'We'll get accurate measurements of the Yarkovsky effect on Bennu by precisely tracking Osiris-Rex as it orbits the asteroid,' he added. Pictured is an artist's concept of Nasa's Osiris-Rex asteroid-sample-return spacecraft arriving at the asteroid Bennu. Because Bennu comes close to Earth, there is a tiny chance – about 1 in 2,500 – that it could hit Earth late in the 22nd century, according to Professor Beshore .","Animation, dubbed 'Bennu's Journey', follows the mysterious life of the asteroid from birth to current position .
Osiris-Rex mission will launch in 2016, arrive at the asteroid Bennu in 2018, and return samples 5 years later .
The samples could provide scientists with an inventory of the materials present at the start of the solar system .
Because Bennu comes close to Earth, there is a 1 in 2,500 that the asteroid could hit Earth late in 22nd century .

"Standing amid the ruins, a child gazes at the devastation war has brought to his home in Syria. Once Deir al-Zor was a busy town in the eastern part of the country, with a growing tourist industry, but when rebels moved in, it became a target for tyrant President Bashar Assad's forces.

"Dr. Martin Salia didn't get into the medical profession to get rich, and even though he was a permanent U.S. resident, he chose to work in his native Sierra Leone because the need for surgeons there was so great. Although his medical colleagues were worried when he returned there to treat Ebola patients, they said the decision was consistent with his character. The 44-year-old surgeon was remembered Saturday at his funeral Mass as a tireless, selfless and heroic advocate for medical care for the less fortunate. Dr. Martin Salia was remembered Saturday at his funeral Mass as a tireless, selfless and heroic advocate for medical care for the less fortunate . Even though Salia was a permanent U.S. resident, he chose to work in his native Sierra Leone because the need for surgeons there was so great . Salia died of Ebola on Nov. 17 after being flown to a hospital in Omaha, Nebraska, in the advanced stages of the deadly virus. He became the second person to die in the United States after contracting Ebola in West Africa, where it has killed nearly 7,000 people. Ron Klain, the White House Ebola response coordinator, read a personal note of condolence from President Barack Obama to Salia's family. Salia died of Ebola on Nov. 17 after being flown to a hospital in Omaha, Nebraska, in the advanced stages of the deadly virus . ""The greatest heroes are people who choose to face danger, who voluntarily put themselves at risk to help others,"" Klain said. ""Martin Salia was such a man."" The 90-minute Mass at the home parish of Salia's family in Maryland drew a crowd that swelled to the hundreds. Relatives, friends, colleagues and dignitaries from both the U.S. and Sierra Leone were in attendance, along with Sierra Leonean immigrants from around the country, some of whom said they didn't know Salia personally. Isatu Salia, center, carriers the cremated remains of her husband, Dr. Martin Salia, while their sons Maada Martin Salia, 20, right, and Hinwaii Sakatty Salia, 12, walk with her to enter St. Mary's Church in Landover Hills, Md. Salia's wife, Isatu Salia, wept as she carried a small black box containing her husband's cremated remains into the church, flanked by the couple's sons, 20-year-old Maada and 14-year-old Hinwaii. Bockari Stevens, the Sierra Leonean ambassador to the United States, called Salia a national hero who abandoned ""the luxuries of the United States"" to aid his homeland. ""It is a loss not only to your family. It is a loss to our country,"" Stevens said. Stevens called for the United States to do more to ""ensure that this scourge is blighted"" in Sierra Leone, which is now bearing the brunt of the 8-month-old outbreak, and the other West African nations stricken by Ebola. Klain pledged that more aid was on the way. ""The world's response has been too late, but now, help is coming,"" he said to applause.

The top United Nations official in the fight against the disease said Saturday in an interview with The Associated Press that Sierra Leone will soon see a dramatic increase in Ebola treatment beds, but it's not clear who will staff them. Only about a quarter of a promised 1,200 treatment beds are up and running. The nation is also dogged by unsafe burials, which may account for up to 50 percent of all new cases, said Anthony Banbury, head of the U.N. Mission for Ebola Emergency Response. Salia was born and raised in Kenema, Sierra Leone, and received his medical training in Freetown, the country's capital. He later served as a surgical resident in Cameroon and also worked in Kenya and the United States. His dream had been to open his own hospital in Sierra Leone, colleagues said. Salia did not receive aggressive treatment for Ebola until nearly two weeks after he first started showing symptoms. His formal diagnosis was delayed, and it took several days for him to be flown back to the United States. Those delays, doctors said, probably made it impossible for anyone to save his life. Isatu Salia, third from left, joined by her sons Maada Martin Salia, 20, left, and Hinwaii Sakatty Salia, 12, right, is greeted by Father Rick Gancayco as she carries the cremated remains of her husband, Dr. Martin Salia . Dr. Marilee Cole, an international health consultant who ran a Georgetown University training program in Cameroon, remembered Salia as an unusually humble physician. The diminutive, wiry surgeon was always in motion, she said, and despite his work ethic, he managed to organize a soccer league for the hospital staff. After he completed his residency and began training other doctors, they were awed by his multitude of skills, she said. 'You never knew how hard he was working until you talked to your colleagues,' Cole said. 'Over the course of many years, I came to understand there was something special about him.' In a brief interview after the Mass, Salia's older son said he was heartened by the esteem in which others held his father. 'I'm really proud that he was able to do so many things for a lot of people,' Maada Salia said.","Dr. Martin Salia chose to work in his native Sierra Leone because the need for surgeons there was so great .

"It's the most prestigious tournament in ice hockey - so when you win it, there's only one way to celebrate. Stanley Cup champions the Boston Bruins have toasted their 2011 victory with a staggering $156,679.74 bar bill at the MGM Grand in Mashantucket, Connecticut on Saturday night - and that wasn't even the full team, but just six of its apparently hardiest members. However $56,679.74 of the tab went on the players working up the Dutch courage to make one final order that will go down in history: a $100,000 bottle of Ace of Spades Midas Champagne. Congratulations to US: Boston Bruins player Zdeno Chara (right) drinks from the Stanley Cup as team mate Shawn Thornton just drinks straight from the the $100,000 bottle of Ace of Spades Midas Champagne . Getting my groove on: Brad Marchand shows he's got some moves off the ice also . There are just six of the 30-litre bottles in existence - well, five now. Made by luxury brand Armand de Brignac and produced by Champagne house Cattier, it is the largest bottle of luxury Champagne in the world. The gold metallic bottles are crafted entirely by hand, inspired by fashion designer Andre Courreges. Debauchery: The players quickly ended up dancing on the bar Coyote Ugly-style. Right, the reason they thought that was OK - their bar tab . Making new friends: Brad Marchand poses with some Bruins fans inside the nightclub . Each have two Ace of Spades insignias . and four hand-applied pewter lables. They are housed in a black wooden . case, lined with velvet and fitted with an engraved nameplate. Each is . embossed with the Champagne's royal crest. The bottle ordered by the Bruins was hand-delivered by Shrine owners Ed Kane, Joe Kane and Randy Greenstein. And the losers: Rioters torched cars and looted shops in Vancouver after the city's Canucks lost the Stanley Cup Finals . Of course there was only one cup that was prestigious enough to drink such a drink from. Photographs capture player Zdeno Chara drinking the golden liquid straight from the bowl of the Stanley Cup. Thing of beauty: The Ace of Spades Midas Champagne bottle - one of which was ordered by the Bruins on Saturday night . His team mate Shawn Thornton, meanwhile, is pictured drinking straight from the gold bottle - which is so big that he needed assistance holding it up. Images of the joyful, debauchery-filled celebration are in direct contrast to scenes pictured in defeated Vancouver last week. The Canucks lost 4-0 to the Bruins in Game Seven of the tournament - sparking violent riots in the West Coast Canadian city. Police squared off against angry youths who burned cars and destroyed store fronts in savage demonstrations last week. A photograph of one couple lying on the ground kissing in the midst of the riots has become the iconic image of the violence after they declared they had been beaten by police. But in Massachusetts there was nothing but joy. And despite hangovers that must have rivalled those portrayed in the Hangover II, the players still managed to make it to Fenway Park on Sunday to be honoured by the Boston Red Sox. The Midas  bottle was signed by every member of the team there - including Tim . Thomas, Zdeno Chara, Patrice Bergeron, Milan Lucic, Brad Marchand and . Shawn Thornton. It will be on display at High Rollers and is set to be raffled off to benefit the Bruins foundation. The first Midas bottle also sold for $100,000 at a casino - at the famous nightclub XS in the Encore casino in Las Vegas. Most expensive drink purchase: Ace of Spade Midas champagne at $100,000 . When they ordered the Midas: As their final act, after downing $56,679.74 of wine, liquor and beer (presumably making it seem like a very good idea at the time) Least expensive drink purchase: Bud Light at $5 (but they ordered 136 of them... bringing the total just on Bud Lights to $680) Proof they weren't afraid to mix their liquors: Tab included various . different flavours of Bacardi rum, Patron tequila, Grey Goose vodka, . Jack Daniels whiskey, Captain Morgan's Spiced rum, Hennessy, along with (of course) multiple beers and champagnes . Most popular drink: Bud Light (well, they are hockey players after all) Least popular drink: Fiji water (just $268 of the total bar bill - but $268 wisely spent) Service charges: An incredible $24,869.80 .","As Vancouver went up in smoke, the U.S. victors partied like there was no tomorrow ."
"Australia star Jarryd Hayne has sensationally quit rugby league to pursue a career in American football. The full-back, who would have been one of the Kangaroos' key players in the upcoming Four Nations Series, has announced that he has secured a conditional release from his contract at Parramatta Eels. The 26-year-old World Cup-winner does not have any opportunities lined up in the United States but is hoping to earn trial opportunities in the NFL over the next year.

Hayne was outstanding for New South Wales, above, in their 2014 State of Origin series win over Queensland . Hayne, who issued a statement and then spoke at a press conference hastily arranged by the Eels, said: ""It's been about 12 months now that I've seriously considered this. ""I've passed the fear stage. I've wrestled with my emotions and realised that this is where my heart lies. ""I feel like I've done everything in the game. What more is there to achieve other than a premiership (title win)? ""There's goals, but you've got to enjoy the journey more so. I feel that the journey of going over there and having a crack at the NFL is far greater than anything here. ""I'm a kid following his heart, following his dream."" Hayne was recently named as joint-winner of the Dally M medal, the highest individual award in Australia's NRL competition, for 2014. His departure is another blow for Australia coach Tim Sheens, who is already without a raft of senior players for the Four Nations tournament also featuring England, New Zealand and Samoa.

"Under-fire Australia coach Ewen McKenzie resigned a few hours before the Wallabies were beaten 29-28 by world champions New Zealand in Brisbane, the Australian Rugby Union (ARU) said in a statement. McKenzie, who took over from Robbie Deans just over a year ago, had come under pressure over the last two weeks for his role in the row over offensive text messages Kurtley Beale allegedly sent to a team official in June. He was forced to deny he had been involved in an intimate relation with Di Patston, the official in question, and faced the accusation that he had lost the support of senior players over her role with the team. Wallabies coach Ewen McKenzie resigned from his post before his team's 29-28 loss to the All Blacks . A spectator is removed from the stadium after he allegedly poured a drink over McKenzie during the game . CEO of Australian rugby Bill Pulver speaks to the Australian media following McKenzie's resignation . The defeat to the All Blacks was a third straight loss for the Wallabies after defeats in South Africa and Argentina over the last month and left McKenzie with a 50 percent winning record in his 22 matches in charge. 'I did not ask Ewen to resign, but understand his decision. He informed me this morning of his intention to resign, regardless of tonight's result,' ARU chief Bill Pulver said in a statement. 'Ewen is a world-class coach and a world-class individual who has been committed to playing entertaining rugby for our fans since he started in the role. 'We sincerely wish Ewen well for the future professionally and personally.' All Blacks centre Malakai Fekitoa crashes over in the final minute as New Zealand snatch a late victory . Australia player Kurtley Beale is currently under investigation for two separate disciplinary incidents . Pulver empathised with McKenzie following a difficult two weeks in the Wallabies camp . Pulver said he hoped to appoint a new coach before the end of the week when the Wallabies depart for their November tour of Europe. Former Springbok coach Jake White, who was in the frame to replace Deans last year, and Michael Cheika, who led New South Wales Waratahs to the Super Rugby title this year, are likely to be leading candidates.","McKenzie had come under pressure over his role in text message saga involving Kurtley Beale and team official last June .

"A tax raising the price of sugar sweetened drinks could help tackle the obesity epidemic, scientists have claimed. Scientists at the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, South Africa, measured the effect of a 20 per cent tax on soft drinks, on the prevalence of obesity in adults in the country. The team found the effective price rise could act as one initiative, in a multi-faceted approach to preventing obesity, Medical Daily reported. Researchers found that implementing the tax resulted in a 3.8 per cent reduction in obesity in men and a 2.4 per cent fall in women, equating to a fall of 220,000 obese adults in South Africa. A new South African study has found a 20 per cent tax on sugar-laden drinks could help tackle obesity levels. File image . Author Mercy Manyema, said the onus is on governments to help improve the health of the population. 'It is the responsibility of the . government to protect the health of its population,' she said. 'One way of doing so . is through ""nudging"" people to make healthier and more sustainable . choices. 'An SSB (sugar sweetened beverage) tax has the potential to do this in addressing . obesity-related diseases.' Senior researcher, Professor Karen Hofman, added: 'While SSBs alone may not be the . only reason for an increase in body fat, these fizzy drinks do not . contain any essential nutrients, have a high sugar content and a strong . link to weight gain. 'Drinking just one SSB a day increases the . likelihood of being overweight by 27 per cent for adults and 55 per cent for children.' Senior researcher, Professor Karen Hofman, added: 'While SSBs (sugar sweetened beverages) alone may not be the only reason for an increase in body fat, these fizzy drinks do not contain any essential nutrients, have a high sugar content and a strong link to weight gain' The report follows a recommendation by the South African Minister of Health, Dr Aaron Motsoaledi, on the need to regulate foods high in sugar, in order to tackle the overweight population, and the diseases related to obesity. Author Aviva Tugendhaft, added: 'This is not surprising considering that one 330ml serving of a . fizzy sweetened drink contains an average of eight teaspoons of sugar . and the same size fruit juice contains an average of nine teaspoons of . sugar.' In the last 30 years, the number of obese adults in South Africa has soared, making the nation the fattest in sub-Saharan Africa. More than half of adults are now considered to be overweight or obese - 42 per cent of women and 13 per cent of men. The paper was published in the PLOS ONE journal.","South African study measured effect of a tax on the prevalence of obesity .

"When people are in a bad mood, they are more likely to actively search social networking sites like Facebook to find friends who are doing even worse than they are. That's according to a study that found that, in general, people use social media to connect with people who are posting positive and success-oriented updates. But when they were in a negative spiral they would search for others who were also having a similarly bad day - or worse. Research led by Ohio State University has found that people in a negative mood like to see others who are also doing badly on social networks. Normally people preferred positive and upbeat statuses. But when upset they looked at people rated unsuccessful or unattractive . The study was published online in the journal Computers in Human Behaviour. It involved 168 college students, with the researchers first putting participants in a good or bad mood by having them take a test on facial emotion recognition. Regardless of their answers, the students were randomly told their performance was 'terrible' to put them in a bad mood or 'excellent' to put them in a good mood. Afterward, all participants were asked to review what they were told was a new social networking site called SocialLink. Earlier this week the California-based firm revealed that it carried out an experiment during a week in 2012. During that time, negative posts were deprioritised in the data feeds of 689,003 users, to see if it generated a more positive response. Posts were determined by the experiment to be positive or negative if they contained at least one positive or negative word. The experiment affected around 0.04 per cent of users - or 1 in 2,500. According to Facebook, nobody's posts were 'hidden,' they just didn't show up on some feeds. It found that negative posts elicited a swell of positive responses, but also that a reduction in positive news led to more negative posts. ‘When positive expressions were reduced, people produced fewer positive posts and more negative posts; when negative expressions were reduced, the opposite pattern occurred,’ said the researchers. Overall, the researchers found that people tended to spend more time on the profiles of people who were rated as successful and attractive. But participants who had been put in a negative mood spent significantly more time than others browsing the profiles of people who had been rated as unsuccessful and unattractive. The overview page presented preview profiles of eight individuals, which the students could click on to read more. The key to the study was that the eight profiles were designed to make the people profiled appear attractive and successful - or unattractive or unsuccessful. Each profiled person was ranked on a scale of 0 to 5 on both career success and attractiveness, or 'hotness'. The profile images were blurred so that participants could not see what they actually looked like. When participants clicked on the profiles, they found that all the status updates were much the same. They were all relatively mundane and didn't discuss any career or academic success, physical appearance or romantic relationships. The results were based on a fake social network site created by researchers called SocialLink (screenshot shown) where people were rated according to career success and attractiveness. 'If you need a self-esteem boost, you're going to look at people worse off than you,' said author Dr Knobloch-Westerwick . 'When people are in a negative mood, they start to show more interest in the less attractive, less successful people on their social media sites,' said Dr Silvia Knobloch-Westerwick, co-author of the study and professor of communication at Ohio State University. These findings give more context to recent studies that found people who spend a lot of time on Facebook tend to be more frustrated, angry and lonely - perhaps because positive updates from friends make them feel inadequate. 'People have the ability to manage how they use social media,' said Benjamin Johnson, co-author of the study and assistant professor at VU University Amsterdam. 'Generally, most of us look for the positive on social media sites. But if you're feeling vulnerable, you'll look for people on Facebook who are having a bad day or who aren't as good at presenting themselves positively, just to make yourself feel better.' Dr Knobloch-Westerwick added: 'If you need a self-esteem boost, you're going to look at people worse off than you. 'You're probably not going to be looking at the people who just got a great new job or just got married. 'One of the great appeals of social network sites is that they allow people to manage their moods by choosing who they want to compare themselves to.'","Research led by Ohio State University has found that people in a negative mood like to see others who are also doing badly on social networks .

"It has earned a reputation as Britain's most debauched student pub crawl - and this year's Carnage UK event in Cardiff certainly lived up to its notoriety. The theme for this year's night of revelry was 'Pimps and Hoes', and saw the university's undergraduate girls take to the streets dressed in little more than their underwear, covered by the official pub crawl T-shirt. Hundreds of first-year students turned out in Cardiff city centre to participate in the first such event of the year and were captured on camera unashamedly stumbling around, and behaving drunk and disorderly. And as the evening drew to a close . couples perhaps unknown to each other hours earlier were seen in . passionate clinches, while in shop doorways some students could be seen . slumped in a drunken stupor. Scantily clad: Hundreds of students take part in the first Carnage bar crawl of the year in Cardiff . After party: Two blonde females sit down on the floor to enjoy their takeaway food . Sleepy: One student can't wait to get home and so decides to have a nap on the floor . 'Pimps and Hoes': Students adhered to the fancy dress theme accordingly wearing little other than bras and mini skirts . The Carnage UK organisers have . repeatedly come under fire for hosting the events, which promote . excessive binge drinking as students are encouraged to go from one bar to . the next to consume copious amounts of beverage. Andrew Misell, manager of Alcohol Concern Cymru said: 'Companies who organise events like this must take their . responsibilities seriously. Too often young people take part, drink far . too much and end up in a vulnerable state on the street with society . left to pick up the pieces. 'We know that alcohol is part of many people’s social lives but we need . to learn how to enjoy it sensibly and safely, and events like Carnage . don’t help. 'For a young person it may seem like one, fun-filled night out but there . can be grave and far reaching consequences because of their excessive . drinking.' Scantily . clad female students wore little other than bras and mini skirts with . suspenders as they adhered to the fancy dress code of a prostitute. Male students wore ripped open . T-shirts and shorts and were pictured passionately kissing girls nearly . bearing all on street corners. Some students didn't even manage to make it home before slumping on the pavement and falling asleep. Anger: One girl wearing fish net tights and a black bra tries to get away from police . Tired: This student looks like he has finished for the night as he sits down to text on his mobile phone . Embrace: A student wraps his arms around a female on the notorious student night .

Other pictures show youngsters walking with traffic cones on their heads and others receiving a ticking-off from police. Students appear to have no quarms sitting on the pavement to eat their takeaway. Nor do they seem to care being pictured behaving drunk and disorderly. Carnage UK is staging events in 44 . university town and cities over the next two months to welcome this . year’s intake of freshers. But the organisers have been criticised in the past for encouraging binge drinking and anti-social behaviour. Pete Mercer, NUS Vice-President for Welfare told MailOnline: 'NUS has long been critical of organised bar crawls that promote excessive drinking and put the participants’ health at risk. 'We have established a successful partnership with Drinkaware to promote safer drinking practices amongst young people and will continue to do so. 'It takes a staggering lack of imagination on behalf of the organisers to assume that students are only interested in getting drunk; with a little thought they could put on activities that didn’t promote such a lazy stereotype of young people.'

In 2009, 19-year-old student Philip Laing desecrated a poppy wreath in Sheffield and was later ordered to carry out 250 hours of community service and pay £185 cost after admitting outraging public decency. Following a Carnage event held in . 2009, police said they were looking into the possibility of charging the . organisers for the cost of the extra police needed to be drafted in to . man the streets.

"Dramatic footage following the Sunday shooting of a New Hampshire man shows his devastated fiancée overcome with the news he was dead after an armed attack on his home, possibly at the hands of his own brother. Jen Lord’s unthinkable trauma managed to get even worse as fiancé Eddie Hoffens’ brother and roommate David told a friend ‘he shot the guy and was afraid that he also shot his brother Edgar’ before being hauled off by police for tampering with evidence. That 'guy' was the brothers’ reported attacker Charles Cable and both he and Eddie are dead. And while the two Manchester brothers have a history of discord, with David pleading guilty last month to threatening to kill Eddie, the 21-year-old repeatedly told police he ‘didn’t mean to do it.’ Wrenching: Jen Lord of Manchester, New Hampshire is inconsolable in dramatic photos taken after she learned of the shooting death of her fiance Eddie Hoffens . Devastating: Initial reports indicated that Jen Lord's fiance was gunned down by his own brother during an armed attack on their Manchester, New Hampshire home . According to Jeffrey Hastings, the photographer who took the wrenching photographs, police took David Hoffens, 21, into custody after he ran from the scene and disposed of a gun. Hoffens had allegedly just been involved in a confrontation that left both his brother and an attacker dead at their Lake Avenue home. Charles Cable, 20, was found face down outside the home in a puddle of blood. He would later die at a hospital. According to the Union Leader, Eddie Hoffens, 22, would be declared dead on arrival after he was found at the base of the home’s stairs Sunday just before 4pm. Torn apart: Pictured are Eddie Hoffens, left, before he was taken from fiance Jen Lord, right, on Sunday. After the 4pm shooting, Eddie's brother reportedly told a friend he'd shot someone and feared he'd also shot his brother . Victim: 20-year-old Charles Cable, pictured, was killed when he apparently came to the Hoffens' home armed for an attack. Cable has a history of run-ins with the police and was himself stabbed some 10 times in a May attack . David’s confessor and childhood . friend Eric Woodard said he called Eddie’s phone Sunday and Lord . answered, too overcome to even speak. It . was when he contacted David that he learned the scope of the tragedy. Woodard told police that’s when David said he ‘shot the guy and was . afraid that he also shot his brother Edgar’ after ‘the guys’ pulled  a . knife on him. Initial reports suggested that David accidentally shot Eddie during an armed confrontation with Cable at their home. However, . complicating the case are an additional admission of guilt from Dan . Morgan—boyfriend to the brothers’ mother Cynthia Hoffens—and a history . David has of threatening his older brother. Morgan told police he is the one who . accidentally shot Eddie while he was pointing the gun at Cable. He . claims it was David who shot Cable. But just last month, David pleaded guilty to threating to kill Eddie. ‘I’ll slit your throat,’ he admitted to telling his brother. No . one had been charged in the homicides as of Monday afternoon, but David . was arrested and charged with tampering with evidnce by detectives who . found him at an area bakery. David . admitted to investigators that he’d fled the scene on foot and ditched . the gun and holster. The holster has since been recovered. According . to the Union Leader, David also admitted to obstructing justice after . threatening to kill Eddie by ripping phone lines from the wall so he . couldn’t call 911. David and Eddie’s sister Samantha Hoffens took to Facebook in her jailed brother’s defense: . ‘We . are trying to get 2500$ to get David out on bail. If anyone can help . please let me know. I will also be trying to put together a fund for my . brothers funeral. Thank you.’ Hectic: The scene that developed at the Hoffens' apartment after the 4pm shooting was chaotic as investigators tried to make sense of the situation. At left, police take a statement from an unidentified man . Two dead: Cable was rushed to the hospital after he was found bleeding from the head but breathing. He later died at an area hospital. Eddie Hoffens was pronounced dead on arrival . Awaiting charges: Despite the graveness of Sunday's apparent crime and police assurances there is no public danger, no one had been charged for the murders as of Monday evening . For his part, the late Charles Cable has also has a history of encounters with the law. At the time of his death, Cable was waiting to be tried for charges he assaulted his girlfriend and and her mother in October. Cable . was on the other side of the law back in May when he suffered as many . as 10 stab wounds during an early morning knife attack. David Hoffen’s bail was set at $25,000 and a probable cause hearing set for December 5. Plot thickens: Police must now put together the pieces in an increasing confusing plot line. Despite David's purported confession to a friend, his mother's boyfriend also admitted to police that it was he who shot Cable . Gory: Both victims were found outside this  home on Sunday. Eddie was dead at the scene and Cable died later at a hospital after he was found face down in a puddle of his own blood . 'I'll slit your throat'?

"Jailed: Lee Wilkinson, who was jailed for 11 months at Newcastle Crown Court after biting off the finger of Michael Dent during a nativity play at Harton Primary School in South Shields, Tyne and Wear . A man bit off the tip of a love rival's finger at a children's nativity play after a long-running feud. Father-of-three Lee Wilkinson, 40, attacked Michael Dent during the festive performance after Mr Dent had an affair with the attacker's wife while he was working away from home. When the men saw each other at Harton Primary School, South Shields, they became embroiled in an angry verbal confrontation. A fight broke out, during which Mr Dent, 33, put his hand in Wilkinson's mouth, who then 'bit hard' on the finger. Wilkinson was sentenced to 11 months in prison at Newcastle Crown Court, after the judge said that he had 'used his mouth as a weapon'. The court heard how Wilkinson had been working offshore when Mr Dent started a relationship with his wife, Louise. When the relationship 'became serious', Wilkinson separated from his wife, which resulted in a 'large amount . of animosity and hostility'. The pair had already fought each other on two previous occasions. Bridie Smurtwaite, prosecuting, said: 'They both attended the school, with Mr Dent arriving in the queue behind the defendant. She told the court how scientific expert Mr Cooper had believed ‘this injury must have required severe force.’ His report went on to say how ‘the injuries caused were consistent with the jaws going up and down on the tip of the victim’s finger and one of them would have had to pull with some force to cause the tip to have become separated from the rest of the finger’. Wilkinson, from South Shields, pleaded guilty to unlawful wounding and a separate public order offence relating to a run-in between the two men on Christmas Eve in 2011, at an earlier hearing. Affair: The court heard how Mr Dent, pictured, and Wilkinson had fought on two previous occasions after Dent began a relationship with Wilkinson's wife . Miss Smurthwaite told the court how the pair had previously fought on two earlier occasions, and Dent was cautioned by police at both times. She said: 'On the first occasion, on 19 November 2010, Dent had been at his ex-wife’s house, when he saw Wilkinson in the conservatory. 'He believed that he heard Wilkinson talking about him so he went into the conservatory and assaulted him. On the second occasion in August 2011, Dent attacked Wilkinson outside the Glitterball night club in South Shields as he began to walk home. The pair fought in the street and after police were called, Dent was again cautioned for assaulting Wilkinson. In a statement taken by police, Dent said: 'I’m worried about bumping into him in the street. I would have to claim compensation as I am a full time scaffolder and will be unable to work for some time. 'It has caused a great deal of upset for my children.' Tom Moran, defending, said: 'The background to these two men goes back a long way. While working as a taxi driver in February 2008, he was assaulted by a passenger who was not prosecuted. 'He had to have plastic surgery to the inside of his mouth after it was prized open during the attack. 'After being unable to work for some time he then took on a job in the North Sea, which sees him work all year round and means he is often away for up to three weeks at a time. Weapon: Judge Simon Hickey, sitting at Newcastle Crown Court, pictured, told Wilkinson that he had 'used his mouth as a weapon' 'During one of the occasions he was away, his wife Louise, who he has three children with, started a relationship with Mr Dent. 'This was a relationship that became serious and the two separated and she set up home with Mr Dent. Judge Simon Hickey sentenced Wilkinson to 11 months imprisonment, 10 months for unlawful wounding and one month for a public order offence. The judge said he had taken into account Wilkinson’s early pleas, the two earlier offences for which Dent had been cautioned for, his clear work ethic, and for the fact Dent was having an affair with his wife. Judge Hickey told Wilkinson: 'You were both attending a nativity play at a local school. 'You both moved, as can be seen for the footage, into the foyer away from the children and I saw females of all ages in the area where you started to scuffle. 'It’s reassuring to see that you do not have any previous convictions for violence, you were a man of good character previous to this matter. 'The victim was spared any reliving of this offence as you pleaded guilty immediately. It was while you were away at sea to provide for your children that this man began an affair with your wife. 'It is in my judgement that if someone loses the tip of their finger, they will have the reminder of this throughout the rest of their life. 'It must be remembered that in this case you used your mouth as a weapon.'","Lee Wilkinson, 40, and Michael Dent, 33, involved in long-running feud .

He has contacted a list of billionaires . with a proposal for funding his quest for immortality - which Itskov . refers to as 'cybernetic immortality' and the 'artificial body'. The initiative is opening its San Francisco office this summer, and will be launching a social media project connecting scientists around the world. 'The 2045 team is working towards creating an international research center where leading scientists will be engaged in research and development in the fields of anthropomorphic robotics, living systems modeling and brain and consciousness modeling with the goal of transferring one’s individual consciousness to an artificial carrier and achieving cybernetic immortality,' says Itskov's official site. 'Such research has the potential to free you, as well as the majority of all people on our planet, from disease, old age and even death.' 'For anyone interested, but skeptical, I am ready to prove the viability of the concept of cybernetic immortality by arranging an expert discussion with a team of the world's leading scientist working in this field.'I will also be willing to coordinate your personal immortality project entirely free of charge for the sake of speeding up the development of these technologies,' Itskov, a 31-year-old media entrepreneur, says that he aims to transplant a human brain into a robot body within 10 years.

'A . person with a perfect Avatar will be able to remain part of society. People don’t want to die.' James Cameron's Avatar: Dmitry Itskov's 'Avatar' project aims to 'load' human minds into robotic bodies within 10 years . ‘I understand these are some very big . challenges for scientists,’ Itskov says. ‘But I believe in . something you call ‘The American Dream.’ If you put all your energy and . time into something, you can make it a reality. Itskov envisages surgically 'transplanting' a human consciousness into a robot body within 10 years. He hopes to then 'upload' minds without surgery, leaving human bodies as empty husks as their owners 'live on' inside robots. The project is called Avatar after the James Cameron movie, set far in . the future, where human soldiers use mind control to inhabit the bodies of . human alien hybrids as they carry out a war against the inhabitants of a . distant world. 'The . next effort of science will be to create a new body for the human . being,' says Itskov, speaking at the Global Future 2045 conference. 'It . will have a perfect brain-machine interface to allow control and a human . brain life support system so the brain can survive outside the body.' Itskov says that the system will at first be of interest to, 'Disabled people and people at the edge of dying.' 'The . third phase will be to create an artificial human brain,' he says - a . computer environment into which human minds can be uploaded. Measuring brain waves with EEG machine: Recent breakthroughs have allowed scientists to 'see' what is inside people's heads for the first time - but could the technology really be used to create robot Avatars?

"The brother of James Foley said on Thursday that the Obama administration threatened him when he tried to raise funds for the slain journalist's release from the terrorist group that beheaded him. 'They were actually an impedance,' Foley told Fox News, referring to the government's role in rescuing his older brother, a photojournalist who was kidnapped by ISIS militants in Northern Syria in 2012. 'They got in our way... That's what really bothers me to the core.' The U.S. follows a strict policy of never negotiating with terrorist organizations or paying ransom for Americans kidnapped by them, arguing doing so only leads to more abductions. Scroll down for video . James Foley's parents John and Diane Foley and his brother, Michael, speak to reporters about James' murder outside of their home in Rochester, New Hampshire, last month. Michael has become particularly outspoken about the failures of the Obama administration to rescue his brother and for threatening the family for trying to raise funds to secure his release . Captured and executed: James Foley was taken hostage on Thanksgiving, 2012, while working for GlobalPost in northern Syria and executed - video of the brutal act was released online on August 19 . 'We have found that terrorist organizations use hostage taking and ransoms as a critical source of financing for their organization and that paying ransoms only puts other Americans in a position where they're at even greater risk,' White House spokesman John Earnest said. Foley, however, said the government made it difficult for the family to privately raise funds to secure his brother's freedom. 'I was specifically threatened by the Department of State about raising funds towards ransom demands for my brother,' he said. 'We were smart enough to look past it but it slowed us down. We lost a lot of time.' US freelance reporter James Foley was kidnapped in war-torn Syria in November, 2012 and executed by his ISIS captors in a video posted online on August 19 of this year . Michael Foley, at right, and other members of his family tried desperately to raise funds to secure James' release from the hands of his captors . In a separate interview with ABC News, his mother, Diane Foley, said a military officer working for the National Security Council told them several times that her family could face criminal charges if they paid a ransom. 'We took it as a threat and it was appalling,' she said. 'Three times he intimidated us with that message. We were horrified he would say that. He just told us we would be prosecuted. We knew we had to save our son, we had to try,' A spokeswoman for the National Security Council said that the Foley family was informed of U.S. laws banning terrorism financing but denied members were told they could face charges if they made a ransom payment, according to ABC. Michael Foley also said in the interview the new military campaign the U.S. is pursuing to stop ISIS 'came too late for Jim.' Devastated: Diane and John Foley talk to reporters, on Wednesday August 20, 2014 outside their home in Rochester, New Hampshire. The day before shocking footage of their son's execution was posted online . Strategy: President Barack Obama addresses the nation from the Cross Hall in the White House in Washington on Wednesday and said he had authorized U.S. airstrikes inside Syria for the first time, along with expanded strikes in Iraq, as part of 'a steady, relentless effort' to root out Islamic State extremists . 'I just hope it's not too late for others,' he said. ISIS is still holding several hostages from Western and other countries. Diane Foley earlier spoke of her deep disappointment she felt towards the Obama administration for its handling of his time as a prisoner of the terror group, saying, 'I really feel our country let Jim down.' On the 13th anniversary of 9/11 and the day after President Obama addressed the nation and finally offered a strategy to defeat ISIS, Foley told CNN that 'as an American', she was 'embarrassed and appalled' at the efforts to rescue her son from captivity. Articulate and thoughtful throughout her interview, she made the startling claim that US officials threatened her family with prosecution if they tried to raise a ransom for Foley, 40, and said 'Jim was sacrificed because of a lack of communication and prioritization.' And in a thinly veiled attack on Obama's new strategy to 'degrade and destroy' ISIS she said that meeting violence with more violence may not be the answer and said, 'bombing caused Jim's death.' 'Jim was killed in the most horrific way. He was sacrificed because of just a lack of coordination, lack of communication, lack of prioritization,' Foley said. 'As a family, we had to find our way through this on our own.' Still grieving, Diane Foley also said US officials told her they would not exchange prisoners or carry out any military action to try and rescue her son. At times withering in her assessment of the Obama administration's co-ordination with her family, Mrs. Foley poured scorn on the Pentagon's claim they tried to rescue Foley on July 4, only to raid the wrong base. Speaking to CNN's Anderson Cooper, Foley said her family knew where James Foley was being held on two separate occasions in Syria, and that each time he was there for months following his capture on Thanksgiving, 2012. On August 19, ISIS released a gruesome video online which showed the beheading of Foley by a masked ISIS militant, who told the camera in a British accent, that his 'real killer' was the United States. Exactly two weeks later, another American journalist, Stephen Sotloff, was beheaded, apparently by the same man, who tells the camera, 'I'm back Obama'. During the efforts to get James home, Mrs. Foley said she met good people, people who wanted to help, but was adamant that she didn't want to single anyone out and lay 'blame'. Mrs. Foley said it was important to remember that ISIS is the enemy and not the United States. However, ultimately, she 'didn't feel that Jim was a priority.' 'We were just told to trust that he would be freed somehow, miraculously,' said Foley's mother to CNN. 'And he wasn't, was he?'

The South African qualifies to play for his adopted nation through residency rules, the French federation said on Sunday. Castres Olympique player Kockott has been on Philippe Saint-Andre's radar for some time as the France coach regularly tinkers with his halfback line. Rory Kockott of Castres is tackled by Harlequins' Mike Brown in the European Rugby Champions Cup on Friday, with the South African scrumhalf having been called into the France squad . International Rugby Board (IRB) eligibility rules state that a player can play for a country he was born in, one parent or grandparent was born in or in which he has completed '36 consecutive months of residence immediately preceding the time of playing'.

"On what should be the happiest day of her career, Wimbledon winner Marion Bartoli has faced an online backlash with trolls branding her 'fat', 'manly' and an 'ugly b****'. The vicious attacks took place after 28-year-old Bartoli scooped the woman's singles prize at today's Wimbledon final. Online trolls took to Twitter to criticise her looks, saying that she did not deserve to win as she is too 'ugly'. Winner: Bartoli was attacked by Trolls on Twitter criticising her looks and branding her 'manly' Shock: The Frenchwoman has described the win as a childhood dream come true . One Twitter user said 'Bartoli didn't deserve to win because she is ugly'. Another said: 'For the first time ever a man wins the women's Wimbledon final! Go team men. #balls' And she was also told to: 'get a boob job with the money you won. ugly b***'(sic) Radio commentator John Inverdale also caused outrage when . he asked BBC Radio 5 Live listeners: 'Do you think Bartoli’s dad told . her when she was little ""You’re never going to be a looker? You’ll never . be a Sharapova, so you have to be scrappy and fight.""' The BBC was forced to apologise after the remarks that were made live on air. Inverdale later said: 'We poked fun, in a nice way, about how she looks ... but Marion Bartoli is an incredible role model.' Second place: Sabine Lisicki was left devastated when she lost today's final, but Bartoli comforted her by saying she would have another go in the future . All smiles: Some Twitter users compared Bartoli's looks with those of her rival Sabine Lisicki . A BBC spokesman said: 'We accept that this remark was insensitive and for that we apologise.' The Twitter attacks have prompted an outpouring of criticism online as with Bartoli supporters rush to her defence. One said: 'Bartoli as the complete underdog has just won Wimbledon. WHY ARE PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT HER FACE AND BODY!!?!' John Inverdale made a derogatory comment about the tennis champion . Another added: 'Sadly being an amazing athlete counts for nothing if you're a woman :(' Bartoli today defeated . Sabine Lisicki, who had gained huge admiration for the way she beat last . year's champion Serena Williams earlier in the tournament. But she lost to 15th seed Bartoli 6-1, 6-4 after an hour and 21 minutes on Centre Court. Bartoli had endured a difficult 2013 before this fortnight. She failed to pass the third round of any tournament and her coaching relationship with her father Walter came to an end. She had also never won a major tournament before. But she was a picture of delight this afternoon as she lifted the famous Venus Rosewater Dish on Centre Court after racing into the stands to hug Walter. Bartoli reached the final here in 2007, but she seemed over-awed by the occasion at the beginning. 'Honestly I just can't believe it,' she said. As a little girl I dreamt about this moment for so long. 'I was there in 2007 and I missed out. I know how it feels Sabine, and I'm sure, believe me, you'll be there one more time, I have no doubt about it. 'When I started this campaign on Court 14, I think if you told me I'd be here in the final i wouldn't believe you. To hold the trophy is unthinkable. 'I'm just so happy to be holding this trophy. It's been my dream since i was six years old.'","The 28-year-old won the woman's singles prize at Wimbledon .

"Charles Ross was arrested after deputies received complaints about him giving wedgies to unsuspecting people at a Florida movie theater . A Florida prankster who enjoys ‘harassing’ people in public and posting the results on YouTube, is facing battery charges and even possibly prison time after one of his latest victims didn’t find his behavior very funny. Charles Ross, 18, of Bradenton, Fla., was arrested on a misdemeanor charge on Sunday after deputies received complaints about him giving wedgies to unsuspecting people at a movie theater. According to a police report, Ross harassed customers by grabbing them ‘by the back of [their] pants and pulled them up hard.’ After administering the wedgie, Ross would then ask his victim if they wanted to hit him, police said. Ross had a number of victims come . forward to police. Although most were too embarrassed to pursue charges, one . filled out an affidavit. ‘It is a battery,’ Dave Bristow from . the Manatee County Sheriff’s Office told ABCNews.com. ‘He did unlawfully . touch someone, so technically it’s a battery.’ On his YouTube channel RossCreations, Ross has uploaded 60 videos of himself performing pranks, including unplanned ‘trust falls’ with unsuspecting strangers, kissing strangers, and performing handstands over beach-goers. It has attracted more than 57,500 subscribers and nearly five million views. Ross hasn’t yet been able to upload his latest video as the camera was seized by police as evidence. ‘We have video of this, so it’s just whether or not the state wants to pursue it,’ Bristow said. Ross has posted a $750 bond and will appear before a judge within a month for the crime, which carries possible jail time. Scroll down for video . In one of his YouTube videos, Ross attempts to kiss total strangers - in this clip a man threatens to punch him when he tries to get close . In another one of his hilarious videos, Rose does a handstand and walks over unsuspecting victims on a beach . An unrepentant Ross told 10News Tampa Bay that he does not disagree with the charge or arrest. ‘I'm sorry that someone got offended. It's supposed to be a joke. Some people find humor and laugh at it... others can't,’ he said. This is his second prank-related arrest in three months, after he was charged with disorderly conduct in November. A Sarasota Sheriff's deputy says he was sitting on a picnic table when Ross jumped on top of it and over the deputy's head, putting him in harm's way. Despite his latest arrest, Ross says he will keep making his prankster videos, although he plans to focus more on ones where he is the butt of the joke.

"If you spotted an orange-coloured 'star' on Tuesday night, then you were probably looking at Mars. In fact, the event you witnessed was rare - for the first time in 778 days, Mars, Earth and the sun aligned in an 'opposition of the planets.' To scientists this is a unique but ultimately meaningless arrangement, but to a Christian minority, it marks the the beginning of significant events - even the second coming of Jesus Christ. The unusual alignment of the sun, Earth and Mars happened a week before the beginning of the astrological event that some believe is associated with the end of the world . The significance of the arrangement is that it . happened exactly a week before the first of four dark red 'blood moons,' which some Christians believe marks a cycle associated with the end of . the world. John Hagee, a Christian pastor who has . written a book on the Tetrad called 'Four Blood Moons: Something is . About to Change' told the Daily Express that Tuesday night marked the dawn of a 'hugely significant event' for the world. 'This is not something that some religious think tank has put together,' the notoriously outspoken church founder said. 'Nasa has confirmed that the Tetrad has only happened three times in more than 500 years — and that it's going to happen now.' Also known as the . 'Tetrad', since it involves four successive total 'blood-red' lunar . eclipses each followed by six full moons, Nasa has confirmed it started . Tuesday night and will end on September 28, 2015. In the 21st century, tetrads are a frequent occurrence, with nine sets in total, but this has not always been the case. From 1600 to 1900, for example, there were none at all. The 'Tetrad,' cycle began in April last year. It involves a series of four dark red 'blood moons.' At the end of the cycle in September 2015, some believe the end of the world will happen . The Book of Joel in the King James Bible prophesied about the blood moons and the end of the world: 'The . sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the . great and the terrible day of the LORD comes.' According to Mr Hagee, each time the Tetrad has happened during that time, there has been a significant religious event accompanied with it. In 1493, the first Tetrad saw the expulsion of Jews by the Catholic Spanish Inquisition. The . second happened in 1949, right after the State of Israel was founded. And the most recent one, in 1967, happened during the Six-Day War . between Arabs and Israelis. This graphic explains why Mars was so visible to the naked eye on Tuesday night . Mr Hagee said the the first of the blood moons will happen on April 15, right in the middle of the Jewish holiday of Passover. The second, on October 8, occurs during the Feast of the Tabernacle. The third will be on April 4, 2015, also during Passover. The final one happens on September 28, 2015, also during the Feast of the Tabernacles. A lunar eclipse occurs when the moon passes in the shadow of Earth. This is an area known as the umbra, where light from the Sun is blocked by our planet. The light refracts differently in the atmosphere and, as it hits the moon, it makes it appear red. This gives rise to its ‘blood red’ appearance during a total eclipse, when the entire moon is in shadow. If it skirts the shadow, known as a partial or penumbral eclipse, the effect is less dramatic.","Next week begins the start of the 'Tetrad,' a series of lunar eclipses .

"The director of one of America’s largest spy agencies is catching flack for once working from a war room built with American tax dollars to mimic a fantastical space ship. Keith Alexander heads up the National Security Agency and in addition to a lot on controversial revelations about his organization, a recent profile of the top spy says that when he ran the Army's Intelligence and Security Command, it was from the captain’s chair of the starship USS Enterprise. Specifically, from the Enterprise of the television series Star Trek: The Next Generation. And the eccentric director known as ‘a cowboy’ reportedly used the odd room to woo lawmakers and other important officials who coveted the chance to play captain. Make it so! While heading up the Army's Intelligence and Security Command, Keith Alexander gave orders from a room designed to look like the bridge of Star Trek's Enterprise . Though it focuses a great deal on issues like the PRISM program uncovered by Ed Snowden’s major information leak, a profile of Alexander in Foreign Policy couldn’t help but include details about his old war room in Fort Belvoir. Designed by a Hollywood set designer to mimic the famous ship’s bridge, Alexander’s base of operations in the Fairfax County, Virginia Army base was ‘complete with chrome panels, computer stations, a huge TV monitor on the forward wall,’ according to the profile. The television displayed sensitive national security photos and information, but was so placed to look like the all-important Enterprise bridge screen on which the comings and goings of outer space would be displayed. Excessive? The odd room featured a giant monitor at the front, just like the fantastical starship's. Also like the Enterprise, the doors made a 'whoosh' sound when they opened . Hollywood magic: A Hollywood set designer designed the chrome-covered war room known as the Information Dominance Center . There were even sound effects. Just . like in the Star Trek series, the doors to the so-called Information . Dominance Center war room made a ‘whoosh’ noise as they opened. ‘Though . it’s no surprise from a man described as ‘a techno-spy since the . beginning of his military career,’ an audio component could seem . excessive to some since tax dollars paid for the facility. Instead of Vulcans and Klingons, high ranking government officials stepped on and off Alexander’s bridge. Aye, sir: Now he's the leader of the embroiled NSA, an organization whose name has become synonymous with domstic spying since revelations that followed the Edward Snowden leak . ‘When he was running the Army's Intelligence and Security Command, Alexander brought many of his future allies down to Fort Belvoir for a tour of his base of operations,’ a source told Foreign Policy. ‘Lawmakers and other important officials took turns sitting in a leather 'captain's chair' in the center of the room and watched as Alexander, a lover of science-fiction movies, showed off his data tools on the big screen.’ The source, who was once in charge of VIP visits to the war room, revealed that Alexander used the remarkable space to help him woo officials. 'Everybody wanted to sit in the chair at least once to pretend he was Jean-Luc Picard,' said the source.","As head of the Army's Intelligence and Security Command, Keith Alexander gave orders from the odd room designed with tax dollars .

"A man who found himself unlucky in love decided to launch a unique dating night where singletons woo their potential matches by giving presentations. Rahul Saggar, from Brooklyn, New York, was inspired to start Presentation Date Night when a woman unexpectedly showed interest in him after hearing a PowerPoint presentation he gave at work. Now, Mr Saggar hosts events in his basement where guests drink complimentary alcohol and share cooking demonstrations, poetry readings and PowerPoint shows in the hopes that their presentations will lure mates. Modern love: Rahul Saggar, from Brooklyn, New York, hosts events in his basement where guests share cooking demonstrations, poetry readings and PowerPoint shows in the hopes that they will lure mates . Mr Saggar explained that the two events he has hosted so far were successful because they introduced a whole new way of courting potential love interests. He told DNAInfo: 'You're in someone's place that's cozy . and everyone is there for the same reason. There's a certain degree of humility, since you . know you're there presenting yourself.' Some of his guests have included a woman who made lemonade, a man who read aloud a poem about his likes and dislikes and a singer who performed with two drag queen backup dancers. And Mr Saggar himself, a documentary filmmaker, kicks off each session by reading a collection of rejection letters he's received from potential employers and movie submissions. 'I'd go to Rahul's even if I weren't . single - I like anything that . pulls New Yorkers out of their shells' Christopher Xavier, a musician and illustrator who attended one of the events, said of the night: 'The variety of acts was amazing.' Explaining that he was inspired to attend because he just got out of a long-term relationship, Mr Xavier added: 'I'd go to Rahul's show even if I weren't single or looking, because I like odd events and I like anything that pulls New Yorkers out of their shells.' At the next event on Thursday, December 19, Mr Xavier plans to present a video he has made called Don't Look at Girls, which combines drawings and songs about the dangers of romance. Innovative concept: 'You're in someone's place that's cozy and everyone is there for the same reason,' explains Mr Saggar (pictured). There's a certain degree of humility, since you know you're there presenting yourself' 'I like the mystery of the show, too, as there are no rules or guidelines on how you'd sell yourself to the audience,' he said. 'No two presenters [are] remotely alike.' 'Everyone's there for the same reason, and there's a degree of humility, since you . know you're there presenting yourself' Mr Saggar launched the night with the intention of helping singletons find romance, but it seems the event has taken on a life of its own. Indeed, he described one night during which the dating event turned into a kind of group therapy session after one woman presented her online dating profile and started talking about how men 'have the power' in dating. 'And then men there said that the women have power,' said Mr Saggar. 'It became like a group therapy session... [The presentations] definitely become a dialogue.'","Rahul Saggar from Brooklyn, New York, was inspired to start Presentation Date Night when a woman unexpectedly showed interest  in him after he gave a PowerPoint presentation at work ."
"The controversial inventor behind the 3D printed gun has revealed his latest project - a $1200 milling machine to make untraceable rifles. Called the Ghost Gunner, the CNC mill can produce metal parts to built a rifle. The rifle does not have a serial number, and is therefore known as a 'ghost' gun. Scroll down for video . The CNC machine can automatically convert a prebought aluminium   block that can be bought legally for $80 into the main component of an assault rifle. The finished rifle: The parts are combined to make a fully functioning assault rifle . although the machine is a standard CNC milling machine used to make aluminium parts, it has been set up to work in a unique way. Rather than creating a gun from scratch, it adapt a part known as an '80% lower'. This is the body of the gun that connects its stock, barrel, magazine and other parts. If you purchase a pre milled '80% lower', a piece that is 80% complete and totally legal, you can clamp it into the machine, hit a button and it will do the rest. By milling the part at home, and buying the rest of the parts online, which are not controlled, it is possible to build a semi-automatic weapon with no serial number, a weapon some gun control advocates call a 'ghost gun'. Defense Distributed's previous creations have included 3-D printable plastic magazines and the Defender gun wrong brought it worldwide attention earlier this year. Cody Wilson, the man behind the firm, says the new product is the 'gold standard'. '3-D printing [guns] was about signaling the future,' he told Wired. 'This is about the present. 'You can use this machine today to create something to the standards you're used to…The gold standard of the gun community is metal.' The machine works in a unique way.

It is also the part of a gun that is most licensed. By milling the part at home, and buying the rest of the parts online, which are not controlled, it is possible to build a  semi-automatic weapon with no serial number, a weapon some gun control advocates call a 'ghost gun'. Favored by target shooters in competitions and by hunters who stalk small game and sometimes deer, the AR-15 is the most popular rifle in America. Police believe that an AR-15 was used by 23-year-old John Zawahri last year to kill five people in a rampage through Santa Monica before he was himself killed by police. It was also the weapon of choice for James Holmes in Aurora,and Adam Lanzi in Newtown. It fires a 5.56mm, or .223 caliber bullet. Magazines for the weapon (that are in circulation in the U.S.) range from 5 to 100 rounds. With proper training, a shooter can effectively and accurately empty a 30-round magazine in less than a minute. Selling that untraceable gun body is illegal, no law prevents you from making one. The firm boasts anyone can use the machine. 'Just follow a few simple instructions to mount your 80% lower receiver, tighten a couple screws (with simple tools we provide), and on day one, Ghost Gunner can help you legally manufacture unserialized firearms in the comfort of your own home.' The release of the kit, which has sold out its first run, follows a debate in California over a state law that would ban the manufacture of all guns without serial numbers. The bill, widely known as the 'ghost gun ban' and introduced by Los Angeles state senator Kevin de Leόn earlier this year was designed to criminalize either 3-D printing or finishing an 80 percent lower without a government-assigned serial number in California. The legislation passed California's senate and assembly, but was vetoed by the state's governor Jerry Brown, who wrote that he 'can't see how adding a serial number to a homemade gun would significantly advance public safety.' 'You can have an unserialized toothbrush, and you can have an unserialized rifle,' Wilson told Wired. 'This is important to me. 'The untraceable firearm is my stand.' the machine is small enough to be used at home - and costs just $1299. The machine is available to preorder online . Defense Distributed said it decided to build its machine from the ground up. 'We found existing CNC machines too expensive, too DIY, or too inaccurate to manufacture firearms for the casual user. 'By miniaturizing the build envelope to just large enough to mill common firearm receivers, we were able to improve rigidity, reduce material cost and simultaneously relax some design limits, allowing us to sell an inexpensive machine with more than enough accuracy to manufacture firearms. 'All GhostGunner schematics and design files will be published into the public domain,' the firm said.","Allows anyone to create an AR-15 assault rifle from parts that can be bought online freely .

"More than a dozen sick British tourists have been put on IV drips after getting struck down with a mysterious sickness bug at a four-star Thomas Cook holiday hotel – which the tour operator is still taking bookings for. Around 18 holidaymakers – including members of a wedding party – have complained of sickness and diarrhoea at the ‘dream resort’ in Holguin, Cuba. At least one visitor has been taken to hospital due to the severe symptoms while 18 others are said to have been given saline drips to treat severe hydration after falling ill with suspected food poisoning at Hotel Playa Pesquero. Scroll down for video . Around 18 holidaymakers - including members of a wedding party - have complained of sickness and diarrhoea at the 'dream resort' and at least one visitor has been taken to hospital due to the severe symptoms . More than a dozen sick British tourists have been put on IV drips after getting struck down with a mysterious sickness bug at a four-star Thomas Cook holiday hotel Hotel Playa Pesquero in Holguin, Cuba . It is not the first time holidaymakers have been struck down with illness at the hotel. Just a few weeks ago tour operator Thomas Cook agreed to pay out £150,000 in compensation to 20 tourists who went down with food poisoning at the same hotel last year. And in 2012, newlyweds James and Collette Sullivan started the process of suing holiday giant First Choice after the pair and their two young children contracted a ‘Salmonella bug’ while staying at the resort to get married. At the time a First Choice spokeswoman said: 'We are sorry to hear the family did not enjoy their holiday.' The latest outbreak is said to be affecting around 80% of the visitors staying at the 944-room hotel. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office confirmed one person had been hospitalised since the outbreak started last month. Several holidaymakers have told of the ‘poor standard of hygiene’ and ‘obscene’ toilet facilities at the resort via travel website TripAdvisor. One user, DominoOne, from London, wrote: ‘At this moment in time there is a sickness bug going around which has wiped out approximately 80% of the hotel with 18 people requiring IV fluids and a number have been admitted to hospital. ‘This was confirmed to me by the numerous on site doctors following my families many visits to the onsite Surgery. Several holidaymakers took to travel website Trip Advisor to complain about the 'poor standard of hygiene' and 'obscene' toilet facilities at Hotel Playa Pesquero . One TripAdvisor user, Pete May, wrote: 'I was part of a large wedding group and I think almost everyone had ""bowel issues"" mine last 2 days, not good' ‘The general standard of hygiene in the hotel is very poor. No hand washes on entry and exits, as you find in other quality hotels.’ Patsie00, from the West Midlands, branded her trip to the hotel ‘hugely disappointing’ and said: ‘We, along with a lot of other guests caught what we were told was a virus in the hotel, and were ill for 6 days. ‘I would NOT ever recommend this hotel ........ it's a lesson learnt for us.’ Dande0508, from Norfolk, added: ‘The food was very poor, about 80% of hotel was ill with a bad belly. ‘We would not go back to this hotel again, purely because of tummy bug and food.’ Pete May, wrote: 'I was part of a large wedding group and I think almost everyone had ""bowel issues"" mine last 2 days, not good' And ChrisB posted: ‘My wife fell ill after two of the evening meals. On our final night after dining at the seafood restaurant, my wife and I both felt nauseous.’ Lawyers for holidaymakers who have been taken ill at the resort said visitors are now being advised not to go in the swimming pool area and said it was looking into launching a group action case. Simon Lomax, of lawyers Simpson Millar, said: ‘While this latest outbreak is quite rightly very worrying for holidaymakers it doesn't surprise us as we have just settled a case against Thomas Cook for a similar outbreak last year at the same hotel. ‘In that case around twenty British holidaymakers were struck down with a severe stomach and sickness bug with diarrhoea. ‘They spent the majority of their stay confined to the bedrooms at the four star rated hotel. It later turned out to be Salmonella caused by poor hygiene practices. The latest outbreak at Hotel Playa Pesquero in Holguin, Cuba is said to be affecting around 80% of the visitors staying at the 944-room hotel and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office confirmed one had been hospitalised . Several guests, including Patsie00, complained about the 'obscene' toilet facilities and said there were only two cubicles of toilets by each pool, which are supposed to cater for up to 600 guests . ‘We understand that a hotel doctor is now advising people not to go in the swimming pool area due to the risk of passing on infection. ‘It looks like dozens of Brits are affected and reports suggest many of the guests have been hospitalised and put on an IV drip because of the severe nature of the gastric symptoms. ‘That’s a big issue with dehydration in a hot country when you can’t keep anything down.' He also said he suspected the outbreak to be a repeat of previous Salmonella poisoning at Playa Pesquero. He said: ‘The allegations raised are very similar this time; birds in the restaurant, poor food hygiene, birds droppings in food, dirty equipment and under-cooked food. ‘They are all problems that lead to a good suspicion of food poisoning . ‘This is not an acceptable practice as the same rules apply to food and water hygiene as back home. ‘Holiday companies need to take steps to ensure that international hygiene standards are complied with and that holidaymakers are not subjected to food-borne illness and disease. ‘The attention to cleanliness of equipment and staff is essential in preventing illness outbreak but in this case it looks like lessons have not been learned.’ While some holidaymakers have paid extra for earlier flights back to the UK, many are still stranded at the hotel because flights by tour operators only run fortnightly this time of year. At least one visitor has been taken to hospital due to the severe symptoms while 18 others are said to have been given saline drips to treat severe hydration after falling ill with suspected food poisoning at Hotel Playa Pesquero . Despite reports of the serious outbreak of sickness and diarrhoea at the resort, Thomas Cook is still selling hotel packages to Hotel Playa Pesquero which is deemed a four-star resort . Mr Lomax added: ‘It is difficult getting home early from Cuba as flights are fortnightly with the tour operator. These families have saved a long time for what was supposed to be a dream holiday. ‘They’ve spent the whole time sitting on the toilet and some have been hospitalised. Their holidays have been spoilt.’ Despite reports of the serious outbreak of sickness and diarrhoea at the resort, Thomas Cook is still selling hotel packages to the hotel. The four-star Hotel Playa Pesquero is described by the tour operator giant as having ‘beautiful surroundings and a truly relaxing atmosphere’ which makes the hotel ‘come up trumps’. In 2012, newlyweds James and Collette Sullivan started the process of suing holiday giant First Choice after the pair and their two young children contracted a 'Salmonella bug' while staying at the hotel for their wedding . It boasts two swimming pools, an international buffet restaurant and several a la carte restaurants. An all-inclusive seven night stay, based on two people sharing in May, is currently on offer via the Thomas Cook website for £870 - with flights from Gatwick included. Thomas Cook is not the only operator to use the hotel but they have launched an investigation after some of their guests fell ill. A Thomas Cook spokesman said: ‘Thomas Cook takes health and hygiene issues very seriously and maintaining the safety of our guests is our number one priority. ‘We can confirm that a number of customers staying at the Hotel Playa Pesquero in Cuba have recently reported a stomach upset which is currently under investigation. 'We are working with management at the Hotel Playa Pesquero to ensure that the appropriate procedures are being followed and those customers in the resort are offered every assistance by our dedicated resort team. ‘We know how important holidays are to our customers and how upsetting it can be when they are ill overseas. We will continue to follow rigorous processes to establish the cause of all cases of sickness reported to our staff. ‘We urge any customers with concerns in resort to contact a member of the resort team immediately for assistance.’ A spokesman from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said: ‘We have become aware of an incident at a hotel in Holguin, Cuba in March. ‘We understand that a number of guests, including some British nationals, became ill, resulting in one person being hospitalised. ‘We stand ready to provide consular assistance if requested.’","One hospitalised and dozens on IV drips after outbreak at 'four-star' hotel .

"Attackers collecting body parts of albinos for witchcraft hacked off the hand of a seven-year-old boy, officials said today. The boy was walking home with his friends in Tanzania when he was seized by the men. It is the latest in a series of bloody assaults on albino people. An Albino boy is pictured with black pupils in a school. The seven-year-old Tanzanian boy was attacked as he walked home with four school friends and his arm was hacked off (file picture) Apolinary Macheta, the local government leader in Tanzania's southwestern Milepa district, said: 'The boy was attacked on Saturday by three people as he walked home with his four school friends.' The boy named Mwigulu Magessa, is recovering in hospital, Macheta added. It comes just days after an albino mother of four had her arm chopped off by machete-wielding men. Police said on Saturday they had arrested five men after discovering the decomposing limb hidden in a field. In Tanzania, albinos are killed and dismembered due to a widespread belief that charms made from their body parts bring good fortune and prosperity. Albinism is a genetic condition characterised by a deficiency of melanin pigmentation in the skin, hair and eyes which protects from the sun's ultraviolet rays. Human rights groups have called the rise in attacks on albino people 'alarming'. They are targetted and dismembered due to a belief their body parts bring good fortune (file picture) People suffering from the condition are discriminated against and persecuted in many African countries. Last month an albino child died in Tanzania's Tabora region after attackers hacked off his arm with a machete. Kijo Bisimba, of Tanzania's Legal and Human Rights Centre, has said a rise in attacks is 'alarming' and pointed to a renewed spate of assaults after what it said was months of calm. Such ritual killings have also occurred in neighbouring Burundi and some of the attackers are suspected to be from Tanzania, where albino body parts can fetch thousands of dollars.","The boy was walking home with four school friends when he was attacked .

"A scarcity of lethal injection drugs has forced states to go back to the future to carry out capital punishments. Tennessee has brought back the electric chair and both Wyoming and Utah are considering the use of firing squads, according to reports. Republican Gov. Bill Haslam signed a bill into law Thursday allowing Tennessee to electrocute death row inmates when prisons are unable to obtain the necessary drugs, the state announced. Grim return: Tennessee has reintroduced the electric chair as an execution method (Virigina's electric chair, located at Virginia State Penitentiary in Richmond, is pictured) The drastic measure is just the first of what may be many as European drug makers are refusing to sell the cocktail of drugs normally used to execute death row inmates. Tennessee lawmakers overwhelmingly passed the electric chair legislation in April, with the Senate voting 23-3 and the House 68-13 in favor of the bill. The Volunteer State is also the first in the nation to bring the electric chair back into use without giving condemned inmates the option of an alternative method, according to Richard Dieter, the executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center. ‘There are states that allow inmates to choose, but it is a very different matter for a state to impose a method like electrocution,’ he said. ‘No other state has gone so far.’ Dieter said he expects legal challenges to arise if the state decides to go through with an electrocution, both on the grounds of whether the state could prove that lethal injection drugs were not obtainable and constitutional protections against cruel and unusual punishment. The electric chairs reintroduction to Tennessee came just as rumblings started in both Wyoming and Utah that those states are mulling over whether to bring back sharp shooters to carry out death sentences. Give them the gas: Wyoming law currently requires inmates to die in a gas chamber similar to this one if no lethal injection drugs are available, but no such facility exists in the state . A Wyoming legislative committee has begun drawing up a bill that would allow firing squads to end the life of inmates . Bob Lampert, director of the Wyoming Department of Corrections, told members of the Wyoming Legislature's Joint Interim Judiciary Committee the state has completely run out of the lethal injection drugs, and suggested an alternate method of executing inmates. ‘In the event that we had an execution scheduled and we couldn't carry it out as a result of lack of substances, I suggested to the Joint Judiciary that we may want to consider having an alternate means of execution, such as the firing squad,’ he said. Laws currently on the books call for the state to execute inmates using a gas chamber should the need arise. Wyoming has only one inmate currently on death row – Dale Wayne Eaton, who convicted in 2004 of the brutal 1988 sexual assault and murder of a teenage woman, according to the Billings Gazette. A vote will not likely be held on the measure until July, during the state’s next legislative meeting. The answer?: The execution chamber at the Utah State Prison is seen after Ronnie Lee Gardner was executed by a firing squad in Draper June 18, 2010 . Republican Utah legislator Paul Ray is also planning to float the idea later this year of bringing firing squad deaths back to the state. ‘It sounds like the Wild West, but it's probably the most humane way to kill somebody,’ said Ray. It has been only four years since the last firing squad death in Utah – five police officers used .30-caliber Winchester rifles in 2010 to execute convicted murderer Ronnie Lee Gardner. He actually chose to be killed by firing squad rather than lethal injection. The state had outlawed it in 2004 but left open the possibility of anyone condemned to a death sentence prior to the ban to have the option, Gardner took it. ‘The prisoner dies instantly,’ Ray insisted. ‘It sounds draconian. It sounds really bad, but the minute the bullet hits your heart, you're dead. There's no suffering.’ Dieter said that if Utah brought back firing squads as a default option rather than leaving it up to inmates to choose, as was the practice before 2004, it could also be challenged in court. Tennessee has 74 prisoners on death row and Utah has nine, state records showed. The Supreme Court has never declared a method of execution unconstitutional on the grounds that it is cruel and unusual. It upheld the firing squad in 1879, the electric chair in 1890 and lethal injection in 2008. Lethal injection is receiving more scrutiny as an execution method, especially after last month's botched execution in Oklahoma. In the Oklahoma case, inmate Clayton Lockett's vein apparently collapsed and he suffered a fatal heart attack 43 minutes after the process began. Many other states including Oklahoma, Missouri and Texas also use lethal injection for the death penalty. Authorities in those states have also expressed concern about difficulties obtaining the necessary drugs.","The states are looking for alternative execution methods as lethal injection drug supplies dry up .
Utah abolished firing squads in 2004 but last executed a man using one in 2010 because he chose the method prior to it being outlawed .
Wyoming law requires a gas chamber to be used should no lethal injection drugs be available - the state has no gas chamber ."
"Spain's Euro 2012 heroes got the royal seal of approval today as two special little fans welcomed the team home. Princess Letizia's daughters six-year-old Leonor and Sofia - proudly wearing Spain football shirts - got to grips with the silverware at a reception given to the members of Spanish national team.

"The chip off the old Eubank block made his father proud but did not do quite enough on his own behalf to win a fight which was an epic of its class. Billy Joe Saunders boxed the boy’s ears off in the first half of their grudge match and then survived a torrid last six rounds to hold onto this British, Commonwealth and European middleweight titles. The ExCeL arena was rocking even more loudly than when Anthony Joshua was winning his super-heavyweight gold medal at the London Olympics. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Billy Joe Saunders: I still think Chris Eubank Jr is a 'c***' Billy Joe Saunders celebrates beating Chris Eubank Junior via split decision to retain his British, Commonwealth and European titles . Rivals Eubank Junior (left) and Saunders share a rare moment of respect after finding out the result of their long-awaited fight . Saunders (right) throws a right hand at Eubank Junior (left) during their clash at the ExCeL centre in London . Eubank Junior (right) attempts to land a body shot on Saunders during their 12-round battle on Saturday evening . On my card Saunders battled fairly safely to the finishing line, although the official judges had it close enough to give it to him on a split decision. But some of the closing rounds were a wafer thin call between the skills of Saunders and the charging power of Chris Jnr. Eubank was given something of a boxing lesson in the first six rounds and if he had been given that kind of education before he probably would have caused the upset his famous father expected. As it, he finished this brutal night already the better for the experience and if these two collide again, which they surely will in the future, it could be a different ending. However, Saunders proved his enormous courage in the closing stages to keep the more powerful Eubank just about at bay. It was a magnificent clash of styles between the boxer and the powerful physical specimen. But Eubank will be regretting not going onto the attack earlier. He spent the early rounds partly in posturing mode, trying to lure Saunders onto a one-punch KO but the champion was so accurate with his southpaw jab that he was able to land and nip away on most occasions. And when Eubank came storming after him he still landed sharp punches of his own in contrast to Eubank’s hefty blows. Eubank's arrival was reminiscent of how his father used to come among us – adopting a statuesque pose on the ring apron before vaulting over the ropes. Like Chris Snr was in imposing, muscular condition, while his dad was his familiar immaculate self, in elegantly black to match the boy's trunks. Eubank stood waiting in the corner at the first bell and Saunders obliged by crossing the ring to confront him, landing at once with his southpaw jab and continuing to do so through a lively first opening session in which he caught Eubank with some crisp rights, also . Saunders was resisting the temptation to be drawn into a brawl to Eubank's advantage. He used his more polished skills and again had the better of the more fiery exchanges. They taunted each other after one skirmish and then stood face to face at then of the round, which again went to Saunders. Saunders shouts with delight after being named the winner of Saturday evening's grudge match in east London . Saunders (right) has earned a shot at the WBO world middleweight title next year after his split decision victory . Eubank Junior (left), who came out on top on one judge's scorecard, looks down on Saunders after throwing a left hand . Saunders proudly displays his British, Commonwealth and European title belts inside the ring after retaining them with another victory . Eubank was waiting to land the one big shot he needed to discourage Saunders and reinforce his own confidence – while his father stood erect and watching intently behind his corner. He did connect with a sharp left when they landed simultaneously his punch looked the heavier. But Saunders was unimpressed and went on to extend his early lead. Eubank stood back in attempt to draw Saunders in but the champion bided his time before engaging and his southpaw jab was usually accurate enough to enable him to connect and escape. Eubank's lunges looked raw in comparison with the experienced skills of Saunders and he had still to win a round. The fifth was a messier stanza so not as clear cut. With so few punches landed neither man deserved to win it. At times Eubannk was missing by yards. Saunders tried to embarrass him into advancing by barking 'come on.' Eubank made a gesture in that direction but too often ended up in a wrestling match. Saunders just edges it but the rounds are inching closer. Whenever referee Michael Alexander was able to keep them apart Saunders landed. Eiubank had some success within the spasms of grappling and landed two good lefts to win his first round of what was becoming a very late night. Eubank kept telling his opponent that he was not hurting him and there was no doubting his strength of chin as well as physique. The Eubannk cavalry charges ere beginning to have an effect and he shook Saunders twice at close quarters to close the gap a little further.

Chris Eubank (centre) congratulates Saunders on his victory against his son by shaking his hand after the final bell . It was rough house now but Saunders rediscovered his range with some clever combinations. Even though Eubank shook his man with one pile-driver it was not enough to give him this one. Saunders was boxing his way back into the ascendancy but still knew he was in a fight. Eubank came on strong to land a heavy right but Saunders opened up with lefts and right just before the bell to move within reaching distance of the finishing line. Eubnank was warned for punching low, not for the first time. As they clinched again and again the issue was whether Saunders would weaken in the championship rounds. It was a war of attrition at this stage. Eubank was warned yet again for punching low, then slipped to the canvas as it ended. On my card Eubank needed a knockout. He went for it in massive style and rocked Saunders twice. The effort was taking its toll on Eubank, also. It was an epic climax,with Saunders risking everything by standing his ground instead of keeping out of trouble, But he survived. Both men claimed the victory, with Eubank Snr congratuling his son. He had won the last battle but surely not the war.","Billy Joe Saunders beat Chris Eubank Jnr on points after a pulsating fight in London .

"Everton winger Kevin Mirallas has done his own soul-searching following the unedifying sight of West Ham's James Tomkins clutching his face in fake agony despite being shoved several inches lower, in the chest, by the Belgian international. Tomkins has been rightly castigated for falsely trying to get a fellow professional in trouble during last weekend's hostile encounter at Goodison Park, but as a father to two-year-old son Juan, Mirallas also accepts responsibility for his role in the incident. Accepting that footballers have a duty to their audience of varying ages, he doesn't think he was right to push Tomkins in the first place after a set-to sparked by his foul on West Ham's Morgan Amalfitano. James Tomkins reacted over the top to a push from Kevin Mirallas last weekend at Goodison Park . Tomkins embarrassingly held his head as if he'd been pushed in the face by the Belgian winger . Tomkins goes down clutching his face in agony despite not getting any contact near his face . 'The sad thing for me, reflecting on it, was that it was also a bit stupid of myself to react in the way I did. I always try to give a good positive image,' said Mirallas. 'A yellow card could have been a red card offence so I think I was lucky with my own reaction. It was rash. In a match, things sometimes happen that are a source of regret afterwards.' He's not letting Tomkins off the hook for his embarrassing play-acting though. 'It was sad to see simulation of that level, upsetting,' said Mirallas. 'You go out to be the best role model on the pitch, not just for the fans but the millions of children who watch football too.' Fortunately for Mirallas, referee Mark Clattenburg wasn't conned by Tomkins and he is therefore available to face Spurs on Sund. It's a game that is important to Everton's ambition of qualifying for the Champions League by topping last season's fifth-place finish and Mirallas goes to White Hart Lane having made an impressive comeback last weekend from a hamstring injury that kept him out for almost two months. His man-of-the-match performance in Thursday night's 2-0 Europa League win against Wolfsburg saw the 27-year-old set up the first goal for compatriot Romelu Lukaku, and score the second. Romelu Lukaku (right) and  Mirallas both scored as Everton defeated Wolfsburg 2-0 in the Europa League . Mirallas slotted home Everton's second of the game on 75 minutes at the Vauxhall Arena . The result saw Everton qualify for the knockout stages of the competition as winners of Group H . 'It's true I am back quicker than the original diagnosis claimed. Thankfully it didn't turn out to be as serious as they first believed,' said Mirallas. 'I had some very good care in Belgium and I have come back strong. 'I don't see why our team shouldn't reach fourth or do even better. 'Everton weren't able to penetrate to the highest levels before, maybe we didn't have the resources or players to do it. 'But now we are in a position to sign more expensive players, there is a certain stability in the club, players are staying more than in the past and we are able to target higher-quality players that come up for sale. 'I am not saying it is necessary to go out and splurge and make big purchases, but buying one or two quality players each year results in having the best team possible, and I think that is what we are doing. 'This year has been excellent, playing in European competition as well, and I think we are on the right route.' While results have picked up after an indifferent start to the season, Everton's crowded fixture list has led to injuries with John Stones, Bryan Oviedo and Antolin Alcaraz ruled out of the trip to north London and doubts also surrounding Leighton Baines, Steven Naismith, James McCarthy, Gareth Barry and Steven Pienaar. It may lead Martinez to ask Mirallas to play his third game in a week where he will come up against two fellow Belgian internationals Jan Vertonghen and Nacer Chadli, the latter a childhood friend from back home. Mirallas has already opened contract talks with the club with his current deal having less than two years to run. 'Everyone is out to get the best they can in terms of their contract in terms of their contract but I will just underline that I am very happy here,' he said.","Kevin Mirallas admits to soul-searching following James Tomkins incident .

"A Labour MP is on the verge of defecting to UKIP, Douglas Carswell claimed today. The former Tory MP who easily won the Clacton by-election after switching parties said it was 'looking very promising' that a Labour MP would be next to join him. Labour leader Ed Miliband today sought to rescue his crisis-hit leadership with a fresh promise of an immigration crackdown, after UKIP also came within 617 votes of winning the safe Labour seat of Heywood and Middleton on Thursday night. Scroll down for video . Ed Miliband (left) has announced new immigration measures after conceding UKIP is a threat to the Labour party, but new UKIP MP Douglas Carswell, pictured arriving at the BBC today, claims a Labour MP could be next to defect . Mr Carswell's surprise defection in August sent shockwaves through Westminster, and within weeks was followed by fellow Mark Reckless, the MP for Rochester and Strood. Attention had been focused on Tory MPs and their willingness to change parties, fearing a UKIP surge in their constituencies would cost them their seat in Parliament. However, the Heywood result and growing unease about Mr Miliband's leadership mean UKIP leader Nigel Farage now has his sights set on wooing Labour MPs to cross the floor. Mr Carswells revealed that within hours of his Clacton by-election triumph, he took a call from a Labour MP poised to jump. Speaking on Friday, he said: 'A member of the parliamentary Labour party called me this morning and we had a chat about them coming over. 'It's looking very promising,' he told The Sunday Times. 'For years and years and years, like monopolistic businesses, they assumed the customers had nowhere else to go. Ed Miliband has been urged to copy Tony Blair by having people with broader appeal around him, such as Gordon Brown and John Prescott . Ed Miliband must get out of his 'north London comfort zone' or he will not win the election, Labour MP John Mann warned today. He urged the Labour leader to appoint a wide slate of MPs to his frontbench, in the way that Tony Blair put up with Gordon Brown and John Prescott because they broadened New Labour's appeal. Mr Mann said Mr Miliband’s article would not persuade a sceptical country he was taking action to deal with immigration. Labour MP John Mann . He told MailOnline: 'We need to see demonstrable evidence of a change of attitude. 'He has to move outside his north London comfort zone. Tony Blair had Brown, who he clearly couldn’t stand, and Prescott, who is not a natural dining partner, as his key lieutenants. 'Blair’s wasn’t particularly comfortable with either Brown or Prescott but he understood that represented areas of the electorate that he didn’t feel comfortable with. ‘Miliband isn’t doing it, that’s Miliband’s problem. ‘If he doesn’t succeed in getting outside his comfort zone, he will not be Prime Minister.' 'Then UKIP came along. For years and years they assumed that their own party had nowhere else to go. Well, guess what, guys, they do.' Today he told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show he hoped there would be more Tory MPs joining UKIP. But he stressed: 'UKIP is not the Conservative party in exile. I try to work with MPs from all parties. I am primarily interested in making sure voters make the journey I have made.' He refused to confirm or deny that veteran Labour MP Austin Mitchell was poised to defect. 'Austin Mitchell has been saying that for many years and on that I think he's proved ahead of his time,' Mr Carswell said. 'I try and work with MPs of all parties but I'm primarily interested in trying to make sure that voters make the journey that I have made. 'This isn't about which 650 politicians make their journey.' He likened the Tory party to struggling music shop HMV, with UKIP acting like the online music-streaming service Spotify. 'I think it’s a little bit like HMV music, once ubiquitous when it came to buying music. 'The way the Tory Party is retailing politics is like the way HMV retailed music: it’s a defunct retail model. 'I argued that we needed to Spotify politics, we ought to make the Conservative Party a bit more like Spotify, but the Conservative Party can’t change and won’t change because there are too many vested interests that are against recall, against open primary, against direct democracy, against change. 'Why? Because if we had direct democracy many members of the Conservative Party and the leadership would be replaced.' In an attempt to shore up his troubled leadership, Mr Miliband today pledged tougher measures for migrants coming to Britain saying they will have to be able to speak English and must earn the right to claim benefits. The Labour leader announced the policy just days after the party only narrowly won last week's Heywood and Middleton by-election in the former Labour stronghold, where it hung on with a wafer-thin majority over Ukip. Mr Miliband has been accused by some party members of not doing enough to combat the threat of Ukip with Andrew MacKinlay, the former MP for Thurrock, saying the party's dismal performance 'was not the performance of a Government-in-waiting'. But today writing in the Observer, Mr Miliband says he recognises that Ukip is a threat that the Labour party cannot ignore as immigration has 'changed the face of many communitites.' He then went on to explain the new immigration measures were an attempt to tackle the issue in a 'hard-headed fashion'. The paper reports that sources say the new measures would include extending the period that EU migrants must wait before they can claim unemployment benefits to six months and imposing language tests on those applying for certain public sector jobs. Mr Miliband wrote: 'Our task is to turn the despair and cynicism on which Ukip thrives into a positive force for change. We can only do so if we understand that many people are turning to Ukip because of disappointment with Conservative and Labour governments. 'I will not cede the issue of immigration to those offering fear or falsehood. So I will continue to chart a new way forward, combining stronger border controls and laws to stop the exploitation that has undermined wages of local workers, with reforms to ensure those who come here speak English and earn the right to any benefit entitlements. 'Such measures are part of a compelling and credible plan for Britain's future that will restore the values people believe in – contribution, responsibility, fairness – to the way our country is run.' Ukip have risen dramatically in the polls since April 2012 when they languished on 9% with little hope of an MP . The pledges come after concerns Nigel Farage and UKIP are gaining massive support in traditional Labour heartlands. Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman today insisted there was no 'wobble' in the Labour ranks and denied a leadership change would be required despite concerns about how voters view the party and huge Ukip gains in Heywood and Middleton. She told BBC 1's Andrew Marr Show: 'There's not a wobble in the ranks and nor should there be. 'Obviously we're very pleased we've got a new Labour MP and it was evident there was a collapse in confidence in the Tories and the Lib Dems but that doesn't make us complacent because the result was very close. 'But I think what is absolutely evident is that the anger and concern that there is amongst people when they're being told the recovery has arrived and yet they're not getting better off, and feeling disconnected from politics, that is being picked up on by Ukip but actually Ukip, although they're tapping into that sense of despair, they don't provide the answers.' Asked if there was any chance that Labour would change its leader before the general election, Ms Harman said: 'No, absolutely not. We always knew and Ed Miliband knew, the whole party knew it would be a very tough challenge after we were defeated in 2010 to be in contention to be in government and to have a Labour prime minister in 2015.' She added: 'We are not going to have a wobble or a leadership change.' Labour MP Graham Stringer says Mr Miliband's team have now idea how to combat Nigel Farage's, pictured, 'street fighting' political skill . One northern Labour MP, speaking on condition of anonymity, told the Mail on Sunday: 'If Miliband cared to ask me, I could tell him why Ukip is picking up votes in northern constituencies. It is because if a single mother with a child is in a queue for council housing, she will find that an East European family with three children can jump ahead of her. 'And if she goes to the local GPs, the same East European families will have taken all the appointments. Anyone who utters that kind of sentiment is denounced as a racist. It is nothing of the sort: it is the truth.' Meanwhile another MP, Graham Stringer, said Labour could lose the General Election because Mr Miliband's team had no idea how to combat Nigel Farage's 'street-fighting' political skill. Mr Stringer, who took part in the Heywood campaign,said he was shocked by the hostility to Labour on the doorstep. 'We came extremely close to losing the seat,' he said. 'The ministerial bag-carriers who now run the Labour Party have no idea how to manage the bare-knuckle street-fighting which is Farage's speciality. 'The seat nearly fell – and the General Election could be lost for the same reason – because we are not tackling people's feeling of unfairness over immigration and the effect it is having on schools, housing and hospitals. 'The team around Ed Miliband have this aversion to even discussing immigration because they are so ideologically wedded to the EU and its open borders policy.'","New UKIP MP Douglas Carswell predicts more defections from other parties .

"Rihanna's staff asked Topshop to send her clothes – after she had threatened to sue the store for using her face on a T-shirt. The singer claims the ‘unendorsed’ white T-shirt with a photograph of her in a bra top may have damaged her image. But that didn’t stop her entourage calling Topshop six times after a dispute had broken out ‘asking for products for her to wear’, according to the store. Dispute: Rihanna is suing Topshop over the T-shirt bearing the picture of her face, seen left, which she claims is similar to one of her album covers and could mislead fans into believing the item was 'genuine' merchandise . But while the singer is claiming the . top blighted her image it has not stopped her entourage contacting . Topshop to ask for clothes for Rihanna half a dozen times since the . lawsuit was launched.,  the retailer's lawyers said. A barrister at London's High . Court today claimed Rihanna's representatives had asked Topshop for products for the singer on '10 recent occasions', and said her 'shopping . habits' were testament to the retailer's own considerable reputation. Of those 10 occasions, six came after Rihanna launched proceedings against Topshop, said Geoffrey Hobbs QC. Mr Hobbs said: 'It is not in dispute . that Rihanna is a celebrity (but) the reputation of Topshop is also . material to the allegation of misrepresentation. 'Rihanna's . own shopping habits provide compelling evidence of Topshop's reputation . in fashion wear. (There are) 10 recent occasions on which her . representatives have contacted Topshop asking for products for her to . wear. 'We note that six of these requests post-date this dispute,' the barrister said. 'Shopping habits': Employees of Rihanna, seen wearing a Topshop jumper last year, have asked for clothes for the singer since she launched legal proceedings, the retailer's lawyers said . The T-shirt in question is printed with a snap of the star wearing a bra top, which she says was 'very similar' to images used on one of her album covers. She . claims sales of the shirt amounted to 'passing off' and may have led to . her reputation being tarnished with her fans, had they bought the . garment thinking it was 'genuine' endorsed merchandise with 'an . emotional connection to their heroine'. Lawyers for Topshop maintain the retailer did nothing wrong, and accuse the pop star of making an unjustifiable bid to establish a 'free standing image right' over use of her picture in the UK. Mr Justice Birss, sitting at London's High Court, heard that Topshop bought a licence to use the image on the T-shirt from the photographer who took it, during the video shoot for Rihanna's single We Found Love which was filmed in Belfast and Bangor, Northern Ireland, in November 2011. However the 25-year-old singer protested that they had short changed her and her fans when the T-shirt went on sale. The judge was shown the controversial tank-top T-shirt, showing the singer in a pale bra top with her hair in an up-do, as part of a 'wall of T-shirts' displayed to the court on coat hangers in evidence today. Martin Howe QC, for Rihanna, who is suing Topshop's owners, Arcadia Brands Limited under her real name, Robyn Rihanna Fenty, told the court: 'Rihanna is one of the world's most famous musical performing artists. She needs little introduction. 'Like most well known contemporary performing artists, she engages in merchandising, and like most such performing artists, it represents a significant part of her revenue stream. 'In 2012, Topshop sold a T-shirt displaying a clearly recognisable image of Rihanna taken when she was on a video shoot. She was wearing her makeup and hairdo for the video shoot, and very similar images of her appeared on her CD inlay (for the album Talk that Talk.) 'The sales...gave rise to a likelihood of deception, damaging Rihanna's goodwill. 'A substantial number of people buying, or even seeing, those T-shirts would think they are approved or somehow connected with Rihanna, when, in fact, they were not approved of or connected with her at all. 'This will be particularly so amongst the group of most likely purchasers of those T-shirts, namely fans of Rihanna. 'We are saying that one of the qualities of the T-shirt is the mere fact of whether it has been endorsed or not, and is a genuine object, emanating from the source of the fans' affection. 'It is not so much a concern about the quality of the item, but it not having the emotional attachment to the heroine and (for fans) the desire to own the actual item issued by their heroine. Claims: Topshop was selling a T-shirt emblazoned with a picture of Rihanna's face she claims is 'very similar' to one of her album covers . 'Rihanna's case is not about stopping the sale of all images of her on T-shirts in the UK, nor is it about trying to create a free standing so-called image right in the UK. Passing off is a question of fact in each case. 'Topshop accepts that Rihanna has generated goodwill as a musical performing artist. It denies that she has any goodwill in any other area. 'Rihanna's case is that she has generated reputation and goodwill beyond that as a musical performing artist (which) extends into the fashion and clothing industries and has done so for years. 'She has collaborated in the design of clothes with a range of clothing designers at the high end of fashion, including Giorgio Armani and Gucci, and at established high street fashion stores, including River Island. 'These garments were not only endorsed by her but were sold and labelled under Rihanna's name and trademark. These ranges were highly acclaimed,' the barrister said. Mr Howe concluded by saying that Rihanna is seeking a 'blanket injunction' preventing Topshop from offering for sale any clothing bearing her image. Geoffrey Hobbs QC, for Topshop, responded that, having bought a licence to use the image from the photographer who took it, the fashion giants were fully entitled to sell the T-shirt. 'We resist the claim on two main bases; first, this is, in substance and reality, an impermissible attempt by Rihanna to establish an image reproduction right in the UK. There is no such right. 'On the contrary, Topshop are entitled honestly to sell the garment, having obtained the necessary copyright licence. 'Secondly there is no representation here, given that the garment is fashion wear and not promotional merchandise.' The hearing, set to last until next week, continues.","R&B mega-star is suing Topshop over T-shirt with picture of her face on it .

"Harry Redknapp admitted the price will have to be right if he is to sign Jermain Defoe. The QPR manager tried desperately to sign the Toronto FC striker in the summer transfer window and wants to buy him in January. But the 32-year-old will reportedly want upwards of £80,000-a-week and Toronto claim they want to keep a striker they signed on a four-year deal in February. The numbers will make or break the deal, according to Redknapp, who gave Defoe his West Ham debut in 1999, signed him for Portsmouth in 2008, and bought him again for Spurs in 2009. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch . Former England striker Jermain Defoe is currently playing for Toronto FC in the MLS . Harry Redknapp (right) has been Defoe's manager at three clubs and signed him twice before . Redknapp said: ‘There is no deal close for Jermain yet. I am a big fan of Jermain, I have signed him enough. ‘We tried to sign him in the summer but it couldn’t be done so we will have to wait and see on that one. ‘He is a player we are interested in but the figures have to be right. ‘I haven’t spoken to the chairman about it but we will see, I know what we need. The figures would have to be right, and it's a player we would like.’ Redknapp, meanwhile, admitted he is surprised Rio Ferdinand has not appealed his three-game ban for his recent Twitter spat. Redknapp said: ‘I spoke to Rio. I thought he was going to appeal. It was unjust. I thought it was a heavy punishment. Someone criticised him and he criticised back.

"A cyclist who took part in a documentary highlighting his clash with a taxi driver has become the target of death threats from motorists. Gareth Williams provided the BBC with footage filmed on  his helmet camera for The War On Britain’s Roads, which was broadcast on Wednesday night. But after it was shown he was branded ‘smug’, ‘antagonistic’ and ‘confrontational’ online by viewers and even subjected to threats such as he ‘deserves to be run over’. Scroll down to watch . Abuse: Gareth Williams, pictured, was inundated with abuse following his appearance on BBC1's The War on Britain's Roads on Wednesday night . Anger: In one of the film's most controversial moments, Williams slapped the side of a taxi and then captured his confrontation with driver Michael on his helmet camera . Fraying tempers: Williams call the cabbie a 'mug' and then accuses him of assault for poking the helmet camera . Mr Williams, 24, was seen arguing with a taxi driver who pulled over to remonstrate after he had banged on the side of his cab following a near-miss. He antagonised the driver by sarcastically applauding him and calling him a ‘mug’ before accusing him of assault after he poked the camera on his helmet. After the driver got back in his taxi Mr Williams followed on his bike, shouting: ‘You don’t own the road or the bus lane – you don’t own anything but your cab.’ Later on in the BBC1 documentary, Mr Williams boasted he was not afraid to annoy drivers by  riding in the middle of the road if it was safe to do so. Now the urban cyclist has been inundated with hate messages on the internet, with some of the abuse even coming from fellow cyclists. One Twitter user, known as Diesel, said: ‘The white guy in glasses arguing with the black taxi driver is going to get himself killed one day. Arrogant provocator [sic].’ Punch-up: The show featured several confrontations between motorists and cyclists filmed on helmet cameras . Violent confrontation: Simon Page, who was in a group of seven cyclists en route from Dover to London, was knocked to the ground in Bexley Village, South London . Street fight: Driver John Nicholls, right, was charged with assault - but escaped with a fine . Shelby Sadler said: ‘I want to smack this guy with the glasses he’s an idiot.’ But some went further, posting messages which said they would mow down the cyclist if they ever saw him out on the road. A viewer who called himself ‘Jerry’ on the social networking site tweeted: ‘I’d happily run him over, thinks he’s mint.’ A viewer called Kate Bailey said: ‘This cyclist with glasses on actually deserves to be knocked off his bike and die!!!!’ A third said: ‘I am a cyclist, but [he] deserves to be run over.’ A cyclist who died after a collision with a lorry yesterday has become the third bike user to die in just a week. The . man, believed to be in his 30s, was hit on a busy road into east London . in the morning rush hour and pronounced dead at the scene. The lorry driver has been arrested on suspicion of causing death by careless driving and is being questioned by police. Commercial Road was closed for five hours after the accident and buses were diverted. Jonathan . Lopez, a journalist who lives nearby, said: 'Commercial Road doesn’t . have any bike lanes, but it’s a very, very busy road. That man’s family . is going to be destroyed.' The latest casualty comes after an 87-year-old cyclist died in Cheltenham and a 48-year-old man in Bicester on Tuesday. It means 114 cyclists have been killed on the country’s roads this year alone. Mr Williams writes a blog, The Croydon Cyclist, on which he uploads footage of dangerous drivers and publishes the registration number of the vehicles involved. He also edits a website, cyclecamera.tv, that allows cyclists to share video camera footage of incidents filmed while riding. Last night Mr Williams, who cycles 30 miles a day in and out of London, dismissed the threats. He said: ‘I don’t see it as cyclist v motorist. It’s good road user v bad road user. It’s hot air. ‘People think they are anonymous on the internet. Come the real world, they will run away crying. I don’t think I’m at risk. 'I get lots of people on YouTube saying, “If I see you I will run you over. You are going to die.” You get so used to it you just ignore it.’ However, Mr Williams said he may take a break from posting videos recorded on his helmet camera.He said he was ‘disappointed’ with the way the documentary was edited and claimed it had started out with a different vision. ‘They kind of represented me as Jack-the-lad and a cocky, arrogant young guy,’ he said. ‘I comment on bad cyclists as well. I’m not just going for bad motorists.’ The documentary was condemned by the joint chairman of the Parliamentary Cycling Group, Labour MP Ian Austin. He described the programme as ‘stupid, sensationalist, simplistic, irresponsible nonsense’. 'Arrogant': Some Twitter users accused Gareth Williams of being a 'provacator' looking for trouble with motorists' Twitter storm: Many took exception to Gareth on Twitter . Road rage: Michael, a 52-year-old cabbie of 19 years, also got his chance to say his piece to camera in the programme . A cyclist who dedicated his life to campaigning for safer roads was killed by a car knocking him off his bicycle, an inquest heard. Former university lecturer Mark Brummell (right), 53, was hit by a Renault Scenic at some crossroads during a leisurely evening bike ride through the New Forest, Hants, after work. The cycling fanatic had been a leading member of a safety campaign group for 10 years, did not own a car and road everywhere. He was knocked off his beloved cycle by driver Stephen Chard in Ipley, but died later in hospital. Chard, 59, of Highcliffe, Dorset, was banned from the roads for a year after pleading guilty to causing death by careless driving. Coroner Keith Wiseman recorded a verdict of accidental death at an inquest. In a statement read to the court, Mr Brummell's brother Nic said he feels no anger towards Chard, who he believes made a 'genuine mistake'. He said: 'I'm a cyclist myself and I know how, with no malice, it is easy for human error to cause something so serious. 'I feel this man [Chard] would not have meant to hurt or kill my brother and just made an error. I don't feel anger towards him.' Chard was also ordered to complete 100 hours of unpaid work and pay 85 pounds costs by Southampton magistrates following the crash in May.

"Former George W. Bush adviser Karl Rove as some harsh wards for fellow Republican Michele Bachmann, who announced this week she will not seek another term in Congress: Good riddance. Rove said Bachman, who represented Minnesota's 6th Congressional District since 2007, 'did nothing' as chairwoman of the Tea Party Caucus. 'It will be an opening for the Tea Party,' Rove said Sunday on the ABC News program, This Week With George Stephanopoulos. 'Now the position is open, someone next year will accept the chairmanship of it, and they may do something with it.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Former Bush White House adviser Karl Rove said Michele Bachmann 'did nothing' while serving in Congress and is happy to hear that she will retire . Bachmann founded the House Tea Party Caucus, and is a stalwart defender of pro-life, anti-gay-marriage and anti-Obamacare initiatives . Bachmann's marathon video sounded at times like a series of disclaimers. She insisted that campaign finance probes and her barely-there victory margin in 2012 were not factors in her decision to forgo a re-election bid in 2014 . Rove's harsh words come a few days after Bachmann announced she would not seek another term in an eight-and-a-half minute video . message posted on YouTube. 'The . law limits anyone from serving as president of the United States for . more than eight years,' Bachmann said in her videotaped message. 'And in . my opinion - well, eight years is also long enough for an individual to . serve as a representative for a specific Congressional district.' Bachmann has been dogged by allegations that she improperly spent money from a Congress-related political action committee to help with her 2012 campaign for the Republican presidential nomination. Former campaign aides first leveled that accusation, and both the Office of Congressional Ethics and the federal Election Commission are investigating. The FBI has also made inquiries into charges that Bachmann's presidential campaign made secret payments to Iowa Republican state Senator Kent Sorenson for help in the run-up to the 2012 Iowa Caucuses. Former Bachmann chief of staff Andy Parrish said in a sworn statement that the congresswoman 'knew and approved' of unethical payments to Sorenson. But Bachmann insisted in her YouTube video that her presidential campaign did nothing wrong. Bachmann was a candidate for the GOP presidential nomination in 2012, but faltered when news surfaced that chronic Migraine headaches limited her ability to manage her day-to-day responsibilities. She bowed out in February 2012 and ran for re-election to Congress with just nine months to campaign . 'It was clearly understood that compliance with all rules and regulations was an absolute necessity for my presidential campaign,' she said, 'and I have no reason to believe that that was not the case.' Bachmann narrowly won re-election last year, beating Democrat Jim Graves by just 4,200 votes, a margin of 1.1 per cent. Graves recently announced that he would run again next year. Bachmann downplayed concerns that she might not be re-elected if she were to run again in 2014. 'My decision was not in any way influenced by any concerns about my being re-elected to Congress,' she said. 'If I ran I would again defeat the individual who I defeated last year.' A Republican strategist told MailOnline early Wednesday morning that the Republican Congressional Campaign Committee would be hard pressed to put resources into a 2014 Bachmann campaign, and suggested that her pre-emptive withdrawal was at least in part related to fears that she couldn't win again without resources from her party. HAPPIER TIMES: Bachmann appeared on 'Late Night With Jimmy Fallon' in November 2011, during the Republican presidential primary season. Former campaign aides have since accused her of making unethical payments to an Iowa state legislator for help with her failed Iowa Caucus effort . 'Bachmann has a less than 50-50 chance of winning again, and she knows it,' that GOP strategist said. 'She's probably bowing out gracefully so the RNC has plenty of time to find another candidate. That way if she ever runs for office again - say, for governor of Minnesota - she won't have to worry about bridges she burned.' Bachmann did leave open that possibility in her video. 'There is no future option or opportunity- be it directly in the political area or otherwise - that I won’t be giving serious consideration if it can help save and protect our great nation for future generations,' she said.","Former Bush adviser had harsh words for Minnesota congresswoman .

"An accused witch doctor said to have used sorcery to bring about the death of another man in a remote Papua New Guinea village has been chopped into pieces and his body parts burned to ashes. The gruesome attack on the alleged sorcerer was carried out close to the time when a 20-year-old woman was tortured and burned to death after she was accused of using witchcraft to kill a six-year-old boy. As news of the recent alleged incidents of sorcery has spread through the jungles of the nation lying to the north of Australia, uneducated villagers have been put on their guard and are watching for other witches or witch doctors, say police. Spreading: The gruesome attack on the alleged sorcerer was carried out close to the time when a 20-year-old woman was tortured and burned to death after she was accused of using witchcraft to kill a six-year-old boy . In the latest gruesome incident, a 50-year-old man named as Eriok Tembe, from the village of Tewai-Siassi, in the eastern part of the country, was attacked at his home by a group of people convinced he had used witchcraft to bring about the slow death of another villager. They hacked him to pieces with machetes, said provincial police commander Supt Leo Lamei, and then set his body parts on fire when they applied torches to his hut. ‘He’d argued with other villagers during the day when they accused him of using sorcery to kill another person,’ said Supt Lamei. Still alive: Sorcery and witchcraft are still practiced in remote villages in Papua New Guinea's highlands . Sorcery and witchcraft is widely believed in Papua New Guinea and is commonly practiced in remote villages across the island nation. The cost of a witch doctor revealing a cause of death or casting out an evil spirit is usually 1000 New Guinean kina (£303), plus a pig and a bag of rice, . In 1971, whilst still a colony, the country introduced a Sorcery Act to criminalise the practice. However the law has recently seen a rise in attacks on innocent people accused of black magic, such as that on Miss Leniata, and convictions by ‘kangaroo courts’ made up of of local village elders. As a result the Papua New Guinean law reform commission proposing to repeal the law. Last July, 29 people were arrested accused of black magic and cannibalism after allegedly murdering seven people in order to eat their brains and use their genitals for sorcery rituals. In 2009 a man was hacked to pieces by machetes after a ‘kangaroo court’ convicted him of sorcery. ‘Then during the night, between 3am . and 4am, a number of people went to his home, chopped him up with bush . knives and set his house in fire with his remains inside.’ Police arrived later and in a grim search retrieved the charred remains before delivering them to relatives for burial. ‘The suspects are still at large and we are yet to identify them,’ said the police officer. ‘We condemn these acts and we are using all available resources to bring the suspects to face the law.’ Sorcery is rife through the remote regions of jungle-clad Papua New Guinea, where alleged witches and witch doctors are said to use effigies of their victims and so-called magic chants to bring about the deaths of their enemies and their relatives. Other acts of sorcery include burning something that belongs to the intended victim, which could be a single hair or clothing – and some so-called evil-doers are said to blow contaminated smoke in the direction of their enemies. Mr Tembe died at about the same time as . young mother Kepari Leniata was tortured and burned to death in the . central highlands, 150 miles away, after she was blamed for the death of . a young boy who died in hospital from a stomach illness. Her shocking death made international . headlines, yet the murder was one of scores among the executions of . alleged witches in the country, which is steeped in superstition and . ancient irrational beliefs. Sociologists . say that accusing people of carrying out sorcery and witchcraft is . based on fear and ignorance and international action is needed to spread . ‘modern knowledge’ among remote tribes. Part of the culture: Sorcery and witchcraft is widely believed in Papua New Guinea, which brought in a Sorcery Act to protect against attacks on those accused of practising black magic (file picture) Breaking the law: The criminalisation of sorcery has seen several cases of violent vigilante action against 'witches' and 'sorcerers' in highland villages .","Man, 50, was attacked in the middle of the night in his hut .

"Jermain Defoe’s fall-out with his Major League Soccer side Toronto just one truncated season into a four-year contract is being blamed in Canada on his formidable mother Sandra. Defoe is expected to return to the Premier League with QPR in the January window, as manager Harry Redknapp indicated on Thursday, provided terms can be agreed. And Toronto have briefed local media that Sandra is heavily responsible for ‘mama’s boy’ Jermain leaving so prematurely. Jermain Defoe could link back up with Queens Park Rangers manager Harry Redknapp . The Toronto forward scored 11 goals for the Canadian outfit during the 2014 season . Defoe (pictured with sister Chonte, left) has been influenced to leave Canada by his mum Sandra (right) Toronto chief Tim Leiweke felt he had to seriously impress Sandra to get her son to Canada in the first place. This included having rap star Drake and basketball great LeBron James make a fuss of her. And the multi-layered contract that Defoe signed with Toronto included luxury accommodation for his mum. Now Leiweke says: ‘We have to determine does Jermain want to be here, but we’re not going to give him away.’ The way the NFL have taken ownership of Wembley ahead of the Jacksonville v Dallas match on Sunday — with the media attending Roy Hodgson’s England squad announcement faced with no-entry signs everywhere — suggests they would take precedence over the national game if ever an American football franchise came to London. England cricketer Matt Prior has stayed quiet since being slated in Kevin Pietersen’s book as the ‘Big Cheese’ in the dressing room.

The prawn-sandwich brigade have embraced the Rugby World Cup to the extent £50million of corporate hospitality has been sold for the tournament with a year to go, including all Twickenham boxes for the 10 games there.

Green snubs BBC pal . It’s the talk of the BBC that Alan Green, football commentator on 5 Live and recently Match of the Day, turned down an invitation to a special Beeb farewell party for Mike Ingham in Manchester this week. Ingham, who was Green’s partner on big-match radio commentaries for nearly 30 years, retired after the World Cup. Green also snubbed an FA reception where a presentation was made to Ingham in Miami ahead of the World Cup. He claimed he knew nothing about it but was seated just outside the hotel function room ahead of the bash.

"Bryce Dion, 38, a sound engineer from California, was killed in Omaha after a shooting broke out while he was filming reality TV show Cops . Police accidentally shot dead a crew member of TV show Cops on Tuesday when they opened fire on a suspect armed only with a pellet gun, who was also killed. Sound engineer Bryce Dion, 38, who had worked on the reality show for seven years, was killed during the stand-off at a Wendy's restaurant in Omaha, Nebraska. A relative of the suspect Cortez Washington, 32, claimed on Wednesday that police officers over-reacted and were showing off for the cameras. The unnamed relative told TMZ that the officers were 'hyped up' for the filming, adding: 'With everything going on in Ferguson, you think they would use other options.' Police and the show's creators strenuously denied any suggestion that they were grandstanding for the cameras. Cops creator John Langley said at a news conference: 'Cops truly is a reality show. It's not manipulated, it's not managed, it's not staged. It's all true, it's real, and it happens as it happens.' Police Chief Todd Schmaderer said witnesses and officers thought the robbery suspect's Airsoft handgun looked and sounded real - but discovered later that it fired only plastic pellets. Washington was struck by the officers' gunfire, but fled outside of the restaurant before collapsing. Officers continued firing on the suspect as he exited the restaurant - and Mr Dion was caught by stray bullets. Scroll down for video . Chaos: Frame grabs from security video showing an armed robbery at a Wendy's restaurant in Omaha is displayed during a news conference at police headquarters on Wednesday . Bryce Dion, 38, (center) a sound engineer on the long-running Spike TV reality show, was struck by bullets fired by police outside a Wendy's in Omaha on Tuesday and killed . Dion was wearing a bulletproof vest, but a single bullet that struck his arm 'slipped into a gap in the vest' and went into his chest. On a 911 call after the shooting, a voice can be heard saying: 'One of the Cops guys has been hit by gunfire. We need a squad here now... We need multiple squads, two squads. The voice, believed to be a police officer, continued: 'We've got a Cops cameraman hit, white male, he's not conscious, he's breathing slightly.' Captain Schmaderer said: 'My concern with my officers is that they are taking this very hard. Bryce was their friend.' Schmaderer said video captured by the cameraman who was with Mr Dion, the sound engineer, showed a chaotic situation in the restaurant. Police released still shots from the video showing a hooded and masked person pointing what appears to be a gun at officers. Popular: The trained 38-year-old sound man had worked on the long-running reality show for seven seasons . Mr Dion, a sound engineer from California, left, and 32-year-old ex-con Cortez Washington, right, were both pronounced dead from gunshot wounds sustained in the shooting at an Omaha Wendy's restaurant . Schmaderer said police would not release the full video but that it will be part of a grand jury investigation into the shooting. Schmaderer said Washington had a lengthy criminal record, including an accessory to robbery conviction from Missouri for which he was on parole. He moved to Nebraska in September 2013, and his parole was due to expire in June 2017. Schmaderer said the incident began at around 9.30pm on Tuesday when one of the officers, on his way to another reported robbery, called to request backup for the robbery at the Wendy's at 43rd and Dodge streets. The Cops crew members were accompanying two officers who responded to that call. When police entered the restaurant and confronted the suspect, Mr Dion became separated from the cameraman, Schmaderer said. Following the shooting, Mr Dion and Washington were taken to the University of Nebraska Medical Center where they were both pronounced dead. Cops is a reality TV show that depicts law enforcement officers in action. According to its website, the show has been filmed in at least 140 U.S. cities and three foreign countries.

Similarities: Police released an image comparing the pellet gun they found to a Taurus PT92 pistol . Executives with Langley Productions said this was the first time one of their crew members has been fatally shot while filming. The show started on Fox in 1989 and is now shown on the Spike network. In 2010, a TV crew for the A&E reality show 'The First 48' recorded a Detroit police raid in which a 7-year-old girl was accidentally killed by an officer. That incident highlighted concerns about whether TV cameras influence police behavior, perhaps encouraging showboating. Upset: Schmaderer dismissed a reporter's suggestion that perhaps his officers were too aggressive in their response to the situation because they knew they were being filmed . Schmaderer on Wednesday bristled at a reporter's question about whether his officers overreacted knowing that cameras were recording them, calling the suggestion 'absolutely ridiculous.' He said the video of Tuesday's shooting shows the officers reacted properly. Schmaderer said he accepted the invitation from 'Cops' to film in Omaha in the name of transparency. But he also expressed regret at the outcome. 'Personally, I will live with this forever,' Schmaderer said. 'If I'd have known that this would happen, of course, I wouldn't have done it.' Top executives for Langley Productions, President John Langely and Executive Producer Morgan Langley, attended the police news conference in Omaha and agreed that police there had acted professionally. Happier times: Dion, pictured in the red circle, seen here with his colleagues from season 27 of 'Cops' John Langley said the crew had been filming all summer in Omaha and had only one week left when the deadly shooting happened. 'Bryce has been with us for seven years,' said Morgan Langley, who hired Dion. 'This is very hard for us. 'He’s a very talented guy, he did something that he loved and was passionate about.' The 38-year-old's neighbors in California told KCAL9 News that they didn't really know Mr Dion because he was always traveling for work. Mr Dion, a native of Boston, has worked on over 80 episodes of 'Cops.' Only recently the sound technician had been promoted. His IMDB page states that Dion also worked on the shows Jail, Vice Squad, Conquering Kilimanjaro With Angie Everhart and Undercover Stings.

"There are various, well-known tweaks you can make to your smartphone to boost its battery life, such as turning off Wi-Fi and decreasing the screen’s brightness. But these only have a limited effect when other features and services are draining energy, often without you even realising they're doing so. Glasgow-based experts have now created an interactive guide that reveals how to save battery life using tips specific to individual phones, such as Apple’s iPhones, HTC and Samsung’s range of devices, and Sony’s handsets. Scroll down for video . Choose your phone below: If the guide is slow to load, get tips from liGo's original version . Glasgow-based experts at retailer liGo have now created an interactive guide (pictured) that reveals how to save battery life using tips specific to individual phones, such as Apple’s iPhones, HTC and Samsung’s range of devices, and Sony’s handsets. Tips scroll across the screen . It also includes older models, and handsets from Motorola, LG, BlackBerry, Amazon, Huawei and Nokia – now known as Lumia. The tips, compiled by electronics retailer liGO, begins by asking the user to select their make and model. An image of the handset appears below, surrounded by tips that conserve battery life on that particular model. Testing has revealed that the battery in Sony's Xperia Z3 handset not only lasts, on average, for 48 hours, this is the case even when streaming music, making calls and watching videos. Tests involved using the device for approximately five hours over a 24-hour period, for a range of ‘typical usage scenarios’. They included calling, texting, surfing the web, checking social networks, playing games, using the camera, listening to music and streaming video. Clicking on a tip reveals the steps needed to disable, or enable, the selected features, alongside information about why it drains battery, where appropriate. On the module above, these tips scroll across the screen. The guide does assume that smartphone owners are running the most up-to-date version of operating system available. Running older systems can cause battery problems themselves. According to the guide, Apple iPhone 5S users, for example, can save battery life by managing which apps update in the background - known as Background App Refresh. This feature is accessed via Settings, General, and by switching off the apps that are automatically updated. The reason this drains battery is because, even when the phone isn’t being used, these apps use a network to pull in data. This tip applies to Samsung's Galaxy S5, too. This feature also uses data that owners may not be aware of. However, be aware that by disabling Background App Refresh can prevent notifications appearing until the app is manually opened. Another tip, for Samsung Galaxy S5 owners, is to turn off Air Wake Up. According to the guide, Samsung Galaxy S5 users, for example, can save battery life by managing which apps refresh in the background - known as Background App Refresh. The reason this drains battery is because, even when the phone is not being used, these apps use a network to pull in data . Apple iPhone 5S (pictured) users can save battery by disabling Handoff. Handoff allows users to pass over work to other iCloud devices. It is disabled through Settings, General and Handoff & Suggested Apps. The guide does assume that smartphone owners are running the most up-to-date version of operating system available . Smart stay features detect when people are looking at their screen, and means the display remains on, effectively disabling auto-locking. This feature uses the forward-facing camera, so disabling it via Settings reduces power usage. And for Windows Phone users, seen on the Lumia range of devices and HTC One (M8) for Windows, limiting what tiles are pinned to the start will reduce power usage. These tiles automatically refresh to show up-to-date Facebook posts, tweets, emails or weather details, for example, and this uses battery.","Guide was created by Glasgow-based liGo and reveals the best ways to conserve battery life on various smartphones .

"A 'pimp' has been accused of forcing a 13-year-old prostitute to have his name tattooed on her eyelids when she threatened to run away. Roman Thomas III was arrested in Miami after the girl was branded with his street name 'Suave' on one eyelid, and 'House' on the other to denote that she belonged to him, police said. He is accused of pimping the girl, who has not been identified, through an online advertising site as a 'new girl' to men wanting to have sex with children. Accused: Roman Thomas III (left) is accused of forcing a 13-year-old girl to have his street name tattooed on her eyelid and to become a prostitute. Shanteria Sanders (right) has also been charged in the case . The girl was allegedly plied with alcohol and drugs by Thomas and a woman in a Miami motel and coerced into prostitution, the Miami Herald reports. Thomas will be formally charged on April 13 while a woman, Shanteria Sanders, 23, who has 'Suave' tattooed across her chest, was also charged in the case, according to the Herald. The pair face charges of human trafficking, false imprisonment, lewd and lascivious exhibition and delivery of a controlled substance to a child. Thomas, who was meant to be wearing an ankle monitor as part of his probation, has a long criminal record, including counts of 'lewd and lascivious battery' on a child. He is alleged to have met the 13-year-old girl at the USA Flea Market in Miami, before persuading her to go with him to the motel where he was living. Thomas and Sanders are accused of taking 'provocative' photographs of the girl before putting them on the Backpage.com website. They then charged men $100 an hour to have sex with her, police say. They are alleged to have forced the girl to get the tattoos after she threatened to leave. Their alleged crimes were uncovered when the girl's mother called the police after tracking her daughter down and found her with Thomas.","Roman Thomas III is accused of turning troubled teenager into prostitute .

"Ed Miliband faced an open Labour revolt last night after a senior party figure called for him to resign as leader. Andrew MacKinlay, the former MP for Thurrock, said the party’s dismal performance in last week’s Heywood and Middleton by-election ‘was not the performance of a Government-in-waiting’. Writing in today’s Mail on Sunday, below, Mr MacKinlay says Mr Miliband’s leadership is ‘a complete disaster’. He pleads: ‘Ed – for the sake of the party we both love, please stand aside now.’ Scroll down for video . Former Labour MP Andrew MacKinlay said Ed Miliband must resign if Labour is to win the next election . Mr MacKinlay’s comments came as civil war broke out in the party following the by-election in a former Labour stronghold, where it hung on with a wafer-thin majority over Ukip. Mr Mann spoke out after Mr Dugher dismissed his call for new policies to widen Labour’s appeal. The Mail on Sunday revealed last week how Mr Mann had accused Mr Miliband of ‘extraordinary complacency’. Mr Dugher said: ‘Normally when John Mann talks about broadening the Labour coalition, he means broadening it to include John Mann.’ But yesterday, Mr Mann hit back: ‘The reason voters hold us in such low regard is because of patronising and condescending views like that. Ed Miliband has been warned that Labour voters are defecting to Ukip over immigration concerns . ‘Ukip’s support is being driven by a vitriolic rejection of an arrogant Westminster elite who think they know it all. This is the problem we have at the top of the Labour Party.’ Mr Stringer, who took part in the Heywood campaign, echoed Mr Mann’s criticism and said he was shocked by the hostility to Labour on the doorstep. ‘We came extremely close to losing the seat,’ he said. ‘The ministerial bag-carriers who now run the Labour Party have no idea how to manage the bare-knuckle street-fighting which is Farage’s speciality. ‘The seat nearly fell – and the General Election could be lost for the same reason – because we are not tackling people’s feeling of unfairness over immigration and the effect it is having on schools, housing and hospitals. ‘The team around Ed Miliband have this aversion to even discussing immigration because they are so ideologically wedded to the EU and its open borders policy.’ Ed Miliband was forced to withdraw his most recent party political broadcast over a copyright issue . One northern Labour MP, speaking on condition of anonymity, said: ‘If Miliband cared to ask me, I could tell him why Ukip is picking up votes in northern constituencies. It is because if a single mother with a child is in a queue for council housing, she will find that an East European family with three children can jump ahead of her. ‘And if she goes to the local GPs, the same East European families will have taken all the appointments. Anyone who utters that kind of sentiment is denounced as a racist. It is nothing of the sort: it is the truth.’ Sorry Ed, you're a complete disaster as our leader... so stand aside now' says former MP ANDREW MACKINLAY . Last week’s by-election results confirmed what many of us in the Labour Party have been thinking for months – that Ed Miliband needs to step down as leader and make way for an election winner. It is not the performance of a Government-in-waiting to scrape a majority of little more than 600 votes in Heywood and Middleton, a previously safe Labour seat. Ed is a decent, intelligent man. That is not in question. There is no gentle way of putting this but Ed Miliband's leadership of the Labour Party has been a disaster . But – and there is no gentle way of putting this – his leadership is a complete disaster. Yes, if we manage to stay at our current rating of around 35 per cent, then Ed may well become Prime Minister in May. However, recent history demonstrates that this cannot be relied upon. In the 1980s, Labour leaders Michael Foot and Neil Kinnock were also ahead in the polls for much of their time, yet fell short. Ed’s speech to the Labour Party conference last month, when he forgot to mention the deficit, was a train crash. My fear is that his fluff will join Mr Foot’s donkey jacket – when he wore a green coat while placing a wreath on the cenotaph in 1981 – as symbolic of a doomed leadership. Likewise, when Mr Kinnock fell over on Brighton beach, clutching his wife Glenys as he evaded a wave during the 1983 party conference, it became a metaphor for the electoral tsunami that was to come. Both Neil Kinnock, left and Michael Foot, right, both seemed destined to win a general election for Labour . Despite their flaws, even Foot and Kinnock demonstrated qualities which Ed lacks. Kinnock bravely tackled Militant Tendency and Foot was one the greatest orators of all time. The reason they both lost to Margaret Thatcher was because voters could not imagine either man standing in front of No 10. Ed has the same problem. The Miliband ‘brand’ has failed. I am a traditional, old-fashioned politician who left school at 16, worked for local council and began my political career in the unions. For 18 years as an MP, I represented the solid, working-class seat of Thurrock in Essex. It is now held by the Tories on a wafer-thin majority from Labour, but could be vulnerable to Ukip. Clacton, where Ukip triumphed last week, is only 40 miles down the road. Ed will never appeal to floating voters in such vital marginal seats. He has surrounded himself with too many wet-behind-the-ears advisers and apparatchiks who have never done a real day’s work in their lives. Chief courtier in this dysfunctional set is Douglas Alexander, who combines his role as Shadow Foreign Secretary with heading our General Election strategy team. Douglas was heavily implicated in Gordon Brown’s ‘bottled’ Election U-turn of 2007, ran David Miliband’s failed leadership campaign and played a key role in the pro-union referendum campaign in Scotland, which was floundering until Brown stepped in to save the day. And we are counting on him to deliver victory in 2015. How stupid. Of our elder statesmen, no-nonsense former Home Secretary Alan Johnson or plain-talking ex-Chancellor Alistair Darling would both be better leaders than Ed Miliband. And among younger Labour MPs, Yvette Cooper, Chuka Umunna and Andy Burnham can all, unlike Ed, deliver crisp, cogent – and complete – speeches. Ed, for the sake of the party we both love, please stand aside now.","Andrew McKinlay blasted Ed Miliband as 'a complete disaster as leader'

"A schoolgirl enjoying a dream holiday ran up a £3,800 bill after uploading pictures of her trip onto Facebook with her mobile phone. Casey Snook, 14, used the website to post regular updates about her time in New York. She eagerly told friends about her visits to the Empire State Building, Central Park and Times Square and uploaded a series of pictures with her iPhone. But she was unaware of the massive bill until her father’s bank account - which funded the phone - suddenly went overdrawn after the holiday. 'I felt physically sick': Casey Snook (pictured with her mother Kate) ran up a £3,800 phone bill after posting pictures on Facebook with her mobile phone while on hoilday in New York . Phone company Orange said she ran up the charges by using Facebook with data roaming - a service which enables internet access abroad. Her mother, Kate Snook, 43, a catering assistant, accused the company of 'extortion'. She said: 'When I heard about it I felt physically sick. Casey was very upset and embarrassed and I was in tears. 'I can’t believe that a company would let a bill which is usually £50 get up to that level. Did they not worry the phone had been stolen? Extortionate: One of the photos taken by Casey Snook  in New York's Times Square . Snap happy: Casey Snook took lots of photos on her trip to New York but had no idea she was running up a phone bill totaling £3,800 by uploading her pictures onto the social networking site Facebook . 'She was only using it for the normal teenage stuff, updating her friends with what she was up to and this and that. 'It was an experience - we visited the Empire State Building, Central Park, Times Square, Grand Central Station and the Whispering Wall. She was just using Facebook like a normal teenager to tell her friends.' Casey, of Hengrove, Bristol, jetted off to the Big Apple with her mother on May 27. Big phone bill: Casey Snook couldn't wait to show off her holiday photos so she uploaded them on Facebook which cost £3,800 . Thousands of pounds were taken out of Casey's father's bank account to pay for the bill she ran up in New York . Four days into the trip the teenager . received a text from Orange warning she had gone over her internet data . limit - and her bill had gone from its usual £50 to £320. The company barred the teen from sending any more text messages or making calls - but did not block her data roaming. Mrs Snook told Casey to stop using her phone until they returned to the UK in two days time. But . once the family returned home Mrs Snook received a phone call from . Casey’s dad Victor, who pays the bill, to say his bank had told him he . was overdrawn. Casey Snook jetted off to the Big Apple in May where she had a great time until she got her phone bill in . Casey wanted to show friends photos she took of the Empire State Building, Central Park and Times Square . Orange insists it sent a number of warning texts to Casey to say she had exceeded her data usage. The firm also says it sent a message . to Casey asking if she wanted to continue to use data after she had gone . over her limit - and she clicked 'yes'. But her parents are calling for an explanation as to why no further warnings were sent after the text message explaining the bill would be £320. Mrs Snook said her daughter does not remember this, and believes many people would not understand the implications of continuing to use their phone. 'To be honest, I wouldn’t understand what a data cap was, and I don’t think a lot of teenagers would,' she said. 'This is about the extortion of a 14-year-old, and Orange is completely refusing to budge on the bill. 'The rates that are charged are ridiculous and I just don’t understand why another message wasn’t sent after the one that said the bill had reached £320. Why wasn’t one sent at £500 or £1,000? 'Her usual bill is around £50 - weren’t Orange concerned that her phone had been stolen? Anyone could press a button to say they wanted to continue using data. 'We are just going to have to pay it. I’m going to give her dad half of the money, but neither of us can afford it.' A spokeswoman for Orange said: 'All Orange customers have a number of protections in place - customers are even automatically opted-in to a roaming data cap, which limits their charges to £49 for a set amount of data. 'Customers receive warning texts to alert them of their data usage and we have an app that helps them monitor data usage, and opt-in to a data bundle if needed. 'In this instance the customer received numerous text alerts which updated them on the roaming costs for the USA, and also updated them on their data usage. 'Once they had reached the limit of their data bundle, the customer actively opted out of our roaming data cap so that they could continue to use data, effectively removing the in-built protection from large data roaming bills.'","Casey Snook, 14, uploaded photos on Facebook of her trip to New York .

"The stabbing of Ann Maguire in front of her pupils triggered a national debate over security in our schools last night. Head teachers demanded stronger backing for schools which choose to introduce airport-style metal detectors and frisk pupils for weapons. But they said schools must not be ‘locked down’ in the wake of the incident. Staff have repeatedly voiced concern over the risk of violent attacks on school premises. Scroll down for videos . Vigilant: Metal detectors at a school in Leyton, east London . Latest figures show that 550 pupils a year are expelled from schools in England for assaulting a member of staff and 17,000 short-term suspensions are handed out. Last week, police disclosed that nearly 1,000 children – 80 of them primary pupils – have been caught taking weapons into school in three years. A survey of teachers found that more than half have been subjected to verbal abuse or threats from pupils. Children are being instilled with a ‘blame someone else’ culture at home and also believe they can treat teachers ‘like servants’, the NASUWT report claimed. Schools have been granted powers to frisk pupils for weapons and a range of contraband by patting down their clothing. They can also screen whole groups with security arches or wands. Stabbed: Ann Maguire, 61, was pronounced dead at a hospital after attempts to save her life failed . The teacher was approached by the alleged attacker and stabbed repeatedly in the neck at the school in Leeds, West Yorkshire . But head teachers warned last night that many staff remain reluctant to conduct the searches. Russell Hobby, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: ‘People are not necessarily comfortable with the powers. What I think is right is that this is taken on a school-by-school basis. ‘Where there are tensions in a particular school that school could take the choice, for example, to exclude a pupil or to install metal detectors. Schools need to be confident in exercising their powers and know they will be backed by the local authority. ‘A school has to set boundaries and be that place in the community where a pupil knows they will be safe.’ But he stressed: ‘We don’t want to lock down all schools where there are no problems or risks. Schools should be open to the community unless you have got particular reasons to suspect there might be issues.’ Hilary Benn, Labour MP for Leeds Central, described the incident as ‘profoundly saddening’. But he added: ‘Schools are places of learning. We want our schools to be open – we don’t want to lock pupils and staff behind high fences.’ 'You was the best teacher': Two tributes left at the school - both of which describe Mrs Maguire as 'caring' Gathering: The local community attend Corpus Christi Catholic Church to pay their respects to Mrs Maguire . Memory: Flower tributes were left outside the school, pictured, with one card from a pupil reading: 'A special teacher. We was all sad about it. RIP I will never forget you' In 2008, the Labour Government announced plans for airport-style metal detectors in hundreds of schools. The following year, the east London borough of Waltham Forest became the first to announce that detectors would be used at its 22 secondary schools. Guidance from the Coalition says pupils can be made to pass through a metal detector even if there is no suspicion they have a weapon. If they refuse, they can be barred. Schools are also increasingly installing CCTV and drafting in police officers to patrol corridors and classrooms. Campaigners say such measures can unfairly ‘criminalise’ youngsters. Professor Terry Haydn of  the University of East Anglia warned this month that pupils in England were among the worst-behaved in the developed world. The Government and Ofsted ‘seriously underestimate’ the scale of classroom indiscipline, he said.

"Whether in the crystal clear waters of the Caribbean or off the coast of Australia and Tasmania, some of the world's most beautiful oceans also contain the world's most nightmare-inducing creatures. Often dwelling at the bottom of the sea and rarely seen by humans, Distractify compiled a list of the creepiest underwater animals around. Behold the best of the bunch and good luck getting into the water after this. Scroll down for video . The world's most gorgeous oceans also contain the world's most creepy underwater creatures . The goblin shark is a deep-sea dwelling animal with a whole lot of very sharp teeth. Thankfully, it poses no threat to humans as it mostly eats bottom-feeding fish. While very little is known about the elusive creature, it is believed to have a wide global distribution having been spotted everywhere from the Gulf of Mexico to Japan. Distractify has compiled the most nightmare-inducing deep-sea dwellers. Here: the sarcastic fringehead . The sarcastic fringehead may have a chuckle-inducing name, but this tiny, ferocious fish is no joke. Known for its large mouth and territorial behaviour, they are ambush feeders and aggressively attack their prey - usually crustaceans. They are native to Southern California and Baja, Mexico. The water bear is one of the toughest creatures on Earth and is able to survive extreme environments . Good luck ever being able to close your eyes again after getting a glimpse of the world's toughest creature: the water bear (or tardigrade). The water-dwelling micro-animals are classified as extremophiles, which means that they can thrive in an environment that would be detrimental to most life on Earth. No wonder they can live for up to 200 years and survive trips to space. Spider crabs, which are native to the UK, are covered in spikes and have 10 legs . The spider crab is one unusual looking creature. It's body is covered in spikes and along with its eight walking legs, it also has two longer clawed arms. Most often, they are found in course sand and bedrock along the UK's southern and western coasts. The Bobbit worm can grow up to sizes of nearly 3m long, though the average remains 1m . Found in warmer oceans, the Bobbit worm can grow to sizes of nearly 3m (9.8 ft) long - although the average remains around 1m (3 ft). The creature catches its food by burying its long body into an ocean bed composed of gravel and mud, waiting for one of its five antennae to sense prey. Due to its sharp teeth and speed of attack, sometimes its prey is sliced in half in the process. The Mola mola is the world's heaviest bony fish and weighs up to 1,000 kg . The Mola mola is the heaviest known bony fish in the world with an average adult weight of 1,000 kg. An ocean sunfish, the species is native to temperate and tropical waters. Though they may be absolutely massive, these docile creatures eat a diet almost solely comprised of jellyfish and pose no threat to humans whatsoever. While the rainbow eel may look pretty, the creature can be quite aggressive when called for . The red-lipped batfish is one of the strangest underwater creatures - it can walk on the ocean floor . While both the colourful ribbon eel and red-lipped batfish may look beautiful, you definitely don't want to get too close. These eels can change colour and sex during their life and grow to be 1.3m long. As far as the batfish, their pectoral fins actually allow them to walk on the ocean floor. It's found in deep waters off the Galapagos Islands. Blobfish live off the coast of Australia and Tasmania and are very rarely seen by humans - thankfully! You can't un-see this haunting creature! The blobfish lives off the coasts of mainland Australia and Tasmania. Rarely seen by humans, they usually live at depths between 600 and 1200m. Get a glimpse into the mind of the barreleye - literally! It's head is transparent and brains visible to all . Last but certainly not least: the barreleye, which is also known as the spook fish. Named for their large, protruding, barrel-shaped eyes, the four-eyed fish has a transparent head - meaning you can see it's brain, as well.","Distractify compiled list of most nightmare-inducing underwater creatures .

"Libya is braced for further bloodshed after negotiations between rebel troops and Gaddafi loyalists over the surrender of a town where it is believed the tyrant may be hiding broke down. Thousands of soldiers loyal to the country's National Transitional Council (NTC) have surrounded the stronghold of Bani Walid, 95 miles south east of Tripoli, where at least 100 heavily armed, pro-Gadaffi fighters have dug in. The rebels claim some civilians in the town have been slaughtered and fear others will  be used as human shields. Celebration: Rebel reinforcements from Tripoli arrive at a checkpoint between Tarhouna and Bani Walid, from where they will launch a new attack . Advancing: Anti-Gaddafi fighters from the Warfallah tribe gather in the outskirts of Bani Walid one of the remaining bastions of support for the ousted dictator . Poised: Thousands of anti-Gaddafi fighters have surrounded the town of Bani Walid after negotiations for a peaceful surrender broke down . On the run: The ousted dictator described Bani Walid as an 'armed fortress' Negotiator Abdullah Kanshil told reporters that hopes of a peaceful surrender were gone after talks with Gadaffi spokesman Moussa Ibrahim failed. Mr Kanshil, himself a resident of Bani Walid, claimed Gaddafi loyalists had demanded the rebels entered the town unarmed. He said:  'From my side, negotiations are finished. They said they don’t want to talk, they are threatening everyone who moves. 'They are putting snipers on high rise buildings and inside olive groves, they have a big fire force. We compromised a lot at the last minute, . 'I urge Gaddafi people to leave the town alone. 'We feel sorry for the people of Bani Walid. We hope for the best for our city.' Mr Kanshil said rebel fighters were stationed . outside the town were waiting for the green light to launch a final . assault. Rebel forces believe Gaddafi loyalists have slaughtered more than a dozen people who had been held captive in a room in Bani Walid. There has been some speculation that members of Gaddafi’s family, perhaps even the former  leader himself, may be hiding there. Gaddafi's spokesman Moussa Ibrahim said in a telephone interview that the ousted leader was somewhere in Libya, 'safely surrounded by loyal supporters'. Wreckage: Rebels inspect an airplane destroyed by an airstrike. Nato bombers have been hitting key targets close to the remaining Gaddafi strongholds . Anti-Gaddafi soldiers pose in front of a torn-down poster of the former dictator at the Bir Durfan military base 60 kilometers from Bani Walid . Siesta: Anti-Gaddafi fighters sleep at the last checkpoint before Bani Walid, which is currently held by Gaddafi supporters . Mr Ibrahim said: 'He’s in the country. He’s in a safe place surrounded by many people who are prepared to protect him.' In a defiant audio message on September 1, Col Gaddafi referred to Bani Walid as 'an armed fortress'. The interim government, based in Tripoli, said it is now sure Col Gaddafi's son, Khamis, has been killed. They say he died fighting close to Tripoli and has been buried near Bani Walid. Intelligence sources reported one of Gaddafi's other sons Saif al-Islam had left Bani Walid on Saturday, heading south. There was no information on the whereabouts of another son, Mutassim. While anti-Gaddafi forces now control most of the Libya, some central and southern areas still remain loyal to the ousted dictator. Ready to attack: Rebel fighters keep guard at the last checkpoint before the town of Bani Walid . Breakfast time: A rebel fighter prepares to cook his morning meal a few miles outside Bani Walid . Nato has reported bombing an ammunition storage facility near Bani Walid as well as striking targets close to Gaddafi's hometown of Sirte. NTC military spokesman Ahmed Bani said the Sirte was also surrounded by troops poised to attack. He said: 'There are ongoing negotiations regarding Sirte between the elders and various tribes and the free Libya forces surrounding Sirte. 'The time is coming when talk is done with and we will enforce our will upon liberating the city of Sirte.' Naji al-Maghrabi, commander of one of the NTC brigades positioned outside the town, said: 'We are awaiting the green light from the council. 'If they tell us, ""Move into Sirte now,"" we will.' Life returning to normal: Children walk past destroyed military tanks on the way to a playground in Misrata . One of his fighters, Belqassem Souliman, added: 'They have no way out but to surrender or die.' The U.N. mandate which permits Nato to conduct bombing missions in order to 'protect Libyan Civilians' expires on September 27 and the interim government is keen to seize control of the entire country by then. Panos Moumtzis, UN humanitarian coordinator for Libya, said he was worried about humanitarian problems in areas where Gaddafi loyalists are still in control. He said: 'We are looking very closely at the situation in Sirte. 'We are preoccupied about the protection of civilians in this area. We understand that there is a dialogue taking place. We would really like to see a peaceful solution as fast as possible.'","Thousands of anti-Gaddafi troops surround key town of Bani Walid .

"A suburban Los Angeles school district has paid a private firm to monitor its students' social media activities. The Glendale Unified School District last year hired the firm Geo Listening to snoop the social media postings of the 14,000 or so students in the area to screen for any signs of bullying, self-harm, drug-use or violence, at a cost of $40,500. Critics believe the screening sets a dangerous precedent and stifles free speech, but school district authorities and Geo Listening say the purpose of the exercise is student safety. Unaware: Hoover High students Young Cho (left) and Christopher Chung (right), both 16, only found out that their social media posts are being monitored by the Glendale school district through media reports . Geo Listening provides Glendale district officials with a daily report based on students' post from social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Tumblr and YouTube. The firm's analysts search for terms that indicate violence, drug-use, . bullying, self-harm or suicidal thoughts, racism and sexual harassment and alert the school district to anything untoward. However, the firm does not engage in hacking or tracking private correspondence, only monitoring public posts and comments. 'All of the individual posts we monitor on social media networks are already made public by the students themselves. Therefore, no privacy is violated,' a Geo Listening spokesperson told RT, adding that the company does not 'monitor email, SMS, MMS, phone calls, voicemails or unlock any privacy setting of a social network user.' Cyber bullying: The Glendale school district is seeking to nip online bullying in the bud by monitoring its students' social media activity . Geo Listening CEO Chris Frydrych says his firm was not given a list . of children's names, but the firm doesn't disclose how the company deduces whether . teens are students of the Glendale district. Frydrych told CNN that the way kids communicate is different nowadays, and . that the firm doesn't spy on kids, but rather listens more effectively. Two area students committed suicide last school year, including a 15-year-old from Crescenta Valley High School in the Glendale District. Following the tragic deaths, the Glendale Unified School District hired Geo Listening for a pilot monitoring program of students from its three high schools, Glendale, Hoover and Crescenta Valley. According to Frydrych, the pilot program helped prevent the suicide of a student after the company alerted the district to worrying posts on social media, resulting in an intervention. Following that success, the district contracted the firm for a full year. 'We think it's been working very well,' Superintendent Richard Sheehan told the Los Angeles Times. 'It's designed around student safety and making sure kids are protected.' High school spies: According to Geo Listening, students' privacy is not invaded by the practice of social media monitoring, but some students disagree . Students were unaware their social media accounts were being spied on until media reports of the practice emerged. Herbert Hoover High student Christopher Chung told the Los Angeles Times that he found out about the monitoring program on Facebook. 'I heard rumors that GUSD was doing a little bit of monitoring - but nothing as official as this,' he said. 'The only way students were finding out about it was through social media. Our principal hasn't said anything about it.' Free speech advocates say school districts reading students' social media posts is an invasion of the students' privacy - especially if they're punished for activities engaged in outside of school hours. Lee Tien, senior staff attorney for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit that defends privacy, free speech and consumer rights. told the Los Angeles Times the program is essentially 'stalking' school kids. 'People say that's not private: It's public on Facebook. I say that's just semantics. The question is what is the school doing? It's not stumbling into students - like a teacher running across a student on the street. This is the school sending someone to watch them.' Communication skills: Teens do a lot of their communicating online these days - which is why the Glendale district says it's necessary to monitor what students are saying on social media . The response from Glendale district students themselves are mixed. Some feel anything that helps prevent bullying is a good thing. Others expressed outrage that the district spent money on a monitoring program when other areas need funding. 'GUSD instead of paying 40k to stalk students uh can't y'all spend it on things that matter like SOAP for the bathrooms and quality food,' tweeted one. Another Twitter user said, 'GUSD payin 40,500 for monitoring but we have like the worst campus, no class set textbooks, AND TEACHERS HAVE US PRINT OUT OUR OWN PAPERS?' Superintendent Sheehan will make an appearance at the school district's PTA meeting later this month to discuss the program with parents and address any concerns.","LA's Glendale school district has been monitoring its 14,000 students' social media accounts for about a year .

"Warning: Former Attorney General Dominic Grieve claims the atrocities in Iraq should be a warning that leaving Europe would be a disaster for Britain . Sacked Tory Cabinet minister Dominic Grieve said yesterday that it would be a disaster if Britain walked out of the European human rights court. Mr Grieve said the barbaric slaughter in northern Iraq showed the importance of sticking to human rights rules. The former Attorney General was removed from office in David Cameron’s reshuffle last month, amid speculation that a clear-out of Cabinet europhiles is meant to pave the way for repeal of the Human Rights Act and a British rebellion against the demands of the European human rights court. Mr Grieve has consistently maintained that Britain must stick to its legal obligations to obey the rulings of the Strasbourg-based court, and that to fail to do so would encourage aggressive and violent behaviour by countries on the fringes of Europe. He spoke in the aftermath of the Strasbourg ruling on Tuesday in which European judges removed the threat to British taxpayers of millions of pounds of compensation payments to prisoners who have been denied the vote. In a test case the human rights court said Britain is wrong to deny the vote to convicted prisoners, but it refused to pay 10 Scottish prisoners either compensation or costs to pay their lawyers’ bills. ‘There are suggestions that my own party wants in some way to enact legislation if we get into government to prevent the court's judgments being implemented unless the Parliament approves it,’ Mr Grieve said on the BBC Radio Four Today Programme. ‘That would be, in my view, a disaster.’ He added: ‘It would put us in breach of our international legal obligations, would place us in great difficulty in terms of our international standing on human rights. ‘And one only has to look at what is going on at the moment in northern Iraq to see that human rights do matter.’ Mr Grieve’s line that by sticking to Strasbourg law Britain can keep rogue countries in order has been provoking frustration among eurosceptics, who say that Russia is a member of the European Court of Human Rights, yet it does not seem to be respecting international law. His Tory critics also believe many Strasbourg judgements are politically motivated and intended to underline the superior powers of the human rights judges. The former Attorney General said that rather than quitting the court, ‘we ought to be acting prudently and moderately in trying to get the changes we want.’ The refusal to give compensation to prisoners denied the vote was ‘a hopeful sign’ that its judges have been listening to British opinion. ‘My view is that we need to have a robust dialogue with the court and I think we have been trying to have that,’ he said. ‘Our own judiciary have been saying quite clearly that they think there are areas where the court is not as good as it should be. The danger for the UK is that if we engage in sabre-rattling with the court, I don't think it will be constructive. ‘I think we are in danger of making a very serious mistake, one that would be reputationally very damaging to the Conservative Party in any future government. Danger: He warns that by leaving the European Court of Human Rights, Britain could be in danger of breaching our international legal obligations. He claims sabre-rattling with the court will not be constructive . 'There are other ways forward. The danger is if one gets carried away with one's own rhetoric, one can do a lot of damage to the country. Because ultimately this country is founded on the rule of law.’ Senior Tories have indicated that the Party is preparing to repeal the Human Rights Act and produce a British Bill of Rights in place of it. A British rights charter would strain the relationship with the Strasbourg court, with its parent body the Council of Europe, and with the EU. Yesterday it was disclosed that Home Secretary Theresa May has advised Mr Cameron that Britain must withdraw from the European Convention on Human Rights which the Strasbourg court exists to enforce, and sources close to Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said that Labour’s Human Rights Act, which makes European rights part of British law, will be repealed if the Tories win next year’s election. Eurosceptic Tory MPs said that Strasbourg had pulled back from trying to force compensation payments for prisoners because of the growing fear in Europe that Britain will pull out. Clacton MP Douglas Carswell said: ‘This was a rare outbreak of common sense from this federalist court. It is amazing what you achieve when you threaten to quit.’ MP John Hemming from the pro-European LibDem party said: ‘The prisoner ruling was a politically considered move. ‘The European Court of Human Rights needs to be accountable. At the moment, on something like prisoner voting, they just go off on one. 'They should be subject to democratic accountability from the parliament of the Council of Europe.’","Move would 'put us in breach of international legal obligations,' Grieve said .

"He was drunk, obsessed with murder and seething at life in the Royal Navy, but Able Seaman Ryan Donovan was still handed a loaded machine gun and allowed to guard a nuclear submarine. Donovan then murdered a senior officer and attempted to kill three other shipmates in April this year. Last night he was beginning a 25-year sentence for murder after a court heard how he had repeatedly promised to unleash a massacre. Charged: A photo of Ryan Donovan (left) taken two days before the killing and, right, victim Lieutenant Commander Ian Molyneux and wife Gillian . The attack finally came after a row with two officers over poorly performed cleaning duties. Despite the row, he was allowed two days of shore leave – which ended at 3:30am on the fateful day when he was put to bed extremely drunk. At noon that day – having told colleagues he was going to kill someone – he began a guard duty stint and was handed an automatic rifle. Moment afterwards weapons engineer Lieutenant Commander Ian Molyneux, 36, was shot in the head at point blank range. The submariner – obsessed with gangster rap and violent computer games – admitted committing murder during a goodwill visit to Southampton by his submarine, the £1.2billion HMS Astute. Hero: Councillor Royston Smith with Commander Breckenridge alongside HMS Astute two days before the shooting. It was Cllr Smith who wrestled the gun from Donovan when he started firing during a tour of the submarine . It emerged that the Navy missed a string of warnings about his behaviour. They knew he had a police caution for assault, had been arrested for drunkenness and referred to doctors for alleged misuse of drugs. One former submarine commander said: ‘That he could be given a firearm after a heavy drinking sessions is astonishing. ‘If this had happened at sea the Royal Navy could have had a catastrophe on its hands.’ Wounded: Lieutenant Chris Hodge, circled, having dinner with some of his colleagues. Donovan admitted the attempted murder of Mr Hodge . Donovan fired seven shots in 13 seconds in . the confines of the vessel before being wrestled to the ground by . visiting dignitaries. Another officer was hit in the abdomen as others . dived for cover. Last night top brass were facing . urgent questions about why he was given an SA80 automatic rifle and 30 . rounds of live ammunition and put on guard duty. Because  life on submarines can be so cramped and claustrophobic the selection process for the ‘silent service’ is supposed to be more intensive than for other parts of the Armed Forces. Submariners can be away from families for at least six months  at a time. But, despite them having to pass an aptitude test, there is no formal psychological test. Instead, senior officers believe the rigorous training which can last up to two years will weed out unsuitable recruits. Before they begin training, personal qualities and life experiences are assessed. Candidates must also pass a a medical and security checks. Over the following weeks and months they will complete courses and exercises to judge whether they have physical and mental fortitude to operate in a confined environment for long periods and interact with a small crew. The final section is the ‘Part 3’ training course where recruits put to sea in a sub. Those who become submariners are supposed to continually assessed to make sure they remain fit for the job. A year before the shooting Donovan had . told fellow seaman Andrew Love that he was thinking about the best way to ‘start a . massacre’ in the control room. He said he wanted to stage a ‘kill . frenzy’ from computer game Grand Theft Auto. Prosecutor Nigel Lickley QC told Winchester Crown Court: ‘The defendant just giggled and said he was thinking how to start a massacre. ‘He started talking about Grand Theft Auto, where you start a massacre and rack up points by killing. The prosecutor added: ‘Witnesses said Donovan had wild eyes and the look on his face was of somebody who was in another place – like they were in a dream and they were doing this like in a video game.’ Mr Justice Field yesterday branded the shootings a ‘murderous onslaught’. He said it was a miracle that Donovan  had not killed two other officers. As Lr Cdr Molyneux’s widow Gillian sobbed in court, he said that the loss for her and their four young children will be ‘crushingly hard to bear’. The judge added: ‘In killing that officer, you robbed him of a bright future within a loving family and with a promising career as a naval officer.’ The court heard that the seaman had faced up to a month in a naval prison after refusing to get up and help reclean a floor. He was nevertheless granted two days’ shore leave during the five-day stop in Southampton as children and VIPs toured the submarine. He spent the time drinking and visiting strip bars before volunteering for the first available guard duty on April 8. On that day, as he travelled back to the submarine, he told fellow seaman Colin Banks: ‘I’m going to kill somebody’ adding, ‘I’m not kidding, watch the news.’ Donovan told another sailor before going on duty: ‘One day I will be famous.’ Asked why, he replied: ‘You will see.’ Despite being helped into bed while . drunk at 3.30am, Donovan was handed the gun at noon after an officer . sniffed his breath and checked his eyes to see if he was sober. As . he walked away Donovan suddenly swung around and began firing at Petty . Officer Chris Brown, 36, and Chief Petty Officer David McCoy, 37, from . less than 10ft. Four bullets missed the men. Donovan then walked towards the control room where he was met by Lt Cdr Molyneux who shouted: ‘What have you done?’ He shot the officer in the head . before stepping over his body and wounding Lieutenant Commander Chris . Hodge, 45. The gunman was then tackled by Southampton council leader . Royston Smith and chief executive Alistair Neill. HMS Astute docked in Southampton for a five-day goodwill visit that included visits from civil dignitaries. Pictured, the sub just days before the shooting took place . Describing Lt Cdr Molyneaux’s . actions, prosecutor Nigel Lickley QC said: ‘It was a totally heroic . attempt to stop an armed man in his tracks.’ Mr Lickley added that Mr . Smith and Mr Neill displayed ‘remarkable courage’. The . court heard details of how Donovan had been arrested in Canada in 2008 . for being drunk and had a police caution for assault in 2007. HMS Astute leaving Southampton following the shooting to return to its base at Faslane, Scotland . In 2009 he was referred to a Navy doctor because of fears he may have been taking drugs but no evidence was found. Donovan’s barrister Christopher Porter, QC, described his client as feckless and grossly immature and said he had intended to kill himself at the end of the shooting. The widow of Lieutenant Commander Ian Molyneux said nothing could ever replace her ‘soulmate’. Gillian Molyneux yesterday sobbed and prayed in court as her husband’s brave last moments were relived through the words of witnesses. Weapons engineer Lt Cdr Molyneux, 36, did not work with Ryan Donovan and the killer had no argument with him, but mercilessly gunned him down anyway. Tragic: Widower Gillian Molyneux (left) said that she had lost her 'soulmate' Commander Ian (right) Mrs Molyneux said outside Winchester Crown Court: ‘Nothing can ever replace Ian – my husband and soulmate and the father of our four beautiful children. ‘There is no pleasure or relief for me today – only the ongoing, heartbreaking sadness for the loss of Ian. ‘I find huge comfort in the abundance of love and support I have received from my family, many friends, Ian’s colleagues in the Royal Navy. ‘I will now try to rebuild my life with my gorgeous children and the eternal memory of Ian, my hero and true love.’ Addressing the children directly, she added: ‘To Jamie, Arron, Bethany and Charlie – your Daddy and I love you very much and our future will always be guided by him.’ Colleagues of Lt Cdr Molyneux described him as a devoted family man who was proud to serve in the Royal Navy. Known to comrades as Molly, he lived with his wife and children, aged between three and 13, in Standish, Wigan. HMS Astute’s commanding officer commander Iain Breckenridge described the dead man as a ‘gentle giant’ with a ‘mischievous twinkle in his eyes’. He said: ‘I know that every man in Astute considered Molly as a true shipmate and held him in the highest regard.’","'Immature' Ryan Donovan was put on sentry duty despite being drunk .

"Dennis Eugene Emery, 57, cocked the gun, pointed it at the animal and then for some reason turned it around right as it fired, shooting himself in the face . A man accidentally shot himself dead while threatening to kill one of the family dogs during a heated argument with his wife at their home in Florida. Police say Dennis Eugene Emery, 57, cocked the gun, pointed it at the animal and then for some reason turned it around right as it fired, shooting himself in the face. He had been fighting with his wife Francisca and warned her that he would shoot one of their dogs in their Pinellas Park home, before producing the revolver. 'He was involved in a domestic disturbance with his wife,' Sergeant Adam Geissenberger of the Pinellas Park Police Department told Fox 13. 'During that disturbance he retrieves a firearm, he produces the firearm, and he threatens to shoot one of the family's animals.' 'It's a shame. It's a damn shame. I never figured him to be irresponsible with a handgun,' next door neighbor Dallas Collins said. Mr Collins told the news channel that Emery's wife owned 13 border collies, and the dogs' barking was a constant source of tension between the couple. According to the Tampa Bay Times, police said the argument started because Emery was upset as he could not find his lighter. He picked up a revolver and pulled back the hammer to emphasize his threat to shoot the animal. As he released the hammer while also turning the gun to his face, the revolver fired. Police said Emery had experienced 34 run-ins with the law since 2012. He was arrested three times in five days in October. Charges against him for aggravated assault, resisting arrest, and leaving the scene of a crash were pending at the time of his death. Investigators originally received conflicting reports over whether the shooting was unintentional or  suicide, but they now say they believe it to be an accident. Sgt Geissenberger added: 'Loss of life, regardless of the situation, is very tragic and now this family has to deal with the loss of a loved one very close to the holidays.'","Dennis Eugene Emery, 57, had been arguing with his wife at their home .

"A mother who fled jihadi gunmen told yesterday how she had seen militants sever the heads of men in her village and then parade them in front of the victims’ families on the bonnets of captured vehicles.

She said at least five heads had been severed and paraded. Scroll down for video . Eyewitness: The Yazidi woman fleeing for her life described seeing horrific things as ISIS invaded her village . Another witness said that the women would be ‘better off dead’ than captured by the militants due to what was being done to them. The latest horrific account of the barbarism of militant death squads in their sweep through northern Iraq in the last two weeks was one of a catalogue of harrowing stories given by Yazidi survivors, who had escaped the attacks only to find themselves trapped in the Sinjar mountains fearing massacre. The woman and her family had made it to the safety of Kurdistan after walking from the mountain for 12 hours guided by Kurdish fighters. Others had an even longer trek to the camps of Turkey. One survivor spoke of seeing up to 1,000 bodies lying on the mountainside in temperatures approaching 50C. The smell was appalling, he said. Another told of a pregnant woman being executed and her stomach cut open black-uniformed Islamic State militants. The anguished journey off Sinjar was made by Mahma Qassem, 28, a father-of-three, who said two members of his family had been killed and one was missing on Sinjar. Terror: An attempted rescue mission ended in tragedy yesterday after the helicopter crashed, killing the pilot . Horrific: Tens of thousands of people from the minority Yazidi population are trapped in the mountains . Displaced Iraqi families from the Yazidi community in Sanjir cross the Iraqi-Syrian border at Fishkhabur . Traumatic: The minority sect has no option, they must flee into a war zone - Syria - or face slaughter at home . ‘Many people have died on the mountain, many people are close to dying, they are alive but not living,’ he said. ‘We thought we would be safe in the mountains but it is a different danger there…from starving or dying of thirst as well as from the bullet. ‘Some people, especially the old, are too weak to try to walk so they can try to escape – they will die there either from a bullet or from a shortage of the things that makes life possible.’ He added : ‘People know if they try to escape and take the wrong path then they will be taken and killed if they are men, if they are women or girls, they will be taken… . ‘They are doing bad things to women. Some people say it would be better for them to be dead.’ Another Yazidi, Tariq, 33, who had been trapped on Sinjar said : ‘We had nothing. With my own eyes, I saw dogs feeding off bodies. He said that people had fled the Islamic State only for them to be hunted down by a messenger who gave an ultimatum to convert to Islam by noon the next day or die. The mission: This is a map of the UK's Iraq mission. An Antonov An-12B aircraft at East Midlands Airport was loaded with cargo from UK Aid today as part of the Government's humanitarian response to the crisis in Iraq . Rescue attempts: This footage shows traumatised refugees being flown to safety on a military helicopter . At least 20,000 civilians, most of whom are from the Yazidi community, who had been besieged by jihadists on a mountain in northern Iraq have safely escaped to Syria and been escorted by Kurdish forces back into Iraq . With tens of thousands of others, they walked on to the barren mountainside of Sinjar. He spoke of people dropping down from dehydration and hunger. His 80 year-old father died two days later from the extreme heat and lack of food or water. Amer Omar Pajo said he watched his father shot in the head by Islamic State gunmen as they fled to the mountains and his mother later died from dehydration. The family sold the last of their belongings to pay a smuggler. One mother, who suffers agonising rheumatism, told how she and her three young children waded through the Tigris River, walked through a minefield and climbed through a barbed-wire fence to make it into Turkey. At one point in the five-hour walk, her family said, the smuggler wanted her children to leave her behind because she was too slow, but they chose to carry her instead. A Tornado surveillance aircraft comes to land at the Royal Air Force base in Cyprus ahead of the mission . Omer and his wife, Baraa, both 60, took nine days to make the trip from their home in Sinjar to a border town in southeast Turkey. Their 26-year-old daughter, Busra Saeed, said the most harrowing moment of her journey was not when the militants torched her home or the bullets, it was when she crossed the river from Iraq to Turkey. She had to hold her two-year-old son Waseem above her head to keep him from drowning. ‘I thought I would lose him,’ she said. Baraa, who survived by eating leaves, said a neighbour had telephoned her days ago to say he had witnessed militants kill a pregnant woman and cut open her tummy.","Woman describes IS fighters cutting off heads and driving them around .

"A New York homeless man is about to launch his own app after learning how to code through the generosity of a software developer who passed him every day during his commute. First announced on Medium last month by software developer Patrick McConlogue, 23, ‘Finding The Unjustly Homeless and Teaching Them to Code’ came to him after seeing the homeless man, who goes only by Leo, on his way to work every day. The original proposal was this: Mr McConlogue offered the homeless man two choices - $100 or a free laptop, wireless hotspot, coding books and daily coding lessons. Leo took opportunity over cash. Programmer in training: Leo, a homeless man in New York, is set to launch his own app after only four weeks of coding lessons . ‘I can go through $100 in a few days. In a week,’ Leo told Business Insider. ‘But he told me I could have a laptop and learn how to do something and I figured it could turn into something more.’ ‘It's really hard to convince people that you are not a bad person, or a drug addict or a crazy,’ he added. ‘How are you gonna do that when you are homeless, and that's how the homeless are depicted? It's not always a negative thing but people don't know that. Leo worked for MetLife until losing his . job in 2011, he told BI. Out of work, he was priced out of his . neighbourhood when luxury condos began to take over. He soon found . himself in an unthinkable place – he was homeless. Leo's teacher: Software developer Patrick McConlogue provided Leo with a laptop, coding books, a wireless hotspot, solar charger and gives him daily coding lessons . This background perhaps helped Leo stand out in the sea of New York homelessness. Calling the poverty-stricken man ‘a genious,’ Mr McConlogue wrote of the increasing awe with which he looked at Leo as he ; rattled off import/export prices on food [and] the importance of solar and green energy.’ ‘He is smart, logical, and articulate,’ the charitable developer added. Leo's classroom: This park, on the West Side, surrounded by a highway and construction sites, is where Leo learns to code . McConlogue made a deal with Leo. He would provide a Samsung Chromebook, a wireless hotspot, three coding books, a solar charger and something to hide the laptop in, as well as daily one hour coding lessons. The rest was up to Leo. So it began, lessons started outside every morning at 8am sharp. In four weeks he’s gone from having no idea what coding was to almost finishing his first app. ‘Yeah! I mean, I thought coding was something that went over like, a dessert,’ Leo told Business Insider. Mealticket: This Samsung Chromebook is Leo's ticket out of poverty . Lessons start with a fifteen minute review of the day's previously created code, which is stored on the website Nitrous.io, McConlogue told BI. Lessons then go into a 15 minute rapid-fire coding session followed by 30 minutes of actual teaching by McConlogue, he added. The classes are taught outside in a park surrounded by a highway and a construction site. With the plan beginning to realize its goal, some feel that Mr McConlogue is using Leo for his own fame, according to BI. When asked, Leo dismissed the notion. ‘I don't really care about all that, what do I care? I'm learning something, right? I know I'm learning something and that's what I care about. Patrick's my man,’ he told the site. man on a mission: Leo's app, set to launch in about a month, will address global warming and other environmental issues he cares about . Leo would not divulge the details of his new app, other than to say it addresses global warming and climate change. The app is expected to launch in about one month, but McConlogue told Business Insider he's looking even further into the future. 'There's a lot of need that became apparent through this,' McConlogue said. 'I would love to get the tools necessary to help some of these individuals and get them some of the information they are looking for regarding coding and opportunity.'","Patrick McConlogue came up with the idea after passing the homeless man every day on his way to work .

"Microsoft has been forced to delete seven sarcastic videos mocking Apple's latest range of iPhones. In a series of spoofs titled 'A fly on the wall in Cupertino?', two actors make ludicrous and dumb suggestions to a man supposed to be Apple CEO Tim Cook in the firm's Californian headquarters. Their list of pretentious colours, including 'vermillion', 'chartreuse', and 'robins egg', is a dig at the new range of multi-coloured iPhones - and Apple's notoriously 'trendy' image. In poor taste: Microsoft deleted the advert that mocked Apple . Apple chief executive Tim Cook praises the new iPhone 5S as the most refined model ever made . Colours aside, they took aim at every element of the controversial new design, including the fingerprint reader and megapixel camera. At one point, the actress hands a piece of A4 paper to 'T' (Tim Cook): 'Feel how light that is. You know how we did that? Megapixels - got them down to eight.' Picking apart Mr Cook's speech at the launch on Wednesday, the actors make fun of phrases such as 'the gold standard' and 'unapologetically plastic'. But after an onslaught of criticism, the rival phone company conceded to remove the clips. A statement released by Microsoft said: 'The video was intended to be a light-hearted poke at our friends from Cupertino. But it was off the mark, and we’ve decided to pull it down.' Tech bloggers have rushed to berate the videos, which feature a Steve Jobs lookalike as Tim Cook. Writing for The Next Web, Ken Yeung said: 'Poking fun at Apple’s various colors is perhaps Microsoft’s way of saying, “hey, we thought of this first”, but it’s just comes across as bewildering.' Video sourced by VaultFeed and Publishize . Microsoft CEO, right, Steve Bullmer's company apologised for the stunt mocking Apple, run by Tim Cook, right . One commenter on Twitter said: 'These Microsoft ads aren’t funny or entertaining at all, I don’t get it.' Another tweeted: 'Pathetic AND offensive?' One video went viral before Microsoft managed to delete it. It opens with one of the colour-coordinated 'ideas people' poking fun at the iWatch, which is still yet to hit the market after numerous mentions. The actor says: 'Sorry we're late. My iWatch had to go back to R&D [research and development].' He proceeds to suggest random colours, with a flourish of his wrist, for the CEO to think about - while his colleague 'translates' them into layman's terms: . 'Vermillion, do you feel me?' 'Pink.' 'Chartreuse' 'Green.' 'Robin's egg blue' 'Blue.' The actress also translates 'yeah bro' to 'yes', and 'nah brah' to 'no'. He continues to mock how the model falls short of its description: 'You asked us to make the gold standard of iPhone. It turns out that is super hard. 'We made you an iPhone which is the colour gold'. In what was classed as a 'make or . break' event for Apple, the tech firm unveiled a cut-price handset . called the iPhone 5C as well as a high-end model called iPhone 5S. The release of the iPhone 5C marks a step away from Apple's luxe image. Many . believe the move is a desperate bid to poach Samsung buyers, as the .

"Family birthdays at my French in-laws' rambling farmhouse are mandatory but lively affairs, with anything from 20 to 25 noisy personalities gathered under one roof. Every time I travel to a celebration with my husband to meet his sisters and brother, and their respective families, it is with some apprehension. They are daunting. From the off, I found these reunions terrifying. But as time passed, and Pascal and I clocked up five years of marriage, I hoped my place as the second wife of my in-laws' eldest child was finally, firmly, established. Second best? Samantha fears she can't live up to Pascal's first wife Eleanor . So I was astonished by events at a recent birthday lunch. We were sitting round the table when my father-in-law poured himself another generous glass of Malbec then asked: 'Can you pass the cheese, Eleanor?' The uncomfortable silence was palpable. Everyone knows 'Eleanor' is not my name. It is the name of Pascal's first wife. An embarrassed titter erupted from a guest and my sister-in-law, Manuelle, gave my hand a reassuring squeeze under the table. My cheeks burned. Pascal swiftly came to the rescue. He broke the pregnant silence by asking if anyone wanted more wine. I have known Pascal and his family for more than six years. It pains me to admit it, but such blunders - and they have happened more than once - still leave me feeling bewildered and distressed. Perhaps I should be more generous to Pascal's father, who is in his early 70s and can be forgetful. But I'm at his house regularly: I help him with DIY, bring gifts and take him out to lunch, so the very least he can do, surely, is remember my name. Mine is not the name which passes my in-laws' lips the most, it is Eleanor's. At that birthday lunch, she was again, the spectre at the table, worming her way into a family gathering at which she had no place. Daphne du Maurier’s novel Rebecca - in which the unnamed heroine lives her life in the shadow of her husband's eponymous first bride - celebrates its 75th anniversary this year. It is a book I love but which has always haunted me. And today, the echo of the oh-so perfect first wife has shifted from powerful fiction to troubling fact. Today I am in the shadow of my very own Rebecca: I live, day-in, day-out, with my husband's ex. Baby quest: Samantha longs to give her husband children like his first wife did . Du Maurier's son Kits Browning has revealed the novel was based on his mother's jealousy of her husband's first wife. She, like me, recognised that the ghost of the first wife can never be exorcised. When I first came across pictures of Pascal and Eleanor together, my heart plummeted. Flicking through album after photo album, I began to compare her relationship with Pascal to mine. They were married for eight years. How could I possibly compete, I wondered. As I flicked through, they went from loved-up boyfriend and girlfriend to happily married couple, before becoming the proud parents of a daughter, and then a son - Joëlle, 29, and Hélios, 26. To my envious eyes, they seemed the perfect family. Perhaps the biggest blow to my ego was that it was obvious they were each other's first love. I have never dared delve too far into the reasons why she and Pascal split, but they got together when young, and it seems, simply grew apart. 'While I'm in no doubt I am the love of . his life, he is reluctant to take his family to task over Eleanor, and . her seemingly privileged status' It would make my life infinitely more bearable if Eleanor was fat, frumpy and past her prime, but she isn't. Even though she is 15 years older than me, Eleanor - who is also British - is blonde, beautiful and intelligent. It is even more galling that she was a professional sportswoman, excelling at badminton, and is now a professor of English. The perfect Eleanor has imposed herself with frustrating regularity - even on my wedding day. My stepdaughter mentioned her mother had wanted to send a card. I balked at this. Joëlle explained, awkwardly, that Eleanor had wanted to write 'Good Luck' inside - as she thought I would need it. Why would this woman feel the need to poke her nose in, 20 years after Pascal had left her? She has also guarded her friendship with my husband's sister, Veronique, staying in such close contact with her that I could never hope to form my own bond. What does Pascal have to say about it? Very little. While I'm in no doubt I am the love of his life, he is reluctant to take his family to task over Eleanor, and her seemingly privileged status. How does this make me feel? Disappointed and, on occasion, very nearly murderous. Art imitating life: Daphne du Maurier's son said her novel Rebecca was based on her jealousy of her husband's first wife . In 2009, without our say-so, she joined us with Pascal's family on a weekend break. My in-laws take a summer holiday together every year, and it's a tradition for the children to meet up with them for a long weekend. Imagine my horror when, two years into my marriage, Pascal and I arrived to discover his first wife was there too. At first, I had no idea who she was. My legs almost buckled when she bounded over, introduced herself and kissed Pascal on the cheek. It was mortifying. Needless to say, it's a day I would rather forget. Not only did Eleanor insist on taking constant photographs of Pascal and I, she also dominated the conversation at the dining table. She sat next to me - speaking perfect French, which at the time I couldn't do - but interrogated me in English, goading me about why I'd given up being a vegetarian. 'I look to the future, to weddings, . christenings and grandchildren, and shrink with misery when I think how . Eleanor will dominate them' A heavy silence hung between Pascal and myself on the journey home, and it took until the next day for me to pluck up the courage to ask if he had known beforehand Eleanor would be there. He said he'd known nothing about it, and we later found my in-laws did not tell us, because they knew we would not have gone. So the next year, I told Pascal that if 'she' was going on the family holiday, I wasn't. For once, he took a stand and told his parents we would not be going and why. The fall-out was ugly. There were many heated telephone discussions between Pascal and his parents, and since then the family holiday has been dropped. But it's not Eleanor’s looks, her French or even her equanimity with my in-laws which really irritates me. Eleanor has something I will never have. She gave birth to, and raised his children. And it's becoming increasingly clear to me, midway through yet more IVF, that I will never achieve the same. Pascal and I have been trying, unsuccessfully, to have a family of our own for the past five years. My stepchildren, though lovely, are the product of their marriage. They mean my husband's life will forever be entwined with his ex-wife's. No escape: Samantha hates the fact Eleanor will always be in her life as the mother of Pascal's children . I look to the future, to weddings, christenings and grandchildren, and shrink with misery when I think how Eleanor will dominate them. Sadly, I have no alternative but to avoid them. Today, I am constantly reminded of Eleanor's status as 'mother' and 'first wife' whenever my stepchildren come to stay. She sends cards and presents which the children must hand over to their grandparents in front of me. These days, Joëlle rarely discusses her mother in front of me. I have left the table more than once when this conversation comes up. While Pascal sympathises, he tries to keep the peace. I sometimes ask how he would feel if my parents discussed my ex-husband in his company. Pascal's response is logical, but cuts me to the quick. 'Why would they talk about your ex?' he asks. 'You don't have children so there's no reason for him to continue to play any part in your life. And so, my IVF battle continues, while the fragrant, fecund Eleanor wafts around my family. Veronique, pointedly asks how things are going on 'that front' whenever we meet. I do not doubt my answers are always faithfully reported back to Eleanor. I can't help but feel Veronique disapproves. When she gave my husband a 'friendly' warning of how difficult the IVF process is, I had to wonder whether these were Veronique's true feelings, or whether she was parroting something Eleanor had said to her. Slowly, I have come to realise that the spectre of my husband's oh-so perfect first wife will not go away. I may resent and regret that fact, but I know she will be in my marriage for the rest of my life. I only hope we can survive her presence.

"A 22-year-old student who is so terrified of cheese she is unable to walk past the supermarket counter in case she bursts into tears has spoken of how her phobia blights her everyday life. Melissa North, from Herne Bay, Kent, said she developed the phobia at the age of four, but she is now so terrified of the dairy product the mere sight of it can bring her out in a cold sweat. The illustration and visual communications student said family and friends tease her for the fear, which has seen her stay away from the food ever since she was given it at a friend's . house when she was a child. Melissa North, 22, has said she is so terrified of cheese she is unable to go past the supermarket counter in case she bursts into tears . She said: 'Walking past a deli counter in a supermarket is really difficult for me. I get so clammy and start to have a panic attack. 'It just looks awful - so gooey and disgusting - it makes me feel sick. 'My friends and family think it's hilarious but it's really awful. I hate going near the stuff, and seeing people eat it is horrendous. 'Touching or eating cheese for me is like someone who is scared of spiders holding a tarantula. It's terrifying.' Ms North said she has stayed away from the dairy product ever since she was given cheese on toast at a friend's house when she was a child. She said: 'It tasted horrible but my parents had always taught me to finish what was on my plate - I didn't want to be rude so I had no choice but to eat it. The illustration and visual communications student has said her fear of the food has got worse after a cruel joke played on her by her school friends . 'It just tasted disgusting and I've been afraid of it ever since. Now if I was ever offered cheese or was given a meal with cheese in it I would just have to refuse it - the idea of eating it makes me feel physically sick. I'm just so scared of it.' The student says her fear of the food has got worse after a cruel joke played on her by her school friends. She said: 'When I was 15 there was a really awful incident with cheese that made my phobia even worse. 'My friends at school all knew about my cheese phobia and thought it would be fun to throw some cheese at me as a joke. Ms North said she has stayed away from the dairy product ever since she was given cheese on toast at a friend's house when she was a child . 'It was cream cheese and it landed right in my face. 'I just fell to the floor and crawled out of the class room crying. 'I went to the toilets but was in too much of a state to clean it off. I was panicking and crying and I could just feel this horrible sticky cheese all over my face. 'My friend eventually managed to calm me down and clean me up but it was a horrendous experience.' Ms North said the worst kind of cheese was soft cheese, while blue cheeses come in at a close second. She said: 'I hate the way that cream cheese looks. It's so soft and gooey and just looks a mess. 'The texture of it makes me want to be sick - I think that's what scares me most about it, the way that it feels. 'Going into a supermarket and seeing all the cheeses piled high together makes me panic - I really have to struggle to hold it together. 'If there's ever a news item or a documentary on TV that shows cheese, I have to change the channel straight away.' Ms North said she is constantly mocked by friends and family who think her phobia is amusing. She said: 'My boyfriend is always making fun of me. He will chase me around the house with a block of cheese in his hand but I just go into a state of panic. People who have a fear or anxiety disorder over cheese are said to suffer from turophobia. Sufferers often associate the dairy product with a traumatic memory, although people who are lactose intolerant may also have the condition. Those who are known to suffer from turophobia may dislike one type of cheese more than other types, while some may fear the food stuff altogether. 'I just have to lock myself in the bathroom until he gets bored. He is supportive of me but it's hard to explain how much I hate it.' The student's most recent ordeal saw her unable to return to her room following another cruel joke by a university friend. She said: 'I came back from a full day studying to find cheese smudged all over my door. 'A flatmate had found it funny to graffiti on my bedroom door and I just couldn't go near it. 'That wasn't even the worst part, they left a trail of cheese outside my door so there was no way I could go in. 'I wouldn't even risk jumping over it. I ran downstairs crying and it took hours for my flat mate to agree to clean it up. 'I know it sounds really strange, and I know that some people think I'm joking, but it's a serious phobia. 'Touching or eating cheese for me is like someone who is scared of spiders holding a tarantula. It's terrifying' - Melissa North . 'I'd love not to be able to be so afraid of it, but I'm terrified.' Dave Smithson, Services Coordinator at Anxiety UK, said: 'Any kind of phobia is an irratonal fear of an object or situation which wouldn't normally arise in the average person. 'It's not unusual to find different and unusual phobias like that of cheese. 'There are various ways you can help people with their phobias, in most cases it involves some sort of therapy, and a therapist can devise coping therapies. 'For a lot of people phobias are a life-long problem, as they do not realise what help they can be given.' If you're frightened of these, you may suffer from bibliophobia, or fear of books . More than a fear of something, a phobia is a type of anxiety disorder which means the sufferer has an overwhelming need to avoid all contact with the source of their anxiety. Some phobias, such as arachnophobia, or fear of spiders, are more common than others, while others, such as these below, are more unusual. Papyrophobia: Fear of paper . Bibliophobia: Fear of books .

"Swoop: The son of jailed mob boss Vincent 'Vinny Gorgeous' Basciano (pictured)  is among 25 people arrested for allegedly running a $50million betting ring . The son of jailed mafia boss Vincent 'Vinny Gorgeous' Basciano has been arrested on charges of helping to run a $50million betting ring that operated across five states from New York to California. Vincent Basciano Jr, was among 25 people charged in connection with what police described as a mob-linked enterprise. They included Gadoon 'Spanky' Kyrollos, and the three owners of gambling website Pinnacle Sports - which boasts of having customers in 100 countries. Queens District Attorney Richard Brown said: 'Illegal gambling is not a victimless crime. 'Those who participate in these criminal enterprises often use threats, intimidation and even physical force to collect debts.' Pinnacle sports owners Brandt England, of Las Vegas, George Molsbarger, of Santa Monica, Calif., and Stanley Tomchin, of Montecito, Calif., were charged with enterprise corruption, money laundering and conspiracy. England faced an additional charge of promoting gambling. His lawyer in Las Vegas, David Chesnoff, said: 'We certainly intend to defend this matter vigorously in court.' He declined to address the specifics of the allegations, saying he was new to the case. The probe was led by investigators from the New York Police Department, but multiple state, municipal and federal law enforcement agencies were involved, and arrests took place in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Nevada and California. Fifteen of those charged are accused of being bookmakers who took bets on football, baseball and basketball games as well as horse-racing. According to Inspector Brian O'Neill . of the NYPD's Organize Crime division members of the group made threats . to collect money although no charges of violence have been made. Family man: Vincent 'Vinny Gorgeous' Basciano pictured during the early 1980s with one of his four children . The group allegedly used off-shore gambling web-sites  in an attempt to avoid detection. The Queens district attorney’s office, which is prosecuting the case, said that in one 18-month period the gambling operation took in $50 million in profit while using computer servers in gambling friendly countries to try to hide dealings with bettors in the U.S. Gamblers placed bets over the phone and . at least four websites, while the ring used dummy accounts to hide the . flow of money and couriers to transport cash profits to and from Panama . and Costa Rica, authorities said. Among the others arrested were the three owners of the Pinnacle Sports gambling website . Pinnacle Sports sidestepped the issues of whether it was involved in illegal gambling in the U.S. and whether England, Molsbarger and Tomchin were owners of the site. 'Regarding the recent allegations surrounding the individuals allegedly affiliated with Pinnacle Sports, please be reassured that no Pinnacle Sports employees have been arrested or charged, and Pinnacle Sports itself was not charged in the indictment,' it said in an emailed statement. 'We expect no interruptions to our day to day business activities at this time.' No one returned a phone message left at a number listed in Tomchin’s name Thursday. Molsbarger’s phone number isn’t publicly listed. Other people indicted in the case include a manager of the legal sports betting operation at the M Resort Spa Casino in Nevada and men in several states who prosecutors said had worked as bookmakers or money handlers. Vincent 'Vinny Gorgeous' Basciano earned his name as the owner of Bronx beauty salon 'Hello Gorgeous' as well as for his snappy dress sense and good looks. He is currently serving life imprisonment having narrowly avoided the death sentence for ordering a 2004 gangland hit on Ralph 'Randy' Pizzolo shortly after taking control of the Bonnanno crime family. During the trial, prosecutors used the unprecedented testimony of former Bonanno boss Joseph Massino to try to portray Basciano as a stone-cold killer who deserved death. Bonanno boys: A 1981 surveillance photo shows crime figures Gerlando Sciascia, (left), Vito Rizzuto, (centre left), Giovanni Liggamari, (centre right) and Joseph Massino outside their Bronx headquarters . Massino, 68, broke his family's sacred vow of silence and began talking with investigators after his 2004 conviction for orchestrating a quarter-century's worth of murder, racketeering and other crimes as he rose through the ranks of the Bonannos. While imprisoned together in 2005, the former Bonanno boss agreed to wear a wire and betray the 51-year-old Basciano by recording conversations about killings and other banter. Jurors heard one recording of Basciano boasting, 'I'm a hoodlum. I'm a tough guy. Whatever happens happens. Let's go.' In another, a Massino mused about the demise of the family. 'We was OK until I got pinched,' he said. 'We was on top of the world.' The classic Mafia movie Donnie Brasco took its inspiration from the reign of terror imposed by the Bonanno crime family. The New York criminal empire was named after Joseph Bonanno and was the first family to be expelled from The Commission for actively dealing in heroin. The Commission is the council of the crime bosses brought together to maintain order in the Mafia.Bonanno boss Joseph 'Big Joe'. Massino was boss from early 1990s to 2004 - he then became the first official boss from New York to become an informant. Donnie Brasco is the story of how an FBI agent was able to work undercover with the Bonanno crime family and almost became a 'made' man.

"The National Security Agency said late on Friday that it was a glitch that brought down its public website for a few hours and not hackers, contrary to some online claims. The NSA website was down for several hours after 3pm on Friday prompting claims that the site of the secretive surveillance agency had been targeted by rogue hackers. But the agency denied it had come under attack and said in an email to ABC News that an 'internal error' had been responsible for its offline presence. The National Security Agency headquarters at Fort Meade, Maryland. The NSA's website went offline for at least six hours on Friday but the agency denied this was because of a hacker attack . 'NSA.gov was not accessible for several hours tonight because of an internal error that occurred during a scheduled update,' the spy agency said in a statement. 'The issue will be resolved this evening. Claims that the outage was caused by a distributed denial of service [DDoS] attack are not true.' The site was inaccessible for at least six hours on Friday and even longer for some users. German officials have traveled to Washington to investigate claims that the NSA bugged the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Merkel is among the world leaders who are trying to cope following allegations of massive electronic monitoring by the NSA around the world . Some Twitter accounts affiliated with infamous internet hacker group Anonymous claimed credit for a denial of service attack while other hackers also claimed responsibility for sending the website offline. The NSA has come under fire recently in the aftermath of revelations about deep domestic and international spying programs. The range of surveillance by the NSA included allegations the agency bugged the telephones of foreign government leaders, including political allies such as German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Former National Security Agency systems analyst Edward Snowden, center, receives the Sam Adams Award in Moscow, Russia in October. Snowden's revelations about NSA activity, including the alleged tapping of up to 35 world leaders' cell phones, have questioned America's attitude to its allies. Also pictured are Raymond McGovern, right, a former U.S. government official, and former NSA executive Thomas Drake, left . German intelligence officials are headed to Washington to confront the U.S. over the claims Chancellor Merkel's phone has been bugged since 2002. German foreign minister Guido Westerwelle told a press conference on Thursday that the revealtions had jeopardized relations with the U.S. and damaged trust between the two supposed allies. 'If you trust one another, you don't spy on each other,'Westerwelle said. 'Doing so regardless puts pressure on the friendship.' Demonstrators marched through Washington, DC, on Saturday towards the National Mall for a rally to demand that Congress investigate the National Security Agency's mass surveillance programs . The DC protests came in the same week as allegations the NSA bugged the mobile telephone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel . Many of the claims about the range of NSA activity came from files taken by former contractor Edward Snowden who provided details of the agency's programs to selected media. Thousands of people protested in Washington, DC, on Saturday against the NSA's domestic and international surveillance programs by marching to the Capitol. Protetsors holding signs that said Stop mass surveillance,' 'Thank you, Edward Snowden' and 'No NSA mass spying,' called for closer scrutiny of the agency.","Secretive surveillance agency claims online outage was not the work of hacker group Anonymous .

"A mystery structure being built on a barge floating off San Francisco's Treasure Island is fueling speculation that Google is turning its idea of a floating data center into a reality. While the Internet company won't confirm the development, CNET reports it has evidence suggesting the four-story 'secret project' could be a Google sea-faring data center. Google patented a 'water-based data center' in 2009, describing an environmentally friendly, sea-powered telecommunications and storage system. 'Secret project': While Google won't comment, experts say this four-story construction in San Francisco Bay looks like a data center . Is this is? A 2009 patent filed by Google shows a water-borne data center . Possible: This large structure on a barge just off Treasure Island, between San Francisco and Oakland, could be a floating data center being made by Google . 'A system includes a floating platform-mounted computer data center comprising a plurality of computing units, a sea-based electrical generator in electrical connection with the plurality of computing units, and one or more sea-water cooling units for providing cooling to the plurality of computing units,' Google wrote in the patent. Now, CNET investigative reporter Daniel Terdiman claims the mystery construction site floating in San Francisco Bay could belong to Google, drawing on evidence from lease agreements, expert consultations and interviews with locals. He said putting data centers inside shipping containers, as he claims Google is doing, is already a well-established practice. 'The cutouts in the long walls of the containers, when they line up, they make hallways,' said Joel Egan, who designs similar structures. 'You could put all sorts of mainframes into the containers...It doesn't have enough windows for an office building' While some commentators have criticized the reporter's evidence as circumstantial, experts say it's plausible that Google would build water-based data facility. Joel Egan, the principal at Cargotecture, which designs custom cargo container buildings, said the structure looks like a data center. 'The cutouts in the long walls of the containers, when they line up, they make hallways,' Egan told CNET. 'You could put all sorts of mainframes into the containers...It doesn't have enough windows for an office building.'

"Texas Representative Steve Stockman introduced legislation today that would allow taxpayers to give the Internal Revenue Service the 'same 'lame' excuses for not for handing over documents as the IRS is giving Congress. If the IRS is allowed to claim that 'convenient, unexplained, miscellaneous . computer malfunction is sufficient justification not to produce . specific, critical documentation,' Stockman's bill says, taxpayers should be able to, as well. 'Taxpayers shouldn’t be expected to follow laws the Obama administration refuses to follow themselves,' Stockman, a Republican, said in a statement announcing The Dog Ate My Tax Receipts Act. 'Taxpayers should be allowed to offer the same flimsy, obviously made-up excuses the Obama administration uses.' Texas Rep. Steve Stockman, right, introduced tongue-in-cheek legislation today called The Dog Ate My Tax Receipts Act. Stockman is pictured here chatting with Rep. Steve Chabot of Ohio before a House Foreign Affairs Committee in April . The Congressman's tongue-in-cheek legislation is meant to tweak the IRS for claiming that it's unable to provide 28 months worth of emails from former Exempt Organizations Division Director Lois Lerner because her computer crashed in 2011. Lerner left the IRS last year after she was implicated in a tea party targeting scheme in which the IRS inappropriately scrutinized right-leaning organizations applying for non-profit statuses while approving progressive groups' applications with little additional questioning. At a May 2013 House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform hearing Lerner testified that she had not broken any laws or regulations before invoking her Fifth Amendment right not to implicate herself in a crime. Since then, Congress has been trying to get its hands on her emails, dating back to January 2009, so it could see if the IRS acted alone in the targeting or it was in cahoots with the White House. IRS commissioner John Koskinen informed the House Ways and Means committee on Friday that getting the bulk of Lerner's emails for the first half of the time period in question would be more difficult than he'd originally led the committee to believe because of the computer crash. During the crash her hard drive was damaged, Koskinen told Congress, and attempts to retrieve her data afterward were unsuccessful. Koskinen told the Ways and Means commitee today that Lerner herself went to 'extraordinary' lengths to have technology experts at the IRS rebuild her hard drive so that she could access her old emails but they were 'unrecoverable.' In keeping with its usual policy, the IRS recycled Lerner's hard drive in 2011, Koskinen said, so he cannot comply with an Oversight subpoena to turn the computer part over. The computers of six other officials affiliated with the scandal also crashed, he told Congress on Monday, and the IRS is still working to recover their data. 'At this time it is too early to know whether any of the emails have been lost on any of those hard drives,' he testified today. Internal Revenue Service Commissioner John Koskinen told the House Ways and Means Committee on today that the IRS can't produce emails from seven officials connected to the tea party investigation because of computer crashes, including the emails from Lois Lerner . In response to Koskinen's shocking testimony this morning, Stockman, a Republican who is not running for re-election to his House seat and only has a few months left in his congressional term, filed The Dog Ate My Tax Receipts Act this afternoon. In his bill Stockman says that 'fairness and Due Process demand that the American taxpayer be granted no less latitude than we afford the bureaucrats employed presently at the IRS.' Unless the IRS produces the documents that were subpenaed, 'taxpayers shall be given the benefit of the doubt when not producing critical documentation' if their excuse is one of the following:1.         The dog ate my tax receipts2.         Convenient, unexplained, miscellaneous computer malfunction3.         Traded documents for five terrorists4.         Burned for warmth while lost in the Yukon5.         Left on table in Hillary’s Book Room6.         Received water damage in the trunk of Ted Kennedy’s car7.         Forgot in gun case sold to Mexican drug lords8.         Forced to recycle by municipal Green Czar9.         Was short on toilet paper while camping10.       At this point, what difference does it make?'In any case, IRS can see the NSA for a good, high quality copy,' Stockman snarkily stated at the end of the bill.","Texas Rep.

"The online activist group, known as Anonymous, has threatened to shut down Zynga and Facebook, days after the gaming giant announced it was laying off 5 per cent of its workforce. The group is targeting the San Francisco based company because of 'the outrageous treatment of their employees and their actions against many developers,' an unidentified member of the group, donning their trademark Guy Fawkes mask, announced in a YouTube video posted on Sunday. Slamming the tech firm for slashing its employee base while sitting on 'billion dollars cash,' the hackers threatened to release games it has stolen from Zynga's server, in addition to shutting down both Zynga and Facebook on November 5. Scroll down for video. Warning: The online activist group known as Anonymous has threatened to shut down Zynga and Facebook on November 5, which marks Guy Fawkes Day . Threat: The group planned its attack in retaliation against Zynga's announcement it would cut 5 per cent of its staff and would outsource many of those jobs to India . The looming threat to take down the social networking sites comes after Zynga unveiled a restructuring plan in the wake of its disappointing third quarter earnings report on October 24. Zynga CEO Mark Pincus announced last week it would lay off five per cent of its workforce, of approximately 3,000, shutting down its office in Boston and slashing the staff at the company's Austin branch. The company is also said to be looking at closing operations in the UK and Japan. The downsizing came as Zynga announced the company lost $52.7 million, or 7 cents per share in the past quarter. The company CEO described the layoffs . as necessary 'to streamline our operations, focus our resources on our . most strategic opportunities, and invest in our future,' in a memo to . staff last week. 'As part of these changes, we’ve had . to make some tough decisions around products, teams and people.' Plan: The group dubbed their campaing #OP maZYNGA and plans to roll out their attack in multiple phases . Layoffs: Zynga CEO Mark Pincus (speaking at a San Francisco event on October 11) said last week the layoffs were necessary 'to streamline operations' 'We don’t take these decisions . lightly as we recognize the impact to our colleagues and friends who . have been on this journey with us. We appreciate their amazing . contributions and will miss them.' In addition to staff cuts, the company is also retiring some of its older games. Though Zynga dominated the early . online gaming market, with its widely popular FarmVille and Words With Friends, it has been . losing out to competitors like King.com, Wooga and Kixeye, in addition . to the mobile arena where it has lost market share. The latest news from Zynga could mean . even more problems for Facebook, as the gaming unit accounted for 14 per . cent of Facebook's total revenue for the first six months of 2012. Facebook has failed to impress Wall . Street in the aftermath of its hyped IPO in May, as many analysts wonder . if Mark Zuckerberg can really deliver a profit. Gaming giant: Zynga (pictured: the company headquarters in San Francisco) opened in 2003 and developed FarmVille and Words With Friends. It accounted for 14 per cent of Facebook's revenue in the past six months . That said, Zynga has announced it . will enter the gambling business and combined with its cost cutting . measures and staff reductions, shares were actually up last Wednesday as investors seemed . pleased with the company's vision to move past this rough patch. So with its stock on the rise, the . online group is taking on the gaming giant - accusing the company of throwing its employees . under the bus while executives reap the benefits of increased investor . confidence. In an operation dubbed #OP maZYNGA, a . posting from Anonymous on the AnonNews website stated it would retaliate with a multiphase . effort to hit the tech company where it hurts. The group has claimed to have . accessed Zynga's server and has obtained confidential . communication to executives about the company's strategy, which . allegedly includes plans for further layoffs and increased outsourcing to . Bangalore, India. In the next phase of its attack, Anonymous plans to release code of Zynga games and even plans to shut . down both the gaming site and Facebook. Zynga customers and Facebook users, We are anonymous. During the last few days anonymous has been targeting Zynga for the outrageous treatment of their employees and their actions against many developers. We have come to believe that this actions of Zynga will result in massive layoff of a thousand people and legal actions against everyone that speaks to the public about this plan. It will also come to end of the US game market as we know it as all this jobs will be replaced in other more convenient financial countries. With a billion dollars cash sitting in a bank we do believe that such actions are an insult to the population and the behaviour of corporations like Zynga must change. Anonymous could not allow this to happen so it's starting to release confidential documents we have leaked on this plan. As we speak we are planning to release also all the games we've taken from their servers for free. That being said we will stop the idea of the distribution of such games if Zynga will cease immediately the plan. 'On November the fifth we will release the key to the data files. Remember, remember the 5TH of November,' the group said. November 5 marks Guy Fawkes Day, which commemorates the day in 1605 when Guy Fawkes joined a group of Roman Catholic conspirators who tried to blow up the British Parliament. The group of hackers, whose members don masks . of the English rebellion leader, are a loosely organized body who protest government surveillance of the web. They have taken responsibility for taking down many government websites, in addition to launching cyber attacks on major corporations. The internet social activists formed . in 2003 and have since thrown their support behind progressive causes . like Julian Assange's WikiLeaks and Occupy Wall Street. Anonymous had previously threatened to shut down Facebook on November 5, 2011. 'If you are a willing hacktivist or a guy who just wants to protect the freedom of information then join the cause and kill Facebook for the sake of your own privacy,' the group said in a statement last year about the lack of privacy on the site. 'Facebook has been selling information to government agencies and giving clandestine access to information security firms so that they can spy on people from all around the world.'

"Alex Zane may be a well-known music-lover, but he is happy to avoid Ibiza's sprawling nightclubs . He may be a well-known music-lover having hosted high-profile shows on MTV, XFM and NME Radio. But Alex Zane reveals he more than happy to shun the masses of Ibiza's hard-partying tourists, booming beats and sprawling nightclubs to take a trip to the north of the island, which is littered with breath-taking beaches. The 35-year-old presenter says the Spanish island has 'two characters' explaining the tranquil villages and peaceful orange groves are just a bike-ride away and offer the opportunity to 'live like a local'. Read our Q and A with Alex to find out how he spends his time on the island. Many people are cautious of visiting Ibiza as they think it's all about clubbing and rowdy youngsters. But what else has the island got to offer? 'Ibiza is an island of two characters; the south which is devoted to the mega clubs and party-goers and the other, lesser known Northern side of the island, which is peaceful, tranquil and full of unspoilt beauty. Of course, the boundaries aren't as clear cut as this, but for every all-night DJ session there is an early morning sunrise at one of the many breath-taking little coves that litter the Island. The nightlife may have gained a reputation for the island amongst tourists, but it's this other side to Ibiza that the locals rave about. If you are one of the 50 per cent of Brits who, according to research by American Express, are after the authentic experience of 'living like a local', then the best way to explore this quieter side of the island is to hop on a bike and get off the beaten track to explore the many villages, peaceful orange groves and quaint little restaurants that tourists don't usually get to experience. I guarantee you won't hear a baseline the whole time you are there.' Alex Zane recommends escaping Ibiza's crowded clubbing areas and visiting the island's northern coast. Beaches such as Cala de Sant Vicent (pictured) can be found on the North East of Ibiza . Best restaurant? 'My favourite restaurant on the island is a little family owned place called Sabores Naturales in the centre of the small town of San Juan. It's got a quiet courtyard outside where you can just sit, relax, eat, drink and let time pass you by without a care. All the food is vegetarian and organic with fresh fruit juices and, in my opinion, the best homemade pizza on the island.' Best beach? 'Picking my favourite beach in Ibiza is a bit of a tricky one. If I did have to choose though, it would probably be Cala Xuclar. It felt like I was on a tropical beach without the long-haul flying. With great views and white sand, combined with a few fisherman's huts and a tiny kiosk serving food, it was the perfect place to escape from it all.' Great outdoors: Alex Zane loves the party side of Ibiza but also enjoys going out exploring . Best place to stay? 'If you are going in search of sunset bike rides and early morning strolls around the old towns, then I'd advise staying in any one of the boutique hotels in the north of the island, like the Hotel Hacienda Na Xamena, with its series of spa pools and waterfalls built into the cliff face. We stayed in Can Curreu and it's safe to say that that the view from the breakfast table made the early starts much better.' Your favourite thing about Ibiza and why? 'My favourite thing about Ibiza is discovering the hidden gems of the island. When you say to people you are heading on holiday to Ibiza, they immediately imagine rows of sun beds on the beaches and overcrowded bars blasting out music. Yet you only need to venture a little off the tourist trails and, even in peak season, you can find stunning, empty beaches and relaxing places to sit for a drink. Perhaps the island's reputation has meant less people visit Ibiza in search of a rejuvenating holiday. For whatever the reason, they're missing out.' The ultimate island guide: Alex produced his quick guide to what is great about Ibiza . What are your packing essentials? 'Packing light is the key if, like me, you enjoy moving around a lot. There's nothing worse than heaving a giant case jammed full of clothes to lug on and off various forms of transport. As long as you've got one smart outfit in there and the facilities to clean it you'll be fine. And if you don't have the facilities to clean it, you're probably not in a place you're going to need it in the first place.' Which destination is top of your wishlist? 'I'd like to explore more of South America. I've seen a lot of Brazil: Rio, Sao Paulo and up to Manaus and then deep into the Rain forest, but that's it. I'd really like to go further south to Argentina.' What is your earliest travel memory? 'Scotland. I remember being in Scotland so much as a kid. My mum often took myself and my brother to stay on the West Coast. We spent time on Skye, around Oban and Arisaig and then on the banks of Loch Awe. It is still one of my favourite places in the world to spend time… stunning scenery, wild weather and fascinating history.'

"Manchester City have had enquiries from Inter Milan and Roma for Matija Nastasic who they want to sell with Eliaquim Mangala expected to arrive from Porto. They would prefer to move him abroad although Arsenal would guarantee quicker payment. Arsene Wenger will move for a new centre-half if captain Thomas Vermaelen leaves for Manchester United. Talented: Matija Nastasic impressed for the champions Manchester City last season . On his way: Could Nastasic have played his last game for Manchester City? And Nastasic is on the Gunners’ radar as they make plans for the exit of Vermaelen. The Serbia international was watched extensively by Arsenal scouts during his time at Fiorentina, but City moved quickly to snap up Nastasic in 2012 as he developed a reputation as one of the best emerging defenders in Europe. Despite missing out to City, the North London club remain keen on Nastasic and are set to revive their interest should Vermaelen leave. Nastasic’s future at the Etihad Stadium is unclear this summer due to the pending arrival of Mangala. Experience: Thomas Vermaelen is still a top player on his day . Frustrating: Vermaelen has endured his fair share of injury woes over the last few years . VIDEO Vermaelen could join Manchester United . Whether Vermaelen completes a move to Old Trafford remains to be seen, with the Gunners far from convinced about selling their skipper. The Belgium international has less than 12 months on his existing deal meaning he can leave on a free transfer next summer. But Wenger knows letting Vermaelen go, particularly after the departure of fourth-choice centre-back Bacary Sagna, would leave him alarmingly short of options in the position. It is understood Wenger would give serious consideration to a player-swap deal with United. Wenger has shown firm interest in United central defenders Chris Smalling and Phil Jones in the past, and may look to include either in a deal for Vermaelen.","Man City have had enquiries from Inter Milan and Roma for Nastasic .

"Town of Bani Walid is set to be overturned . Volunteer fighters poured in from the Libyan capital and other towns held by the former rebels today to join what they expect to be the final battle for Bani Walid, one of Muammar Gaddafi's last remaining strongholds. After a week-long stand-off over a peaceful surrender of the town, the Libyan fighters on Friday launched a two-pronged assault on Bani Walid that soon dissolved into street fighting. Sign of peace? Anti-Gaddafi fighters toast their victory as they close in on a resolution . Route to victory: More Libyan rebel soldiers are seen jubilating before heading to the frontline in Bani Walid . Revolutionary forces had initially given tribal leaders and pro-Gaddafi loyalists in Bani Walid until Saturday to surrender, but said they were drawn into fighting on Friday night after former regime fighters attacked with rockets. Volunteers asking to join the battle said today they were getting increasingly impatient with the stand-off. Dozens crowded around a desk at a mosque in Wishtata, a hamlet about 25 miles from Bani Walid, to register their names, blood type and other information. Abdel Wahab Milad, a 26-year-old teacher from the town of Gharyan, drove dozens of miles to the front in a pickup truck with six friends. Dressed in army fatigues, he said he signed up for battle because it was time to ""get rid of Gaddafi once and for all."" Gaddafi has not been seen in public for several months, and has been a fugitive since the fall of the capital of Tripoli in late August. In audio messages broadcast over a loyalist TV station, Gaddafi has urged his followers to keep fighting. On Friday, revolutionary forces also battled loyalists near the Gaddafi hometown of Sirte, 250 miles southeast of Tripoli, but withdrew after heavy casualties. Firepower: Anti-Gaddafi forces fire a Howitzer from the artillery line before advancing into the town of  Bani Walid . War zone: The Al-malti checkpoint on the outskirts of the town of Bani Walid, now held by pro-Gaddafi forces . Meanwhile, officials in neighbouring Niger said four senior Libyan military officers have entered the country. Justice Minister Amadou Morou said late Friday that the Libyan chief of staff of the air force, his pilot and the commanders of two Libyan military regions have arrived in Niger. Morou declined to name the officers. Morou condemned an attempted attack on the Embassy of Niger in Tripoli on Wednesday night by a group of 20 armed men who tried to force their way in. He said the compound is now being offered protection by Libya's National Transitional Council. Libya's new rulers had set a Saturday deadline for Gaddafi loyalists in Bani Walid, Sirte, and Sabha, deep in Libya's southern desert - the three key remaining Gaddafi bastions - to surrender or face an offensive. At the Libyan fighters' checkpoint outside Bani Walid, the spokesman for the revolutionaries, Abu Seif Ghneya, said there was no fighting or casualties overnight but that there would be a final push toward the town centre today. Before the Friday evening assault on Bani Walid, Gaddafi holdouts inside had fired mortars and rockets toward the fighters' position in a desert dotted with green shrubs and white rocks, killing at least one and wounding several. Loud explosions were heard about six miles from the front line during the day, followed by plumes of black smoke in the already hazy air. Nato planes circled above. Nato says it is acting under a UN mandate to guarantee the safety of Libya's civilian population. Its bombing campaign has been crucial to the advance of Gaddafi's military opponents. On Friday, Interpol said it had issued its top most-wanted alert for the arrest of Gaddafi, his son Saif al-Islam and the country's ex-chief of military intelligence, Abdullah al-Senoussi. The three are sought by the International Criminal Court for alleged crimes against humanity, and there have been reports Seif al-Islam is in Bani Walid.",Town of Bani Walid is set to be overturned .
"Metereologists call it a a 'bombogenesis' - a mid-latitude cyclone whose surface barometric pressure drops by 24 or more millibars in a 24-hour period. But the easiest way for the rest of the us to understand it is as winter bomb, and one that is headed for the northeast U.S. from early next week, despite the calendar saying it's spring. Experts say to prepare for a wintry mix of rain and snow from the Carolinas to Maine and into Canada as a mass of cold Arctic air descends over the Northeast and East Coast. Models suggest the storm will rapidly intensify Tuesday night and Wednesday, qualifying as as an 'explosive development' or bombgenesis. According to Alex Sosnowski, a senior meteorologist for AccuWeather.com, the storm is moving from the Gulf of Alaska and will travel southeastward into British Columbia and the northern Rockies over the weekend. On the move: The winter 'bomb', descending south from Canada, is expected to turn eastward early next week, dropping spotty snow, rain and a wintry mix over the central states . Bombs away: Meteorologists say to prepare for a wintry mix of rain and snow from the Carolinas to Maine and into Canada as a mass of cold Arctic air descends over the Northeast and East Coast . The snowstorm already hit Montreal on Saturday. A low pressure system in the area is moving rapidly eastward toward Maine . Springing backwards: A woman in Montreal tries to go for her daily jog on Saturday but is thwarted by snow . Back on the streets: A snowplow is forced back to work in Montreal on Saturday as a low pressure system is moving rapidly eastward to reach the state of Maine this evening . On Tuesday the storm is expected to either slam or shoulder New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and New England. Residents of these areas can expect strong winds and windswept snow Tuesday night and Wednesday. Coastal cities should look out for possible flooding with high tide Wednesday morning. 'The storm will spin up as eastbound disturbances from the Midwest and the Gulf of Mexico interact over the East Coast and Western Atlantic,' according to Weather.com. 'These disturbances, initially relatively weak, are expected to merge into a much more powerful low-pressure system just off the East Coast.' Scary: The sudden storm has been dubbed a 'Nor'easter bomb' The storm may then either slam or graze New Jersey, eastern Pennsylvania, New York and New England with windswept snow and strong winds Tuesday night through Wednesday . A motorist drives along a country road during an early spring snowstorm near Montreal, Saturday, March 22, 2014 . Initially meteorologists said up to six inches of snow could fall, but with the way the storm is moving it is hard to tell. The storm hit Montreal on Saturday and contined to move south toward Maine on Sunday. Experts said the weather patters seemed more January than they did March. Hopefully, they say, it is the last blast of winter for this half of 2014. The snow and big freeze will be accompanied by strong winds that could lead to coastal flooding. As well as creating treacherous driving conditions, the late-season storm is likely to create other hazards. 'Where heavy wet snow falls on areas where trees are budding and blossoming in the South, there is a greater risk of downed tree limbs and power outages with the storm,' AccuWeather's chief operating officer Evan Myers said. On hold: Warmer weather had brought cyclists and joggers back to Lake Michigan in Chicago, but another cold front is due to set in .

"Jon Dolan is a Chelsea fan with a Matthew Harding Lower season ticket and he's has been a regular at Stamford Bridge for more than 40 years. With his team about to make their first major signing of the summer in the form of former Arsenal midfielder Cesc Fabregas, the Blues supporter explains why Chelsea fans won't be welcoming the 27-year-old to Stamford Bridge with open arms. Here we go again. Only 12 months after the relief of getting rid of Rafa Benitez, the faithful at Stamford Bridge are being asked to warm to his on-field equivalent… Cesc Fabregas. Some hope. Try to think of a more unpopular current player for a Chelsea fan and you are struggling. Controversy: Cesc Fabregas hasn't been a popular figure amongst Chelsea fans . Incident: John Terry (centre) is kicked in the face by Arsenal's Abou Diaby while Fabregas complains about a piece of celery thrown onto the pitch . Up for a fight: Fabregas (right) gets to grips with Frank Lampard during Chelsea Carling Cup Final win in 2007 . Obviously there is Samir Nasri - you just have to look at him to be wound up - and Luis Suarez combines being objectionable with actually playing for Liverpool. But Uruguay’s finest is generally hopeless when he faces Chelsea. No, Fabregas is the one. He has more previous than Benitez, who stoked the rivalry between Stamford Bridge and Anfield and will never be forgiven for his plastic flag taunts. Even winning the Europa League as ‘interim’ manager when he replaced cult hero Roberto Di Matteo was not enough. Rival: Jack Wilshere revealed Lampard and Fabregas didn't like each other on the pitch . Big shoes to fill: Fabregas has his work cut out if he is to emulate Lampard's historic career at Chelsea . It started in 2007 at the Millennium Stadium during the Carling Cup Final against Arsenal. This was the one where John Terry took a kick in the face and ended up in hospital but precious little Cesc was more interested in complaining to the referee about some harmless celery throwing when he was taking a corner. Then, as Frank Lampard attempted to calm down a brawl which led to three sendings off, the chippy Spaniard grabbed hold of him around the neck, starting a long-running feud. Dislike: John Terry (right) squares up to the Chelsea-bound midfielder during a Premier League match in 2007 . Lampard is a proper legend, rightly revered throughout the game, but pictures of him facing Fabregas in games against Arsenal and Barcelona show the two squaring up. In 2012, before the Chelsea vs Barcelona Champions League semi-final Jack Wilshere gave an insight into his former team-mate on twitter. ‘I think Cesc would love to score tonight ... him and Lampard never liked each other on the pitch,’ tweeted Jack. Well Fabregas didn’t get a goal or a win… and Frank was able to lead Chelsea to the trophy in Munich a couple of weeks later. Upset: Chelsea fans were forced to welcome former Liverpool boss Rafael Benitez to their club in 2012 . Get him out: The Blues fans were less than impressed with the temporary appointment . Fabregas must have something against Chelsea heroes because he was at it with Jose Mourinho in the season just ended. Jose made a perfectly reasonable remark about Barcelona not being up to much this season and was told to shut up and mind his own business by the soon-to-be-former Nou Camp star. Still, it seems Jose is too big to hold grudges and Fabregas is on his way to the centre of Chelsea’s midfield. Of course, there is a significant hole to fill there… but for the sake of our sanity don’t even think of giving Super Frank’s No 8 shirt to Cesc the Pest. Gone, but not forgotten: Lampard revealed he will leave Chelsea when his contract is up on July 1 . Nearly done: Jose Mourinho looks set to wrap up the signing of Fabregas before the World Cup .","Cesc Fabregas isn't a popular figure amongst Chelsea fans .

"Despite controversy sparked when 18 Again lotion hit shelves in India, first of its kind vagina was launched in Thailand . Advert shows woman complaining of dark vaginal area . A vaginal whitening wash that promises to make your private area 'safely fairer within four weeks' has hit the beauty market in Thailand. The latest product, called Lactacyd White Intimate, comes after huge controversy was sparked when 18 Again- an Indian pharmaceutical 'vaginal . tightening and rejuvenating cream' came onto the market earlier this year. The latest product's advert, which is online, on TV and on radio, shows an attractive, fair-skinned young woman complaining about how tight shorts can leave skin looking darker. Scroll down for video . The new advert shows a girl parading around in white shorts to advertise the new vagina whitening product . The latest product has been released despite controversy over India's 18 Again vagina tightener . She then waltzes off in a tiny pair of white shorts as a voice-over states that the product can help skin become 'bright and translucent'. In a country where fair skin is synonymous with success, skin and body hair whitening products are readily available - and the industry is expected to reap $2bn this year alone- but this is the first vaginal whitening wash to hit the shelves. When 18 Again hit the shelves in India, not only did women voice the opinion . on Twitter that 18 Again was created by Ultratech purely to cash in on . female insecurities, but many criticised the accompanying TV . advert. The awkward commercial, set in an . extended family household, involves a woman dancing around the internal . courtyard with her husband. She repeatedly sings lines borrowed and from Madonna's Like A Virgin (but given a Bollywood makeover),  including 'ooh, I feel . like a virgin' and 'it feels like the first time'. The advert for 18 Again involves a woman dancing seductively around her husband, repeatedly singing the line 'Ooh, I feel like a virgin' At the end of the advert an elderly couple are seen using a computer, inferring that they are ordering some cream top spice up their own sex lives . Her husband grabs her waist and warbles 'oh, yes it's true' while an elderly couple of parents look on, seemingly aghast. The . film ends with a shot of the product, then a clip of the intrigued . elderly couple apparently using the internet to order some of the cream . for themselves. Rishi Bhatia, chairman and managing director of Ultratech India, said: '18 Again is a first-of-its-kind product for women in India. 'This . product is being launched in India post clinical trials conducted . among women of all age groups under dermatological control. '18 Again . has the power and the potential to break the shackles and redefine the . meaning of women empowerment altogether.'","Despite controversy sparked when 18 Again lotion hit shelves in India, first of its kind vagina was launched in Thailand .

"A Nigerian groom has been jailed for 12 months for a sham marriage where he picked Celine Dion’s song 'The first time ever I saw your face' to march down the aisle. Hull University masters student Jayeola Abiola, 29, needed to marry to stay in the UK, and paid Portuguese Vania Pinheiro-Fernandes, 29, to be his bride. They met for the first time at their dress rehearsal and he stumbled to pronounce her name. Vania Pinheiro-Fernandes (right) bought her dress, tiara, wedding veil, and flowers from British Home Stores in Leeds for £245 with the groom, Jayeola Abiola (left) watching . Vania Pinheiro-Fernandes (far right) at a BHS store in Leeds in November last year when the defendants purchased a wedding dress . So when it came to the big day he ordered: 'The first time ever I saw your face' as the soft love tune to be blasted out on loud speakers in Hull’s Guildhall to cement their bogus life together. Vania Pinheiro-Fernandes bought her dress, tiara, wedding veil, and flowers from British Home Stores in Leeds for £245 with the groom watching, Hull Crown Court heard. She had bought the dress two hours before the ceremony and still had 60 miles to drive down the M62. Leeds . law student Ayodeji Abbis, 25, was paid £1,000 to act as the best man. He was one of six people who turned up for the ceremony. Officers of the UK Border Agency had been tipped off by the Hull Registrar that the couple seemed to barely know each other when they were interviewed at the rehearsal . But the wedding plans turn sour. Officers of the UK Border Agency had been tipped off by the Hull Registrar that the couple seemed to barely know each other when they were interviewed at the rehearsal. So Border Agency secretly filmed a wedding video of the cars, groom, bride and best man arriving outside the grand 19th century council town hall before arresting them at the door. Jailing the bride and groom today at Hull Crown Court Gurdial Singh said: 'It is often said sham marriages are too prevalent and strike at the heart of the immigration system. 'Deterrent sentenced are called for and custodial sentences are inevitable. 'You Abiola were in danger of becoming unable to stay in this country. It was ultimately a sham marriage and you were prepared to pay for it. 'It was not a question of family and friends wishing to indulge love, to do you a favour. 'You Pinheiro-Fernandes played your part and were to be the bride. You went along with this and bought the dress turning up at the ceremony.' He said Pinheiro-Fernandes, a former air-steward, should be jailed for eight months because she played a lesser roll. Abiola, 29, of Hull, and . Pinheiro-Fernandes, 29, of Park Hotel Manchester, appeared for sentence . after pleading guilty to conspiracy to breach immigration law by . arranging a marriage so Abiola could remain in the UK. The marriage was to cost £5,000. Around £2,500 was paid in advance and the rest was to be paid on completion. Crown . barrister David Bradshaw said Jayeole Abiola was a Nigerian student in . Hull and his visa was due to expire a few days after the marriage. Knowing his visa was due to expire he paid Abiola Kumoye to arrange a . sham marriage. Portugal being a member state of the EU entitled him to . citizenship. Abiola Kumoye (right) has pleaded guilty to conspiracy to breach immigration law acquiring criminal property while Ayodeji Abbis (left) was found guilty of the conspiracy . 'It was fake because he did not know her,' said Mr Bradshaw. 'He was not in love with her. He didn’t want to set up a loving family unit. He did it because he wanted to stay in the UK. The bride and the organizers stood to gain because they were being paid for their services.' He said the Registrar Callum McDonald first became suspicious of the marriage at a meeting into the Wilson Centre in Hull on October 16. It was to be a formal check of birth . certificates, documents, passport, immigration documents and opportunity . to pay the deposit. 'The groom gave his proper name, but the bride gave a fake name when they spoke to the registrar,' said Mr Bradshaw. 'The bride did not want to be married in . her real name. The registrar was suspicious because the bride didn’t . look like her picture in the passport. He asked them both some . questions. They were not very convincing in their answers.' 'The song to be played first was Celine Dion's 'The first time ever I saw your face'. It was quite apt.' He said they filled out a Registrar’s choice form giving details of music and readings for the ceremony. 'There was to be music for the bride to walk into,' said Mr Bradshaw. 'The song to be played first was Celine Dion’s: 'The First Time ever I saw your face. It was quite apt.' A poem was to be read by Mr Abbis. There was music for signing the register and music for leaving the room to. Recorder Singh adjourned sentence for a report on marriage fixer Abiola Kumoye, 34, of Manchester. He has pleaded guilty to conspiracy to breach immigration law acquiring criminal property £2,650 the first part of the fee for the sham marriage. The judge also adjourned sentence on best man Ayodeji Abbis, 25, of Hunslet, who was found guilty of the conspiracy and received £1,000 for his trouble. Det Sgt Andy Norris of the UK Border Agency said sham marriages have grown considerably in the country but the problem has only recently come to light in Hull. 'People who think they can use Hull in this way will need to think again. 'We are working to tackle this problem head on. We will find and arrest anyone carrying out these crimes, no matter where they are in the country.' Mr Norris said there are benefits to all parties involved with arranging these scams. 'A lot of sham marriages are arranged to allow people to stay in the country legally and that is the major reason people try to arrange these and why people are willing to act illegally to do so,' he said. 'Criminals who organise these fake weddings do so for a monetary benefit, sometimes thousands of pounds, and our worries are that the money raised from this could be used to possibly fund other areas of crime. 'Fake passports and documentation are used to try and pull the wool over the authority’s eyes. 'They often involve non-EU citizens who seek illegal assistance to get married in order to stay in this country.'

"A young father horrified by the number of babies left alone in hot cars has invented a device to alert parents if they forget to take their child with them. Matthew Sheets, 26, has designed a weight-activated seat sensor which notifies a parent's mobile phone when their child is still in their baby seat. The alert appears on their phone once they step outside of a 20ft (6 metres) radius from the baby seat if they've forgotten to take their child out of its seat. Scroll down for video . The small Starfish sensor is 1.5 inches (3.8cm) round and as thick as a few coins. It will cost £36 ($60) What's more, if they haven't noticed the notification on their phone, the device - called Starfish - will then tell their emergency contacts within five minutes. The small sensor - just 1.5 inches (3.8cm) round and as thick as a few coins, will cost £36 ($60) when its Kickstarter crowd funding campaign ends in September. Mr Sheets, founder of Studio Whale who made the device, became a father to Henry for the first time just over four months ago. He said: 'On average, one child dies in a hot car every nine days in the United States. With Starfish, we aim to make that number zero. The Starfish gadget  was created by Matthew Sheets, 26, who is a father of a four-month-year-old (pictured) When activated, Starfish creates a 'geo-fence' around itself and sends a notification to the parent's phone . 'As a new father, hearing the news of yet another infant losing his life in a hot car horrified me. 'I asked myself, 'How? Why? What can be done?' Starfish is a weight-activated seat sensor that notifies a smartphone when someone has left their car - without their child. The device, which sticks to a child's seat, automatically pairs to the parents iPhone or Android phone using Bluetooth. It then sends a notification that the child is in his or her seat. When activated, Starfish then creates a 'geo-fence' radius around itself. If the phone leaves the 'geo-fenced' area - which is around 20ft (6 metres) - Starfish will automatically notify the parent that their child may be in danger. Starfish can also notify an emergency contacts the parent doesn't respond to the notification after five minutes. 'The search for answers prompted me to start developing a device that could easily prevent these tragedies from happening. That device is Starfish.' Mr Sheets, who lives in Birmingham in Alabama, with wife Jessica, 25, called it Starfish because of the way it will stick inside a child's seat. He expects to be able to ship the product in December, which will work on both Apple and Android smartphones via bluetooth. He added: 'When you place your child on the Starfish device, it automatically pairs with your smartphone, sending you a notification that your child is in his or her seat. 'When activated, Starfish then creates a 'geo-fence' radius around itself. 'If you leave the ""geo-fenced"" area, around 20ft (6 metres), Starfish will automatically notify you that your child may be in danger. 'For me, this technology is all about saving lives. Starfish is a simple way to prevent these tragedies from happening. 'With enough support, we will enter production by October, and have plans to ship units by November and first runs by December.'

"Violent crime in Britain has fallen by a quarter in the past decade, according to a study. The UK has experienced a ‘substantial and sustained’ fall in offences ranging from drunken thuggery to murder since 2003, the report suggests. And official statistics show violent crime is now at its lowest level for 30 years. The UK Peace Index study, published yesterday, also identifies the villages and towns across the country where crime is at its lowest, and the urban centres where it is still rampant. Crime around the UK: This map shows that the most peaceful areas of Britain are in the English countryside, with violence clustered around London and other major cities as well as in Northern Ireland . Fall: This graph shows how violent crime has tumbled in recent years after spiking between 2002 and 2005 . Falling crime: Statistics from Eurostat, the European agency, show violent crime in Britain is falling faster than anywhere else . 1) UK (Scotland): from 27,618 in 2006 to 21,632 in 2009; -22% change . 2) UK (England & Wales): 1,205,065 to 1,001,322; -17% . 3) Italy: 145,209 to 131,610; -9% . 4) UK (Northern Ireland): 35,223 to 33,100; -6% . 5) Netherlands: 131,388 to 126,770; -4% . 6) Germany: 215,471 to 208,446; -3% . 7) Austria: 135,121 to 134,142; -1% . 8) Spain: 114,205 to 112,926; -1% . 9) Portugal: 24,157 to 24,421; +1% . 10) Finland: 38,037 to 39,595; +4% . 11) France: 326,065 to 341,942; +5% . 12) Belgium: 107,369 to 115,019; +7% . 13) Sweden: 98,154 to 111,702; +14% . 14) Luxembourg: 2,471 to 3,264; +32% . 15) Denmark: 19,670 to 26,320; +34% . Source: Eurostat; each EU country uses a different definition of violent crime. Broadland in Norfolk was identified as . the most peaceful council borough in England and Wales. It contains . three market towns and covers part of the Norfolk Broads. Although it has a population of around . 125,000, only eight violent crimes were recorded in 2012. The most . dangerous place to live is Lewisham in South London where more than 400 . violent crimes are carried out every month, and the other boroughs in . the least peaceful five are also in inner London. In a comparison of urban areas, . Glasgow was identified as the city in the UK with the worst crime rate . followed by London and Belfast. Glasgow’s murder rate is double the . national average. The study was compiled from Home . Office statistics by the Institute for Economics and Peace, a think . tank. It found that the homicide rate – which includes murders and other . killings – has halved in a decade. Overall, the violent crime rate was . down by a quarter, from 1,255 crimes for every 100,000 people a decade . ago to 933 last year. Crime in England and Wales fell at a . faster rate than the European average over that period, with eight in . ten of local council areas experiencing a drop of at least 10 per cent. Change: These graphs show how nearly every form of unrest has become less common in most areas of the country, although the red bars show that public disorder has risen in the majority of places . Capital: While London remains more violent than most other areas, as shown by the high violence indicated in the left-hand map, the green areas on the right-hand map shows that the unrest is decreasing . League table: The most and least peaceful areas of the UK, based on relative scores determined by a number of factors related to social unrest . In the UK, the only category of crime to increase sharply over the last decade was drug offences. The report said changes in police . practices, an ageing population, a fall in alcohol consumption and the . introduction of the minimum wage were likely causes. It also acknowledged a ‘close . correlation’ between levels of violence and social breakdown, such as . single parent households and high teenage pregnancy rates. But the authors dismissed the impact . of more criminals being locked up. In the ten years since 2003 the . prison population has increased by more than 7,000. Some experts said, however, that the . report was wrong to dismiss the effect of prison. Peter Cuthbertson, of . campaign group the Centre for Crime Prevention, said: ‘Crime is much . lower than 20 years ago because twice as many criminals are in prison. ‘But the UK is still a high crime . society and people are right to worry about this. Trends: Drug offences are the only type of non-violent crime to have become more common since 2003 . Variation: Scotland and London are the most dangerous regions, as this map shows, with the South the least . A better police . presence on the streets has been shown both to cut crime and to improve . people’s perceptions of crime rates.’ Dr David Green, director of the . Civitas think tank, said a recession was often linked with lower violent . crime because people had less money to spend. This meant alcohol consumption went down with the result that people were less likely to get into fights. But a recent report revealed that 80 per cent of the public think anti-social behaviour is on the rise. Statisticians have also accused police . of exaggerating falls in crime by downgrading crimes. The ONS found . officers were under ‘informal pressure’ to meet crime reduction targets. The falls in crime figures in recent years have come despite cuts to police funding and officer numbers. They have boosted the argument made by . Home Office ministers that police can find efficiency savings and . protect the front line while making essential spending cuts. Homicide: The rate of murder and manslaughter in all areas of the UK is far lower than in the U.S. Leading the pack: The UK's violent crime rate has been falling faster than the rest of Western Europe . Technology: Advances such as CCTV, DNA profiling and better burglar alarms have helped to deter criminals. Drinking less: Alcohol consumption has fallen in the past decade, leading to a reduction in street brawls and late-night attacks. Fewer young people: Demographics are often linked to crime rates as countries with a high youth population tend to be more violent. Government policy: The introduction of the minimum wage and the raising of the school leaving age kept the poor and the young off the streets. The internet: One theory suggests that when people are able to communicate globally, they impose stronger taboos on violent crime because they are exposed to the judgement of others. Ban on lead: Leaded petrol and lead-based paints seem to have affected people's behaviour and made them more likely to commit crimes. Abortion laws: A controversial study has suggested that the legalisation of abortion in the U.S. helped lower crime rates. Idyllic: Broadland, in Norfolk, is the most peaceful area in the UK with just eight weapons crimes last year . Contrast: The London borough of Lewisham has been named the most violent place in Britain - its murder rate is two and a half the UK national average . Global scale: Western Europe is extremely peaceful compared to most other regions of the world . Within Europe: The UK has fewer homicides than any other European country except Monaco . The UK Peace Index is based on a combination of five factors - the rate of homicide, violent crime, weapons crime and public disorder, and the number of police officers, all drawn from Home Office statistics. Homicide and violent crime are given greater weighting in the calculation as they are considered most damaging to the general peace - each makes up 26.7 per cent of the score. Police numbers account for 20 per cent of the final rating, with weapons crime and public disorder accounting for 13.3 per cent each. Combining the five measures creates an artificial number between one and five for each region which allows all areas of the UK to be directly compared with each other for their overall levels of violence. Anyone listening to Radio 4’s Today programme yesterday morning was presented with a long list of possible reasons why crime in the UK is falling. Among the more credible answers raised were new police technology, the national DNA database and CCTV. We were also told, more questionably, that it was possible the real reason was the rise of the internet, the removal of lead from petrol and even ‘a new morality’ taking hold across the Western World. The discussion summarised perfectly what many commentators have always recognised: the Left is desperate to find some reason other than prison to explain why crime is going down. A barely passing mention was given to what many criminologists regard as the most likely cause of the falling crime rate: the sharp rise in the prison population over the past two decades. Since the mid-1990s, when Michael Howard instituted his ‘prison works’ policy, the number behind bars in England and Wales has shot up, and remained high. Then, it stood at just over 40,000. Now it is more than double that and regularly tops 84,000. At the same time, crime has fallen markedly. The British Crime Survey found it declined by 46 per cent between 1995 and 2008/09. The authors of yesterday’s report, the little known Institute for Economics and Peace, were dismissive of such a link. But the evidence for ‘prison works’ is compelling. Take one recent study by academics in the Netherlands, where politicians took a zero-tolerance approach to prolific offenders. Drug addicts caught repeatedly stealing from homes or cars were jailed for two years instead of the usual community sentence or three months behind bars. On average, each already had more than 30 convictions; some as many as 300. The results were overwhelming: crime fell by 25 per cent. In cities which locked up the most criminals, it fell by up to 40 per cent. Like the Netherlands, this country has a small band of repeat offenders. More than 100,000 have at least 15 convictions and the worst repeat offenders are responsible for a third of all crimes. The other thing missing from yesterday’s discussion was any mention of victims. For them, even short jail sentences work, by giving them relief from their attacker. What the Left can’t see is obvious to victims of crime: when you lock criminals up for lengthy periods, they can’t do you harm.","UK murder rate has fallen by half since 2003 and every region is safer .

"The original calfskin Domesday Book has survived for over 900 years, considerably longer than a mirror project by the BBC launched in 1986 on laser discs. The corporation’s aim was to celebrate the 900th anniversary of the book with a modern-day version using quotes, maps and videos - but the discs just didn’t take off and within 10 years the equipment that could read it was obsolete. Now the whole project has been rebooted, with the Domesday Project loaded onto a computer with a 52in touch-screen that’s on display at The National Museum of Computing at Bletchley Park. Slick: The new BBC Domesday multi-media Touchtable at The National Museum of Computing . The book was commissioned in December 1085 by William the Conqueror. He had taken England by force in 1066 and wanted to know precisely what his spoils of war were. The finished tome contained records of no less than 13,418 English settlements. The BBC’s project in 1986 was welcomed by historians as like the original, it would provide a handy insight into life in 1986 - but market forces consigned it to history. Living history: Domesday Touchtable can be viewed by several people at once and provides a snapshot of life in 1986 and 2011 . To view the discs you needed to put an Acorn BBC Master computer, an SCSI controller and a Philips VP415 Domesday laserdisc player on your shopping list. None of this equipment endured the test of time, so the BBC set about finding alternative hardware to do the job. Luckily, a joint U.S-UK project called CAMilEON (Creative Archiving at Michigan & Leeds: Emulating the Old on the New) saved the corporation’s blushes. Out with the old: The clunky equipment needed in 1986 to view the BBC Domesday Project . Researchers emulated a BBC Micro and the laser disc player and extracted the BBC’s data in a form that could be easily transferred to 2011 technology. In April this year Domesday Reloaded was launched which saw extra information and observations about life in 2011 added to the original documents and loaded onto the touch-screen device. Called the Domesday Touchtable, it contains 50GB of information and can be browsed by four different people at the same time. Test of time: The original Domesday Book was written in 1086 . Peter Armstrong was the team leader from the original project and contributed to Reloaded. He told the BBC: ‘I think it's amazing. We're very very pleased. It's taken us a generation - 25 years later. A new generation of programmers made this happen.' The exhibition at The National Museum of Computing Bletchley Park opened yesterday. Key data from the Domesday Book has been available online since 2004, while the original book is kept under lock and key at the The National Archives in Kew, London.",Original Domesday Book is over 900 years old - the BBC's version lasted 10 years .
"From their unusual ‘rippling’ legs to fiendish fangs, spiders strike terror into many people. But arachnophobes may now have another reason to reach for a glass to trap their nemeses because baby spiders - or spiderlings -  have been caught on camera ‘exploding’ from the back of their mother. The bizarre defence mechanism was filmed by Mathew Duncan, of Chula Vista, California, when he captured two three adult spiders in a jar. Scroll down for video . The bizarre 'defence mechanism' was filmed when Mathew Duncan, of Chula Vista, California, when he captured two adult spiders in a jar. Here, you can make out the female beneath the aggressor spider (bottom), while her babies scuttle away after 'jumping' from her back . One spider is shown to scuttle aggressively towards the female before flipping her over and grabbing hold of her. As the fight begins, the female appears to eject her babies from her back, showering them across the jar. While it may be tempting to think that she has summoned a miniature army to defend her, one expert thinks that the aggressor may have simply torn the sac, which females carry developing spiderlings in on their backs. Another theory is that the mother was giving her brood the best chance of survival when she was under threat, by releasing them out into the world. But it appears it is the spiderlings that have made the 'decision,' not her. Dr Judith Lock, an expert in behavioural ecology at the University of Southampton, told MailOnline that it looks as if the spiderlings jumped off their mother's backs when she was under threat. Stuart Hine, Centre Manager, Identification & Advisory Service at the Natural History Museum in London, told MailOnline: 'What we have is one spider species attacking another, which is always likely if they are put in an enclosed space like this. 'I cannot make out what the attacking species is, other than it is a male – as can be determined by its swollen palps. 'The smaller and ‘attacked’ spider is probably a species of Pardosa (Araneae: Lycosidae) and she is carrying her brood on her ‘back’. 'This is typical behaviour of the family Lycosidae, the females carry their egg cocoons around with them and when they hatch,  the young spiderlings crawl onto her abdomen where they are afforded protection and maternal care – including a share of her food. 'It all goes wrong though if she is attacked by a predator herself, in which case they simply disperse as in this video – they are probably old enough to fend for themselves providing they were released. 'In the animal world most mothers will stoically attempt to protect their offspring from attack. However in most species their own survival instinct ultimately overrules the maternal instinct and their own survival becomes paramount.' One spider is shown to scuttle aggressively towards the female before seemingly grabbing hold of her (pictured bottom). It is not clear whether the larger spider tears the female's egg sac, whether she deliberately unleashes the tiny spiders in defence, or if, as one expert suggests, the spiderlings escape voluntarily . Some spiders are better mothers than others. Female wolf spiders carry their spiderlings on their backs (pictured) when they have hatched and are among very few species of spiders to do this . An army of green-fanged cannibal spiders is invading Britain - eating smaller arachnids as they set up nests in homes across the country. The eight-legged creatures are believed to be tube spiders - one of the largest types in the UK - and their bite is like a bee sting. Their thick black bodies range from between 1.5cm to 2.2cm wide, their fangs shine menacingly green, and they are known to eat their own mothers. Mike Rance first spotted the eight-legged beast when he was outside his friend's house in Newport, South Wales. Mr Rance, 41 from Cwmbran, said: 'I spotted this one on the wall and shined a light on to it and could see its fangs. 'It was devouring another smaller spider – they're proper little cannibals. 'We tried to feed it a woodlouse but it wasn't interested. 'They only seemed to want to eat smaller ones, I guess they must be easier prey.' A vet confirmed that one of the spiders, which had been captured, was a tube spider. A few species of spiders allow their offspring to ride on their backs while they are small. This gives them a better chance of not being eaten. 'The agressor spider flips the mother over. Perhaps the spiderlings recognise a chance in orientation and that's when the jump off,' Dr Lock said. Craig Walker, arachnid expert at ZSL London Zoo agrees. 'As the footage is so blurry it does give the impression that she explodes, but of course she is just carrying her brood on her abdomen as do many species of “nomadic” spiders, such as wolf spiders for instance. 'When she is attacked they simply jump off & run for cover. 'Other inverts that carry their young on their backs include scorpions.' An invertebrate keeper at Bristol Zoo Gardens added: 'The babies scattering is their best chance of survival- not likely to be causing a distraction or an attack. Maternal care methods vary greatly in the world of spiders.' Mr Duncan said he had ‘no idea’ that when he trapped the spiders, one of them was carrying babies on her back. ‘So I'm glad I caught it and fed it to the other before I had 20-30 spiders disperse in my home. I would love to know what type of spiders these two are,’ he told The Mirror. If the spider was using a defense mechanism in a bid to ward off her attacker, her ‘explosion’ of babies is not the only strange defence mechanism unleashed in the natural world. The hairy frog - also known as the horror frog - breaks its own tow bones when under threat so they stick out through its skin and act as claws. Likewise, the Iberian ribbed newt pushes its own rib bones through its skin, before secreting poison through the holes created. Insects such as the Malaysian ant have poisonous glands which explode when they are threatened, shooting the deadly liquid towards aggressors. The potato beetle eats poisonous plants to cover itself in toxic faeces, while Cereal leaf beetles encase their poo in a jelly sac, which they carry on their back as protection. Many creatures have usual defence mechanisms including the cereal leaf beetle (pictured) which encases its poisonous poo in a jelly sac, which it then carries on its back as protection against being eaten .","The spider attack was filmed in by Matthew Duncan in Chula Vista, California .

"Former professional football player turned actor Terry Crews has said the NFL is 'really like a cult' during a recent interview talking about how former players took medications provided by team doctors without being told the long-term effects. 'The NFL is a cult, because you’ve been looking at this motto and this logo for your whole life and you believe in it and you’re like ""They wouldn’t do anything to hurt me. They never would.""’ Crews told SI Now. 'And, uh oh, maybe they would.” Crews comments come as yet another lawsuit was filed by former players on Tuesday who accuse the league of providing painkillers and other drugs, allowing the players to continue in games despite inuries, without disclosing the fact the medications can cause complications in the future. Football player turned actor Terry Crews claims the NFL 'is a cult' in a recent interview. He made the comments as a lawsuit was filed Tuesday by more than 600 former players who accuse the league of giving out painkillers and drugs to players without disclosing the long-term effects . Crews currently plays Detective Sergeant Terence 'Terry' Jeffords on the sitcom 'Brooklyn Nine-Nine.' He says that players took the drugs without questioning because they wanted to do anything to prolong their careers . Crews in the new movie 'Blended,'  playing the character Nickens, who fancies himself 'the South African Tom Jones' On Tuesday, the NFL was hit with another lawsuit from former players who accused the league of providing painkillers and other drugs that would allow the players to remain in the game and avoid missing any time, but led to serious complications later in life. More than 600 players have joined the suit. It claims that doctors and trainers gave out the drugs without a prescription and without warning of side effects. The lawsuit also says that the drugs were given in combinations as 'cocktails.' 'The stuff works,' Jeremy Newberry, who played most of his career for the San Francisco 49ers before retiring in 2009, told The Associated Press. 'It works like crazy. It really does.' Crews' brief NFL career included playing for the Los Angeles Rams, San Diego Chargers, Washington Redskins and Philadelphia Eagles . Newberry, who is part of the suit, says that because of the drugs he took while playing, he suffers from kidney failure, high blood pressure and violent headaches. Crews said that when you spend your life working toward a goal, you will do everything you possibly can to keep that goal alive. As a result, you might follow what others tell you if you think it will benefit your career, he noted. 'When you give your life over to something like that and give your total trust into something like that, it will always disappoint you,' Crews added. Crews had a relatively short career playing for the Los Angeles Rams, San Diego Chargers, Washington Redskins and Philadelphia Eagles. He currently plays Detective Sergeant Terence 'Terry' Jeffords on the sitcom 'Brooklyn Nine-Nine.' He is featured in the movie 'Blended' that opened today.

"Shafilea Ahmed's decomposed remains were discovered in Cumbria in 2004 and her parents are now on trial for her murder . A second sister of Shafilea Ahmed wrote an account of the teenager being murdered by their strict Muslim parents, a court heard yesterday. But Mevish Ahmed, 21, told the jury that the scenes she described were works of fiction and insisted the couple had not killed her. The trial of Iftikhar Ahmed, 52, and his wife Farzana, 49, has already heard from their second child, Alesha, that they hit Shafilea and then suffocated her with a plastic bag in front of the other children. The alleged attack, said to have happened in 2003 when Shafilea was 17, began after a row over a revealing outfit she wore to her part-time job and followed months of clashes over her lifestyle, Alesha claimed. Yesterday the jury was told that since the case began last month, police had been given diary entries and letters written by the Ahmeds’ third daughter. Mevish, who was 12 at the time of Shafilea’s disappearance, has accompanied her parents into court along with her younger brother, Junyade. The accounts were written by Mevish in 2008 and given to a friend, Shahin Munir, Chester Crown Court heard. Prosecutor Andrew Edis suggested that if the documents had a title, it would be: ‘How my parents killed my sister.’ In one extract, Mevish says: ‘Three times she ran but they got her.’ A second extract read to the court included the sentences: ‘She didn’t do nothing. Shouting, time after time. What did she do? ‘That’s it, space of one to two minutes – gone.’ Alesha, the chief prosecution witness, has told the jury that Shafilea repeatedly ran away from home to escape the violence she claims their parents meted out. On trial: Iftikhar Ahmed, left, and Farzana Ahmed, right, are alleged to have killed their 17-year-old daughter because she refused to obey them . She also told how in September 2003 . her parents pushed Shafilea on to the settee in their house in . Warrington, Cheshire. The couple then forced a plastic bag into the . teenager’s mouth and suffocated her in front of the other children, she . said. Alesha told of watching the couple . sorting through bin bags and rolls of tape after the alleged killing – . before seeing her father leave the house carrying a dark package. Mr Edis suggested to Mevish that her writings ‘look like an allegation of murder against your parents’. But she replied: ‘No, it is not based on me or my family. It is just chat – just random stuff.’ She also described her writings as ‘just a story’ and added: ‘I used the names but that doesn’t mean it is about us.’ Family home: The Ahmeds lived in this house in Warrington, Cheshire. Shafilea's remains were discovered in Cumbria in 2004 . Mevish met Miss Munir in a park in . August 2008 – when she had a drug problem – the court heard. Miss Munir . wrote a record of what she said Mevish told her. This was read to the . jury. It began: ‘They sat her down in a chair and her Dad went mad. ‘He started proper hitting her. Mevish tried to stop it but her Mum pushed her away. ‘They used the plastic bag to suffocate her and one or two minutes, she was gone.’ Mevish insisted to the court the account was fiction or ‘free writing’. She admitted asking Miss Munir to return the documents but said her friend had kept photocopies. Earlier she denied witnessing her parents killing her sister. On May 24, Miss Munir told Miss Ahmed in a text she ‘just wanted to do the right thing’. Miss Ahmed replied: ‘And you are doing. It’s not like you’re lying.’ Mr Edis accused the witness of trying . to ‘suppress the truth’ and she replied: ‘It’s nothing to do with a . cover-up. I’m not saying that at all.’ In a further exchange that day, Miss . Munir said: ‘You know what, Mev, if I didn’t care about you I wouldn’t . have given it a second thought and have done it.’ On May 29 Miss Munir sent a text to Miss Ahmed saying: ‘Please, please ring me, okay please.’ A second text which followed said: ‘I’m sorry okay, really, really sorry.’ Mr Edis said that was the first contact between the pair after Miss Munir spoke to police. She was interviewed by officers that afternoon but did not sign the witness statement, the court heard. There followed four phone calls between them totalling 74 minutes. Questioned about that conversation, . Miss Ahmed said: ‘I’m not going to say I can remember the full . conversation because I can’t.’ Mr Edis said: ‘Most people would be able to give the jury an account of a conversation which was as recent as this.’ She replied: ‘She kept saying she was sorry. She was upset, she said she had given the police my writing.’ The barrister asked Miss Ahmed for her response, to which she said: ‘Nothing really. ‘It wasn’t my concern.’ Mr Edis said: ‘She must have done something.’ The following day, Miss Ahmed said in a text to her friend: ‘Well, you need to go and tell them that you lied.’ Miss Munir replied: ‘I can’t get done for it.’ Miss Ahmed responded: ‘Not really. If you had signed, yes you could. But you didn’t.’ Later, Miss Munir told Miss Ahmed: ‘I can’t go back on it.’ Later the court was told about a . conversation between the two friends in December 2008 in which the . prosecution say Miss Ahmed told Miss Munir about the ‘humiliation’ she . would suffer at the hands of her mother when she was angry. Mr Edis said she was ‘very . embarrassed’ about it and said she told her friend how she was taken . into a room and the door was locked. Mr Edis said: ‘You used to keep your . eyes closed because you didn’t want it to happen and your mother would . humiliate you to teach you a lesson... you told Shahin that she used to . touch you in places where you did not want to be touched.’ He said she was also verbally abused at the same time. Miss Ahmed responded: ‘No. My mother . never touched me in places I didn’t want to be touched. My mother didn’t . verbally abuse me.’ She said her mother would just shout at her when she was angry. Mr Edis added: ‘You saw your mother and father kill your sister.’ She responded: ‘No. I didn’t, no.’ Shafilea was murdered because her . parents believed her ‘Westernised’ lifestyle was bringing shame on the . family, the prosecution say. Her remains were found in Cumbria in . February 2004, but it was not until 2010 that Alesha gave her account to . the police. Mr and Mrs Ahmed deny murder. The jury was sent home and the trial will resume tomorrow at 10am.

"A newlywed who killed his wife after strangling her and beating her around the head with an industrial hammer in a row over decorating, has been jailed for just seven and a half years. Thomas Crompton, 39, was found guilty of manslaughter after he brutally killed his 34-year-old wife of three months, Angela, on June 11. His wife's family, who have asked for her to be referred to as Angela Phillips, have blasted the length of sentence saying he will be walking the streets again in just three years. The argument began because Ms Phillips had cleared Crompton's belongings away ready to decorate their house at Arminghall, near Norwich. When metal sculptor Crompton got home from work he 'lost it' because he was concerned his items could have be damaged. A blazing row broke out and witnesses could hear crockery being smashed. Crompton was found guilty of manslaughter for killing 'vivacious' Angela after three months of marriage . Father-of-two Crompton attempted to strangle his wife before attacking her with the hammer, hitting her around the head a number of times. When he returned to the workshop he confessed what he had done to his co-worker Bjorn Fiskvatn, and said: 'That’s it. I’ve killed her' Mr Fiskvatn rushed to the house and found Ms Phillips on the floor of the dining room, where she was still breathing. The mother-of-three young children was taken to the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital before being moved to Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge, but died two days later from her head injuries. A post mortem found Angela had suffered significant brain damage and 'non-survivable' head injuries. Crompton had always admitted killing his wife and was cleared of murder following a trial at Norwich Crown Court, but was convicted of her manslaughter. Compton Judge Peter Jacobs said: 'The type of injuries she received could not have been survived by anyone.' However he accepted that Crompton was of previous exemplary character and had tried to help his wife in the past with her problems. The family of Ms Phillips said: 'We have lost a daughter, sister, mother and aunt in the most horrific circumstances. 'Angela was a beautiful and vivacious . young woman with a gift for artistry and creativity. It is a tragedy for . everyone that her young life has ended so abruptly. 'We . are deeply disappointed with the manslaughter verdict in this case and . will be pursuing all available avenues to understand how such a verdict . was reached. 'The fact the defendant will only serve half of today’s sentence before being released is merely salt in the wound. Angela Phillips had wanted to decorate the home she shared with Thomas Crompton (pictured) when he 'lost it' and killed her with a hammer . 'His actions have left three deeply bereaved children to grow up without a mother and have put all our family through a dreadful ordeal of intensive care, funeral and court. 'During the court case it felt that Angela herself was on trial, and in many ways that has been the hardest part for us. We feel Angela and her family have been let down in this case by the justice system. 'This continues to be a . life changing experience for us and our energies are now focused on . protecting and nurturing Angela’s children. We ask for privacy in our lives while we do so.' Karim Khalil, defending, said that Crompton’s actions that day had been 'out of character'. Mr Khalil said: 'His remorse is and always has been and will remain genuine and deeply felt. 'He has to live with the consequences of what he did. He was so overwhelmed by the emotion of passion he was unable to resist the impulse that overcame him.' The court was told that Ms Phillips had mental health problems, had threatened suicide and that the . 'This was a complex, emotive and difficult case for all parties concerned and it demonstrates that violence is never the answer to any domestic argument. 'The actions of Crompton have had widespread and devastating consequences for the children and family of Angela and Thomas.' He added: 'This was a brutal attack on someone Crompton claimed to love. Violence is never a good resolution to an argument and this is a tragic end to this couple’s relationship, leaving their children and families devastated.' After the death of Ms Phillips, who had two children from a previous relationship, her family paid tribute to her and the staff that helped try and save her life in June last year. They said: 'It is a tragedy for everyone that her young life has ended so abruptly. 'We would like to express our sincere gratitude to the staff at the Norfolk and Norwich and Addenbrooke’s hospitals who made Angela’s final hours as bearable as possible.'","Thomas Crompton, 39, 'lost it' because wife of three months, Angela, 34, moved his things .

"A proud father visiting his son in Afghanistan spent what would become both men's final days seeing the city where the younger man worked as a university lecturer and ran a Kabul health clinic, drinking tea with a colleague and learning about his son's work. A planned visit to a Kabul hospital brought them together with a third Illinois man, a doctor who shared their interest in the Afghan people and a faith-driven commitment to helping others. Gary Gabel of suburban Chicago and his son, John Gabel, were killed Thursday when an Afghan police security guard opened fire on the group as they entered the grounds of a hospital in Kabul. Also killed was Dr. Jerry Umanos, a pediatrician from Chicago. John Gabel's wife, Teresa, also an American, was wounded. Victims: This photo taken on Tuesday, April 22, 2014, shows from left, slain John Gabel, his mother and his slain father Gary Gabel sitting with Mohammad Hadi Hadayati, Kabul University's vice chancellor. The father and son were killed when an Afghan police security officer opened fire on Thursday at a hospital . What prompted the guard to fire on the Americans was not clear, but recently there have been a number of so-called insider attacks - incidents in which Afghan security forces fire on their comrades or foreign trainers or civilians. Violence increased in Afghanistan ahead of the NATO withdrawal and also in the weeks leading up to the country's April 5 election. Whether the couple's young daughter, Laila, and John Gabel's mother, Betty, were along for the visit to the Cure International Hospital remains unclear. Umanos, who trained young doctors and cared for pediatric patients at the hospital, had invited the family as his guests. 'Giving back to those in need was special to all the Gabel family,' Arlington Heights Mayor Thomas W. Hayes told The Associated Press. The mayor said he's known the family for 25 years as members of the Orchard Evangelical Free Church in Arlington Heights, and learned of the deaths first 'through the church grapevine' and then from a church email to members. Gary Gabel sang in the church choir, was involved with church youth groups and the leadership team. Hayes coached John and his own son, both now in their early 30s, when they played on a church basketball team. John, who was tall, was the team's center. Hayes described the church as a close-knit group, which has grown over at least four decades to 2,000 members in four suburbs. Memories: Mohammad Hadi Hadayati, Kabul University's vice chancellor, shows a photograph of from left, slain John Gabel, his mother, his father Gary Gabel who was also killed and himself, during an interview on Saturday . 'It's going to be a very difficult time tomorrow morning, I can tell you that,' Hayes said of Sunday's church service. Family and friends grieved privately Saturday. The Associated Press left phone messages for Gabel family members that weren't immediately returned. 'Out of respect for the Gabel family, we don't have anything to say at this time,' church spokeswoman Claire Bechard said in an email to the AP. She confirmed the Gabels are church members. Kabul University vice chancellor Mohammad Hadi Hadayati remembered John Gabel as a 'good friend' who worked for the Colorado Springs-based charity Morning Star Development and ran a small health clinic that provided a pharmacy and emergency care for the students, professors and employees. John Gabel had directed the clinic for two years under an agreement between Kabul University and Morning Star, Hadayati said. A phone message left with Morning Star Development on Saturday was not immediately returned. Gabel also served as a guest lecturer at the University, The Chicago Sun-Times reports, and worked in the information technology department.

"A group of international military observers captured by pro-Russian rebels are being held as ‘human shields’, according to the Ukrainian government. Kiev said the eight foreigners, who were in Ukraine to gather information about the worsening security situation, were being detained in ‘inhuman’ conditions. But last night the hostages were denounced by their captors as Nato spies. The escalating tension heightened fears of an imminent Russian invasion of eastern Ukraine. Foreign observers were gathering information about security situation, the Ukrainian government has claimed .

The main flashpoint yesterday was the seizure by pro-Moscow paramilitaries of monitors from the Organisation for Security and Co-Operation in Europe, a Vienna-based body whose 57 member states include Russia. The monitors included German, Swedish, Danish, Polish and Czech nationals, as well as Ukrainian army officers accompanying them. The Ukrainian State Security Service said the hostages were being detained ‘in inhuman conditions in the basement of the terrorists’ headquarters’ in the eastern city of Slaviansk. It claimed the operation had been planned and co-ordinated by a Russian special services agent, though this was denied by Moscow. Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk cut short a visit to Rome, where he asked the Pope to pray for his country, to fly home to face the crisis . Mr Yatsenyuk said: ‘Russian military aircraft overnight crossed and violated Ukrainian air space seven times. The only reason is to provoke Ukraine to start a war.’ He said Moscow, which has sent thousands of troops to the border, was looking for a pretext to invade. Meanwhile, leaders of the Group of Seven major economies agreed  to impose additional sanctions on Russia. US officials said new measures aimed at Putin ‘cronies’ could be unveiled tomorrow unless Moscow took immediate action to defuse the crisis. Lithuanian president Dalia Grybauskaite yesterday welcomed 150 US paratroopers. Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia have been members of Nato since 2004 but until now have not allowed foreign troops to be stationed on their territory, partly to avoid antagonising Russia. But that policy has now been abandoned and 600 American soldiers are being sent to the Baltic states and Poland as Washington attempts to reassure its European allies about their security after Moscow’s intervention in Ukraine. Ukraine fears a Russian incursion on the pretext of guaranteeing security for referendums next month on whether eastern regions of the country should split from Kiev and become part of the Russian Federation.

"Two Georgia brothers reported missing earlier this week have been found safe and well in Texas while their father has been arrested on abduction charges. Police have been searching for Daniel Cleary, 46, and his two sons Ben, 9, and Henry, 7, after he failed to return the two boys to their mother in Suwanee on Wednesday. On Friday police released surveillance photos which showed the three in a Walmart store in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Found: Daniel Cleary, left, and his two sons, Henry and Ben, right, have been found. Police have arrested Cleary on abduction charges after he allegedly failed to return the boys to his ex-wife at the end of their week-long stay . An amber alert was issued for the boys after their mother Theresa Nash reported them missing. She said she was particularly concerned as . Daniel Cleary had purchased a firearm about a month ago, was under . stress and drinking. Cleary, of Roswell, was taken into custody today. 'We have recovered the kids,' McGee said. 'They were with him and they were OK.' Austin police said a citizen had recognized the boys from the alert and . notified police at 5:11 p.m. CDT that they were at a hotel. Ms Nash, spoke to the boys by phone and was on the way to get them, police said. First clue: This image from a surveillance camera inside the Chattanooga, Tennessee, Walmart, showed Daniel Cleary with his two sons . Hunt: CCTV images were captured last Sunday and Monday while Cleary and the two boys, seen wearing blue vests, were on a planned trip to the Tennessee Aquarium . On Thursday, Roswell police issued the . nationwide Amber Alert, known in Georgia as Levi’s Call, after . discovering that Mr Cleary violated a court order by not communicating . with the boys' mother, Theresa Nash, for several days about the . whereabouts of their children. 'He bought a Glock a month ago,' Theresa Nash told WTVM. 'He is drinking. He is under extreme stress because he probably . realizes that he's kidnapped the kids and there's now an Amber Alert.' The CCTV images released Friday . afternoon showed Mr Cleary with his children shopping at the . Chattanooga Walmart, captured on December 23 and 24. Their father picked the kids up on December 19 and was supposed to return them to Nash by 2pm on December 26, but never made it. Ms Nash last heard from her . ex-husband on December 22 when he called her to say that he and the boys . would be spending a night at a Quality Inn motel in Chattanooga, . Tennessee, after visiting the Tennessee Aquarium in town, according to 11Alive. Distraught: The boys' mother, Theresa Nash, said her ex-husband, a recovering alcoholic, had recently bought a Glock handgun . Cleary made one final call from his cell phone on December 23 from Nashville, after which the device was shut off. With mounting concern, Theresa Nash . drove to Roswell and went to Cleary’s home at 285 Crab Orchard Way, only . to discover that the house had been cleared out of TVs and other . electronics. Cleary’s car was later found abandoned in a restaurant parking lot. Nash said that a friend of Cleary's confirmed to her that the 46-year-old man purchased a Glock handgun last month, and she said that police said that the firearm was on him. The mother also added that Cleary, whom she described as an alcoholic, had recently undergone treatment at a rehab facility in California, KOLO8 reported. The man regained shared custody of Henry and Ben only in October, and the Christmas break was their first week alone with their father. ‘I can’t predict his behavior with logic. It always defies me when I try, so I don’t have certainty that he wouldn’t,’ she said. “He loves them very much but he is not of sound mind.’ According to court records obtained by Channel 2, Nash filed a petition for contempt against Cleary last November. The document stated  that the woman smelled alcohol on his breath when he went to pick up the children, so she refused to let Cleary take them. The petition, however, was denied.","Ben and Henry Cleary, aged nine and seven, respectively, have stayed with their father, Daniel, since Dec. 19 .

"Today's crash of an Asiana Airline Boeing 777 at San Francisco Airport has striking similarities with the crash of a British Airways 777 five-and-a-half years ago. In both instances, the aircraft came down before the threshold of the runway after coming to the end of a long haul flight. The hull of both planes also remained largely intact with the majority of the passengers walking away unhurt, shaken with just a few cuts and bruises. Crash no.1: The crash of a British Airways Boeing 777 on landing in London Heathrow was caused by ice crystals forming in the fuel and cutting power to the engines . Crash no.2: The plane slammed into the tarmac before the runway touchdown zone. The engines and the tail fin broke away from the main wreckage . This is the third hull loss for a Boeing 777, introduced in 1994. British Airways Flight 038 from Beijing lost power as it approached the London Heathrow airport on January 17 2008. Eighteen of those on board needed treatment for minor injuries. Many were hurt as they came out of the plane on its emergency slides. There were no fatalities but 47 people sustained injuries; one serious. Intact: An Asiana Airlines Boeing 777 is seen on the runway at San Francisco International Airport after crash landing . No casualties: In 2008 the BA plane on a flight from China crash-landed short of the runway at London's Heathrow Airport. All the passengers escaped with just a few injuries . Everyone survived in London: Fire engines smothered the Boeing 777 in foam after it landed with its wings extensively damaged and its undercarriage wrecked . The 150-tonne aircraft was the first Boeing 777-200ER to be written off in the model's history. The Boeing 777's engines did not produce the necessary thrust to reach the front of the runway as it came into land. The plane struck the ground and came to a halt a few hundred yards later. After a year-long investigation into the causes of the crash, it was found that both engines were still running when the Boeing 777 came down perilously short of the runway but on far less power than had been demanded by the pilot. Ice crystals in the fuel were found to the cause of the accident. Although the fuel itself did not freeze, small quantities of water in the fuel did freeze. Ice adhered to the inside of the fuel lines where they run through the struts attaching the engines to the wings. This accumulation of ice had no effect on the flight until the final stages of the approach into Heathrow, when increased fuel flow and higher temperatures suddenly released it back into the fuel. This formed a slush of soft ice which flowed forward where it froze once again, causing a restriction in the flow of fuel to the engines. The plane's captain Peter Burkill and co-pilot John Coward were hailed as heroes for averting a major disaster. Britain's . Air Accident Investigation Branch said ice blocking the fuel lines that . power the engines was the cause of the BA plane losing power. No obvious cause: It's not immediately clear what made Flight 214 from Seoul crash on landing at San Francisco airport in perfect flying conditions, but there is no shortage of theories . Resting place: The plane came to a halt on the grass off the main runway. Incredibly, the fuselage of the aircraft remained intact throughout impact . Third time unlucky: This is the third hull loss of a Boeing 777 aircraft since the plane was brought into service in 1995 . In this afternoon's crash at San Francisco Airport it appears the aircraft also did not have the thrust required to meet the threshold of the runway with the tail of the plane striking the tarmac before the wheels touched down. The impact saw the tail ripped clean off the aircraft's fuselage. However, the fact that debris exists at the runway's edge, at the perimeter of the tarmac and also in San Francisco Bay ahead of the runways' 'touchdown zone' also suggests the crew were for some reason unable to summon the power they required to make the landing safely. In any event, whatever the cause, given the proximity of the airport to San Francisco Bay, the crash could have been far worse had the plane crash landed any sooner.","Crash has parallels to that of British Airways 777 crash in 2008 .

"Visitors to Disneyland Paris are being robbed of the chance to see their favourite cartoon characters because of on-going strike action over a sexual harassment case. Staff who dress up as characters including Mickey, Donald Duck and Goofy are withdrawing from ‘Meet and Greet’ events. They are furious that a senior colleague who was accused of harassing women had been allowed back to work because of ‘lack of evidence’. Hi ho, hi ho it's off from work we go: Actors who play Snow White and the Seven Dwarves along with other characters have walked out from Disneyland Paris in a dispute over pay . There is also widespread anger at low wages, with strikes also being organised as part of a union campaign to get pay increases. It all means that those visiting the theme park outside the French capital, including thousands of Britons, are left disappointed. ‘It’s worst for the very young children who aren’t that interested in the rides,’ said Louise Scott, a mother-of-four from Welwyn, Hertfordshire. ‘They dream of meeting their cartoon heroes, and want to be pictured with them, but there just aren’t any around.’ This week alone there have been cancellations of the Magic on Parade event, ‘Meet and Greet’ sessions in Cafe Mickey, the Cowboy Cookout Barbeque, and a number of other hugely popular events. See ya: Mickey Mouse is among the other characters to wave goodbye to Disneyland Paris in a dispute which has left thousands of holidaymakers disappointed . Ducking out: Hundreds of members of four powerful unions have been taking part in demonstrations outside the amusement park on the outskirts of the French capital . All of the characters come from the entertainment department at Disneyland, where an insider said: ‘We are all hugely professional, but have every right to go on strike if we believe that someone who should not be here is working alongside us. We also object to low pay.’ The Disney board in Paris argued that there was not enough evidence to incriminate the alleged sexual harassment offender. It also denies that staff have the right to ‘opt out’ of their duties, and has pledged to impose harsh financial penalties on strikers. Hundreds of  members of four powerful unions have been taking part in demonstrations outside the amusement park on the outskirts of the French capital. Those caught up in the industrial action last month included hundreds of British families who experienced strike action in March. Goofy decision: Those caught up in industrial action last month included hundreds of British families who experienced strike action in March . ‘It’s bizarre that Disneyland characters are going on strike,’ said Eileen Holmes, a 32-year-old mum from south London who was in Paris with her two young children. ‘You expect to see French lorry drivers and fishermen on strike, but not cartoon characters!’ David Charpentier, of the FO trade union, said: ‘It’s unfortunate, but we have to defend our rights as wage earnings. We have offered a compromise to management, and it’s up to them to respond.’ Daniel Dreux, Disneyland’s human resources manager, said a ‘general increase of 1.5 per cent’ was on the table, and appealed for ‘realism and common sense’ from strikers.","Anger that colleague accused of harassing women is working again .

"George Clooney's wedding to Amal Alamuddin in Venice last month was one of the most high-profile matrimonies of the decade. The glamorous couple - who exchanged vows on September 27 at a star studded Italian ceremony - were the toast of Hollywood, especially when the wedding photographs emerged a few days later showing the newlyweds looking every inch the A-listers we’d come to expect. So impressed with the new couple's wedding look were the British public that they're seeking cosmetic treatments in a desperate attempt to emulate the glamorous pair. Scroll down for video . Influencers: George Clooney and Amal Alamuddin only tied the knot a few weeks ago but they're already influencing cosmetic surgery trends . A  London clinic that specialises in non-surgical cosmetic treatments has reported a rise in couples seeking pre-wedding makeovers after 53-year-old George and Amal, who recently turned 36, tied the knot. The official wedding snaps - first seen in Hello! magazine - have reportedly had brides-to-be asking for a flat stomach like Amal and grooms wanting smooth skin like George, according to cosmetic doctor, Dr Ohan Ohanes, from Swiss Care Clinic. 'Since the Clooney wedding hit the covers of magazines and newspapers across the UK we’ve had enquiries about body contouring and anti-ageing skin treatments,' explains skin expert Dr Ohanes. Get the look: A London-based clinic has revealed that demand for a flat stomach like Amal's and smooth skin like George's are on the up amongst British couples . Power couple: Female patients are choosing non-surgical fat reduction treatments to get Amal's arms and flat stomach, while youthful George's smooth, firm skin is appealing to the men . 'Patients were asking for ""the Amal look"" but soon we started receiving a high number of enquiries from couples looking to emulate both of the Clooney’s flawless appearances,' he said. The cosmetic doctor, who says the London clinic has seen a 150 per cent rise in couples looking into non-surgical treatments like body contouring and dermal fillers, says his patients have actually stated George and Amal as their pre-marital makeover inspiration. 'We’ve had patients turn up at the clinic clutching the wedding photographs of the Clooneys,' he told MailOnline. 'Once you start getting enquiries from couples asking for treatments that emulate the look of a celebrity pair, there’s no doubt a trend is forming.' According to Dr Ohanes, his female patients are choosing non-surgical fat reduction treatments to get Amal’s arms and flat stomach, while youthful George’s smooth, firm skin is appealing to the men. 'So far we’ve had couples choosing his-and-hers Exilis Elite fat reduction to shrink and sculpt certain body parts, especially the stomach,' he explained. 'We’re finding the grooms are more interested in anti-ageing facial treatments, which is something we usually associate with our female patients more. 'I’ve never seen anything like it to be honest,' Dr Ohanes concluded. 'We’ve had more couples enquire about injectables and body shaping after the Clooney wedding than I ever had about Kim Kardashian and her enviable curves.'

"National Geographic have launched their 2014 annual Photo Contest, releasing a selection of entries from this year’s competition. Some of the spectacular entries so far include images of animals, insects, people and places, and clearly live up to the organisation’s already notable reputation for ‘setting the standard for photographic excellence’. Last year, National Geographic received over 7,000 entries from over 150 countries, with professional photographers and amateur photo enthusiasts across the globe participating in the competition. The prestigious competition is accepting entries in three categories: people, places and nature. Photos submitted so far include snaps of playful polar bears in Svalbard, Norway, a flock of galahs in the Asutralian desert, a silhouette of a Mediterranean Mantis and a close-up of a manatee. Lupine fields in California, the beauty of a glacial lagoon at sunset in Iceland and the painted faces of Mexican women celebrating The Day of the Dead complete the selection. The Grand Prize Winner will receive $10,000 (£6,170) and a trip to National Geographic headquarters in Washington DC, to participate in the annual National Geographic Photography Seminar in January 2015. The First Place winner in each category will each receive $2,500 (£1,540) and his or her winning photograph will be published in the National Geographic magazine. The closing date to submit photos is 31 October. Arctic Hi five: Colin Mackenzie snapped two polar bear cubs on an iceflow in Svalbard, Norway and said this cub in particular was entertaining to watch . This stunning image of a Mediterranean Mantis was captured by Hasan Ba Iar in Nicosia, Cyprus.

Photographer Misty Gage said of her manatee picture: 'Capturing this gentle giant's inquisitive nature was rather easy as he swam right up to us and just stared for several long seconds. I love all the bubbles and his cute little face.' The image was taken in at the Point Defiance Zoo, Tacoma,Washington, USA . Frozen beauty: Francesco Riccardo Iacomino submitted his photo Dreamscape, showing the pinks of a perfect summer sky in Iceland reflected in the stillness of the Jokulsarlon Glacer Lagoon. He said: 'It was a typical cloudy day in the Icelandic summer. The day was not hoping for a nice sunset, but I still decided to go on the spot, hoping to finally see the sun once the same had left behind the clouds. When the sun went down, in fact the sky burned out in an incredible vanilla tone. The scene was so peaceful and placid, so I decided to capture it with a long exposure, to bring out the amazing sense of peace that this amazing sunset created. It has been like living in a dream.' Montse Grillo entitled her photo 'From the sky', which features a close-up of a green turtle off the coast of Tenerife in the Canary Islands. She said: 'I find myself devoting much time to these curious creatures. . This turtle was coming from the surface with the sun behind it, and the sunrays surrounding it gave it a special majesty' Seeing blue: Douglas Croft captured the beauty of Big Sur in California, after travelling there to watch the gray whale migration from the cliffs. He said: 'It was too foggy to even see the water. I decided to hike up the Baronda Trail to see if I could get above the fog. This view was my reward. Miles of lupine and blue skies. Outstanding!' Painted Ladies: Daniel Kudish captured these young women in Oaxaca, Mexico, dressed up with their faces painted to celebrate the Day of the Dead (Dia de los Muertos). He said the event was 'an incredible celebration of life, and a beautiful way to remember those who have passed.' Photographer Thomas Dorleans took this image of the Taj Mahal in Agra, India. He recalled it was shot 'in the early morning, the fog of early march spreads the light. It is like we were on drugs' Photographer Aaron Feinberg said of this picture: 'Ah the Agave plant. Filled with amazing patterns and textures. This particular subject was a great find while visiting San Francisco.

"Across the world, life expectancy is steadily increasing and, on average a woman aged 60 today can expect to live until she is 82. For men, this is 79. But the quality of life for this ageing population varies drastically from country to country. Research has discovered that the best country to currently grow old in is Norway, followed by Sweden and Switzerland, while Afghanistan and Mozambique are the worst. The US is in 8th place, the UK is in 11th and Australia is in 13th. Scroll down for video . The 2014 Global AgeWatch Index ranks 96 nations on the quality of life for the over 60s. Norway, Sweden and Canada are currently the best countries to grow old in. At the opposite end of the scale is Afghanistan, Mozambique and West Bank and Gaza. The US is in 8th place, the UK is in 11th and Australia is in 13th . That’s according to findings from the 2014 Global AgeWatch Index. It ranks 96 nations on the basis of the quality of life and social and economic status of older people, aged 60 and over. The index studies four areas, in particular. Income covers the state of pensions, relative welfare of older people, GDP in each country, and poverty rate in old age. Health status includes life expectancy at 60 and psychological status. Capability covers the employment level and educational status of older people, and ‘Enabling environment’ includes physical safety, social connections and access to public transport. From this index, governments can use the findings to identify policies to improve the lives of their older people. Based on the research, Norway is the best place for older people, alongside Sweden, Switzerland and Canada. The UK ranked 11th overall, and 3rd for the enabling environment, but scored poorly for health, at 27th. Globally, by 2050, the report claims the number of over 60s will be 21 per cent of the global population. This is almost double the current figure of 12 per cent. Apart from Japan, the top ten countries are in Western Europe, North America and Australasia. Israel and Estonia join the top 20. The older populations of the three lowest-ranked countries, the West Bank and Gaza, (94) Mozambique (95) and Afghanistan (96), still account for less than five per cent of the total population. The proportion of over-80s is growing fastest, too – projected to rise from two per cent now to four per cent of the global population by 2050. And more than a third of countries are falling significantly behind those at the top of the Global AgeWatch Index. Globally, by 2050, the report claims the number of over 60s will be 21 per cent of the global population.This is almost double the current figure of 12 per cent. The proportion of over-80s is growing fastest, too – projected to rise from two per cent now to four per cent of the global population by 2050 .

Health status includes life expectancy at 60 and psychological wellbeing. Capability covers the employment level and educational status of older people, and ‘Enabling environment’ includes physical safety, social connections and access to public transport. This graph reveals the top 50 countries . Professor Asghar Zaidi, from the Centre for Research on Ageing at the University of Southampton, led the development of the index, working alongside HelpAge International. ‘The Index points to a mismatch between advances in longevity and a lag in the evolution of policies that empower older people,’ said Professor Zaidi. ‘Societies have been slow to embrace the positive aspects of longevity and to see older people as a resource that, in the right circumstances, can repay investment with extended working careers as well as more self-reliant, healthy and independent living.’ The report also highlights the disparity between those nations at the top of the index, and those in the lower third. For example, on income security, 26 countries scored less than half the top values set by Norway and France (89.1 and 88.0 respectively). Toby Porter, Chief Executive of HelpAge International, added: ‘The unprecedented rate and speed of population ageing presents policy-makers with a challenge. 'Only if they act now will they have a chance to meet the needs of their citizens and keep their economies going.’ ‘An essential distinction is required between policies suitable for the current generations of older people and those required for future generations,’ continued Professor Zaidi. ‘Today’s older people need protection and empowerment. For future generations the focus must be on providing opportunities for employment during their working lives and better mechanisms to build resilience for old age.’ Sufficient data was only available for 96 countries, resulting in many not being included, including Kazakhstan, Madagascar and Cuba.

"Abu Hamza is accused of using London¿s notorious Finsbury Park mosque as a recruiting base for his creed of violent jihad . Abu Hamza claims he secretly ‘kept the streets of London  safe’ as a go-between for MI5 and Scotland Yard, a US court heard. The extraordinary image of the hook-handed Muslim firebrand as a force for religious peace in Britain was laid out in a Manhattan courtroom by his defence lawyer. Some 50 pages of documents passed on by Britain would prove the police and security services turned to Hamza to help combat Islamic extremism between May 1997 and August 2000, defence lawyer Joshua Dratel said. ‘They take in every conflict we are talking about in this case. Algeria, Bosnia, Yemen, Afghanistan, the Finsbury Park mosque are all central to this case,’ he said. ‘He takes a certain position publicly but his intent is to de-escalate, to avoid a greater war, to keep the streets of London safe. ‘He is an intermediary, he has done this for Scotland Yard and MI5. They have asked him multiple times to act in hostile situations and return some order in the community.’ Mr Dratel said Hamza had helped repeatedly when British nationals had been involved or arrested in conflicts abroad. The claims contrast starkly with prosecutors’ claims that the 56-year-old former nightclub bouncer posed as a community leader while actually engaging in a ‘global campaign to spread terror’. Hamza, who is accused of using London’s notorious Finsbury Park mosque as a recruiting base for his creed of violent jihad, stared across the court today at one of his alleged victims. New Zealander Mary Quin escaped a 1998 kidnapping of 16 mostly British tourists in the Yemen. Three Britons and an Australian were killed in the subsequent gun battle with Yemeni soldiers, and Hamza is accused of providing the kidnappers with a satellite phone and offering to be their go-between. Miss Quin described how she flew to London in 2000 and confronted Hamza outside the mosque, demanding to find out more about the hostage-taking. She said he eventually took her to his office, where, as children played under his desk, he told her he was ‘surprised, very surprised’ she had come. The radical cleric, who lost both his hands in Afghanistan and has had his hooks removed during the trial, is accused of 11 counts including trying to set up a terror training camp in Oregon . In the conversation, a recording of which was played in court, he freely told her that the kidnappers’ leader had rung him during the kidnapping, which had been carried out to secure the release of Muslim hostages held by the Yemenis. They included five British men, one of whom was Hamza’s son and another was his stepson. Hamza even claimed that the leader of the kidnappers, Abu Hassan of the Aden-Abyan Islamic Army, was a ‘very soft-hearted person’, the court heard. He then baldly informed Miss Quin that the alternative to taking them hostage would have been to blow up their cars with a rocket launcher. He refused to say if he had known about the kidnapping in advance but claimed the hostage takers had never expected anyone would get hurt. Today in court he came face-to-face with one of his alleged victims, Mary Quin, who escaped a 1998 kidnapping after wrestling a rifle from one of her captors . The jury was also played a Channel 4 News interview with Hamza, in which he admitted he would ‘love’ for the Yemeni regime to be overthrown. Hamza, wearing a blue smock and track suit bottoms, peered intently at his accuser as he sat with a female lawyer on either side of him. He has had his hooks removed for safety reasons but he is allowed a pen-holding prosthetic on his right arm. The Egyptian-born imam, who was extradited to the US in 2012, denies 11 charges, including planning to set up a terror training camp in Oregon and being involved in the Yemen kidnapping. If found guilty, he faces a life sentence. The trial continues.

"A letter from the man accused of opening fire on a Pennsylvania State Police barracks - killing one trooper and injuring another - to his parents has been revealed. Eric Frein admitted killing a trooper because he was dissatisfied with government and wanted to 'wake people up,' according to court documents filed Thursday that provided the first indication of a possible motive. Frein spoke of wanting to start a revolution in the letter to his parents and called the slaying of Cpl. Bryon Dickson an 'assassination' in a police interview after his October 30 capture, the documents said. Court documents filed Thursday also included a letter, which authorities say was written by Frein and was addressed to 'Mom and Dad.' The letter says 'Our nation is far from what it was and what it should be. I have seen so many depressing changes made in my time that I cannot imagine what it must be like for you. There is so much wrong and on so many levels only passing through the crucible of another revolution can get us back the liberties we once had. I do not pretend to know what that revolution will look like or even if it would be successful. Suspect: Eric Frein (seen in this October 30 mug shot) has been charged with terrorism. Authorities have said that Frein wrote a letter to his parents, in which he spoke of wanting to start a revolution . Charged: Frein, seen on October 31, is charged with the murder of Pennsylvania State Trooper Cpl. Byron Dickson and critically wounding Trooper Alex Douglass . 'Tension is high at the moment and the time seems right for a spark to ignite a fire in the hearts of men. What I have done has not been done before and it felt like it was worth a try. 'If I am dead I would like to be buried in a wood casket (no lead lined casket!) so that my remains can return to where they came from. I realize that this may not be possible though, laws and what not, so don't sweat it. Also, light a candle for me at the Russian or Greek Orthodox church in Stroudsburg from time to time. It doesn't need to be during a liturgy, just whenever they are open. I am sure you can figure it out. 'I do not have a death wish but I know the odds. I tried my best to do this thing without getting identified, but if you are reading this then I was not successful. If I am still alive and free know that I will do my best to remain as such. And as time goes by, if circumstances change, if my spark hit good tinder, then I may be able to return one day. 'I am sorry. You guys are great parents, I am just not a good son. I squandered so much opportunity and support and rarely tried my best at anything. God knows I do not deserve the things I had, maybe He knew I would be sacrificing all of it in the end, or maybe this is just the final squander. Who knows. 'I love you. Please forgive me of my many faults. And thanks for putting up with me for so long.' Scene: Debris is strewn about the main room inside the airport hangar on November 4 on abandoned Birchwood Resort grounds in Pocono Township, Pennsylvania where Eric Frein was arrested . Search: Authorities launched an extensive manhunt to find Frein . State police charged Frein on Thursday with two counts of terrorism. He already faced first-degree murder and other counts in the September 12 ambush, which killed Dickson, seriously wounded another trooper and sparked a 48-day manhunt in the Pocono Mountains. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Frein, who appeared by video at a brief hearing at which state police filed the additional charges. He has not entered a plea. On the night of his capture, Frein waived his right to remain silent and told police in an interview at the barracks that he had shot the troopers 'because he wanted to make a change (in government) and that voting was inefficient to do so, because there was no one worth voting for,' according to a criminal complaint. 'The defendant further acknowledged taking action (shooting the troopers) to wake people up because it was all he could do.' Police found the letter on a storage drive inside an abandoned airplane hangar that authorities believe Frein used as a shelter. The letter was created on December 29, 2013, and was last accessed on October 6, 2014, while Frein was on the run, the documents said. Police have said Frein had a laptop with him. Authorities, meanwhile, say they're not worried that Frein's confession could conceivably be challenged by defense attorneys. Police refused to tell Frein that his family had hired an attorney for him the night he was captured, according to defense attorney James Swetz, who said he was prevented from seeing Frein at the barracks. 'I was told, ""He's an adult and has not asked for a lawyer,""' Swetz recounted earlier this week. District Attorney Ray Tonkin has cited Pennsylvania Supreme Court precedent that says police aren't required to tell a suspect that an attorney is seeking to speak with him or her. A more recent state court decision, however, said the Supreme Court had not 'eliminated the possibility' that a defendant's due-process rights could be violated under similar circumstances.","A letter that authorities say was written by Eric Frein to his parents has been revealed .

"Michelle Knight has revealed how Ariel Castro broke her jaw with a barbell, brutally raped her when she was strung up by metal wire and broke the neck of a puppy he had given her. The horrifying details emerged in the 33-year-old's book Finding Me which was published on May 6. Along with the brutal physical torture that Castro subjected her to at his Cleveland home, Ms Knight described his emotional punishment, including when he told her: 'You're a person with no meaning.' On the day that her path crossed with Castro, Ms Knight, who had a troubled upbringing where she suffered sexual abuse, was on her way to a foster-care appointment to try to get her adored two-year-old son Joey back. She had stopped to ask directions at a local store on August 22, 2002, when she ran into the father of a friend - Ariel Castro. He offered her a ride but said that he needed to stop by his home. He asked if she wanted to come inside, just for a moment, to take one of the puppies he was keeping for her son. Scroll down for videos . Michelle Knight, pictured during an interview earlier this week, released a memoir on the anniversary of her escape, in which she describes the physical and mental abuse she suffered at the hands of Ariel Castro for 11 years . She told People: 'We stepped into a bedroom. ''The puppies are underneath the dresser,'' he said. 'I looked down to where he was pointing and then, suddenly - Slam! - he closed the door... The gentle guy who'd seemed so nice to me had turned into a madman. He pushed me to the ground. I closed my eyes and tried to prepare myself for what might happen next. To this day I still cannot believe what did.' Ms Knight was strung from wire in a bedroom where Castro returned two days later to rape her. He then dragged her down two flights of stairs to a basement. She wrote: 'What happened over the next three hours is still hard for me to think about. He didn't just rape me the way he had upstairs. He murdered my heart.' Michelle Knight revealed her horrifying ordeal in her new book, published on May 6. An excerpt was included in People, out this week . Castro kept her chained in the dark basement, feeding her stale pizza and repeatedly raping her. He would make her wear a motorbike helmet so that no one could hear Ms Knight's screams. At the times she thought he had gone to work, Ms Knight pounded the helmet repeatedly against the pole and rattled the chains in the hope that someone would hear and call the police. As weeks became months, she wrote: 'I began to wonder if God had forgotten me too.' When he wasn't harming her, Castro forced Knight to listen to his vile diatribes, on how he had had been bullied as a child and hated black people. Miss Knight wrote how Castro got violent if he caught her watching a show like The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air which had black cast members. He also enthused about his love of pornography and said: 'I wish I had gotten to that little JonBenet Ramsey first.' He also made comments about Elizabeth Smart who had disappeared shortly before Ms Knight went missing. After a few months at the home, Castro brought Michelle a puppy. She named him Lobo and showered him with love. Castro then broke the dog's neck while he was raping the young woman because Lobo would not stop barking. In April 2003, Castro abducted Amanda Berry, 16, and brought her into the house of horrors. Ms Knight, who refers to Castro as 'the dude' in her writing, recalled: 'One night Amanda's mother was on the news pleading for people to help find her daughter. The dude laughed. ''You see that? At least someone's looking for her. But who's looking for you? Not a soul. That's because you don't mean nothin' to nobody.''' Michelle Knight got pregnant five times during her years in captivity but Castro starved and punched her until she miscarried. She also suffered a litany of other health problems. In 2012, she almost died after eating mustard which she was allergic to. The 33-year-old has trouble speaking at times because her jaw has been left permanently damaged by Castro's punches - including the time he hit her in the face with a barbell. She has nerve damage in her arms which causes them to shake. On the one-year anniversary of their escape, Cleveland kidnapping survivors Amanda Berry, right, and Georgina DeJesus are honored at the annual National Center for Missing and Exploited Children's Hope Awards dinner in Washington . Boarded up and now demolished: The three women were held captive in the Cleveland home of Ariel Castro for more than a decade . In April 2004, Gina DeJesus was brought to the home by Castro. He allowed her to be kept in the same room as Michelle and the two girls developed a tight bond - holding each other's hands as he abused them. In . an earlier interview, Miss Knight told how Castro would keep her and . the other women locked in an upstairs room when guests would come to . visit - blocking them in with piles of furniture. In 2006, Amanda Berry became pregnant  - but because Castro viewed her as his 'wife', she was not forced to miscarry as Ms Knight had been. In her book, she writes how she delivered Ms Berry's baby girl Jocelyn on Christmas Day 2006. As the little girl grew older, Castro loosened their chains, as he didn't want her to see the women locked up. Although they were allowed into the kitchen or living room now for a few hours on the weekend, Ms Knight wrote: 'After years of being in prison the locks move from off of your wrists and your ankles and up to your brain. And it feels like your captor is all-seeing.' In another harrowing example of . Castro's mindgames, Miss Knight said that she tried to escape once . through a door Castro had left open. However, she was just not fast . enough. She . revealed that following this, Castro would leave doors tantalizingly ajar, to tempt them to run, . only to then shut them in their faces, taunting them. Finally, on May 6, 2013 - the impossible happened - she was finally free. Amanda Berry had taken advantage of . Castro leaving the inner front door unlocked and had screamed through . the storm door for help. A neighbor heard her and called 911. As police officers descended the stairs to their basement prison, Miss Knight . said she turned to Gina DeJesus to tell her: 'You won't . believe . this. We're free. We are going home'. Then and now: Michelle Knight (left) being interviewed almost one year ago on her escape from captivity and now (right) happier and healthier . Ms Knight was taken to hospital where she weight 84lb and was diagnosed with a bacterial infection that was eating at her stomach. She said that once she was allowed to eat solid food, she asked for a cheeseburger from Steak n' Shake and a cheesecake blizzard from Dairy Queen. Miss Knight said . that she wanted people to know that her new life is 'awesome'. She said . that she loved nothing more than waking up in the morning, making a cup . of coffee, watching TV and looking at the sky. Miss Knight, who is now known as Lily . Rose Lee after her favorite flower, said: 'You can't break . someone that's already been been broken. You can only make them . stronger.' Michelle Knight's memoir was released on the first-anniversary of her escape on May 6 . She also said that she was enjoying boxing training and singing, even recording her first song. However her journey to return to the life she was snatched from, hasn't always been easy. Miss Knight's son Joey was given up for adoption during her 11 years held in captivity by Ariel Castro at his Cleveland home. In her book, Miss Knight . said that it was thinking of her son Joey which kept her alive until . her dramatic escape. Michelle . Knight today said that she understands the decision of her son's new . family not to share with the 14-year-old the identity of his birth . mother. The . 33-year-old has photographs of . her son that his new family had shared with her and that she was happy . to see all that he had accomplished. She added that she hoped to be . reunited with him one day. She has chosen not to see her mother to whom she never had a good relationship but hopes one day to have a relationship with her two younger brothers. Amazingly, . Miss Knight is available to forgive Castro, who killed himself in prison last September just weeks into his life sentence. When . she heard the news of his suicide, she was saddened . and 'confused why he wanted to hurt his children like that'. She added: 'He was a human being... and everyone needs to be loved.' The 33-year-old earlier revealed that she has cut ties with the women she was held captive with for so many dark years. She told People that the three survivors have put distance between each other as they all come to terms with the ordeal they suffered. Miss Knight said: 'I love them and they love me. Hopefully we'll all get back together again.' Knight had made a brave and defiant . appearance at Castro's sentencing in August in which she told him: 'I . spent 11 years in hell, your hell is just beginning.' Ms Knight, who is 4'11, said that her hellish ordeal has taught her to enjoy every moment of her life. She told People: 'I don't take things for granted . anymore not even the little things like looking out a . window. I went through years of torture, and now I'm back. I'm free to . fly.'

"Imagine having an entire galaxy named after you. That's exactly what happened to one amateur star gazer after he spotted a new galaxy as part of an online search for the BBC. The galaxy, discovered by Zbigniew 'Zbish' Chetnik, has been named 9Spitch after his nickname was misheard by a television producer on the Stargazing Live programme. Zbigniew Chetnik was the first person to identify a unique galaxy 10 billion light years away from Earth. He is pictured here with his telescope in his observatory . Mr Chetnik, 60, was stunned when . he found out that a blurry spec he spotted in an online search was a . cluster of stars, gas and matter from a distant world. He said he felt like he had 'won the lottery' after discovering the new galaxy 10 billion light years from Earth. The service engineer from Badby, Northamptonshire, spotted the image of light from the galaxy being bent by gravity. Incredibly, as the universe is estimated to be 13 billion years old it means his discovery is one of the nearest to the the Big Bang ever captured by an amateur. The galaxy discovered by Zbigniew 'Zbish' Chetnik has been named 9Spitch after his nickname was misheard by a BBC television producer . Zbigniew 'Zbish' Chetnik made his discovery as part of an online search led by the BBC's Stargazing Live programme. The show recently launched a SpaceWarps 2 project asking amateur astronomers to find galaxies so massive that they warp space and time. In general relativity, the presence of matter (energy density) can curve space time, and the path of a light ray will be deflected as a result. This process is called gravitational lensing . Scientists on the project are asking amateur star gazers to visually inspect astronomical in the hope they can find  this 'gravitational lensing' phenomenon. And despite scientists initially wanting to name the new star-system after Albert Einstein it was named after Mr Chetnik after being backed by Professor Brian Cox. The amazing image - which captures the notion of gravity lensing - has since since caught the attention of observatories around the world. Mr Chetnik said: 'The object at the front is two billion light-years away, and the object that just happens to be directly behind it, is another eight billion light-years away. 'Given the universe is only 13 billion years old, it means this object at 10 billion light years away is quite near the beginning of the universe. 'I was one of six people in the world who spotted the image. 'But apparently I was the first. It is very rare to get a perfect ring from these lensed objects, normally they are a crescent on one side. 'I have an observatory in my garden at home, and what interests me is deep space objects. 'People know you have to have a ""clear sky"", but for what I'm looking for it has to be very clear. Zbigniew Chetnik, a service engineer, captured an image of light from the galaxy being bent by gravity from his back garden in Badby, Northamptonshire . 'That's why when I saw the appeal for help with this on-line project looking for deep space objects, I thought I'd give it a go. 'To have some of the largest telescopes in the world looking at it, I realised it must be something very interesting. 'I've never won the Lottery, but I imagine this is what it feels like.' The father-of-two made the amazing discovery as part of an online search led by the BBC's Stargazing Live programme. Scientists involved with the programme used the Lovell radio telescope at Jodrell Bank to look at the object and phoned observatories in the Canaries, and Hawaii to get more data on it. Zbigniew 'Zbish' Chetnik made the discovery of the new galaxy as part of an online search led by the BBC's Stargazing Live programme. The show is hosted by Professor Brian Cox (left) and Dara O'Briain (right) But the galaxy discovered by Mr Chetnick - who is also known as 'Zbish' - was named 9Spitch after his nickname was misheard by a television producer. Mr Chetnik added: 'The producers had asked my name and nickname, but they must have misheard Zbish as Spitch because that's what appeared on the screen, so people were suggesting 9Spitch as the object's name. 'Gravitational lensing was used to prove Einstein's general theory of relativity. 'And when they asked the public for names on the TV that was among those suggested. 'It was down to 9Stein and 9Spitch and I thought it would go to Einstein. 'But then Professor Brian Cox said it should be named after me to highlight amateur astronomy. 'I guess it's lucky in a way as Spitch was far more likely to be used then Zbish - it's much more snappier.'","Galaxy was discovered by 60-year-old engineer Zbigniew 'Zbish' Chetnik .

"Whistle-blower Edward Snowden has hit back at claims by a U.S. government official that collating phone records is not ‘surveillance’. Senator Dianne Feinstein wrote in a newspaper recently that what the NSA is gathering is not protected under the Fourth Amendment, which prohibits unreasonable searches. She wrote in USA Today on Sunday: ‘The call-records program is not surveillance. It does not collect the content of any communication, nor do the records include names or locations.’ Statement: Snowden insisted that every phone call and internet transaction made in America is logged . Dianne Feinstein has said that the NSA's phone call tracking does not breach the Fourth Amendment . She added: ‘The NSA only collects the . type of information found on a telephone bill: phone numbers of calls . placed and received, the time of the calls and duration. The Supreme . Court has held this ""metadata"" is not protected under the Fourth . Amendment.’ However Snowden, although he didn’t name the lawmaker, clearly had her comments in mind when he gave a statement to the American Civil Liberties Union about phone tracking. He said: ‘In the last four months, we've learned a lot about our government. ‘We've learned that the U.S. intelligence community secretly built a system of pervasive surveillance. Today, no telephone in America makes a call without leaving a record with the NSA. Today, no internet transaction enters or leaves America without passing through the NSA's hands. Our representatives in Congress tell us this is not surveillance. They're wrong.’ He made the statement in support of a demonstration against government privacy invasion taking place in Washington D.C on Saturday. His comment came as tensions mount between Europe and America over the alleged monitoring of leaders’ phone calls. GSM base stations, for example, make it possible to monitor mobile phones, such as that of German Chancellor Angela Merkel . The National Security Agency has monitored the phone conversations of at least 35 world leaders after being given their numbers by an official in another government department, according to a classified document leaked by Snowden. The confidential memo reveals that senior officials in 'customer' departments such the White House and the Pentagon were encouraged to share their ‘Rolodexes’ of contact details with the NSA. The agency then added the phone numbers of the foreign politicians to their surveillance systems and started to monitor them. According to the leaked document handed over to The Guardian, one unnamed official handed over 200 numbers - including those of at least 35 world leaders - none of whom were named. One of the leaders the NSA bugged was allegedly German chancellor Angela Merkel, who accused the American government on Wednesday of tapping her mobile phone, something the White House denies. European leaders united in anger Thursday as they attended a summit overshadowed by the reports of the U.S. spying on its allies.","Senator Dianne Feinstein claimed that the NSA's phone-tracking is benign .

"A British-sounding parrot called Nigel went missing for four years - and came home with a Spanish accent. Nigel, who lived in Torrance, California with his British owner, Darren Chick, flew away one day in 2010, and was gone so long he was given up for lost. But, in a case of mistaken identity, Nigel was returned to another pet owner, who was also looking for their African grey parrot, and was able to pass him on to Chick. Long gone: African grey parrot Nigel, pictured, had been without his British owner for four years and had picked up Spanish instead . However, during his long absence, Nigel had forgotten all about his British roots - and started speaking Spanish. Rather than swapping pleasantries in English, the bird now fires off a '¿Que pasa?' to passing humans, the Daily Breeze reported. After Nigel went missing, he lived in the wild - presumably around Torrance - until he was found a few months ago by a local business owner, Julissa Sperling. After hearing Nigel making noise outside her house, she took him in and searched for potential owners. Instead of his actual owner, she found an ad put out by Teresa Micco, a local vet. When the mistake emerged, Micco noticed that Nigel had a microchip, and used it to find Chick and reunite the two. Sperling, a Panamanian who speaks Spanish, said Nigel might have picked up some of her phrases while waiting in the shop. Coastal: Nigel went missing in the California town of Torrance, near Los Angeles . She said: 'He was the happiest bird. He was singing and talking without control. He was barking like the dogs. I'm from Panama and he was saying, ""What happened?"" in Spanish.' However, when Sperling handed Nigel over to Teresa Micco, a local vet, she realized he wasn't the right bird. Micco had been searching for her own African grey parrot, Benjamin, who flew away this February. But Micco was able to track down Chick with information from Nigel's microchip, and brought him home shortly after taking him in. She said: 'I introduced myself and said, ""Have you lost a bird?"" He initially said no. But he thought I meant recently.' When she verified Chick's name and said she had his African grey parrot, 'He looked at me like I was crazy.' Chick says last week's reunion brought tears of joy to his eyes - despite the fact that Nigel bit him when he first tried to pick him up. He said: 'He's doing perfect. It's really weird. I knew it was him from the minute I saw him.' Nigel is the fifth parrot guided home by Micco, who has been running ads for her own missing bird for nine months.","African grey parrot Nigel lived in California with British owner Darren Chick .

"Bayern Munich boss Pep Guardiola has admitted that Manchester United target Toni Kroos could leave the club before Friday's transfer window deadline. The midfielder reacted angrily after being substituted during his side's dramatic 2-1 comeback win against Stuttgart on Wednesday, fuelling speculation that he will head for the Munich exit. United boss David Moyes, who was pictured speaking to executive vice chairman - and chief transfer negotiator - Ed Woodward during training on Thursday, is prepared to offer £25million for the Germany star, as revealed by Sportsmail on Tuesday. VIDEO  Scroll down to see Kroos laughing with Bayern teammates in Adidas photoshoot . Plenty to discuss: Manchester United manager David Moyes (right) chats with executive vice chairman Ed Woodward (left) during training on Thursday . No Kroos control: Bayern midfielder Toni Kroos storms off against Stuttgart, raising Manchester United's hopes . A good sign for United: Kroos's display of petulance could lead to him moving to Old Trafford . Cometh the hour: Kroos (right) was substituted after just 60 minutes against Stuttgart on Wednesday . Speaking after his side's victory, Guardiola said: 'He (Kroos) is an important player but things can move fast in football. 'Here today, gone tomorrow.' Kroos threw his gloves to the ground on his walk to the dugout after being replaced by Claudio Pizarro in the 60th minute against Stuttgart. Pizarro grabbed Bayern's equaliser 16 minutes after coming on, before Thiago Alcantara executed a perfect scissor kick to secure three points in added time. Moyes watched Kroos in action against Borussia Monchengladbach last Friday night and after the game the midfielder admitted there were no plans for further talks on renewing a . contract that runs out at the end of next season and he was in the dark . over his future. Honest: Bayern boss Pep Guardiola has admitted that Kroos could leave the German champions . Kroos deal: Manchester United are keen to sign £25million-rated Bayern Munich midfielder Toni Kroos . It was . thought he was looking for a pay rise that might cause unrest in the . Bayern dressing room after chief executive Karl-Heinz Rummenigge . admitted talks were deadlocked and ruefully added that it was ‘always . about money in these negotiations.’ But Sportsmail understands the figure presented to Allianz Arena bosses is around £150,000 a week, half the weekly £300,000 dangled before Wayne Rooney to extend his Old Trafford stay. Kroos evidently believes he is well worth a salary that would edge him nearer top earners like Philipp Lahm, Bastian Schweinsteiger and Franck Ribery and is prepared to stick to his guns. Though talks have ground to a halt, Bayern are reluctant to sell and will ask for at least £25million, should they sense there is a danger of Kroos running down his current deal. On the ball: United boss Moyes watched Kroos - who wants parity with Bayern Munich's top earners, including Franck Ribery (right) - in action for the German giants last week against Borussia Monchengladbach . With United’s midfield still in need of strengthening, even after the arrival of Juan Mata, Moyes is unlikely to be deterred and will surely be encouraged by a clear signal he would have little difficulty keeping Kroos happy on the pay front. Sportsmail exclusively revealed on Saturday that Moyes, and assistants Steve Round and Phil Neville, had been met outside Monchengladbach’s ground on Friday night by one of Kroos’ advisers, Sascha Breese, who escorted them inside and sat with them throughout the game against Bayern. Sports Total, for whom Breese works, have since tried to play down claims that Kroos could be heading for Old Trafford, but Moyes has promised more significant signings before the window closes and has the 24-year old in his sights.

France are next up for Germany in the Maracana and yet we could so easily have been speaking of Algeria. They ran them so, so close. Germany’s Arsenal defender Per Mertesacker hit back at criticism of his team’s performance. ‘Would you rather we played beautiful football but got knocked out?’ he snapped, visibly upset at the harsh tone of questioning by the German media after the match.

But it doesn’t matter how . we’ve done it, the main thing is we’re in the quarter-finals. There was a . bit of luck involved in my goal and we’ve got to play better against . France.’ There is a nagging suspicion that Germany are playing . tournament football, with Low’s team keeping their opponents at arm’s . length as they prepare for the latter stages. Algeria, by contrast . were focused at the back and electrifying on the break.

"The National Security Agency has monitored the phone conversations of at least 35 world leaders after being given their numbers by an official in another government department, according to a classified document leaked by whistle-blower Edward Snowden. The confidential memo reveals that senior officials in 'customer' departments such the White House and the Pentagon were encouraged to share their ‘Rolodexes’ of contact details with the NSA. The agency then added the phone numbers of the foreign politicians to their surveillance systems and started to monitor them. The NSA has monitored the phone conversations of at least 35 world leaders according to the latest leak of classified government information to emerge from Edward Snowden . According to the leaked document handed over to The Guardian, one unnamed official handed over 200 numbers - including those of at least 35 world leaders - none of whom were named. The revelation comes amid mounting diplomatic tensions between the US and its allies, after the German chancellor Angela Merkel accused the American government on Wednesday of tapping her mobile phone. The White House has denied that it is currently listening in on Merkel's phone calls. Spokesman . Jay Carney said on Wednesday that 'the United States is not monitoring and will not . monitor the communications of the chancellor.' GSM base stations, for example, make it possible to monitor mobile phones, such as that of German Chancellor Angela Merkel . But German newspaper Der Spiegel noted that the White House . spokesperson 'did not wish to specify' whether the U.S. denied . monitoring Merkel's communications in the past. European leaders united in anger Thursday as they attended a summit overshadowed by reports of widespread U.S. spying on its allies. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the allegations had shattered trust in the Obama administration and undermined the crucial trans-Atlantic relationship. Merkel's unusually stern remarks as she arrived at the European Union gathering indicated she wasn't placated by a phone conversation she had Wednesday with President Barack Obama, or his personal assurances that the U.S. is not listening in on her calls now. 'We need trust among allies and partners,' Merkel told reporters in Brussels. 'Such trust now has to be built anew. This is what we have to think about.' 'The United States of America and Europe face common challenges. We are allies,' the German leader said. 'But such an alliance can only be built on trust. That's why I repeat again: spying among friends, that cannot be.' Controversy: The National Security Agency (NSA) headquarters in Fort Meade, Maryland has been at the centre of a developing diplomatic row since Edward Snowden leaked documents . This . latest leak lends weight to claims that surveillance of national . leaders - even allies - is not only routine practise but that the NSA . isn’t shy about asking other US officials for their help. The memo dates from October 2006 and so was written halfway through George W Bush's second term. It . was issued to staff in the agency's Signals Intelligence Directorate . (SID) and was titled ‘Customers Can Help SID Obtain Targetable Phone . Numbers’. Officials who mixed with world leaders and politicians were encouraged to provide information that could help with surveillance. ‘In . one recent case,’ the memo noted, ‘a US official provided NSA with 200 . phone numbers to 35 world leaders … Despite the fact that the majority . is probably available via open source, the PCs [intelligence production . centers] have noted 43 previously unknown phone numbers. These numbers . plus several others have been tasked.’ The White House has denied the claims that U.S. intelligence has been listening in on Merkel's phone (Obama pictured this week) The . document explained that the new phone numbers had helped the agency . discover more new contact details to add to their monitoring, but . acknowledged that eavesdropping on the numbers had produced ‘little . reportable intelligence.’ The memo then asks analysts to think about useful contact details that they might be able to provide. ‘This . success leads S2 [signals intelligence] to wonder if there are NSA . liaisons whose supported customers may be willing to share their . 'Rolodexes' or phone lists with NSA as potential sources of . intelligence,"" it states. ""S2 welcomes such information!"" On . Thursday Carney told reporters: 'The [NSA] revelations have clearly . caused tension in our relationships with some countries, and we are . dealing with that through diplomatic channels. 'These . are very important relations both economically and for our security, . and we will work to maintain the closest possible ties.'","A NSA memo requesting contact details from senior foreign officials be provided by other government departments have been leaked .

"A Virgin Atlantic plane carrying British tourists to a Caribbean island came close to catastrophe when it landed on debris that had washed onto the runway during a storm. The underside of the aircraft was torn open when pilots landed the plane in treacherous conditions in St Lucia on Christmas Eve. Water and mud lay on the runway after a nearby river burst its banks. Scroll down for video . But pilots of the Virgin Atlantic plane are said to have been given no warning of the storm as they prepared to land. One unconfirmed report suggested the plane had hit a large luggage container that had come loose in the storm. The weather station at Hewanorra International Airport had been washed away in the flood. Pilots on the Airbus A330 had been given instructions to land when the river ‘Petite Riviere Du Vieux Fort’ suddenly burst its banks. Escape: One unconfirmed report suggested the plane had hit a large luggage container that had come loose in the storm . Debris from the flood ripped through parts of the body of the plane and its landing gear sustained ‘substantial damage’. The pilots managed to bring the aircraft to a stop on the waterlogged runway, and passengers were unharmed. The return flight that was scheduled to bring Virgin passengers back to the UK was cancelled because of the damaged aircraft. Passengers were stranded in storm-hit St Lucia until Boxing Day when the airport reopened. Danger: Pilots on the Airbus A330 (file picture) had been given instructions to land when the river 'Petite Riviere Du Vieux Fort' suddenly burst its banks . A spokesman for Virgin Atlantic said 18 passengers had been on the Airbus when it landed in St Lucia. An investigation has now been launched to determine what happened. The flood in St Lucia was caused by a deluge on the Caribbean island when almost 7in of rain fell in the space of 24 hours. The storm washed away roads and bridges on the island and killed at least six people.","Underside was torn open when pilots landed in treacherous conditions .

"More than half of London's top property sales last year went to overseas buyers, with Russian nationals topping the league after UK house-hunters. Russian nationals are understood to have acquired £266million-plus homes in the capital, spending a staggering £429million. People from the UK purchased 2,183 of the 4,510 homes sold in this price bracket in 2010, according to the data. Steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal's £70million property in Kensington Palace Gardens was bought in 2008 . One Hyde Park has 86 residential properties marketed with prices starting at around £20 million (left) and Roman Abramovich's house in Knightsbridge (right) In addition, research from Lloyds TSB earlier this month found that sales of homes worth at least £1million recently reached their highest level since the peak of the housing market in 2007. Strong demand from wealthy cash-rich . buyers, both in the UK and from overseas, as well as limited supply of . such properties is thought to have boosted sales. It is the latest evidence that Britain is increasingly seen as a save haven for assets during the worsening financial crisis. A number of the world's most wealthy people, including non-Britons Indian steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal and Roman Abramovich have properties in London. And many of the 86 residential properties at the Candy Brothers' One Hyde Park, marketed with prices starting at around £20 million, have been snapped up by foreigners. Here are the top 10 purchasers of £1 . million-plus properties London in 2010, the estimated number of . properties purchased and their worth, according to HBC: . 1. UK 2,183 £3,517,122,197 . 2.

Aircraft manufacturer Hawker Beechcraft Corporation (HBC), which partly based its analysis on Land Registry data, believes that the large number of foreign buyers of prime property in London has contributed to an increase in business flights to some of the region's main business airports. Sean McGeough, HBC president, Europe, Middle East and Africa, said: 'As one of the most desirable cities in the world, it's no surprise that London's property market is attracting a large number of overseas buyers. 'Given that many of these individuals lead busy lives and often travel a huge amount, this helps explain the rise in flights to London's business airports.' HBC found that the number of business flights to Biggin Hill, London City and Farnborough increased by 46 per cent, 38 per cent and 34 per cent respectively between January and September.","After UK house-hunters, Russians top the league .

"In the battle to be the most extravagant mega yacht on the seas, it takes a lot to really impress. While helipads, waterslides, and movie theatres are commonplace additions to the yachts of the super wealthy, a stylish Italian vessel is making waves for being the first  to feature a floating drive-in garage. J'ade, by Ferretti group company CRN, features a hydraulic-operated hatch which can store an eight-metre speedboat without the use of a tender lift to hoist it out of the water. Scroll down for video . Innovative: The 196-foot yacht has a hydraulic-operated hatch which can store an eight-metre speedboat without the use of a tender lift to hoist it out of the water . Floating fortress: While swimming pools and helipads are commonplace on many a mega yacht, J'ade features the world's first floating garage . Glide in: The internal basin floods and empties 18,000 litres of water in just three minutes, allowing the boat to enter the yacht without the use of a crane . The internal basin, which holds 18,000 litres of water, floods and empties in just three minutes, enabling the boat (a 27ft Riva Iseo) to enter the yacht without using a crane. When the speedboat is not being stored inside, the basin can also be utilised as an indoor ocean pool, accessible from the lower-deck terrace. Completed last year, the 60-metre yacht was the star attraction at last week's Monaco Yacht Show, where it was a finalist  for the Best Interior award, only to miss out on the prize to the brand-new Perini Navi motor yacht Grace E. J'ade made its debut at the annual yacht show last year, and also won the World Yacht Trophy at the 2013 International Boat Show. Honey, I'm home: The one-of-a-kind  garage enables the owner to access the yacht from their speed boat internally, via the vessel's plush lower deck . Multi-purpose: When the speedboat is not being stored, the basin can also be used as an internal ocean pool, located just behind this luxury terrace . Beauty: The vessel won the World Yacht Trophy at the 2013 International Boat Show and was nominated for Best Interior at the 2014 Monaco Yacht Show . The privately-owned yacht was created by Studio Zuccon International Project, and is designed to feel 'at one with the sea'. The 196-foot vessel can comfortable accommodate 10 guests in four cabins and the owner suite, and 13 crew members. Aside from the impressive 'garage', J'ade also features a gymnasium, hammam room and aquarium. Across the four decks, materials for the interiors are Canaletto walnut and polished rosewood. The hardwood floors are made of wide Afromosia strips and the cabins and owner suite are fitted with white Tai Ping carpets. There are jade green accents throughout the interior. A life of luxury: Guests on board the J'Ade can also soak up the sun on one of the vessel's comfy lounging areas, located across all four of the  decks . Pool on board: If a swim in the ocean becomes a bit daunting for those on board, guests can take a dip in this on-deck plunge pool . Spa: The mega yacht also features a gymnasium and mosaic-tiled hammam room (pictured), where guests can sit back and unwind after a day at sea . No expense spared: The privately-owned yacht was designed for the owner's specific tastes, and includes a round bath in the boat's marble master suite . Made for entertaining: Guests on board the vessel, created by Studio Zuccon International Project, can be sure of a place to sit at several indoor and outdoor living areas . The centrepiece of the yacht is the central stairwell with a crystal lift. A white Yamaha piano sits in the living area. ‘CRN is experimenting,’ Luca Boldrini, CRN’s sales director told Boat International. ‘We’re experimenting in design, in sizes, and in features. Each of the yachts in build has special features in development, and we hope the next step will be to mix and match all these new features in one or two new concepts so future owners can not only have a beautiful, seaworthy and safe vessel, but they can have special features that nobody else has. 'These will not be special features that are just an experiment, but features clients can touch and feel in other vessels under construction or already floating.’ 'At one with the sea': Oversized windows were purpose-built to take advantage of the sea views, and anyone lucky enough to stay in this cabin can also enjoy a balcony terrace, giving them an even better panorama across the ocean . Musical tastes: Got musical guests on board? They can tinkle the ivories on this stunning white Yamaha piano, which takes pride of place in the living area . All at sea: The well-appointed living area combines elegant sofas with driftwood coffee tables and shell-inspired sculptures and bowls to give the room a nautical flavour . Anyone for dinner? The formal dining table comfortably seats 12 guests, while after dinner guests can relax with a digestif on the adjacent seating area . Informal: When the dining table is a bit too formal, breakfast and lunch can be taken on the terrace, with this round table comfortably seating nine people .

"A chemical compound found in spicy curries could help reduce the risk of developing bowel cancer, a study has found. Researchers gave capsaicin, which gives chilli peppers their heat, to mice genetically prone to developing multiple tumours in their gastrointestinal tract. The capsaicin triggered a pain receptor in the cells lining their intestines, setting off a reaction that reduced the risk of growing colorectal tumours. Scroll down for video . Researchers gave capsaicin, which gives chilli peppers their heat, to mice genetically prone to developing multiple tumours in their gastrointestinal tract . Scientists found that the treatment extended the lifespan of the mice by more than 30 per cent. And it was even more effective when combined with celecoxib, an anti-inflammatory drug already approved for treating some forms of arthritis. Bowel cancer is the third most common type of cancer in the UK, with doctors diagnosing an average of 41,000 new cases of the disease every year. The study, published in The Journal of Clinical Investigation, recommended that patients at risk of getting colon or rectal cancers should be given capsaicin as part of their diet to inhibit tumour growth. Capsaicin is already used as an analgesic . in topical ointments, where it acts as an irritant overwhelming nerves . reducing their ability to report pain for extended periods of time. It . is also used in pepper spray. The receptor or ion channel that is triggered by the capsicin - called TRPV1 - was originally discovered in sensory neurons reacting to heat, acidity and spicy chemicals in the environment. The study, published in The Journal of Clinical Investigation, recommended that patients at risk of getting colon cancer, pictured, or rectal cancer should be given capsaicin as part of their diet to inhibit tumour growth . But the study found TPRV1 was also expressed by epithelial cells in the lining of the intestines, where it is activated by epidermal growth factor receptor or EGFR. EGFR was an important driver of cell proliferation in the intestines, whose epithelial lining is replaced approximately every four to six days. Dr Petrus de Jong added: 'A basic level of EGFR activity is required to maintain the normal cell turnover in the gut. However, if EGFR signaling is left unrestrained, the risk of sporadic tumor development increases.' They found that mice genetically modified to be TRPV1-deficient suffered higher-than-normal rates of intestinal tumour growths. Dr Petrus de Jong added: 'These results showed us that epithelial TRPV1 normally works as a tumour suppressor in the intestines.' Molecular studies of human colorectal cancer samples recently uncovered multiple mutations in the TRPV1 gene, though there was no direct evidence that TRPV1 deficiency was a risk factor for colorectal cancer in humans. Dr Raz added:  ‘Our data suggest that individuals at high risk of developing recurrent intestinal tumours may benefit.’","Researchers gave capsicin, which gives chilli peppers their heat, to mice .

"Maths teachers are to be flown in from China to help arrest declining standards in Britain. Sixty English-speaking teachers from Shanghai will be placed in schools from September to promote methods such as rigorous daily maths lessons and homework, ministers will announce today. The move, brokered by Education Minister Liz Truss following a fact-finding trip to China, is the latest in a series of initiatives aimed at reversing a slide in maths standards. It follows research showing that the children of cleaners and catering assistants in Shanghai were better at maths than the children of doctors and lawyers in Britain. English-speaking teachers from China will be flown in to British schools to promote more rigorous methods of teaching maths. It follows a slide in ability in British pupils (library image) The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development study found that youngsters from deprived backgrounds in Shanghai were the equivalent of a year of school ahead of UK children from wealthy homes with well-educated parents. Under the deal,  up to 60 teachers from Shanghai will  be sent to 30 English schools designated centres of excellence for maths. The teachers will demonstrate their methods to their English counterparts, who will in turn assist other schools locally to emulate the approach. The Chinese staff will promote methods such as teaching to the top – where lessons are pitched at bright pupils, while also ensuring middle and lower ability pupils are catered for. Other techniques include helping struggling pupils one-on-one and giving daily maths lessons, homework and feedback. They are expected to emphasise a ‘can-do’ attitude. The idea was proposed by Liz Truss following a fact-finding trip to the country. They will champion traditional maths methods such as long division and multiplication, and teaching by specialist maths teachers for children as young as six. The aim is that they will spread best practice to English staff through demonstration and masterclasses, rather than taking charge of classes. Two maths teachers from each of the 30 English maths ‘hubs’ will work in China for at least a month to learn their world-class teaching techniques. Shanghai teenagers emerged as the best-performing in the world in the maths tests run by the OECD. Fifteen-year-olds were on average three years ahead of their UK counterparts. The UK was ranked 26th, with our performance found to have stagnated between 2006 and 2012. Mrs Truss said: ‘We have some brilliant maths teachers in this country but what I saw in Shanghai, and other Chinese cities, has only strengthened my belief that we can learn from them. They have a can-do attitude to maths – and I want us to match that.’ National Numeracy chief executive Mike Ellicock said the report on differences between Britain and China had shown that ‘in Shanghai the kids work immeasurably harder than the teachers’, while the UK ‘teachers work immeasurably harder than the kids’. Chinese pupils were significantly more likely to believe that hard work, rather than innate ability, was important in maths, he said.","Teachers put in schools from September to promote Chinese methods .

"A poor Chinese mother who was left horrifically disfigured by 70 large tumours growing on her face can smile once again after a hospital carried out the transforming surgery for free. Li Hongfang, 40, was shunned in public after a rare type of bone cancer caused tissue to grow under her skin, distorting her features beyond recognition. She was forced to endure the condition, known as Chordoma, for more than a decade because she had no money to pay for the surgery. But after her plight touched hearts . around the world, shaming the country's ailing health . service on a global stage, a . hospital in Xi'an, capital of northwest China's Shaanxi Province, . offered to carry out the surgery,  which normally costs £60,000, for free. Transformation: Li Hongfang, whose face was left horrifically disfigured by 70 large tumours, is transformed after a hospital carried out the surgery for free . Ms Li, a farmer from Tianchao village, Xianyang, in northwest China's Shaanxi Province,  said she still hadn't looked at herself properly in a mirror. She said: 'I feel my head is lighter, and I must look better. I want to save the big time to the time when the surgery swelling goes down. It could be the best gift to me.' Misery: For years Li, 40, was shunned in public after a rare type of bone cancer caused tissue to grow under her skin, distorting her features beyond recognition . Chief surgeon Guo Shuzhong said Li's . surgery had been very successful and later in the year she will go under . the knife again to remove tumours in her skull, nasal cavities and . throat. Speaking before she went in for her operation Li said: 'I am so grateful to the people who made this happen.' 'I just want to look normal again, like I feel inside. I'm not a monster and I don't want to look like one.' Ms Li originally thought the first swelling on her forehead, which appeared in 2001, was an infected insect bite. 'It didn't even itch or ache in any way – but it also didn't go away and in fact just got bigger and bigger,' she said. But the lump grew bigger and in 2005 she underwent surgery to remove it. But, not long after more bumps appeared on her face and she was diagnosed as suffering from chordoma. While the tumours were benign meaning . Li's life was never in danger, her face quickly became disfigured and . was soon being shunned in public. Ms Li was living with her . husband and two sons at the time, in Tianchao village, Qianxian county, . in west China’s Shaanxi province. She said: 'We didn't have much money . but we were very happy and we loved each other and our two boys. I would . say life was good then.' Soon afterwards, her sorrows increased after her husband died. By 2009 she met Guo Yingping, 40, an . orphan, and the two became friends and later married. Her two sons, now . aged 17 and 14, have now left home to work. At the start of July Ms Li underwent . an operation to remove seven tumours from her face and she checked out . of hospital a week ago. Tens of millions of Chinese people, particularly those living in the countryside, cannot access a doctor or afford treatment. Officials . are debating a programme which aims to provide health insurance for all . its 1.3billion people by 2020, but at present, the health system falls . far behind the needs of those it is supposed to be treating.

"Hundreds of passengers wait patiently to be rescued yesterday after being trapped in the Channel Tunnel. Many took selfies and other photos of the scene as they were evacuated from a car shuttle train which hit fallen power cables eight miles in. The incident blocked one of the tunnel’s two tracks for most of the day, throwing the travel plans of thousands of holidaymakers and other passengers into chaos. Massive queues built up at London St Pancras and Folkestone. Scroll down for video . Stranded: Hundreds of passengers were left stranded in the Channel Tunnel and forced to get off their train and walk along a service tunnel (pictured) after a massive power failure . Stranded: Services through the tunnel to France had to be be suspended as people were forced off the train and evacuated. Services through the tunnel is now running with long delays . Stuck: The Channel Tunnel is designed in a way which means that if a train breaks down inside, services can still run through the length of the tunnel. The train broke down in the north tunnel, which runs trains from the UK to France. Passengers were taken off the train via a service tunnel and onto a new train in the south tunnel, which then continued to Calais, returning to the correct tunnel using one of two under-water cross over points . There were fears of a knock-on effect today but operator Eurotunnel said it hoped services would return to normal by this morning. BBC newsreader Sophie Raworth was among those whose plans were hit. Her Eurostar train took five hours to make the journey from London to Lille instead of the normal 90 minutes. The incident began at about 7.30am when the Eurotunnel shuttle service from Folkestone to Calais ground to a halt about a quarter of the way into its journey. Some 20 minutes later, nearly 400 passengers – and four dogs – were ordered to abandon their vehicles and were ushered by officials and emergency services into the service tunnel that runs between the two main rail tunnels. They were given evacuation packs containing a pen, notepad, playing cards, torch, fan, water and wet wipes. Passenger Richard Byrom said: ‘All of a sudden I heard this crashing noise. It didn’t sound like the train itself had crashed but it came to a grinding halt. There was this scraping sound, like the cables were entangled. For about 20 minutes the train just stopped and we didn’t know what had happened. ‘Eventually they said they are going to take us off because they couldn’t move our train.’ After a half-hour wait, they walked to the other rail tunnel to board a train sent from Calais to pick them up. Eurotunnel blamed the incident on fallen power cables but said it was unclear how it had happened. A spokesman said the affected train had suddenly lost power and come to a ‘controlled stop’, adding: ‘We know it was a problem linked to the overhead power supply but we don’t know what exactly caused it.’ Services were delayed or cancelled as the broken down shuttle was hauled to Calais where, some eight hours later, the passengers were reunited with their vehicles. Those trains that ran to and from France took it in turns to use the track that remained operational. Many drivers booked to use the shuttle service opted to take ferries from Dover instead, causing long tailbacks on the M20. Stuck: Services from London to Paris to Brussels are delayed are cancelled because of queues forming at either end of the Channel Tunnel because of the blockage . Aftermath: Because Eurostar also uses the same tunnel, huge queues have formed at London St Pancras . Crowds: British Transport Police have been brought in to manage problems as queues build in London . 'Queues are building up': Eurostar said it had had to cancel four services today and warned passengers to expect delays to ones that are able to run . Eurostar passengers in London were warned of five-hour delays – or told their train had been cancelled and they would have to rebook. Gavin Nicholls, 37, from Edinburgh, going on holiday with his wife and son to Slovenia via Paris, said: ‘If we can’t travel today and we have to rebook our connecting tickets, it could be a nightmare. It could cost us more than £1,000.’ Simon Clark, 44, from Bedford, said: ‘They said our train has been cancelled and to book another ticket, but there’s a massive queue.’ Newsreader Miss Raworth tweeted: ‘Stuck outside Channel Tunnel entrance at Folkestone... I’m only going for the day!’ Later she tweeted: ‘Crew on the 8:58 London to Brussels were great ... & handing out free chocolate.’ Miss Raworth spoke to BBC news bulletins from the halted train to describe her ordeal. On reaching Lille, she tweeted: ‘5 hours later... made it! I’d be delighted if it weren’t for the fact I’m on #eurostar home in 6 hrs. In theory...’ Also delayed was new Ukip MEP Patrick O’Flynn. He wants Britain to get out of Europe – but waited three hours trying to get in. Eurotunnel said it would work through last night to fix the power lines and hoped services would return to normal by 6.30am today. But there were fears the Tour de France would face disruption. The riders flew out from London City Airport but more than 1,000 support vehicles were seeking to cross the Channel by ferry last night. Cross section: The Channel Tunnel is about 40 metres below the sea bed, has two main tunnels and a central service tunnel connected to both at 375 metre intervals. The south tunnel goes from France to the UK and the north from the UK to France . The south tunnel takes trains from France to the UK and the north tunnel from the UK to France. A smaller service tunnel runs between them and is connected to both at 375 metre intervals. This allows access for maintenance and emergency services and also serves as a safe haven if . passengers need to be evacuated from their train in an incident. In order to deal with blockages, the two main tunnels are each split into three 'intervals'. These are designed in a way which means that if a train breaks down inside, services can still run through the length of the tunnel. This is possible because the Channel Tunnel has two undersea crossovers allowing trains to pass from one tunnel to the other to avoid and isolate a section of tunnel that is blocked. Today almost 400 people were walked from interval two in the north tunnel into the service tunnel and then into a train waiting in interval one in the the south tunnel. The train then used a crossover to take it back into interval four and then along the correct tunnel that nearly always takes services to France. Throughout today trains from France to Britain will take the same route for ninety minutes and then will be forced to wait as trains from Britain to France do the same. This means that services will still run under the Channel but with long delays because of the queuing system in place until the train blocking the tunnel is removed.","Hundreds of passengers were evacuated from inside broken-down Eurotunnel train on way to France this morning .

"Twenty-four current and former Internal Revenue Service employees have been charged with stealing government benefits, federal prosecutors said Wednesday. The IRS employees were indicted on charges that they illegally received more than $250,000 in benefits including unemployment insurance payments, food stamps, welfare, and housing vouchers, the U.S. attorney's office in Memphis said in a news release. Prosecutors say 13 of the IRS employees face federal charges of lying about being unemployed while applying for or recertifying their government benefits. They each face up to five years in prison if convicted of making false statements to receive the benefits. Busted: Twenty-four current and former Internal Revenue Service employees have been charged with stealing government benefits, federal prosecutors said Wednesday . Eleven others face state charges of theft of property over $1,000, a felony that can carry a sentence of probation up to 12 years in prison if they are convicted. 'While these IRS employees were supposed to be serving the public, they were instead brazenly stealing from law-abiding American taxpayers,' U.S. Attorney Edward Stanton said in a statement. Those charged range in ages from 28 to 64. They include residents of Memphis, Jackson, Tennessee, and Southaven, Mississippi. 'The taxes that we pay are supposed to support our nation and assist individuals in need, not free-loaders who are gaming the system,' said Amy Weirich, the district attorney for Shelby County. Tax evasion: Prosecutors say 13 of the IRS employees face federal charges of lying about being unemployed while applying for or recertifying their government benefits . Prosecutors scheduled, then canceled, a news conference to announce the indictments. U.S. attorney's office spokesman Rodney King said the cancellation was due to 'unforeseen events,' without elaborating. King would not say whether the cancellation was related to the investigation into two letters sent to President Barack Obama and a Mississippi senator that indicated they contained poisonous ricin. The FBI says the letters were postmarked Memphis.","Twenty-four current and former Internal Revenue Service employees charged today with stealing government benefits .

"Just 40 days before the nation hosts the FIFA World Cup, a soccer fan in Brazil has died after being hit in the head by a toilet bowl thrown following a match in the host city of Recife. Paul Ricardo Gomes da Silva was killed after Santa Cruz played Parana at the Arruda stadium on Friday, when rioting fans ripped three toilet bowls from restrooms and dropped them on crowds below the stands. Estimated to have landed with more than 750 pounds of force, the 26-year-old fan died instantly and his mother, Joelma told local radio, 'They killed my son and me too - I would not wish the pain I am suffering on anybody.' Scroll Down for the Video . Impact: The toilet bowl is visible in the far left of the picture about to land on the ground . Murder: The wrapped body of Paulo Ricardo Silva, 26, a soccer fan who was killed in clashes between fans, lies on a street as policemen (back) stand nearby outside Arruda stadium after a soccer match between Brazilian soccer teams Parana and Santa Cruz, in Recife on Friday . Recife is one of the host cities of the World Cup, due to start on 12 June and Brazil's soccer association decided on Saturday to ban matches in the Arruda stadium until an investigation has concluded. 'The toilet was thrown from the stands and hit him full on,' said police captain Wilson Queiroz to Globesporte. 'The victim was with someone at the time but everyone fled the scene after the incident.' Five tournament games will be played in Recife, although none at the Arruda. The city will host World Cup matches at the new Arena Pernambuco. Local television stations reported that Da Silva had become involved in a quarrel with different groups of opposing fans following the match that drew about 8,000 supporters. The Brazilian soccer federation announced it was 'preventively closing' the Arruda stadium until authorities complete their investigation. Investigation: Ricardo Silva was killed outside the stadium late on Friday when he was hit by a toilet bowl thrown from the stands, according to local media . Aftermath: The toilet is shown to have smashed on impact and scattered the crowd . Meanwhile, in Natal, soccer fans became involved in a clash before a match between rival clubs ABC and America in an exhibition at the Arena das Dunas on Saturday. Police officer Roberto Andrade told the UOL website that the fighting started when a tiny group of America fans crossed into the path of irate ABC supporters traveling to the stadium. The ABC fans ran after the rival group, pelting rocks at them until police intervened. Andrade said fans from both clubs were arrested and taken to a police station for questioning. The match marked the only official test event at the Arena das Dunas before the World Cup in June. The stadium will host four tournament matches. Violence involving fan groups are very common in Brazil, and the number of incidents increased last year. FIFA and Brazilian authorities have downplayed concerns about violence inside stadiums during the World Cup, saying security will be tight. Venue: A police officer in Recife said the death occurred on Friday at Arruda Stadium (seen here) after a second-division match between Santa Cruz and visiting Parana . Modern: Recife has built a new stadium, the Pernambuco Arena (pictured), for four World Cup matches on the city's outskirts .

"Barely skin and bones, this emaciated dog was abandoned on a street and left to die. As the Rottweiler, called Tiny, lay in the pound, his carers thought he had given up hope. But a British owner took him in, helped him recover, and now this once decrepit animal has won the title of 'Best Dog'. These staggering images show the miraculous transformation he made after he was picked up from a Taiwanese dog's home by Sean McCormack. Before and after: The Rottweiler was left for dead in a Taiwanese dog's home, but has since made a staggering recovery after a British expat took him in . Skeleton: He was virtually skin and bones and covered in cuts when he was rescued from the pound . Rescued: British expat Sean McCormack's (pictured) charity took the dog in and took him to the vet for treatment . His amazing recovery was recognised during The Ruffs, the RSPCA's alternative to Crufts. Mr McCormack, 46, said: 'When I first saw Tiny he was big, clearly very sick and, we were told, aggressive so we we agreed to take him in. 'At first, I thought he was a mastiff, because he was in such a bad state that it wasn't clear to me what breed he really was. 'But my friend Jeff, who has two very lucky rescued Rottweilers, knew right away that Tiny was a Rottie. 'His progress was slow but obvious to see, and he turned out to be one of the lucky ones who don't relapse into full-blown mange from time to time.' Despite fears Tiny was an aggressive animal, he was 'one of the sweetest' animals they had encountered at The Sanctuary. In pain: Mr McCormack, 46, said Tiny was clearly very sick when he first saw him at The Sanctuary dog's home . Health: The staggering images show how successful the transformation has been. Laeila Pereira, a volunteer at the shelter who is looking after him . said: 'He looked like he had given up on life.' Dr. Yang at YangMing Veterinary Hospital in Taipei was the vet who helped with Tiny's recovery. Mr McCormack said: 'Dr Yang is the one to thank for Tiny's amazing recovery, though we also believe that the natural, happy environment we provide and the healthy, raw diet we feed all our animals played their part in his speedy recuperation. 'We knew we could cure him, but were astounded at what a fantastic dog had been hidden beneath the disease and depression that riddled him when he first came in.' More than 300,000 people logged onto the RSPCA's Facebook page to vote for Tiny in The Ruffs awards. Given up: Tiny had a drawn face and deep eyes when after he had been cruelly abandoned on the street. He required extensive treatment to get him back to full health . Mr McCormack said: 'We are all over . the moon that Tiny was crowned Grand Champion of Ruffs 2014 and hope it . serves as food for thought for all those rescue organisations that kill . animals like Tiny in order to ""end their suffering"".' He is now being looked after by Laeila Pereira, a volunteer at the shelter. Miss Pereira said: 'He looked like he had given up on life. I fell immediately in . love with the large, loveable Rottie with an ironic name. Personality: Initially, volunteers feared he would be an aggressive dog, but he turned out to be 'sweet' 'I moved into a new apartment just so I could adopt him. He is now a beautiful and very well loved dog.' Mr McCormack, originally from Folkestone, Kent, moved to Taiwan 15 years ago and set up The Sanctuary to look after unwanted animals which are unlikely to be rehomed. He cares for feral cats, pigs which outgrew apartments they were kept in, orphaned baby squirrels, and lots of dogs, once-aggressive or fearful, blind and disabled. But The Sanctuary is now facing an uncertain future after its landlady told Sean she wants to sell the property which is home to 200 rescued animals. They face the prospect of being made homeless. Mr McCormack added: 'We are starting an IndieGoGo campaign and hoping to use Tiny's story and Ruffs victory to help bring international attention to our plight. 'We're looking to buy a beautiful 2.5-acre site to give our dogs, cats, pigs, rabbits, squirrels, pigeons, hedgehog, budgerigar, and, very soon, deer a permanent happy home.'","Dog rescued from a Taiwanese dog pound after being taken there to die .

"Whether you use serums, oil or gels, for most of us, lovely locks are an everyday essential. But for the Afar tribe who live along Ethiopia's northeastern border with Djibouti and Eritrea, the pursuit of a gorgeous 'do involves one very unusual ingredient. Their distinctive 'asdago' afro hairstyle is created using butter, which lends their locks a slightly ashy appearance as well as protecting it from the sun and keeping it perfectly supple. And it's not just asdago hairdos that benefit from a spot of butter: another look, the 'dayta', also relies on dairy as a means of keeping the elaborate curls, created using a stick, in place. Elaborate: This man's intricate dayta hairstyle bears clear traces of the large amount of buttery unguent needed to create it . Looking good: An Afar man shows off his buttered asdago haircut, accessorised with a natty beaded grip. Using butter on hair is common among the Afar tribe . View from the back: A man shows off his elaborate dayta hairstyle, which is created using a long stick to make the curls that are held in place using butter . Elaborate: The datya hairstyle starts life as an asdago afro but is transformed into an elaborate curled affair using a long stick and liberal amounts of butter . Effective: The liberal use of butter keeps curls in place for days, as well as keeping hair supple and moisturised and helping to protect the scalp from the sun . 'They apply the butter to keep the curls in place,' explains photographer Eric Lafforgue. 'They look a little bit like Victorian ladies, or, if you prefer, Rastas. The curls are full of cow fat and butter.' The Afars, who are grouped into unique mini-kingdoms, each ruled by its own sultan, also like across the border in neigbouring Eritrea and suffered much persecution under the Communist Derg regime. More than 20 years after dictator Mengistu Haile Mariam was forced to flee, the people's fortunes - and talent for hairdressing - have recovered, although like other tribes living traditional lifestyles, they are under threat from encroaching modernity. Impressive though the Afars' grasp of hair dressing is, they aren't the only Ethiopians to use butter to keep their hair in tip top condition. The Karrayyu,  are an ancient nomadic group who live in the Awash Valley in the Fantalle district of Ethiopia, also create elaborate looks using the foodstuff. Sadly, like the Afar, their way of life is also under threat, largely as a result of persecution during the last century of their ethnic parent group, the Oromo, as well as the establishment of national parks and the construction of sugar and cotton plantations which have deprived them of their land. Accessories: The asdago hairstyle, the starting point for the more elaborate dayta hairdo, is often accessorised with beautifully beaded hairpins . Colourful: A group of Afar people show off their elaborate hairstyles and beautifully bright patterned textiles. They also carry traditional weapons . Looking ahead: Although encroaching modernity is the greatest threat to the Afar way of life, the people aren't averse to embracing innovations such as sunglasses . Sultans: The Afar tribe is divided into kingdoms, each with its own sultans - all of whom make a living from their cattle . Persecuted: The Afar tribe suffered appallingly under the regime of dictator Mengistu but their fortunes - and hairdressing skills - have since recovered . Traditional: Men from the Karrayyu tribe cover their beautifully  cut afro hairstyles, known as gunfura, with butter as a means of keeping the look in place . Dwindling: Thanks to land grabs, the Karrayyu, famed for their hairstyle and their traditional Gada ceremony, are facing an uncertain future . Tribesman from the Karrayyu tribe wear their head in a distinctive afro hairstyle called a gunfura, and will make a hole in it when married and add butter to it . Unique: Newlywed Karrayyu young men make a hole in their gunfura and put some butter in the morning, which runs down their necks as they go about their business . The Karrayyu also practice the Gada . system, an ancient and complex form of African democracy which is . traditionally based on the passing on of power from one generation to . another every eight years. The rules, which divide the tribespeople into around 11 strictly-observed group, governs . the life of individuals in Oromo society from birth to death, . controlling everything from economics, art, history, property ownership . and making laws. Every . eight years under a full moon, around 10,000 people - strictly no . tourists - gather for the Gada ceremony to transfer power from one group . to the next. There's no . such prohibition on watching the Karrayyu hairdressers at work however, . creating intricate looks that can take up to a day to complete. 'Karrayyu young men who are newly married make a hole in their ""gunfura"" (afro haircut) and put some butter in the morning, reveals Lafforgue. 'All day long, the butter goes through the hair and down in the neck. It's natural for them!' And the buttery look isn't reserved solely for the men, as Lafforgue points out: 'Karrayyu girls also put butter on the hair. Sometimes you can see the men from the family spitting on the top of the head full of butter, which, although it sounds disgusting, is actually a blessing.' Blessing: A man blesses his sister by spitting on the top of her head as her hairdo is completed and right, a man neatens up his friend's hairdo . A young girl from the Karrayyu tribe makes some shampoo with butter. Sometime men from her family will spit on her butter-covered head, which is seen as a blessing .

The Hamar, a semi-nomadic tribe . of cattle herders, have a set of unique rituals surrounding the use of . butter as a beauty product. The food is most often used by newly-wed . women, who are completely covered in a butter and ochre mixture and shut . in their home alone for six months after the wedding to ensure that any . child she has belongs to her husband. But . it's not solely a wedding tradition: Women also use the mixture to keep . their dreadlocks in place. 'Hamer women use butter and a little red soilto put on their dreadlocks, explains Lafforgue. 'They . put so much that it streams down the back and looks a lot like blood.' To keep the look tidy, regular haircuts are also on offer, although as . Lafforgue explains, they aren't of the type found in a high street . salon. 'They take a stone and a knife to cut them with,' he explains. 'A few minutes and it is done!' Elaborate: Hamer women use a mixture of butter and red ochre to keep their dreadlocks neatly in place. They are cut using a knife and a stone . Elegant: The Hamer's hairstyle of choice is also a practical one, with the mud and butter mixture keeping locks out of the eyes as they do their work .

"It was to be China's answer to Disneyland - a magnificent theme park attracting millions of visitors a year with state-of-the art rides in a chintzy fairytale setting. But Wonderland, now little more than an eerie Ghost town on the outskirts of Beijing, is finally to be torn down after a catastrophic history stretching over 15 years. Construction work at the 120 acre site ground to a halt in 1998 due to a dispute between the developers and the landowners and a corruption scandal that went right to the heart of the communist party.

Back in the mid 1990s, developers Huabin foresaw a bustling theme park attracting some three million visitors and generating 6 billion RMB ($1 billion) a year. Crucially they had secured the backing Chen Xitong, then the Beijing Party Secretary who was being tipped to become the country's next leader. But when Chen was jailed for corruption in 1998, his successor, perhaps scared of being tarred with the same brush, refused to support the project. Ghost town: The fairytale castles loom out of the Beijing fog like a creepy horror movie set . Construction work at the site of what was promoted as 'the largest amusement park in Asia', stopped around 1998 after funds were withdrawn due to disagreements over property prices with the local government and farmers . Crack beginning to show: Back in the mid 1990s, developers Huabin foresaw a bustling themepark attracting some three million visitors and generating six billion RMB ($1billion) a year . The huge, half-finished Bavarian-style structures complete with their spires and battlements and other medieval-themed buildings were left to crumble . A plan to restart work to capitalise on the 2008 Beijing Olympics was allegedly thwarted by proposals tabled in 2005, to build an entire city which would have covered parts of the Wonderland site's green space. Now the farmers that used to own the land have returned to grow their crops once again, with the decaying building site filling the skyline. Photographer David Gray, who visited the magical kingdom-turned-ghost park in 2011 said: ‘Pulling off the express-way and into the car park, I expected to be stopped by the usual confrontational security guards. ‘But there was absolutely no one to be seen. I walked through one of the few entrances not boarded up, and instantly started coughing. ‘In front of me were large empty rooms and discarded furniture, all covered in a thick layer of dust, along with an eerie silence that gave the place a haunted feeling – an emotion not normally associated with a children’s playground.’ Caution: A sign warning people about potential poisons in the soil is pasted on a pillar of a half-finished building on the site .

Local farmers told the photographer . that they have returned to use the land because they say its safe to . think the developers are never coming back. ‘This I can believe’, added Gray on . his blog, ‘As the absence of any security (something very rare in China) leads one to think that even the developers have given up on what is . already there. ‘All these structures of rusting . steel and decaying cement, are another sad example of property . development in China involving wasted money, wasted resources and the . uprooting of farmers and their families. ‘It is a reflection of the country’s property market which many analysts say the government must keep tightening steps in place. ‘The worry is a massive increase in . inflation and a speculative bubble that might burst, considering that . property sales contribute to around 10 per cent of China’s growth’, Gray . continued.

"A turtle in a hamburger, tadpoles inside the mouth and a corpse all rank among the top five weirdest items passengers have tried to smuggle on to planes. The bizarre list, compiled by Jetcost, also reveals a man attempted to board a plane in Miami for Brazil with bags full of exotic snakes – and reptiles in his pants.

Security workers noticed ‘strange bulges’ in his luggage as it passed through X-ray machines. Upon finding a turtle hidden in a burger, Mr Li told them: ‘This is not a turtle, but just a hamburger.‘There is nothing to see.’ Second place goes to American father who attempted to smuggle weapons and ammunition in his son’s stuffed toys – including a Mickey Mouse bear. The security officers made the find at . the boarding area in Rhode Island T.F. Green airport in 2012.

"They are famed for their impressive ability to produce wind. Now, researchers have revealed yet another convincing reason for turning down Brussels sprouts. For the unpopular vegetable could also land you in A&E. Christmas favourite: Brussels sprouts contain high levels of vitamin K, which can interfere with blood thinning drugs if eaten to excess . The warning came after a man from Ayrshire was hospitalised after eating a plateful of the festive greens. He had been fitted with a mechanical pump to help move blood from the lower chambers of his heart, after suffering heart failure last year. He had also been prescribed anticoagulants, which thin the blood, and his dose was monitored once or twice a week. But he was admitted to the specialist heart unit at the Golden Jubilee National Hospital in Clydebank, West Dunbartonshire, after his condition dramatically worsened. Doctors could not work out why the medication was not keeping his blood thin until they discovered he had been eating too many sprouts. The vegetable contains . high levels of vitamin K, a chemical the body uses to promote blood clotting. Consultant cardiologist Dr Roy Gardner . said: 'Patients who are taking anticoagulants are generally advised not . to eat too many green leafy vegetables, as they are full of vitamin K, . which antagonise the action of this vital medication.' A male patient was stabilised at the Golden Jubilee Hospital after overdosing on Brussel sprouts . Anticoagulants are blood thinners that also make existing blood clots more stable and less likely to break off and travel in the blood stream. Warfarin is the most commonly prescribed anticoagulant and is prescribed after a patient has had a heart valve inserted or suffered a stroke. It works by changing the way the liver uses vitamin K, which is an important vitamin in the blood-clotting process. The less vitamin K you have, the longer it takes for the blood to clot. Because Warfarin affects vitamin K, doctors advise patients to be careful when eating foods containing this vitamin such as kiwi, pine nuts, blue cheese, liver and green leafy vegetables. While Warfarin can generally balance out levels in the diet any sudden changes - such as gorging on Brussel sprouts - could put patients at risk. Jill Young, chief executive of the . Golden Jubilee Hospital, said: 'Whilst we think this is possibly the . first-ever festive admission to hospital caused by the consumption of . Brussels sprouts, we were delighted that we were able to stabilise his . levels.' The case was reported in a festive edition of the Medical Journal of Australia.","Brussels sprouts are rich in vitamin K, which can interfere with blood thinning medication .

"Next time you reach for the Play-Doh and start making models with your toddler, think again. You may be doing more harm than good by getting too involved. Parents who try to boost their children’s development by regularly taking the lead with structured activities are in danger of actually stifling it, an expert warned yesterday. Letting youngsters play alone helps them develop crucial skills which are linked to higher academic achievement and well-being, according Dr David Whitebread. Scroll down for video . Parents who try to boost their children's development by regularly taking the lead with structured activities are in danger of actually stifling it, an expert has warned (file photo) The academic said opportunities for children to play on their own are steadily declining, with youngsters nowadays leading more structured lives than generations before them. He was responding to a survey which found parents feel pressure to play one-to-one with their children and engage them in structured activities. Sixty-three per cent thought one-to-one play would help their children develop new skills more quickly and 66 per cent worried they didn’t play with their offspring enough. But Dr Whitebread, senior lecturer in psychology and education at Cambridge University, warned that denying children time to explore alone could harm their development. ‘The really big concern over the last decade is the relative loss of opportunities for children to engage in child-led play,’ he said. ‘Children’s lives are much more structured than they have ever been – and there is quite a lot of evidence to suggest this can be detrimental.  Parents can certainly be given guidelines about productive ways of playing with their children, but it’s important that play is not structured all the time.’ Letting youngsters play alone helps them develop crucial skills which are linked to higher academic achievement and well-being, according Dr David Whitebread (file photo) The survey of 1,100 parents with children aged from birth to three found 73 per cent felt pressure to ensure they develop at a certain pace. Eighty per cent felt the need to fill their child’s time with new activities to ensure they are always entertained. On average, children in the survey, commissioned by parenting website MadeForMums in association with Fisher Price, spent 5.4 hours a day playing – 2.3 hours directly with their parents and 1.9 independently. Dr Whitebread urged parents to give children a range of experiences, both on their own, with peers and with parents. ‘Research shows development of “self-regulation abilities” – which are predictive of academic achievement and emotional wellbeing – has a very strong link to the amount of time spent in child-led play,’ he said. ‘Children often have a purpose in their play when left alone – it is not just mucking about.'","Dr David Whitbread says letting children play alone helps their development .

"Busting at the seams: Mandy has always found it difficult to find clothes to fit her size 8 figure and 30G bust . Some women may envy my size 8 figure and 30G bust but, believe me, they don't come without their own particular challenges. I haven't dared run for a bus since 1976, for example, and have lost count of the number of men who look me firmly in the breasts when talking to me, without making a single moment of eye contact. But perhaps the biggest problem of all is finding clothes that actually fit when, like me, you have a bust that's bigger than the rest of your figure. There are many thousands of us big-busted girls out there. Indeed, a third of UK women say they have to buy a bigger dress size just to accommodate their breasts. Dresses, bikinis and anything that fastens at the front (from shirts to jackets) are generally off-limits: for if they fit round the bust, they undoubtedly look like a tent everywhere else. If they're a perfect fit around my waist, then they gape and strain, fit to burst, over my bust. Neither is an elegant look. So it's not before time that a canny clothes manufacturer has designed a new range for big-breasted women of any size, cut with extra room so you no longer need to wear a circus marquee just to ensure your chest remains under wraps. The genius of the Pepperberry range by Bravissimo is not only that its size 8-18 clothes come with carefully positioned buttons, darts and seams to give even the largest-busted lady a more streamlined shape, but that each item is available in Curvy, Really Curvy or Super Curvy, depending on just how much extra breast room you need. Curvy is cut for women who find tops and frocks tend to pull a little tightly across the chest; Really Curvy is for those who tend to have to go up roughly one dress size to get a good fit over their breasts; and Super Curvy is for women like me - who normally have to forego our natural dress size altogether if we're to have any hope of accommodating our ample bosoms. Clothes that are generously cut over the bust, yet nip back in to follow the line of your body? They certainly sound too good to be true. So I tried the new autumn range, which hits stores this week, in a Super Curvy size 8 to find out... Full skirt floral stripe dress, £79For me, if dresses fit the hips and waist, they're too tight over the bust. I see so many that I have to leave on the rails, as I know they'll never fit.VERDICT: The use of double darts in an inverted 'V' means the extra fabric needed to cover an ample bosom is nipped in for a fantastic fit. But it's way too young and fussy for me. 5/10 . Perfectly simple V-neck  T-shirt in red, £22, jersey blazer in navy, £65Fitted jackets are normally a no-no. And if I can find a T-shirt that fits my bust, the rest of it is big and baggy. VERDICT: My favourite look. The jacket accentuates my waist, skims my hips and accommodates my breasts. The T-shirt fits perfectly thanks to some neat little darts. 10/10 . Floral jersey dress in red floral, £49I love a wrap dress but usually end up showing so much cleavage I look like an ageing glamour model. I avoid them or have to wear a frumpy high-necked vest underneath. VERDICT: It's fabulous - the high neckline means my breasts are firmly under-wraps. If this came in different prints and colours, I’d be sold.8/10 . Belted workwear dress, £79, with peplum suit jacket, £79, in midnight blue Jackets usually gape or pull across the bust, feeling like a straitjacket. I’ve never owned one that fitted well.VERDICT: The jacket is well-cut, lovely and trim around the waist and the peplum is fun. I’d get lots of wear out of the dress. The fabric feels a little flimsy, but I could live with that. 7/10 . Classic shirt in white, £39Whenever I see women wearing white shirts with business skirts or jeans I think how stunning they look, but I can't go there. Within an hour or two, I'm always missing a button.VERDICT: Hoorah! It fits my bust and my waist with no signs of strain, even after a few hours. The extra fabric is gathered in by two seams, keeping it flush against your torso. 7/10 . Floral peplum top in navy print, £39Fitted tops have always been a no-go: it’s impossible for a standard size  8 to fit well in both the bust and the body. I always end up feeling as if my breasts have been flattened.VERDICT: This top is versatile, wearable and fun. I could easily wear this with a smart skirt for work, or dressed-down with jeans.8/10 .

"A young mother was shot dead on her son’s third birthday. Jazzmine Wash, 23, was killed outside her Long Beach, CA, home Thursday morning while on the front steps to retrieve her son’s diaper bag just hours before a party she had planned. She was shot multiple times in the upper torso, officials said, and pronounced dead at the scene. The shooting happened just before 6:30am, and was at very close range, witnesses said. Tragedy: 23-year-old mother Jazzmine Wash was shot dead on her son's third birthday . Ms. Wash, a single mother who had just started a new job, according to KCAL, was planning to throw a party for her young son later in the day, a neighbor said. ‘They were going to take them to Chuck E. Cheese,’ Shawn Mallory told NBC Los Angeles. ‘We're all pretty upset. This is a tight-knit community here, so the neighbors all know each other.’ That party never happened. Instead, witnesses say they heard multiple gunshots in the gated courtyard leading to their apartments. Ms. Wash was killed in an instant. ‘The police woke us up and I heard gunshots. Four or five gunshots,’ a neighbor told KCAL. Multiple shots: Witnesses said they heard four or five gunshots just outside their doors . Too young to die: Relatives and neighbors are crushed by the death of Ms. Wash . Emergency responders pronounced Ms. Wash dead only 10 minutes later. ‘She came outside of the apartment to gather a bag, what was described as a diaper bag, and was shot multiple times in her upper torso,’ Long Beach Police Sergeant Aaron Eaton told KCAL. ‘The suspects fled the scene and the fire department came and unfortunately she was pronounced dead here at the scene.’ Investigators do not yet have any suspects, but believe the shooting was not random, according to reports. Normally quiet: The shooting happened in a gated courtyard, just outside the doors of several residents . Just outside: Ms. Wash is said by investigators to have stepped outside to retrieve her son's diaper bag when she was shot dead . ‘Just a tragic incident all around – for him to lose a mother, for her to lose her life, and a family and friends to lose a loved one or friend,’ Mr. Eaton told NBC Los Angeles. Ms. Wash’s family is devastated, according to a neighbour who spoke to KCAL. ‘They killed her,’ the neighbour said she heard a relative of Ms. Wash say. Those who knew Ms. Wash are stunned, not believing that such a horrific death could happen to their friend and neighbour. Ms. Wash’s landlord told NBC Los Angeles she was ‘a polite young woman who had no enemies.’ ‘Good neighbor. Always said hello, friendly. A real nice person, you know,’ Mr. Eaton told KCAL, adding that it ‘was the little boy’s birthday. It is really sad. We are heartbroken.’ The investigation is ongoing, officials said, adding that investigators are trying to determine Ms. Wash’s familiarity with her killer(s).","Jazzmine Wash planned to throw a party for her three-year-old son later in the day at Chuck E.

"David Cameron condemned ‘lah-dih-dah, airy-fairy’ criticism of the British and American intelligence services last night. The Prime Minister said his fellow EU leaders should stop complaining about snooping by GCHQ and the NSA because British spies have saved their citizens from terrorist attack. And in a clear assault on the Guardian, he accused whistleblower Edward Snowden and ‘newspapers helping him’, of giving assistance to terrorists ‘who want to blow up our families’. Scroll down for video . No meeting of minds: David Cameron with Germany's Angela Merkel at the EU summit in Brussels yesterday . Defence: David Cameron defended the work of the security services as he made clear his own phone had not been targetted by US spies . Mr Cameron has been on the defensive at the EU summit in Brussels amid claims that the US bugged the mobile phone of German chancellor Angela Merkel. Brussels sources said he was given a ‘hard time’ because EU leaders believe UK spies were passed intelligence on 35 world leaders who were victims of eavesdropping by the US National Security Agency. The Prime Minister flatly refused to say whether he has seen transcripts of Mrs Merkel’s conversations. She has called the bugging operation ‘not on’. Mr Cameron was also put on the spot over claims by Snowden that the GCHQ listening station in Cheltenham listened in on Italian politicians after tapping into fibre optic cables in Sicily. Italian premier Enrico Letta said before the meeting: ‘It is inconceivable and unacceptable that there should be acts of espionage of this type.’ But Mr Cameron rejected the criticism. Asked directly about claims of the UK spying on Italy, the Prime Minister said: ‘The first priority of a prime minister is to try to keep your country safe and that means not having some lah-dih-dah, airy-fairy view. It means understanding that intelligence and security services do an important job. Row: Mr Cameron backed the call for talks with the White House by Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel after it emerged her own mobile had been tapped . ‘We need those people. They are brave people who help to keep us safe. I’ve lost count of the plots that I’ve seen being avoided by the work that they do. ‘That is important, not just for Britain. They actually help to keep people safe in other European countries too because we share so much intelligence and information with our EU partners. I make no apology for that.’ Mr Cameron said those like Snowden and the Guardian, which has published details of how GCHQ and the NSA operate, are guilty of ‘helping our enemies’. He said: ‘There are people in the world who want to do us harm, who want to blow up our families, who want to maim people in our country. Criticism: Mr Cameron condemned the 'lah-di-dah, airy-fairy view' of newspapers including The Guardian which published details of the work of intelligence agencies . ‘What Snowden is doing and to an extent what the newspapers are doing in helping him is frankly signalling to people who mean to do us harm, how to evade and avoid intelligence and surveillance and other techniques. ‘That is not going to make our world safer. It’s going to make our world more dangerous.’ The Prime Minister praised Britain’s ‘very strong, unique, intelligence partnership with the United States’ and Britain’s spies. ‘These are some of the most talented and bright and hard-working and dedicated officials in our country,’ he said. Danger: Mr Cameron accused NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden of threatening the work of intelligence agencies in keeping the UK safe . ‘They love our country. We should thank them rather than try to make their work more difficult.’ Mr Cameron spoke out as security officials in London revealed that Mr Cameron’s own calls with other world leaders who were bugged would have been listened to. The White House insists American spies have never targeted the Prime Minister’s phones. But a security source told the BBC: ‘They would have listened in as matter of course. It’s inevitable that they would have heard some of his conversations.’ Mr Cameron’s counterblast came after he was pressured into signing a statement with other EU leaders expressing concern at the way the US has been spying. They ‘expressed their conviction that the partnership must be based on respect and trust, including as concerns the work and co-operation of secret services’. Britain also went along with a related condemnation of spying between EU nations. Mrs Merkel suggested Mr Cameron had bitten his tongue in the meeting, saving his remarks for a post-summit press conference. She said: ‘David Cameron was present at the discussion. He listened to it. He wasn’t against it. That was silent acquiescence.’ Kurt Volker, a former US ambassador to Nato, said EU leaders shouldn’t be shocked by the revelations of widespread snooping. ‘I can’t believe anyone is terribly surprised. As a government official for many years I assumed that my cellphone and email account were susceptible to spying,’ he said. ‘I do think that this level of outrage is done more for political reasons than real outrage.’ Israel was behind the hacking of millions of French phones, not the US, it was claimed yesterday. Mossad agents are said to have intercepted more than 70million calls and text messages a month. Until now the French have blamed the Americans, even summoning the US ambassador to provide an explanation. But yesterday’s Le Monde newspaper said Mossad was to blame. France first suspected the US of hacking into former president Nicolas Sarkozy’s communications network when he was unsuccessfully running for re-election last year. Intelligence officials went to Washington to demand an explanation, but the US hinted that the Israelis were to blame, Le Monde said. The Americans insisted they had never been behind any hacking in France, and were keen to get on with the French, whom they viewed as one of their closest allies. The article was co-authored by US journalist Glenn Greenwald, whose main contact is National Security Agency whistle-blower Edward Snowden.  He hints that Israel was doing the spying and says the NSA called Mossad ‘the third most aggressive intelligence service in the world against the US’.","Diplomatic row over allegations U.S. spied on world leaders escalates .

"A Kansas sperm donor has been forced to pay child support for a child he helped a lesbian couple conceive in 2009. A Shawnee County judge ruled Wednesday that William Marotta, the biological father of a child born to Jennifer Schreiner, must repay some $6,000 in public assistance the state has provided the child as well as future support payments. Schreiner and her partner Angela Bauer found Marotta on Craigslist and performed the insemination at home. Because there was no physician present, the judge ruled Marotta didn't meet the legal criteria of a sperm donor, so Marotta is the father in the eyes of the state. Scroll down for video . You ARE the father: William Marotta (right) of Topeka, Kansas was ruled the legal father of a child he helped Jennifer Schreiner (left at left) conceive with her lesbian partner at the time Angela Bauer (far left) This despite the fact the Topeka man signed away his parental rights before the child was conceived. ‘Quite simply, the parties failed to perform to statutory requirement of the Kansas Parentage Act in not enlisting a licensed physician at some point in the artificial insemination process,' wrote Shawnee County District Court Judge Mary Mattivi in her decision. 'The parties’ self-designation of (Marotta) as a sperm donor is insufficient to relieve (Marotta) of parental right and responsibilities to the child,’ Mattivi continued. The Kansas Department for Children and Families filed the case in October 2012 seeking to have Marotta declared the father of a child born to Schreiner. Never seen her before: Marotta argued he'd waived his rights as a parent before the 2009 conception and that he barely knew the woman with whom he fathered the child . Technicalities: Shawnee County District Judge Mary Mattivi disagreed with Marotta. She ruled that the agreement failed to include a licensed physician and therefore did not live up to the state's legal definition of sperm donation . The state was seeking to have Marotta declared the child’s father so he can be held responsible for about $6,000 in public assistance the state provided, as well as future child support. Marotta opposed that action, saying he had contacted Schreiner and her partner at the time, Angela Bauer, in response to an ad they placed on Craigslist seeking a sperm donor. He said he signed a contract waiving his parental rights and responsibilities. Attorneys for the state contended the contract was moot because the parties didn’t follow a 1994 Kansas law requiring a licensed physician to perform the artificial insemination when donors were involved. During oral arguments at a hearing in October, Timothy Keck, co-lead counsel for the state, said the case focused on child support. Marotta’s attorney, Benoit Swinnen, cited several court rulings he said support the argument that Marotta is legally a sperm donor and not required to pay child support. Swinnen also argued that the Kansas statute doesn’t specifically require the artificial insemination to be carried out by a physician. Court documents show Schreiner indicated . she didn’t know the name of the donor or ‘have any information’ about . him in her application for child support. However, a sperm donor . contract between Marotta and the couple includes his name, and the . agency noted the couple talked about their appreciation for him in an . interview with the Topeka Capital-Journal. Soluble bonds: Bauer and Schreiner performed the procedure alone in their own home in 2009. They have since separated . A filing Wednesday by the DCF argues the sperm donor contract overlooks ‘the well-established law in this state that a person cannot contract away his or her obligations to support their child.’ The right for support belongs to the child, not the parents, the filing says. The agency said it also received different versions of the donor contract from Marotta and Schreiner, suggesting that the document ‘may be invalid on its face.’ ‘We stand by that contract,’ Swinnen said. ‘The insinuation is offensive, and we are responding vigorously to that. We stand by our story. There was no personal relationship whatsoever between my client and the mother, or the partner of the mother, or the child. Anything the state insinuates is vilifying my client, and I will address it.’","William Marotta donated his sperm to Jennifer Schreiner and her partner Angela Bauer in 2009 and signed a contract waiving parental rights .

"True price: The cost of the cup, stirrer and lid on a medium takeaway coffee adds up to 16p . If you crave a cappuccino in the morning or buy a latte with lunch, you might need a double espresso after reading this. The most expensive ingredient in your takeaway coffee is not the beans flown in from South America – it’s the cup. The packaging used by High Street chains costs twice as much as the beans they use, according to a study. With demand for coffee higher than ever, researchers analysed the production costs of a cappuccino at the most popular coffee shops to establish whether customers are getting value for money. They found that the cost of the coffee served in a medium-sized £2.20 cappuccino amounts to  a mere 8p. But the packaging and extras – including the cup, lid,  stirrer, napkin and sugar – cost 16p to produce. Staff wages make up the biggest portion of the drink’s total price, with nearly a quarter of the £2.20 used to pay baristas. The Government receives the second-largest share, taking an average of 37p from each drink in VAT. The cappuccino chosen by researchers as a sample drink is typically made up of one-third coffee, one-third hot milk and one-third frothed milk. Retail analyst Allegra Strategies, which conducted the study, found that the milk used typically costs 8p. Another 15 per cent of the total price is used to pay for rent and associated costs such as business rates, with a further 15 per cent going towards administration. After all these payments are deducted, the coffee shops are left with around 13 per cent of the price paid for the drink as profit. Researchers also found that the price of a cappuccino at Britain’s biggest coffee chains has increased dramatically in the past decade. Only ten years ago it would have cost £1.30. But they denied that customers are being ripped off, saying that paying a higher price for a coffee is now commonplace because the drink is has become part of the British ‘social experience’. Jeffrey Young, of Allegra Strategies, said: ‘I think customers are getting extremely good value. Findings: As well as a breakdown of costs of a takeaway coffee, researchers also found that the price of a cappuccino on Britain's high street has increased dramatically in the past 10 years . ‘The time that consumers spend in coffee shops is generally time well spent for them. ‘Coffee is now a very big part of the social experience of British society. ‘People spend a lot of time there [in coffee shops] and they aren’t paying for that time other than the price of a cup of coffee.’ He added: ‘Sometimes two or three people can get together and spend a few hours and can collectively spend a fiver. That’s extremely good value.’","Cost of actual coffee in a medium £2.20 cappuccino amounts to 8p .

"For a split-second, it could have been the opening day of last season. Same opposition, same score to protect and a contribution from the same player that brought the same, deafening reaction. Deep into added time, with Liverpool clinging to a 1-0 lead, Charlie Adam hoisted a cross into the penalty area and Anfield gasped for breath. Through a sea of red shirts, Simon Mignolet appeared to pluck the ball from the sky and spark a thunderous ovation. The reaction from the home support, however, was mixed with relief. Mignolet had previously came for but missed a number of balls slung in his direction and irony could be detected in the cheering. VIDEO Scroll down for Brendan Rodgers: I didn't realise it was Gerrard's 16th year . Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet applauds the fans after their 1-0 win over Stoke on Saturday . Mignolet pulls off a fine save against the Potters after diving to tip the ball over the crossbar . Mignolet sheres a laugh with match-winner Glen Johnson (right) and Raheem Sterling at full time . But, at that moment, Mignolet ensured the game would be won. When referee Craig Pawson brought a tense contest to an end shortly after, Mignolet stood on the edge of the box, punching the air in celebration. His emotions needed no explanation. A weight had been lifted. When Stoke arrived at Anfield in August 2013, Mignolet made an immediate impression on his debut, saving an added-time penalty from Jon Walters. That plunging stop launched Liverpool’s push for the title and it was the best possible introduction to his new fans. He once described that as the ‘best moment of his career’ but, highlights have been few since. Liverpool are used to charismatic No 1s but Mignolet, for much of 2014, has done nothing but spread anxiety. It meant the circumstances had significantly changed for this visit from Stoke. Mignolet had a huge question to answer, aware the criticism of him — most notably from former Liverpool keeper Bruce Grobbelaar — had been stinging. Mignolet saved a penalty from Jonathan Walters on his debut for Liverpool at the start of last season . The Belgian goalkeeper celebrates with a fist pump after assuring Liverpool of a 1-0 win in the game . He celebrates vociferously with team-mates Kolo Toure (left) and Jordan Henderson . Having spoken to Brendan Rodgers on Friday, Mignolet — whose error against Ludogorets in the Champions League ensured the spotlight was shining on him — knew that he had to produce. That wasn’t always the case. He was heckled by The Kop at one point when he dithered over a goal kick; his kicking, as a whole, wasn’t always assured and his decision making was hesitant, notably in the second half when he allowed Mame Biram Diouf to close in on him. As the pressure mounted, though, Mignolet produced, not least with a fabulous fingertip save to tip over a Bojan Krkic volley. Then, as Stoke tried to salvage a point, he made that catch and all was right in his world. The question is how long it will stay that way.","Simon Mignolet has struggled since taking the No 1 jersey at Liverpool .

"The wait for Apple’s iPhone 6 is nearly over, according to the latest leak. Promotional box art seems to confirm the announcement for Apple's next smartphone as being Tuesday 9 September. And several other details - including the position of the volume buttons and the new location of the power button - have also been revealed. Scroll down for video . A leading French blog says the iPhone 6 will be announced on Tues 9 Sept. The information comes from supposedly leaked box art of the device (left). On the right is the box art previously leaked by Steve Hemmerstoffer of nowhereelse.fr, which confirmed details on the iPhone 5S hours before it was announced . The leak reported by Forbes came from Steve Hemmerstoffer, editor of the leading French Apple blog nowhereelse.fr. The handset is expected to be unveiled on Tuesday 9 September and will come in 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch sizes. It is thought the phone could boast a flexible and scratch-proof sapphire screen, which is about to go into large-scale production in the US. The screen is tipped to be ‘Retina display+’ with a 1,704x904 resolution. Experts also predict a faster A8 processor, better rear-facing camera - possibly with changeable lenses -and wireless charging support. It may also include a heart rate sensor like the Samsung Galaxy S5. Last year Hemmerstoffer unveiled details on the iPhone 5S hours before launch, lending some credibility to the leak. He claims that the image of the box art was passed to him by a reliable Chinese source. On the box a date showing the expected announcement date can be seen - Tuesday 9 September. For the release of the iPhone 5S Apple had a similar design, displaying the date of the announcement on the box. The artwork also shows the new shape of the volume buttons, eschewing the circular design on the iPhone 5S for a more rectangular look. And the sleep and wake button has also been moved from the top of the phone to the right hand side. As expected, the fingerprint sensor used to lock and unlock the phone returns, while the charging port of the iPhone 6 now comes in the form of a Lightning connector. The source also apparently claimed that a 128GB version of the phone will be available. This close-up of the box shows the rumoured features and release date of the iPhone 6. The 'Ring Silent switch' remains in the same place from the iPhone 5, but the volume buttons seem to have changed to a rectangular shape, while the power button has been moved. The date of the release is also supposedly shown . With the iPhone 6 launch two weeks away,  new images of leaked parts have been revealed on a near daily basis. Multiple images of both the front panel and the rear shell of the 4.7-inch device have surfaced, while this image seemingly shows the design of the entire device . This . photo suggests that Apple’s Lightning cable is set to become even . easier to use because it will be reversible at both ends. Sonny . Dickson's image hints that Apple's next cable will have a reversible USB . port (pictured right), with a floating centre instead of fixed pins . (plug pictured left) Last week it was reported that a last minute redesign of a key component had left Apple's suppliers scrambling to get enough screens ready for the iPhone 6. Reuters claimed supply chain sources said the need to redesign a key component disrupted panel production ahead of next month's expected launch. Earlier this month, leaked images were posted by Moscow designers Feld and Volk and claimed . to show the rear shell (pictured) and an embedded logo, alongside a . cable that is said to be used for the home button. The images are . purported to be of the 4.7-inch iPhone 6 model . The issue . highlights the risks and challenges that suppliers face to meet Apple's . tough specifications, and comes on the heels of a separate screen . technology problem, since resolved, in making thinner screens for the . larger iPhone 6 model. Two . supply chain sources said display panel production suffered a setback . after the backlight that helps illuminate the screen had to be revised, . putting screen assembly on hold for part of June and July. Another . image showed an embedded Apple logo (pictured) that the designers claim . is scratchproof, and made of Liquidmetal alloy. Liquidmetal is a . super-strong material that can be moulded into shape . One said Apple, aiming for the thinnest phone possible, initially wanted to cut back to a single layer of backlight film, instead of the standard two layers, for the 4.7-inch screen, which went into mass production ahead of the 5.5-inch version. But the new configuration was not bright enough and the backlight was sent back to the drawing board to fit in the extra layer, costing precious time and temporarily idling some screen assembly operations, the source said. A patent, initially filed in 2012, describes a bayonet mount system for . an iPhone camera (pictured). The protruding camera system is similar to that currently used . on SLR cameras and lets photographers attach and remove interchangeable . lenses using a twist and lock motion . Earlier this month another leak revealed a protruding camera - a feature that was first reported on in April - recessed volume controls, which were hinted at during the start of the month, and an embedded logo. The images were purported to be of the 4.7-inch iPhone 6 model and were leaked by Russian designers Feld and Volk. Synthetic sapphire is a hard, transparent material made of crystallising aluminium oxide, produced at high temperatures. As the material is heated, it forms disks that can be sliced using diamond-coated saws. These round disks are ground into shape, and polished, to become glass. The technology is traditionally used in watch displays because it is thin, super-strong and scratch resistant. Apple already uses sapphire crystal in the Touch ID fingerprint scanner on its latest iPhone 5S and to protects the phone's camera. As a result, sapphire glass could potentially replace Gorilla Glass currently used in most high-end smartphones. Another image taken by the designers showed an embedded Apple logo that the designers claim is scratchproof, and made of Liquidmetal alloy. Liquidmetal is a super-strong material that can be moulded into shape. Another feature rumoured to feature in Apple’s iPhone 6 is a virtually indestructible screen made of sapphire. To create enough of the man-made sapphire material, which make screens that are scratch-resistant and flexible, Apple struck a deal with GT Advanced Technologies in Mesa, Arizona. The sapphire material will be manufactured at a plant powered by renewable energy, which has been built as part of the $578million (£350million) arrangement, The Guardian reported.It is claimed to be composed of thin man-made layers of sapphire, which enables the material to be flexible - giving it a change of withstanding knocks and falls that shatter other types of toughened glass. A YouTube videomaker recently claimed to . have acquired one of the screens - and subjected it to a barrage of . abuse, from stabbing it with a knife and keys to bending and twisting . it. In the video, Marques Brownlee stands on the thin screen and bends it. When released, it goes back it its normal shape, raising hopes the new handset will have an almost indestructible screen .","A leading French blog says the iPhone 6 will be announced on Tues 9 Sept .

"Britain is only days away from  getting rid of Abu Hamza after the hook-handed cleric lost his final appeal against extradition. The ruling by the European Court of Human Rights brings an end to a legal saga which has lasted eight years and cost the taxpayer more than £1million. Delighted Home Secretary Theresa May wants Hamza – viewed as one of the world’s most dangerous preachers of hate – to now be put on a plane to America ‘as soon as possible’. Kicked out: The ruling brings an end to a legal saga over Abu Hamza which has lasted eight years and cost more than $1.5million . In previous cases, suspects have been booted out within two weeks of losing their last appeal. Hamza, who earned global notoriety . for his fanatical sermons outside the Finsbury Park mosque in North . London, is wanted by the US authorities for plotting to set up a jihadi . training camp in the state of Oregon. He and four other alleged terrorists . had complained that jail terms of up to 50 years in the US without . parole breached their right to be protected from ‘inhuman or degrading . treatment’. In April, the European Court of Human . Rights – after two years of hugely expensive deliberation – rejected . this argument. But the men were allowed to make a final plea for the . grand chamber of the Strasbourg court to re-open the case. Last night, . judges also threw this out. There are now no more legal steps they can . take in Europe to halt extradition. They can expect to be placed in immediate custody as soon as they set foot on American soil. The verdict is a relief to the . Government, which had feared that the judges would block extradition . altogether, forcing it to release Hamza back on to the streets. Hamza is also accused by the US of conspiring to take Western hostages in the Yemen and funding terrorism. Also facing extradition are Babar . Ahmad and Talha Ahsan, who are accused of conspiracy to commit terrorist . atrocities overseas and supporting terrorist groups, and Khalid . al-Fawwaz, who is considered one of the US’s most wanted terrorists . suspects. Al-Fawwaz, allegedly a close . associate of Osama bin Laden, was arrested in connection with bomb . attacks on two US embassies in east Africa which killed more than 260 . people in 1998. The fifth man who can be removed, . Adel Abdul Bary, is also wanted in connection with the embassy bombings . and has been in prison for 13 years. The total bill for extraditing the men is estimated to be more than £4million. Worshippers: Hamza (pictured centre, wearing blue) earned global notoriety for his vile sermons outside the Finsbury Park Mosque in London . Hamza was first arrested at the . request of the US in May 2004 but the extradition was halted when the UK . decided to charge him on allegations relating to his sermons. In 2006, he was jailed for seven years . for preaching hate and inciting murder at Finsbury Park Mosque. The . extradition proceedings resumed once Hamza became eligible for release. He arrived in Britain more than 30 . years ago and has seven children from a second marriage. In the late . 1980s, he headed to Afghanistan but returned a few years later having . lost an eye and both hands – allegedly blown off by a mine.

"President Barack Obama's nominee to serve as the U.S. surgeon general, a 36-year-old physician who has attracted criticism for his anti-gun advocacy, complained to a newspaper in 1994 that 'society's preoccupation with firearms' comes from 'fiery gun battles' on Saturday morning cartoons. Dr. Vivek Murthy, who founded Doctors for Obama in 2008 – a group that later changed its name to 'Doctors for America – was a graduating high school senior at the time, one of several valedictorians the Miami Herald interviewed. 'Vivek Murthy, 16, of Palmetto High, takes television cartoons to task' for 'the growing problem of kids and violence,' according to the Herald. 'Today, a typical elementary student wakes up on Saturday mornings to fiery gun battles, explosive scenes of terror and the violent decimation of the ""bad guy"" – all this in a children's cartoon,' Murthy said then. 'With such destructive influence, society's preoccupation with firearms and brutal methods of conflict resolution is no surprise.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Harvard Medical School physician Vivek Hallegere Murthy is President Barack Obama's surgeon general nominee, but his age, connections and anti-gun advocacy are raising the hackles of Second Amendment supporters . Is Yosemite Sam a menace to society? Murthy's experiences watching Saturday morning cartoons made him an anti-gun advocate at age 16 . It was always 'wabbit season' for Elmer Fudd, but his shotgun never seemed to find its mark . Murthy's nomination has created a firestorm of objections on Capitol Hill among Republicans who believe the president is using the surgeon general post to general public support for gun-control measures that House Republicans won't entertain. 'This nominee seems much more devoted to politics than to patients,' Sen. John Barrasso said Monday night on the Fox News Channel. 'I know there are a number of senators who are up for re-election who are probably not going to want to vote for somebody who is this committed to taking away our Second Amendment rights,' said Barrasso, a medical doctor himself. He noted that Dr. Richard Carmona, a Democrat who served an attorney general under President George W. Bush, has written to President Obama to say that Murthy is unqualified. Critics of Murthy have pointed to his Twitter feed as evidence that he would be more political activist than doctor-in-chief if he were confirmed. Following the December 2012 massacre of 26 students and teachers at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, he tweeted: 'NRA press conference disappointing but predictable - blame everything in the world except guns for the Newtown tragedy. #wakeup.' Two months earlier he had tweeted . that he was '[t]ired of politicians playing politics w/ guns, putting . lives at risk b/c [because] they're scared of NRA. Guns are a health . care issue. #debatehealth.' Murthy has never called for knife-control, despite the frequency of slicings and stabbings on the Simpsons' 'Itchy and Scatchy Show' episodes . President Obama nominated Murthy in February, shortly before another nominee -- tapped to lead the civil rights division of the DOJ -- crashed and burned . Tom & Jerry settled dozens of disputes with guns -- the pretend kind -- over a 17-year period . That insistence that firearms belong in willy-nilly national discussions about public health, and not in the relatively more steady world of Constitutional law, is making gun rights advocates see red. 'Historically, the Surgeon General of the United States has been a position with the purpose of educating Americans so that they may lead healthier lives, rather than advancing a political agenda,' Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul wrote in a February letter to Senate Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid. 'Dr. Murthy has disqualified himself from being Surgeon General because of his intent to use that position to launch an attack on Americans' right to own a firearm under the guise of a public health and safety campaign.' Murthy couldn't be reached for comment. The National Rifle Association did not respond to a request. Criticism directed at Murthy comes at a particularly bad time for the Obama White House. Last week in a Senate vote, Debo P. Adegbile failed to advance as the nominee to head the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division. Adegbile came under intense criticism for leading the NAACP legal team that successfully overturned the death sentence of Mumia Abu-Jamal, who was convicted of the 1981 murder of a Philadelphia police officer.","Vivek Murthy, 36, complained as a teen that violent Saturday morning cartoons were feeding 'society's preoccupation with firearms'

"The damaged hard drive containing ex-IRS official Lois Lerner's missing emails was disposed of more than two years ago, the agency confessed on Wednesday. Republicans had hoped to retrieve the broken hard drive and have it fixed so they could review Lerner's emails and determine whether her department acted alone in targeting conservative organizations or it received a mandate from the Obama administration. That won't be possible because it recycled in 2011, the agency told Politico yesterday. 'We believe the standard IRS protocol was followed in 2011 for disposing of the broken hard drive,' an IRS spokesman told the news organization. 'A bad hard drive, like other broken Information Technology equipment, is sent to a recycler as part of our regular process.' Long gone: Lois Lerner's damaged hard drive was recycled years ago, the IRS said on Wednesday, blowing a hole in Republicans' latest attempts to recover Lerner's missing emails . House Ways and Means chairman Dave Camp and Ways and Means oversight subcommittee chairman Charles Boustany had already discovered that the IRS has known as far back as February that it no longer had . email correspondence for Lerner and other key players implicated in the . tea party targeting scandal and failed to share that information with . Congress. The IRS . also 'lost' the emails of six other agency officials associated with the scheme – in addition to those of . Lois Lerner – and kept it a secret for months, the Congressmen said on Tuesday. 'It . looks like the American people were lied to and the IRS tried to . cover-up the fact it conveniently lost key documents in this . investigation,' the duo said in a press release on Tuesday. 'Plot lines in Hollywood are more believable than what we are getting from this White House and the IRS.' The . news prompted the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee to . issue broad subpoenas on Tuesday afternoon for hard drives, thumb drives . and other backups that Lerner and the tax authorities may have used to . archive her messages. 'It . is a little too convenient that right in middle of Lerner orchestrating . the targeting of conservative groups, poof, her emails disappear,' Camp and Boustany said in a statement on Wednesday. 'It . is even harder to believe that six other IRS employees, including . Nikole Flax, also had their systems go down and supposedly permanently . deleted critical details that could help us prove what was really . happening at the IRS,' they continued. 'We need to know where these computers are, who looked at them and when.' Flax served as Chief of . Staff to Steve Miller, who was the Deputy Commissioner of the IRS during the targeting scandal. She visited the White House more than a dozen times between July 2010 and April 2013, according to a Politico, raising suspicion among the Ways and Means committee leaders. 'Who . was she visiting at the White House and what were they talking about? Was she updating the White House on the targeting or was she getting . orders? These are answers we don’t yet have, because – surprise, . surprise – a few computers crashed,' they said in a statement on Tuesday. Boustany . told Politico on Wednesday that 'IT experts have weighed in and said . yes — we can get those' emails off the broken hard drives. But later in the day Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch confirmed the IRS' statement that the hard drives were long gone, telling Politico, 'We’ve been informed that the hard drive has been thrown away.' Scroll down for video . House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp, pictured here at the end of May, and his committee discovered today that the IRS 'lost' the emails of six other IRS officials in addition to Lois Lerner . The Exempt Organizations Division of the IRS is at the center of a scandal involving years of intrusive screening of . conservative groups that sought tax-exempt status beginning in 2009. Hundreds of them saw their applications delayed or denied while . politically liberal organizations skated by and quickly received . approval. The . IRS informed the committee on Friday that 28 months of emails of the former head of the tax-exempt division, Lois Lerner, had been lost in a computer crash and could not be recovered because many records were not backed . up on servers, tapes or external drives. Its own guidelines require that . 'IRS offices will not store the official recordkeeping copy of e-mail . messages that are federal records ONLY on the electronic mail system.' It also requires its offices to back up email messages to 'a separate electronic recordkeeping system.' The Daily Caller reported on Tuesday that IRS regulations require employees to print out copies of all communications that are subject to federal recordkeeping laws. 'The Treasury Department’s current email policy requires emails and attachments that meet the definition of a federal record be added to the organization’s files,' the agency's employee guidance reads, 'by printing them (including the essential transmission data) and filing them with related paper records.' According to Politico, before May 2013, when the targeting scheme came to light, the IRS only kept copies of data going back six months, so copies of Lerner's emails from January 2009 to April 2010 are missing, as well as other IRS officials. Internal Revenue Service Commissioner John Koskinen will be hauled before two House committee hearings next week to explain how Lois Lerner's emails could have been lost despite robust data-retention standards in the U.S. government . Camp and Boustany said on Monday that 'we are simply not going . to accept the IRS claim that these documents are not recoverable. We . will demand the president live up to his promise to work ""hand in hand"" with Congress to get the facts.' The . two lawmakers wrote to President Obama this week asking the White House for records of emails between Lerner and employees the White House, the . Treasury Department, the Department of Justice, the Environmental . Protection Agency, the Federal Election Commission and the Occupational . Safety & Health Administration. That . move came hours after Ways and Means committee staff interviewed government employees . charged with running the IRS's internal computer networks. A . committee aide told MailOnline that those IRS workers confirmed that . budget and space limitations forced the agency to limit officials' access to networks that would ordinarily store email archives. They . also said, according to the aide, that other executive branch agencies . have their own independent archives of the records now lost at the IRS. Camp and Boustany asked Obama to order 'an exhaustive search for all Lois Lerner emails' throughout the executive branch. But . the White House is likely under no obligation to cooperate. President . Obama has already referred to the IRS matter as one of several 'phony . scandals' that he believes are politically motivated. Yet in May 2013 when the scandal first erupted, Obama pledged that his administration would 'make sure that we are working hand in hand with Congress to get this thing fixed.' Subpoena: Rep. Darrell Issa is demanding Koskinen show up for an evening interrogation on June 23 . The Ways and Means Republicans threw that phrase back in the president's face on Monday. 'In order to ensure accountability and “get this thing fixed,” please provide ... all communications between Lois Lerner and any persons within the Executive Office of the President (EOP) for the period between January 1, 2009 and May 1, 2011,' they wrote. 'Also, please indicate in writing when the EOP [Executive Office of the President] was informed, and by whom, that the IRS had lost critical Lerner documents.' On Tuesday, California . Rep. Darrell Issa, who chairs the House Oversight and Government Reform . Committee, demanded that IRS Commissioner John Koskinen explain – in person – . how 28 months of emails to and from . Lerner were 'lost' to a computer crash. Issa wrote to Koskinen in reaction to his agency's claim Friday . that the IRS no longer has copies of emails between Lerner and anyone . outside the IRS from January 2009 through April 2011. Issa demanded in his letter that Koskinen appear in a rare evening hearing on June 23, a . half-day before he's scheduled to testify before the House Ways and . Means Committee. 'I . will not tolerate your continued obstruction and game-playing in . response to the Committee’s investigation of the IRS targeting,' he . wrote. 'For . too long, the IRS has promised to produce requested – and, later, . subpoenaed – documents, only to respond later with excuses and . inaction.' In the House Oversight Committee, Issa hammered Koskinen for promising in a March 26 hearing that he would deliver every email Congress sought. At the time, however, he insisted that it would take 'years' for lawyers to sift through them all and excise private taxpayer information that the IRS isn't permitted to share – not even with other arms of government. And simply searching through Lerner's individual email storage, Koskinen said then, wouldn't produce an exhaustive record. 'They’re stored somewhere,' he explained to Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz during the hearing. 'They get taken off and stored in servers and you’ve got 90-thousand employees,' he insisted, but 'we can find, and we are in fact searching – we can find Lois Lerner’s emails.'

"Many people rely on their smartphone throughout the day to surf the web, check their email and send messages to friends. But what about during the night? A sleep expert has said an increasing number of people have started to use their phone and send text messages while they are asleep and often don't remember writing them. Dr Josh Werber warned sleep texting could have embarrassing consequences as well as leading to health problems as people are not getting enough quality sleep. Lots of people send texts just before they go to sleep, but a U.S. sleep expert has said an increasing number of people have started to use their phone and send messages while they are asleep. Dr Werber warned the practice prevents people from getting enough deep sleep that helps the brain perform higher functions . Sleep texters can get a shock in the morning as they realise they have sent nonsense or embarrassing messages during the night . Sleep specialist Dr David Cunnington, of Melbourne Sleep Disorder Centre in Australia said daily stress is to blame for the rise of sleep texting. Dr Cunnington described sleep texting as the result of people having too much to do during waking life. He said: 'People are doing so much during a normal day that it can mean that they feel like they're ""on call"" even at night. 'Because it's so easy to receive emails constantly, and get notifications from smartphones, it becomes more difficult for us to separate our waking and sleeping lives.' 23-year-old Megan admitted to U.S. television channel CBS 2 that she texts friends and family in her sleep and has 'no recollection' of sending them. She told the channel: 'My charger is right there in the corner . so sometimes I would keep it right here next to me. 'I guess I got up and . texted and went back to bed but I don’t remember it.' She said she has regularly send texts at three and four o'clock in the morning while she was asleep only to wake up and find out she has sent messages of jumbled up words. While this could be embarrassing, Dr Werber of EOS Sleep, people who text during their sleep are 'not getting the deep sleep or the rapid eye movement which is really critical to higher brain function'. Laura Hogya, who has a full-time job but is also a sleep texter, told the channel hat she wakes up exhausted and is not sure whether it is because she has had a bad night's sleep from tossing and turning, or from sending text messages. She said she is half asleep when she gets up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom or to get a glass of water and starts answering messages on her mobile, but she does not remember doing so until the next morning. Unlike Megan's messages, Ms Hogya's make sense but she is still concerned that they could cause problems one day. 'If I answer a client e-mail that’s something that I have to worry about,' she said. Dr Werber unsurprisingly suggested moving phones away from the bed to make it harder to sleep text, which Ms Hogya is trying. He said banishing phones for the bedroom completely not only prevents people from sending text messages during their sleep but helps them sleep better as they are not disturbed by light, which sends a message to the brain that it is tome to wake up. He suggests shutting down all gadgets at least an hour before bed time to increase the chance of a good night's sleep. There are currently no studies into sleep texting, but a similar phenomenon, sleep emailing, was studied in 2008. Researchers . at the University of Toledo reported the case of a woman, 44, who would . compose emails while sound asleep. She had no recollection of sending . the emails when awake. 23-year-old Megan (not pictured) admitted to U.S. television channel CBS 2 that she texts friends and family in her sleep and has 'no recollection' of sending them .","A U.S. sleep expert has said an increasing .

"Historian Lucy Worsley caused a furore when she remarked last year that she had been 'educated out of the natural reproductive function'. Now it seems she might have had a point, after a new study has revealed a clear correlation between intelligence and childlessness - with cleverer women more likely to choose not to have a family. The study, which was conducted by Satoshi Kanazawa, a researcher at the London School of Economics, found that a woman's urge to have children decreases by a quarter for every 15 extra IQ points. Not keen: Kate Humble, 44, says that she decided never to have children at  14 and has 'no maternal urge' Clever and child-free: Cameron Diaz and Lucy Worsley have both said they don't want to have a family . When Kanazawa, who used data from the UK's National Child Development Study, added controls for economics and education, the results remained the same - the more intelligent the woman, the less likely she was to have children. Worsley isn't the UK's only famously clever childless woman, with others including BBC presenter Kate Humble and actress Helen Mirren. In the USA, Oprah Winfrey, Cameron Diaz and Eva Mendes are among the famous names who have said they'll never become mothers, with Diaz adding: 'I have the life I have because I don't have children.' Mendes too has said that she values her lifestyle too much to share it with children. 'I don't want kids,' she said. 'I love sleep and I worry about everything.' Humble, meanwhile, told the Times that she just 'doesn't have a maternal gene' and resolved not to have children at the age of 14. 'People are very judgmental,' she added. 'It's as if I made a selfish decision not to have children, but I never, ever, wanted them.' Unencumbered: Helen Mirren has said she never wanted children and Eva Mendes doesn't want them either . Humble and co certainly aren't alone, with figures released by the Office of National Statistics revealing that the proportion of women without children has almost doubled since the 1990s. One in five 45-year-olds is childless, while among those with degrees, the figure rises to 43 per cent, suggesting that Kanazawa's findings are sound. A social study, conducted by social scientist Dr Nattavudh Powdthavee of the University of York, revealed that the notion that happiness comes from having children is illusory and offers yet another clue to why so many clever women are rejecting motherhood. 'Parents spend much of their time attending to the very core processes of childcare: problems at school, cooking, laundry,' said Powdthavee in an interview with the Times. 'It's these small but negative experiences that are more likely to impact on our day-to-day levels of happiness and life satisfaction.'","The findings show that smarter women are less likely to want babies .

"David Cameron has today ordered plans to be drawn up for a range of possible sanctions against Russia after a No10 briefing paper was exposed to photographers . David Cameron has ordered plans to be drawn up for a range of possible sanctions against Russia. The move came as the Government sought to downplay the accidental disclosure of a briefing paper suggesting there will be no tough line against Moscow. The document was inadvertently exposed to photographers by Hugh Powell, a deputy national security adviser on his way to a Downing Street meeting. An old Etonian friend of David Cameron, he is now facing disciplinary proceedings for his ineptitude. He will receive a dressing-down from Richard Heaton, the top mandarin at the Cabinet Office, who will discuss a punishment with his line manager, national security chief Sir Kim Darroch. Mr Cameron yesterday called the incident ‘unfortunate and regrettable’. Trying to regain the initiative, he has told officials to draw up a ‘broad spectrum’ of potential sanctions. A Whitehall source said: ‘Officials are under instructions from the Prime Minister to work up a package of political and economic pressure. There is a lot of work going on about the possible costs and consequences for Russia and for us.’ On Mr Powell, a source added: ‘The clear instructions from the Prime Minister were that normal disciplinary procedures should be followed and that he should not be treated differently because of his seniority or background. This was a serious incident.’ Mr Cameron warned Russia: ‘We have said very clearly there will be costs and consequences diplomatically, politically and economically, from the decisions that have been taken.’ William Hague dismissed Russia’s excuses for intervening militarily in Ukraine and told MPs that Britain’s options ‘remained open’. A document (pictured) that stated Britain will not impose sanctions on Russia or support military action was revealed by accident . The document was revealed by deputy national security adviser Hugh Powell to photographers as he walked past No10 to attend a meeting about the crisis in Ukraine . The Kremlin says it is acting at the request of former Ukrainian president Victor Yanukovych. But . Mr Hague said: ‘The suggestion that a president who has fled his . country then has any authority whatsoever to invite the forces of a . neighbouring country into that country is baseless. 'Russia has also . argued that Russian-speaking minorities in the Ukraine are in danger, . but no evidence of that threat has been presented.’ The . Foreign Secretary said the document revealed by Mr Powell was ‘not . necessarily a guide to the decisions that will be made by Her Majesty’s . Government’. The . leaked document reveals details of the UK’s plans for raising pressure . on Russia. Several key elements will interest the Kremlin: . WHAT IT SAYS The . papers show plans to break off relations with Russia through a series . of international organisations. Clearly legible are references to the . G8, EU-Russia formats and the NATO-Russia council and it says ‘visa . restrictions/travel bans on key’ personnel. WHAT IT MEANS EU . foreign ministers plan to suspend cooperation with Russia over the . planned G8 summit in Sochi in June. The EU has suspended cooperation . over visas. WHAT IT SAYS ‘UK should not support for now, trade sanctions...or close London’s financial centre to Russians.’ WHAT IT MEANS US . Secretary of State John Kerry has threatened asset freezes on Russians . in America. But Britain does not intend to follow suit, for fear of . losing Russian investment. WHAT IT SAYS A . section on Ukraine talks about a technical assistance package and . mentions a ‘deep and comprehensive’ trade deal and ‘contingency EU work . on providing Ukraine with alternative gas supplies if Russia cuts them . off’. WHAT IT MEANS The . UK yesterday pledged £10million in aid to the Ukrainian government to . help stabilise the country. EU ministers said they were keen to pursue a . free trade agreement with Ukraine. No. 10 confirmed that the UK has . urged EU officials to help Ukraine buy its energy elsewhere. WHAT IT SAYS Britain . should back the ‘deployment of OSCE and/or UN (but not EU) monitors to . Crimea and Eastern Ukraine’, ‘push UN Secretary General Ban to take the . lead’, ‘accept a special European Council’ and ‘discourage any . discussions (eg at Nato) of emergency military preparations’. WHAT IT MEANS Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe monitors began deploying to Ukraine last night. A special EU summit will be held on Thursday. Effective ruling out of support for military action. Mr Hague indicated that EU leaders would discuss sanctions at a summit in Brussels tomorrow. He . added: ‘I have stressed several times the importance of unity among the . western nations; the importance of any measures being well judged and . well targeted; and the importance of any measures being legally . sustainable. ‘That is why these matters require calm and careful consideration.’ Ministers . fear that imposing trade restrictions or somehow excluding Russians . from the financial markets in London will hurt economic growth and deter . foreign investment. The . capital is known as ‘Londongrad’ due to the number of millionaire . Russian oligarchs based here. A senior figure said: ‘We’re trying to . find ways of hurting Russia, not hurting ourselves.’ Mr Powell, who was at Eton with the . Prime Minister, is the son of Margaret Thatcher’s chief foreign policy . adviser Charles Powell and nephew of Tony Blair’s chief of staff . Jonathan Powell. The document undermined claims by Mr Cameron and William Hague that the UK was set to get tough with Russia. Visiting . the Ukrainian capital Kiev, the Foreign Secretary described the . situation as the biggest crisis in Europe in the 21st century. 'Regrettable': William Hague answers questions from MPs in the House of Commons on the escalating crisis in the Ukraine and a secret document that suggested Britain would not support military action against Russia . David Cameron and William Hague - pictured meeting with Ukrainian Prime Minsiter Arseniy Yatsenyuk today - claimed the UK was set to get tough with Russia . He warned Russian president Vladimir Putin that he faces a ‘significant cost’ for taking control of the Ukrainian region. After . chairing the National Security Council meeting, Mr Cameron said a clear . message needed to be ‘sent to the Russian government that continuing . down this path of violating the sovereignty of another country will have . costs and consequences’. He added: ‘We shall have to bring to bear diplomatic, political, economic and other pressures.’ US secretary of state John Kerry  threatened to deny Russians in America access to their money today . By contrast, US secretary of . state John Kerry went much further, threatening to deny Russians in . America access to their money. He said Mr Putin ‘may find himself with . asset freezes on Russian business. American business may pull back, . there may be a further tumble of the rouble’. EU foreign ministers, meeting in Brussels, agreed to suspend . cooperation with Russia over the planned G8 summit in Mr Putin’s holiday . home of Sochi in June. The . EU will also suspend cooperation on visas and they warned that ‘further . sanctions’ may be imposed after an emergency summit on Thursday. A . Downing Street spokesman refused to discuss the leak. ‘We never comment . on security matters,’ he said. Labour . MP Simon Danczuk called for Mr Powell to resign, pointing out that Bob . Quick – the former Scotland Yard head of counter-terrorism – was forced . to quit in 2009 after a similar mistake. He . said: ‘It’s astonishing that the deputy national security adviser can’t . keep sensitive documents like this private. It’s clearly a serious . issue and needs to be addressed.’ Tory .

"The 6.0-magnitude earthquake that jolted parts of Indonesia today served as a reminder of just how active the seemingly-solid ground beneath us can be. And these reminders have become increasingly frequent. On average, the world only sees one or two earthquakes per month that are 6.5-magnitude or higher. But April produced a higher-than-normal number of the major seismic events, as revealed in this incredible time-lapse video. Scroll down for video… . Magnitude 1 and 2 – Not felt by people, detected by instruments. Magnitude 3 – Silght tremor felt by people indoors, likened to a passing lorry. Magnitude 4 – Can crack walls, disturb trees. Magnitude 5 – Moves furniture, damages poorly built buildings. Magnitude 6 – Moderate to major damage, chimneys and walls collapse. Magnitude 7 – Major damage to all buildings, ground cracks, landslides can occur. Magnitude 8 – Total destruction, waves can be seen travelling through the ground. Earthquakes happen every day, and as this animation shows, small ones happen at least once an hour. According to the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC), which issues alerts for tsunamis, there were 13 major earthquakes in April. Five were higher than 7.8, which prompted tsunami warnings. Moderate-to-large earthquakes are less common, but last month was ‘easily a record for this institution,’ according to the PTWC. The time-lapse takes you on a journey of . all recorded large and medium-sized earthquakes that took place from . January through to April of this year.

From there, the Earth continues to shake with another huge earthquake that hits the Solomon Islands in the South Pacific. The activity doesn’t let up all month. But what is interesting, according to the PTWC, is the sheer number of other earthquakes that weren't part of these two major clusters. There were isolated larger-than-normal quakes all over the world—in Nicaragua, Mexico, Canada, and even an unusual one in the South Atlantic. The Centre gave no indication to what might have been behind the huge change in seismic activity. The animation concludes with a summary map showing all of the earthquakes in this four-month period.

"The widow of Boston Marathon bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev has retained legal counsel who has an extensive client roster of suspected and convicted terrorists. Katherine Russell added attorney Joshua Dratel to her legal team, . her Rhode Island-based lawyer Amato DeLuca said on Wednesday. The New York lawyer, whose office in Downtown Manhattan is just blocks away from Ground Zero, previously defended Guantanamo Bay detainees and suspects in the bombings of the U.S. embassies in East Africa. Widow: Katherine Russell, pictured on Sunday in Rhode Island, has been interviewed by federal investigators and claims she knew nothing of her husband's Boston bombing plans . New hire: Russell has retained attorney Joshua Dratel (center, speaking at a legal symposium in New York in 2010) who has represented a number of terrorism suspects . Expert: Joshua Dratel, pictured in 2004 with Maj. Michael Mori at Guantanamo Bay, defended detainee Australian David Hicks for alleged ties to terrorism based on Hicks' stay at an al-Qaeda training camp . Tamerlan Tsaranev's 24-year-old widow . has been under increased scrutiny ever since federal officials found . radical Islamist materials on her laptop, including the al Qaeda . magazine Inspire. Investigators . also found traces of explosive residue in the Cambridge, Massachusetts, . home Russell had shared with her late husband and their 3-year-old . daughter. Russell's defense . team said in a statement that she 'plans to continue to meet with . investigators, part of a series of meetings over many hours where she . has answered questions.' As of yet, Russell has not been . charged with any crime but has beefed up her legal team with an expert in defending terrorist suspects. Russell's attorneys have previously said she and her family were in shock when . they learned of the allegations against her husband and brother-in-law, . Dzhokhar. Authorities, though, are said to be skeptical of her . insistence that she played no role in the attack or in helping the . brothers escape the authorities following the release of the . photographs, according to a report by the New York Times. Defense: Katherine Russell's Rhode Island based lawyer Amato DeLuca, left, with Russell on April 29 at DeLuca's law office in Providence, says the new lawyer was retained given his 'unique, specialized experience' ‘Mr. Dratel's unique, specialized . experience will help insure that Katie can assist in the ongoing . investigation in the most constructive way possible,’ DeLuca, Russell's Providence-based lawyer, said in a statement. Miriam . Weizenbaum, who similarly is based out of Rhode Island, is also on Russell's legal team. The newest addition, Dratel, was the lead counsel for . Australian David Hicks, who had attended the al-Qaeda linked, al-Farouq . training camp in Afghanistan during 2001. Hicks was detained at Guantanamo Bay and deemed an enemy combatant. He was convicted of providing support for terrorists and transferred to . South Australia's Yatala Labour Prison in 2007. Hicks, now 37, was released in December 2007 and . is appealing his conviction in the U.S., on the basis that the military . commission system created by Presidential Order was unconstitutional. Dratel also defended Wadih el-Hage in connection to the 1998 Osama bin Laden backed bombings of the United States . embassies . in Kenya and Tanzania. The American embassies in the East . African capitals of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and Nairobi, Kenya killed . 223 and injured more than 4,000. El-Hage, 52, was convicted in 2001 on several federal counts for his role in the attacks. The convicted terrorist, a Lebanese . born man who moved to the U.S. and became a citizen in 1989, is serving . a life sentence at a federal prison in Florence, Colorado. Dratel, a graduate of Columbia College and Harvard Law School, also was involved in the defense team in the case against suspected embassy bomber Mohamed Suleiman al-Nalfi. Suspect: Russell's husband Tamerlan Tsarnaev, pictured in 2010, died after a gun battle with police . In 2004, Dratel had represented Sami . Omar al-Hussayen, the Saudi computer science graduate student at the . University of Idaho who was suspected of running websites that had links . to terrorist organizations. He . was acquitted of charges relating to the terrorist affiliations but he . was deported to Riyadh, where he now works as a teacher, on suspicion of . immigration charges. In . addition to Russell, Dratel is also currently representing Mohammad el-Mezain, a defendant in the federal prosecution of the Holy . Land Foundation for Relief and Development - an Islamic non-profit . organization that had been based in Richardson, Texas. The fund was shut down on suspicion that it had been used to funnel money to Hamas and other Islamic terrorist organizations. El-Mezain was convicted in 2008 on charges including material support to a foreign terrorist organization, providing material support to a foreign terrorist, and conspiracy to commit money laundering. Claims: Terror suspect Dzhokhar Tsranaev (left) told federal investigators that his sister-in-law, Katherine Russell (right), had nothing to do with the April 15 bombings that killed 3 and injured more than 260 . Russell's brother-in-law, Dzhokhar . Tsarnaev, has reportedly told investigators that Russell was not . involved in the planning and execution of the deadly attacks on April . 15, that left 3 dead and injured more than 260. Dzhokhar's older brother was killed in a police gun battle April 19. The 19-year-old Dzhokhar was captured and charged in connection to the . bombings following a massive manhunt that ended. He was discovered . wounded hiding inside a boat in a backyard. He . is charged with using and conspiring to use a weapon of mass . destruction resulting in death and with malicious destruction of . property resulting in death.

"A suspicious package at a JFK airport mail sorting facility caused a brief scare and quarantine Sunday--and all because of a bag of cosmetics. The FBI says a package was tested after two customs workers reported they felt ill after opening it contained beauty supplies. The package, which originated from China, was likely full of fumes due to a broken bottle of nail polish remover. Panic: New York HazMat teams and the FBI rushed to JFK airport Sunday after a package in a mail sorting facility tested positive for deadly nerve gas . 'The FBI screened and tested the employees and the package they opened,' FBI spokesman J. Peter Donald said in a statement. 'The package in . question was determined to be beauty supplies and nothing further. The . scene has been cleared by FBI personnel.' Donald said said agents have cleared the scene. He said the employees and the package were tested and screened out of 'an abundance of caution.' Tests initially came up positive for VX nerve gas, an extremely deadly chemical warfare agent. Cosmetics: An FBI official later called the incident a false alarm and that the package contained only everyday cosmetics. Reports say the culprit was likely a broken container of nail polish remover . No hiccups: Operations at JFK International airport were not disrupted as authorities swarmed two facilities after the positive test for VX nerve gas . The New York Post reports that the Postal Service facility - which is responsible for sorting international mail bound for the eastern U.S. - and a Customs office a quarter mile away were both quarantined. After the Customs and Border Control agents were overcome, an initial test revealed that the package contained 'chemical-grade weapons and nerve gas.' A second test said the chemical was VX . nerve gas, a deadly synthetic chemical weapon that can be absorbed . through the lungs or the skin. Precautions: It remained unclear why the tests were initially positive for the deadly nerve agent, but authorities did say the quarantine and evacuations came form an 'abundance of caution . It was unclear why tests were positive for the deadly agent or why retesting remained positive. A source told the post that breached packaging likely caused the substance to leak out while in transit. Only two countries - Russia and the United States - are known to possess the nerve agent, though it has been reported that Syria has manufactured it, as well.

"A man who was left in a New Jersey McDonald's sink when he was just hours old has launched a search for his birth mother after being inspired by the success of the 'Burger King baby'. David Volk, from Pen Argyl, Pennsylvania, didn't even try looking for his mother because he had no information about her - but after Katheryn Deprill posted an image on Facebook explaining that she'd been dumped in a Burger King 27 years ago, it took her just three weeks to find her mother. Inspired, Volk decided to do the same, and has now shared an image on his Facebook profile showing him holding a sign reading: 'Please help me! I am looking for my birth mother.' Scroll down for video . Search: David Volk is looking for the mother who left him in a McDonald's bathroom 36 years ago . 'I just never thought there was any . hope,' he told the Star-Ledger.

Volk still had his umbilical cord attached when a manager found him wrapped in a brown plastic bag in the sink of the women's restroom in a McDonald's in Newark, New Jersey in December 1977. He was given the name 'Christopher McDonald' because of where he was found, but his name was legally changed when he was adopted a year later, records show. Volk, who is now 36 and married, said he developed a close bond with his family and was devastated by the loss of his adoptive mother two years ago. He said he isn't angry with his birth mother but simply wishes to meet her and get to know her. Younger years: David was just hours old when he was found in a sink and taken to safety . New home: He was adopted when he was one but his mother, right, passed away two years ago . Scene: He was wrapped in a brown bag and left in a restroom in this Newark McDonald's, which still stands . 'I believe . she was young, maybe hiding her pregnancy or whatever, and she probably . didn't have the means to support me, and I believe that she left me . there for somebody to find me,' he said. He continued: 'I had a wonderful life, great family . that treated me well... I'm very . happy, but I just would like to complete the circle and find my birth . mother.

Her birth mother, Kathy Pochek, learned of the Facebook post and contacted her through a lawyer, revealing to her daughter that she had abandoned her following a rape that she hid from her family when she was just 16. They soon realized they have a long list of things in common - from their names, cars and careers. Bizarrely, Pochek even babysat Deprill's husband when he was a child. 'I have a wonderful family, I would never want to replace them. But being adopted, part of you is missing,' Deprill explained on the Today show alongside her mother and birth mother.

"The welfare state has little or no bearing on how children turn out, an international research project has found. Strong families are the key to producing well adjusted and successful youngsters, it adds. In fact, say the researchers, the children of married parents are likely to do better than those from broken or single-parent families – no matter how much state support the family is given. The study singled out the British welfare state as an example of the failure of state support to make a difference to the lives and success of children. Across the pond: The study said the influence of 'family structure' - whether a child has its two birth parents, or just one parent, or lives in with a step-parent - was more important in Britain than in America . The findings, published in the US in the Journal of Health and Social Behaviour, come in the wake of David Cameron’s announcement of free parenting classes and relationship support  sessions, and a £3.4million website which will give tips on every aspect of child rearing. The findings came in the wake of David Cameron's announcement of free parenting classes . Critics have called the spending a waste, saying that parents have always understood naturally how to bring up children and that a stable family is far more important to a child. The study carried out by researchers at two American universities examined evidence from both Britain and the US – one with a large welfare state, one without – on how the lives of children progress between the ages of five and 13. It said there were a number of risk factors common to both countries that increased the likelihood that a child would have behavioural problems. Boys were more likely to have difficulties than girls, health problems led to other difficulties for children, and children of divorced parents faced a greater likelihood of trouble. In Britain, the study said, the influence of ‘family structure’ – whether a child has its two birth parents, or just one parent, or lives with a step-parent – was more important than in America. Professor Toby Parcel of North Carolina State University said: ‘We found that stronger home environments – those that are intellectually stimulating, nurturing, and physically safe – decrease the likelihood of behaviour problems in both the US and Great Britain.’ ‘We wanted to see whether the role of parents was equally important in both societies because the argument has been made that more developed welfare states, such as Great Britain, can make the role of parents less important, by providing additional supports that can help compensate for situations where households have more limited resources. ‘This study tells us that parents are important in households, regardless of the strength of the welfare state.’ The effect of having two married parents was more important in Britain, the study said. It also found that children from big families were more likely to have problems here. The study found that family structure effects were more pronounced in Britain, where a child from a family with a single mother or multiple children was at a higher risk of having behavioural problems. Broken homes: The study's authors said their findings revealed that parents are important in households, regardless of the strength of the welfare state (file photo) ‘Additionally, the more children in a British family, the greater the likelihood a child from that family had behavioural problems. These effects were absent in  the US.’ The report, Children’s Behaviour Problems in the United States and Great Britain, adds to a large body of evidence which points to the importance of married parents and a stable family background in the upbringing of a child. Mr Cameron’s own research into the happiness of individuals and families in Britain – being carried out by the Office for National Statistics at a cost to taxpayers of £2million a year – has found that marriage makes a difference to levels of life satisfaction. A report on the happiness research last month said: ‘People who are married or in civil partnerships reported the highest average levels of life satisfaction, significantly higher than cohabiting couples. ‘The lowest average rating was reported by people who are divorced or separated, including those who have dissolved civil partnerships.’ The American study was led by Professor Parcel together with Dr Lori Ann Campbell, of Cal State-Northridge college, and Dr Wenxuan Zhong, of University of Illinois.","Research found children from broken homes did worse regardless of how much state support is given .

"A girl photographed at a concert in Ireland performing a sex act on a man has made a separate complaint of sexual assault and may have had her drink spiked, it has been claimed. According to the Irish Times, the 17-year-old has been examined at a sexual assault unit and blood tests have been carried out to see if her drink was tampered with. It follows images showing the teenager performing oral sex at Slane Castle on Saturday which were shared by hundreds of people online. Twitter row: There is no suggestion that the man who she was photographed performing a sex act on at Slane Castle, in Ireland, assaulted her . Gardai are reviewing photographs and videos from the concert. The . newspaper claims that the girl made a verbal complaint relating to . a different 'serious sexual assault' to police working at the concert . but a spokesman was unable to comment. There is no suggestion that the man who she was photographed performing a sex act on assualted her or is suspected of spiking her drink. Meanwhile, another video emerged on YouTube yesterday afternoon of the schoolgirl surrounded by up to eight men. The men appear to push and verbally abuse her as she kisses a different young man to the man she was photographed performing the sex act on. The video has since been removed from YouTube and Irish police are believed to be investigating the footage. Encounter: The teenager was pictured kissing the man in a green hat at the same festival . Police . have confirmed they are investigating the disturbing incident amid . concerns that the images amount to child pornography because she is . under 18. And dozens of . internet commenters have been accused of sexism for mocking the girl . and seeking to reveal her identity - while praising her sexual partner . as a 'hero' and a 'legend'. Campaigners . have warned that the sharing of explicit pictures is a 'growing . problem' which it is almost impossible to prevent due to the fast-moving . nature of social networking. American rapper Eminem was performing to a crowd of 80,000, with police making 63 arrests during the event. Many of the Twitter and Instagram . accounts which shared the pictures of the girl have been shut down, as . has a 'slut-shaming' Facebook page which made fun of the incident. But . the concert achieved web notoriety the next day when the explicit . pictures were widely circulated. Many . internet users were quick to condemn her behaviour - Bridget Moynihan . tweeted that the girl 'has only herself to blame, out in the open . surrounded by people with camera phones. What did she expect.' Others shared images mocking the girl and implying that she was overly sexually promiscuous. It was reported that the person originally responsible for posting the pictures online was a man from Belfast. 'This . is a very sensitive matter and the girl's family are distraught,' a . source told the Irish Sun. 'This is so out of character for her. She's . currently very emotional and confused about the whole thing.' A police spokesman said yesterday: 'Gardai are . aware of the incident and are inquiring into the matter. 'Gardai have . spoken to the female involved and it would be inappropriate for us to . comment any further.' The concerts at Slane Castle, which take . place every year and are considered among the highlights of the Irish . musical calendar, are organised by Lord Conyngham, who lives at the . castle and is known as the 'rock 'n' roll aristocrat', and promoted by . MDC Productions. Venue: The photograph was taken in the grounds of Slane Castle, in County Meath in Ireland . Social networks have asked users to . report the images as quickly as possible so that they can be spotted and . removed by site moderators, who have been instructed to remain . extra-vigilant in looking out for the images from Slane Castle. A . Twitter spokesman said: 'Protecting people's experience on Twitter is . very important and we have a clear set of rules that outline what is and . isn't acceptable behaviour on the platform. 'If . people come across content that may violate our policies, we encourage . them to report it so we can quickly follow up, rather than tweet or . retweet images and links.' A . spokesman for Facebook said: 'At Facebook we take safety incredibly . seriously, and have worked hard for years to develop clear rules and . powerful reporting tools that enable people to easily report things that . make them uncomfortable. We have built a large and highly trained team . of safety experts who review these reports and take action, including . escalating serious cases to the police. 'Unfortunately, . there will always be a tiny number of malicious people who are intent . on harming others, online and offline. It is difficult to prevent this . minority from behaving in this way – but once they do we will work hard . to remove them from Facebook and make sure they are brought to justice.' Cyber-bullying campaigners warned . that this type of incident is increasingly common, especially as web . users aim to damage the reputation of people they know by spreading . photographs of them in compromising positions. Gig: The incident took place on Saturday during a concert by American rapper Eminem . 'This . particular problem is a big one, and it is growing,' said Scott . Freeman, founder of charity Cybersmile. 'With the power of the internet, . this is one example of how its immediate reach can cause huge . destruction. 'It's almost impossible to protect against it, because anyone can take a picture of anyone and share it.' He . said that websites and internet service providers have a duty to crack . down on this type of harmful content, adding: 'If anyone finds . themselves in this situation, they need to contact ISPs and website . moderators to get the content removed.' Last night Clíona Saidléar, policy and communications director with Rape Crisis Network Ireland, said the people who filmed the incident and shared it should be ashamed. Ian Power, communications manager with youth group Spunout, said that the pictures should never have been posted online. 'This is content which should never have been recorded, let alone placed on the internet,' he told the Irish Daily Mail. 'Everyone has made mistakes in their lives, but not everyone has had it so horrifically documented in such a mortifying way. The conversation online has been overwhelming misogynistic also. Some people seem to be regarding this as funny, or banter, when it is not.' Jackie O'Callaghan of the National Parents' Council said that the incident has left many parents worried about their children when attending concerts such as the one at Slane. 'As a parent, hearing about this did make me worry, of course, and it would worry other parents,' she said. Victim: Hannah Smith killed herself this month after receiving abuse from trolls on social network Ask.fm . Despite the widespread condemnation of the girl, very little criticism has been made of the unidentified men featured in the photographs. Twitter user Conor McCullagh wrote: 'What about the hero who was with [the girl], now he deserves a medal.' However, others took to the internet to criticise the apparent double standards. @zintendo wrote on Twitter: 'Cute that everyone is talking about [the girl], nobody is judging the guy. #yourmisogynyisshowing'. Journalist Sarah Ditum wrote on the New Statesman website that the man was considered just 'a bystander' while 'people tried to use the pictures to shame, trash and demolish a young woman'. The alleged misogyny comes in the wake of complaints from prominent women, including MPs, that they have been the subject of vile threats delivered via Twitter by anonymous trolls. A British teenager, Hannah Smith, killed herself earlier this month after being mercilessly bullied by trolls on social network Ask.fm, leading to calls for greater action over online abuse.

"Google has received a patent for a technology that could revolutionise searching - as well as giving the search engine unprecedented knowledge about the world. Humans have an innate ability, thanks to our eyes and brain, to look at any object - from a cat to a lamp to a river-bank - and recognise it and catalogue it. This is far less easy for computers to do - but Google may be about to change that, thanks to its patent for 'automatic large scale video object recognition'. Indexing the world: Google has received a patent for technology that could identify and tag objects according to indicators such as colour, movement and features . The patent describes technology that . can scan a video - for instance the thousands of hours uploaded to .

For instance, you could have your . photo taken outside Big Ben in London, or film a short video outside . London's most-famous clock, upload it to Google, and without giving any . more data, Google could tag your video with 'Big Ben' and 'London'. The patent could signal a revolution . in how we use the internet, especially if the technology becomes . embedded in smartphones - but is likely to cause a lot of concern over . privacy issues. Civil liberty groups have already warned that this could provide Google with a wealth of personal detail about your private life.

'However, such human input is . expensive, time-consuming, and cannot scale up to handle very large data . sets comprising hundreds of thousands of objects and millions of . images.' Nick Pickles, director of privacy and civil liberties campaign group Big Brother Watch, said: 'Yet again this looks like users losing control of what happens to their data. 'If information about your location is instantly added to photos, not only does it alert people to where you are it means Google can associate your identity with even more information, like where you’ve visited and whether you have pets.

"A teenager  has testified that he had 'a lot' of sex with his Catholic high school tutor after she took his virginity - even though she claims he was the one to pressure her into a relationship. The boy, who was just 15 at the time of the alleged three-month relationship in 2013, took the stand for the fourth day in Kent County Circuit Court in Michigan on Wednesday. During his testimony, he denied that he had 'stalked, coerced and brutalized' Abigail Simon, now 35, into going out with him and having sex, as she has claimed, Mlive reported. Simon was fired from her role as a tutor and study hall supervisor at Catholic Central and West Catholic schools after the boy's mother found pictures of her in a garter belt on her son's phone. Charged: Abigail Simon, a 35-year-old math tutor pictured during a previous court appearance, is on trial for allegedly having sex with a 15-year-old male student. She has claimed her coerced her into having sex . Denial: Simon's lawyers say the young man  was the aggressor in the relationship - which he denies . She was arrested at her family's home in Flint in August and is charged with four counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct. On the stand on Wednesday, he denied that he had pressured her into sex, slapped her or held her down, as she had claimed. He also said that she had never told him to stop or cried during sex. 'She never said no,' he said. 'I never forcibly raped her.' They are accused of starting a relationship through text messages in February 2013 before having sex in March 2013. The relationship continued through April. Arrested: Abigail Simon, in her booking photo, was arrested in August over the three-month relationship . He claimed that he was a virgin before he entered into a relationship with Simon and that the teacher had introduced him to rough sex. He testified that they first had sex on the sofa in her apartment after a dinner date and that she performed a sex act on him. Before the dinner, they had checked the restaurant to make sure there was no one there they knew, he said. Afterwards, almost all of their encounters allegedly took place at Simon's apartment in the 300 block of Bridge Street North West in Grand Rapids. 'We had intercourse a lot,' the teenager said, later adding that they had sex every other day. They also took day trips together, he testified, including to Chicago to meet her friends in early March and later to South Bend. The court has also seen texts between the two, which the prosecution claimed showed Simon was sexually forward with the boy. One of the texts from Simon to the boy read: 'I'm scared that you're only 15.' Simon and the alleged victim referred to each other in pet names, the teen testified Monday. He said Simon called him 'boo' and he called his former tutor 'baby girl', according to Wood TV. The boy was also quizzed about how controlling he was in the relationship. He denied that he made her send photos of herself while she traveled alone to ensure she was not with men. Inappropriate: Abigail Marie Simon, 35, was working at Catholic Central High School in Grand Rapids when she allegedly began the relationship with the 15-year-old boy in February 2013 . He said that it was Simon who became upset and refused to talk to him when he attended a party where there were other girls. She instructed him to go to her apartment, he said. Afterwards, he punched a wall and injured his hand because he felt guilty for making her worry about the party, he said. Prosecutors read a text from Simon that she sent while on spring break in Florida. Simon told the teen he should be with girls his age, saying: 'I'm just too old, as much as that stinks.' However the victim refused, begging Simon in another text: 'Please give me one more chance.' Simon is charged with first-degree sexual assault and accosting a minor for immoral purposes.","The boy, now 17, took the stand on Wednesday for his fourth day of testimony in the case of Abigail Simon, his former tutor .

Philip is said to have complained that the annual Ball, at which girls aged 17 and 18 were expected to meet their suitably-moneyed future husbands, was ‘bloody daft’. The Queen’s sister, Princess Margaret, was even more forthright, saying later ‘we had to put a stop to it . . . every tart in London was getting in!’ Since 1958 the ball was held sporadically at various exclusive venues in the capital to varying degrees of success before being relaunched in 2009 and held annually since, albeit without its royal seal of approval.","Event was introduced by King George III in 1780 as a way to celebrate his wife’s birthday .

The name Setenil came from the the Latin septem nihil ¿ 'seven times no' - after Catholic kings took seven attempts to overthrow the Moors . This appears to be a reference to the Christian conquests in the 15th century. Catholic kings were reclaiming territory across the region from the Moors from Africa, who since 711 had ruled the area. But it took the Catholic warriors seven attempts to reconquer the city and they finally drove the Moors out in 1485. The extra 'de las Bodegas' was added in the 15th century - either to honour the vineyards which died out because of pests in the 19th century, or in reference to the caves which maintained local produce, Environmental Graftti reported.","Town built along a narrow river gorge eroded by the Rio Trejo river in Spain .

"Pope Francis is selling one of his two Harley Davidson motobikes in order to raise money for charity. The 1,585cc Harley-Davidson Dyna Super Glide was given to the Pope in June 2013 along with another bike to mark the 110th anniversary of the motorcycle brand. The hog, which has been signed on the tank by the Pope, is to be auctioned off by Bonhams auction house in Paris, France in February and will raise money for Caritas Roma, a charity which works on behalf of the Roman Catholic church. Scroll down for video . Pope Francis announced he was selling one of his two Harley Davidson motorbikes and hopes to raise £12,000 for charity. But it fetched more than £200,000 at auction . The pontiff was given two bikes and a leather jacket by Harley Davidson to celebrate their 110th anniversary . The bike, which has an estimated cost of £12,000, will be sold with no reserve in order to raise as much money as possible for Caritas Romas. The charity hope to use any money to renovate a soup kitchen in Rome which offers food and shelter to more than 1,000 people. Ben Walker, head of motorcycles at Bonhams, said: 'We are incredibly honoured to be selling this item on behalf of Caritas Roma. We hope to be able to do both Pope Francis and Harley-Davidson proud by raising a significant amount of money for a very worthy cause.' Four days after being given the gift, His Holiness blessed a group of 100 Hells Angles in St Peters Square . At the time the Pope laid his hands on a disabled Angel during the open blessing in the Vatican City . Two choppers and a leather jacket were given to the pontiff in June last year in order to celebrate the 110th anniversary of Harley Davidson. Four days after the gifts were given to him, Francis blessed a crowd of Hells Angle bikers in a congregation at an open air mass in St Peter's Square. It is not the first time that a papal vehicle has been sold in order to raise money. In 2005 a Volkswagen Golf which belonged to Pope Benedict was sold anonymously on eBay to German man. During a ceremony in the Sistine Chapel yesterday Francis encouraged women to breastfeed their babies if they were hungry, saying they were the 'most important' people there . It was only when he looked at the registration documents that he realised who the previous owner was, prompting him to re-sell the car for £127,000 to a Las Vegas club. Yesterday Pope Francis was pictured blessing children in the Sistine Chapel in Rome, and encouraged mothers to breast feed their children if they wanted, adding that the children were the 'most important' people there.

"'Gun-Free' zones are common in the United States, especially near schools and other government buildings. Second Amendment activists say the areas serve as an invitation to criminals who want to strike without encountering armed resistance . Second Amendment activists in the United States now have a mobile app that will tell them where their guns aren't welcome - and where they can protest by boycotting businesses in so-called 'gun-free zones.' The December school shooting in Newtown Connecticut occurred in such a zone. U.S. schools and other government buildings are generally inside them. Gun control activists say they make everyone safer, while gun-rights proponents insist they only serve to tell criminals where they can strike without fear of return-fire. The Gun-Free Zone app is aimed at both groups. It's available for iPhones, iPads and Android devices, and it identifies the 20 nearest businesses, churches, schools and other commercial establishments, telling a user if each one is firearm-friendly or gun-free. And for pistol-packing enthusiasts, it can tell them where to enforce boycotts. 'By having the app in everybody's hands, they can decide: If you feel strongly about the gun issue, vote with your wallet. Don't patronize this store, patronize this [other] store,' app creator John Peden told KUTV-TV in Salt Lake City, Utah. Scroll down for video . The Gun-Free Zone mobile app tells users where firearms are forbidden in America. The app's creators say it will allow gun-rights enthusiasts to boycott businesses where firearms aren't welcome . 'If my gun is not welcome in your store, my money is not welcome either,' Peden said in an interview with The Daily Caller. But he allowed that gun control-obsessed celebrities could just as easily use the app to hang out ni the gun-free zones, where they might feel safer. 'I'm sure that Piers Morgan will use it for the opposite reason,' Peden said. 'He's going to want to shop in all the gun free zones he can.' Peden conceded that criminals might use his app to target victims in places, like Newtown, where armed personal defense is illegal. But he also said he thinks that makes gun-free zones more dangerous places for law-abiding citizens, and therefore worth avoiding.By steering clear of the zones, he said, 'me and my family will stay safe, and we have less chance of being involved in a shooting at a mall or something like that.' Connecticut State Police led this line of children away from the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. after a 2012 shooting at the school, which was in a gun-free zone . National Rifle Association CEO Wayne LaPierre spoke at the 2013 Conservative Political Action Conference near Washington, DC. The NRA is America's most powerful group of gun owners, claiming 4.5 million members nationwide . In the wake of the 2012 Newtown school shooting, gun control activists have taken their anger out on the NRA. Members of a group called 'MomsRising' protested in front of the group's Virginia headquarters in March 2013 . Eventually, Peden predicted, every commercial business in America will be tagged by the app's users. All that crowdsourced data is constantly shared with everyone who has downloaded it -- several thousand so far. And the app is free. Utah gun-control activist Gary Sackett told the Daily Herald in Provo, Utah that the app will just give gun owners new ideas about places where they can lawfully get together in large numbers. 'It is not something that is designed to increase public safety,' Sackett said, 'if it is to encourage people to head off to the nearest watering hole that might be gun-friendly.'

"The advocacy group Gun Owners of America has responded to the mass shooting in Connecticut in their own fashion – by saying that gun control supporters ‘have the blood of little children on their hands.’The organization’s executive director, Larry Pratt, said in a statement immediately following the horrific December 14 shootings in Newtown, that ‘blood is on the hands of members of Congress and the Connecticut legislators who voted to ban guns from all schools in Connecticut.’ The pro-gun lobbyist said today on MSNBC’s ‘Hardball’ claimed that if the teachers at Sandy Hook Elementary had guns, the whole tragedy could be prevented. Scroll down for video . Outspoken: Gun Owners of America Executive Director Larry Pratt, pictured in April, said gun control advocates have blood on their hands . Extreme opinion: He said in a statement immediately following the shootings that Congress has blood on their hands . Pratt wrote in his first statement: ‘The only thing accomplished by gun free zones is to insure that mass murderers can slay more before they are finally confronted by someone with a gun.’ And speaking today on ‘Hardball with Chris Matthews,’ Pratt said: ‘Nothing is 100 percent, but if teachers, janitors, and principals were able to defend themselves with guns,’ the children of Newtown ‘might have had a chance.’ He stated: ‘It would serve you better than sitting like fish in a barrel.’ Also in his ‘Hardball’ interview, Pratt stated that it was necessary to be ‘prepared’ and ‘control the government.’ However, David Chipman, a former special agent of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms said on MSNBC that Pratt’s argument crumbled at first blush. ‘Law enforcement is here as a force of good and we’re the good guys,’ he said. The National Rifle Association (NRA), the largest pro-gun advocacy group in the nation, however, has remained conspicuously quiet. Following the shooting, the NRA deactivated its Facebook page, then issuing a very minimal page where commenting is disabled. Driving point home: Speaking today on 'Hardball,' Pratt said that the shooting might have been prevented if the teachers had guns . Meanwhile, Democratic gun-rights advocates on Monday joined the growing number of lawmakers in their party who have started to call for limits on assault weapons, a sign that the Connecticut school massacre could be the 'tipping point' to revive the gun control debate in Washington. Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Virginia Senator Mark Warner, both Democrats who have earned top marks from the powerful National Rifle Association, said they would now be open to more regulation of military-style rifles like the one used to kill 20 young children and six adults on Friday. And House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said she would support legislation banning assault weapons after previously throwing cold water on the idea. 'The voices of reason cannot be silent,' she said on the House floor late on Monday. ''Through administrative and legislative action, we must limit the proliferation of weapons and ammunition that have no other purpose than to kill citizens.' U.S. lawmakers have not approved a major new federal gun law since 1994, and a ban on certain semi-automatic rifles known as assault weapons expired in 2004. Demanding change: Obama, speaking at a vigil last night in Newtown, said that there must be harsher gun control laws enforced . Memorial: Candles are lit among mementos at a memorial for victims of the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School, on December 17, 2012 in Newtown, Connecticut . Senator Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat who authored the previous ban, pledged to introduce legislation early next year to ban the weapons. Gunman Adam Lanza shot and killed 26 people, including his mother, before killing himself . Previous attempts at toughening U.S. gun laws have failed amid opposition from the NRA and other gun-lobby groups - even after mass shootings across the country. But the shift by moderate Democrats showed that the weapons lobby could face a tougher fight this time to ward off calls for more regulation. However, with Congress and President Obama busy trying to resolve the 'fiscal cliff' of tax and spending deadlines, even liberal Democrats acknowledge that any review of gun laws would not take place until 2013. A hunter and member of the National Rifle Association, Manchin said the availability of such high-powered weapons does not make sense, and that he knew of no hunter who went out with assault rifles or clips with 30 rounds of ammunition. 'This awful massacre of our youngest children has changed us, and everything should be on the table,' said Manchin, who once ran a campaign ad in which he shot environmental legislation with a rifle. Solemn: People light candles at a makeshift memorial in Newtown, Connecticut Monday night . 'There's got to be a way to put reasonable restrictions, particularly as we look at assault weapons, as we look at these fast clips of ammunition,' Warner, whose state is home to the NRA, told The Washington Post. John Yarmuth, a Democratic U.S. representative from Kentucky, also shifted position. 'I have been largely silent on the issue of gun violence over the past six years, and I am now as sorry for that as I am for what happened to the families who lost so much in this most recent, but sadly not isolated, tragedy,' he said in a statement. There has been little word on assault weapons from Republicans, who are traditionally strong gun rights advocates, even in the wake of the Newtown deaths. Kentucky's Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader in the Senate, offered words of comfort, but did not mention weapons when he spoke on Monday in the Senate chamber, where a parade of Democratic senators called for greater gun control. Representatives for the National Rifle Association did not respond to a request for comment. The lobby group has no statement on the school shooting on its website. It has not posted any comments on social media since Friday. Tragic: The funeral for Jack Pinto, 6, happened today . Obama called on Sunday for the country to change its approach to violence, although he did not use the word 'gun.' The White House said on Monday gun control is part but not the entire answer to address the violence in the United States. But the tide of national emotion over the deaths of so many children could make a difference this time. 'One of great strengths of the NRA has been its bipartisanship,' said Jeremy Mayer, a political scientist at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia. 'Now it's almost all Republicans and it will be harder for the NRA to deal with a bunch of united and angry Democrats.' Police said 20-year-old Adam Lanza was armed with hundreds of bullets in high-capacity magazines of about 30 rounds each for the Bushmaster AR 15 rifle with which he mowed down the children and staff. He also carried two handguns and had a shotgun in a car.

"Finding people more attractive after a few drinks has long been known as the 'beer goggle' effect - but experts are divided about whether this phenomenon actually exists. To put it to the test, researchers from Bristol conducted lab experiments to gauge whether drink changed people's perceptions of what is attractive. Volunteers were asked to look at photos of men, women and landscapes before and after drinking - and in every category alcohol affected their perceptions.

This suggests the 'Beer Goggles' effect is less to do with the level of attractiveness, and more to do with a lack of restraint and decision-making skills. The volunteers were divided into two groups - one group drank just one alcoholic drink, while the other drank a non-alcoholic placebo drink. Among the images there were 20 male faces, . 20 female faces and 20 landscapes. Researchers from the University of Bristol's Tobacco and Alcohol Research Group (TARG) said attractiveness ratings were higher for all three image types among the alcohol group compared to the placebo group. The study leaders said this confirmed the beer goggle hypothesis, which claims people become more attractive to the opposite sex after a few drinks. Now the Bristol team is extending the research into the more realistic setting of a pub. It is conducting tests over four nights at three pubs in Bristol: the Green Man, the Portcullis and the Victoria. Researcher Olivia Maynard said: 'It's a bit of fun, but there is a serious message. 'If alcohol does change perceptions of attractiveness then that could be a factor in the kind of risky behaviour you see when people are drunk, such as unprotected sex.' Attractiveness ratings were higher for all three image types among the alcohol group compared to the placebo group. The study leaders said this confirmed the beer goggle hypothesis, which claims people become more attractive to the opposite sex after a few drinks, and less so when they're sober again.

"The Ebola epidemic devastating parts of West Africa will have killed tens of thousands of people by the middle of December unless urgent action is taken. In a report published today, scientists warn the window of opportunity to control the outbreak is 'rapidly closing'. As a result, there could be 'calamitous repercussions', unless international efforts to control the disease are substantially increased. Grave diggers create graves to bury Ebola victims at Bong county outskirt of Monrovia, Liberia. Scientists have warn that tens of thousands more will die unless international efforts to control the virus are increased . A carpenter makes new caskets for sale in New Kru in Monrovia, Liberia. Even as Liberians get sick and die of Ebola, many beds in treatment centres are empty because of the government's order that the bodies of all suspected Ebola victims be cremated. Today scientists called for more beds to treat Ebola sufferers . A team of U.S. researchers used mathematical modelling to predict infection rates in Liberia's most populated county, Montserrado. They calculated that without extra help, as many as 171,000 people could succumb to Ebola by December 15, representing 12 per cent of an overall population of some 1.38 million. In Montserrado alone, there could be more than 90,000 deaths by that time, many of them unreported. A single infected individual could pass on the infection to an average of 2.49 people in Montserrado, the researchers calculated. Lead researcher Professor Alison Galvani, from the School of Public Health at Yale University, said: 'Our predictions highlight the rapidly closing window of opportunity for controlling the outbreak and averting a catastrophic toll of new Ebola cases and deaths in the coming months. 'Although we might still be within the midst of what will ultimately be viewed as the early phase of the current outbreak, the possibility of averting calamitous repercussions from an initially delayed and insufficient response is quickly eroding.' The news comes as the World Health Organization's emergency committee decided screening passengers for Ebola may have a 'limited effect' in stopping the spread of the virus. A man prepares to enter the isolation unit at the Ebola treatment centre in Lakka, Liberia. Today scientists warned a single infected individual could pass on the infection to an average of 2.49 people . The committee warned that 'resource demands may be significant' when screening incoming passengers, but that it is up to individual Governments to decide whether the measure is necessary. Passengers are already screened as they leave Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. Writing in the journal The Lancet Infectious Diseases, the researchers today warned some 97,940 cases of the disease could be averted if the international community stepped up control measures immediately, starting from October 31, according to their model. This would require more Ebola treatment beds, a five-fold increase in the speed at which new cases are detected, and the allocation of protective kits to households of patients awaiting admission to clinics. At best, just over 53,957 cases could be prevented if interventions are delayed until November 15, said the researchers. Health workers carry the body of a Liberian woman suspected of contracting Ebola virus. Experts said today the 'current global health strategy is woefully inadequate to stop the current volatile Ebola epidemic' Around 9,000 Ebola cases and 4,500 deaths have been reported in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea since the outbreak began in December last year. Health workers in the US, Spain and UK have been infected after being exposed to the virus in Africa. There are fears of the disease spreading from Africa to other parts of the world despite restrictions at air and sea ports. Of the five African countries originally affected by the outbreak, Nigeria and Senegal have now been declared Ebola-free. Co-author Professor Frederick Altice, also from Yale University, said: 'The current global health strategy is woefully inadequate to stop the current volatile Ebola epidemic. 'At a minimum, capable logisticians are needed to construct a sufficient number of Ebola treatment units in order to avoid the unnecessary deaths of tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of people.'","This is unless international efforts to control virus are increased .

"There is no proof that chocolate and red wine help you live longer, despite millions hoping they do, scientists claim. A study failed to find any evidence that resveratrol, an ingredient found in the skin of red grapes and chocolate, is linked to long life. The antioxidant is believed to have a range of anti-ageing properties. But researchers say levels found in the body had no ‘substantial influence’ on inflammation, cardiovascular disease, cancer or longevity. No link: A study failed to find any evidence that either chocolate or red wine helps stave off disease . Resveratrol is one of a number  of so-called ‘healthy chemicals’ found in red wine, called poly- phenols, which are also available as supplements. Previous studies have shown the plant compound improves the health of mice fed a high-fat diet and increases their lifespan. But there has been controversy about whether it really does hold back the march of time, with conflicting results from some studies on chocolate. U.S. researchers said the latest study was designed to investigate the ‘French paradox’, the phenomenon of low heart disease rates in France despite a diet high in cholesterol and saturated fat. The paradox has been attributed to the regular intake of red wine, in particular to resveratrol. Dr Richard Semba, of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, and colleagues recruited 783 men and women aged 65 or older. All of them had taken part in a study between 1998 and 2009 focusing on two villages in the heart of Italy’s Chianti wine-growing area. Dr Semba and his team measured resveratrol levels in the urine of the volunteers at the start of the Chianti study in 1998. Over the following nine years 268 of the volunteers died. Of 639 who had initially been free of cardiovascular disease, one in four (174) developed heart problems, and 34 of the 734 who were free of cancer went on to develop the disease, says a report in JAMA Internal Medicine. The researchers divided the volunteers into four based on high to low resveratrol intake but found virtually the same proportion of deaths between the groups. Dr Semba said: ‘Resveratrol levels achieved with a Western diet... do not show any apparent protective association with disease … and are not associated with lifespan.’ Maureen Talbot, of the British Heart Foundation, said: ‘People should continue to eat plenty of fruit, veg and wholegrains. ‘We recognise the need to learn more about the action of resveratrol though, so are funding research into its reported disease-combating properties and how it affects the heart and circulatory system. ‘This research is vital because it could potentially form the basis of future medicines.’","U.S. researchers set out to investigate low heart disease 'French paradox'

"They gave me my life back: Kirsty said she is thankful every day to her lung donor . A woman’s life has been transformed after having a double lung transplant. Kirsty Gedes, 28, who was diagnosed with Cystic Fibrosis when she was nine months old, received the organs in 2009. The make-up artist from Lanarkshire has since managed to scale Ben Nevis in Scotland. She said: 'There isn’t a single day goes by that I don’t think of, and thank, my donor ... not one. That person gave me my life back. 'This person signed a piece of paper and saved me. When I got the call about the transplant in November 2009, the day after my birthday, I said that nothing will ever top it. It’s an amazing gift. 'I was fortunate Cystic Fibrosis didn’t get its claws into me, so to speak, until my teenage years. 'It is a very slow progressive illness, so you don’t realise how much is taken away from you until you can no longer walk or you have to completely rely on people.' Kirsty went to university but had to drop out a year later after becoming extremely ill. She was warned if she didn't concentrate on her health she could die as her lung function had dropped to 35 per cent. 'From the age of 24 onwards my life was not my own anymore, it was taken by Cystic Fibrosis,' she said. In 2008, Kirsty, who lives in Glenboig, Lanarkshire, with boyfriend, Dougie Harvey, 27, had a massive lung collapse, in what she described as the scariest moments of her life. She then suffered two more collapses and her lung capacity fell to 25 per cent. She said: 'That’s when I was told the transplant needed to happen.' She spent eight months on the transplant list and required around 60 pills a day and oxygen and a ventilator at night. However, she still managed to continue studying hairdressing at college. She said: 'The eight months passed in a bit of a blur. You have to put life on hold, you have no choice in that, but I always stayed positive. 'My mum used to say ‘If you give up I’m going to kill you’.' Then in November 2009 she had the call from Freeman's Hospital in Newcastle to let her know they had found suitable lungs. She had the transplant in a seven-hour operation. Just days later Kirsty was able to cycle . on an exercise bike for 50minutes and she hasn't looked back. She has . raised thousands of pounds for the Cystic Fibrosis Trust. Climb every mountain: Kirsty managed to reach the top of Ben Nevis at 4,409ft .

'I’ve also taken part in three 10Ks, even though I hate running! I do it because I can raise awareness and money for charity. 'I said my donor’s name while I was doing it, things like ‘We have to keep going’. In the run-up to the finish line I’m sobbing my eyes out because I’m so happy and thankful. 'I have so many things to be thankful for and I’m so grateful to have the chance to watch my nieces and nephew - Caitlin, 13, Tamsyn, 11 and six-year-old Joshua - grow up.'

"Rebecca Bernard has 51 previous convictions for crimes including violence and threatening behaviour. She led an all-girl gang that brought terror to their town and has been the subject of two Asbos for making her elderly neighbours’ lives a misery. You might have thought that when the 23-year-old attacked two innocent men in a nightclub with a champagne bottle, a custodial sentence would be inevitable. Bernard (pictured with a male companion) leaving Bolton Crown Court: She gained notoriety in 2007 after she turned a quiet cul-de-sac into a 'hoodie zone' But she walked free from court after a judge decided she was a good mother to her three young children. In the latest drink-fuelled assault, Bernard smashed a bottle over one  victim’s head then stabbed the other in the arm with its jagged neck. A court heard she launched the attack because she believed, wrongly, that the men were laughing at her. Ian Wilson, 49, suffered a head injury after being knocked unconscious in the assault and has been left scarred for life. His friend Paul Emery, 46, was left so traumatised he is now too frightened to go into his local town centre. Bernard, who is notorious in her home town of Rochdale for her behaviour, suffers from schizophrenia and claims she heard voices in her head. On the night of the attack she had been drinking heavily, worsening her condition. She had previously been given a non-custodial sentence for another bottle attack. At Bolton Crown Court, Bernard wept as she was given a 12-month jail term suspended for 18 months after Judge Charles Bloom QC said the ‘dedication’ she showed to her three children aged six, three and two saved her from prison.

"The Fifty Shades of Grey series of erotic novels are the favorite reading material among former CIA captives being held at the notorious Guantanamo detention camp, it has emerged. U.S. congressman Jim Moran made the revelation after touring Camp 7, the top-security facility that holds more than a dozen 'high-value' prisoners. The Democratic Representative of Virginia said the bestselling book by British author E. L. James was the most requested book - even beating the Koran. Odd: The Fifty Shades of Grey series of erotic novels are the favorite reading material among former CIA captives being held at the notorious Guantanamo detention camp. This is a file picture of detainees at Guantanamo . As reported by the Huffington Post, Mr Moran, who visited the Cuban camp last week, said: 'Rather than the Koran, the book that is requested most by the (detainees) is 'Fifty Shades of Grey.' 'They've read the entire series in English, but we were willing to translate it. 'I guess there's not much going on, these guys are going nowhere, so what the hell.' Mr Moran, who favours shutting down the detention camp on the Guantanamo Bay U.S. Naval Base in Cuba, said he learned about the book's popularity while touring Camp 7 - which holds five men charged with plotting the September 11 attacks in 2001. Popular: U.S. congressman Jim Moran said the bestselling book by British author E. L. James was the most requested book - even beating the Koran . A military spokesman said he could not . discuss details of Camp 7, whose inmates were held in secret CIA prisons . before being sent to Guantanamo in 2006. 'We don't discuss our high-value detainees except in the most generic terms. Further, we do not discuss the assertions made by members of Congress,' said Lieutenant Colonel Samuel House, a spokesman for the prison camp. Some prisoners are taking part in a hunger strike to protest their indefinite detention. Journalists are not allowed to visit that part of the detention camp but can tour the other prisons and the library that provides books, magazines and DVDs to all 166 captives. During a visit last week, Reuters saw an eclectic mix of books in numerous languages, from religious tomes to Star Trek novelizations, Agatha Christie mysteries, stress reduction workbooks and the Greek classic 'The Odyssey'. Also on offer is 'The Hunger Games,' according to a librarian who goes by the nickname Zorro. 'We have the movie and the book too,' he said. Guantanamo librarians have said in the past that they screen reading material for sexual content, even blacking out photos of scantily clad women in the advertisements in sports magazines. Fifty Shades of Grey is a 2011 erotic romance novel and is the first installment in the Fifty Shades trilogy. Secure: The inmates of Camp 7 were held in secret CIA prisons before being sent to Guantanamo in 2006. This file picture shows guards at the gate of the Cuban camp . It traces the deepening relationship between a college graduate, Anastasia Steele, and a young business magnate, Christian Grey. The book gained much publicity because of its explicitly erotic scenes. The series has topped best-seller lists around the world and sold more than 70 million copies worldwide.","U.S. congressman .

"When Jackie Sharp lost her cat Dallas in 2000, she had resigned herself to the fact that she would never see him again. Her cute cat had been with her through good times and bad as she lived in Petaluma. At the age of 3, Dallas disappeared into a creek near her home. 'I was going through my first year of college at Santa Rosa Junior College, and it was crazy and stressful,' said Jackie to the Petaluma Argus. Reunited: Jackie Sharp and Dallas the cat reunited, 13 years since he had gone missing . 'It was horrible,' she said. 'I was looking everywhere for him. It was very sad. I loved that cat. At the end of the day I would come home and he would just curl up on my lap and purr. He was always there for me. He got me through a lot.' Last week, she received a call from the VCA Animal Care Center in Rohnert Park saying that they had her cat. 'I was in shock,' said Jackie, 34. 'It has been 13 years. I figured he had found a new home or was gone by now.' In the intervening years, Jackie moved away but always kept pictures of Dallas and occasionally paused to wonder what happened. Jackie was able to be tracked down because Dallas had a microchip implanted in his neck when he was a kitten. The devices, which are about the size of a grain of rice and are used on dogs, cats and other pets. They carry a unique identification number, which is linked to the owner’s contact information. Hinebaugh Creek: Dallas disappeared in this creek near to Jackie's home and was found in the same creek 13 years later . Dr. Robin Schaffner, the emergency veterinarian who treated Dallas said that the cat was close to dying and would probably have been put down had the vet not found the microchip. 'He was completely dehydrated and emaciated. He probably would have passed away within hours without aggressive treatment. The microchip saved his life,' Dr Shaffner said. It took her awhile to realize they were talking about Dallas. 'It was so amazing,' she said. 'He was the coolest cat ever and I missed him so much.' Incredibly, a man discovered Dallas in the same creek where he disappeared in 2000. He was taken to Laurie Atwood who feeds some of the cats living by the creek. She says that she was determined he would survive, 'It’s not going to be easy, but if this cat can do it, I can do it.' Dallas was given life-saving treatment and put on a feeding tube and given a blood transfusion. Last weekend, Jackie was able to take him home. She says that Dallas recognised her the moment he entered. 'He stared at me, then he climbed up into my lap and started to purr,' she said. 'I always loved his eyes with those grey specks in them. Once I saw his eyes, I knew it was him. He’s a fighter. If he can make it through living in a creek for 13 years, he can make it through anything.'","Dallas the cat disappeared down a creek never to be seen again .

"Among the tragic victims of the Sandy Hook massacre were remarkable stories of survival - and heroism. First grade teacher Kaitlin Roig escaped unharmed when crazed gunman Adam Lanza forced his way into the elementary school on Friday - and so did all of her students. The 29-year-old had been teaching 15 children at about 9:30 that morning when . the classroom windows suddenly shattered. Scroll down for video . Hero: First-grade teacher Kaitlin Roig escaped unharmed when crazed gunman Adam Lanza forced his way into the elementary school on Friday - and so did all of her students . Reacting immediately, Ms Roig, 24, whisked the children into a bathroom. She told ABC News: 'I put one of my students on top of the toilet. I was telling them, it's going to be OK, you're going to be all right. 'I told them to be absolutely quiet because I was just so afraid if he did come in he would hear us and start shooting the door. Killer: Adam Lanza forced his way into Sandy Hook Elementary on Friday morning, killing 20 children and six adults . 'I said there are bad guys out there now. We need to wait for the good guys. 'The . kids were being so good. They asked, ""Can we go  see if anyone is out . there? I just want Christmas, I don't want to die, I just want to have . Christmas."" 'I said, ""You're . going to have Christmas and Hanukkah."" I tried to be positive. If they . started crying I would take their face and say it's going to be OK.' She was struck by the bravery of the children in her class. She told the network: 'One of my students was saying, ""I know karate, so it's OK."" 'I said, “We're staying here until someone comes to get us out.” When authorities did finally come to the bathroom, Ms Roig said she wasn't taking any chances. 'The . police came and started knocking and obviously I was completely beside . myself. I said, “I don't believe you.

"The last time the Rolling Stones wowed a West Country crowd quite like they did at the Glastonbury Festival on Saturday night was when they played the Stonehenge opening ceremony in 2300BC. That, at any rate, was the joke doing the rounds on Twitter late on Saturday, not that you could find anyone at Glastonbury making cracks about superannuated rock stars. Mick Jagger might be a knight of the realm who turns 70 this month, and Keith Richards might now sport something resembling an old man’s paunch, but they, Charlie Watts and Ronnie Wood (at 66, the baby of the band, and also the new boy, having joined as recently as 1975), put on a show that the teenagers in the audience will tell their grandchildren about. Scroll down for video . Showing the kids how it's done: The Rolling Stones performed on the Pyramid stage to a euphoric crowd of more than 170,000 . Voices of experience: The band has an aggregate age of 276. Front man Mick Jagger (second left) turns 70 this month and Ronnie Wood (left) is the baby of the band at 66 . Who are you calling grandad? Mick Jagger's ostentatious dancing dominated the electrifying performance . The grandparents in the audience –and there were plenty of them, too – probably already have. Glastonbury has hosted lots of huge headline acts in the 43 years since Marc Bolan, the first of them, set foot a little gingerly on Michael Eavis’s dairy farm. The admission in 1970 was £1, which included free milk from Eavis’s herd. Tickets now cost over £200, and if you want to drink milk, you buy your own. In the intervening years, Bob Dylan, Paul McCartney, David Bowie, Bruce Springsteen, U2 and Oasis have all performed there. But never the Stones, making this the headline act of all headline acts, before a euphoric crowd of more than 170,000. Not even Glastonbury had seen anything like it. By the time the band came on at around 9.45pm, a circus contortionist would have been hard pressed to get within 500 yards of the festival’s main Pyramid stage. Beforehand, as a glorious Somerset day cooled to dusk, there was almost as much apprehension as excitement among festival-goers. Could the Stones, with an aggregate age of 276, possibly live up to their own mythology? Squeezed next to me, so close that we had to synchronise our jigging like a pair of middle-aged backing singers, was a retired businessman from Croydon, Andy, who first saw the Stones at the Red Lion pub in Sutton, Surrey, in 1963. He saw them again at the famous gig in Hyde Park in 1969, two days after the sudden death of Brian Jones, but this was the first time since. Could they possibly be as good as he remembered? Stamina: Jagger's dynamic performance lasted more than two hours and made some of his fellow band mates look tired . Timeless: Ronnie Wood and Keith Richards entertained teenagers, parents and grandparents on Saturday night . Mature: There was no disguising Ronnie Wood (left) and Keith Richard's (right) advanced years as they put in a historic performance on the Pyramid Stage . They were better. In part, because the amplification is so much more sophisticated now. But also because when these elderly men take the stage, the years drop away as if spirited by a Brown Sugar-loving genie. Close up, of course, there’s no disguising their age. Richards looks bizarrely as if he could be John McEnroe’s raddled grandfather, while Watts, the drummer, his grey hair politely coiffed, looks like everyone’s auntie Daphne. Throughout, like auntie Daphne at a family party, he wore a benign half-smile and seemed relieved to be sitting down. As for Wood, there are pickled walnuts less wrinkly. But none of these men got where they were on Saturday, without incredible musical machismo and supreme stagecraft. And then there is Jagger. He pranced, he strutted, he pouted, he bounced, sometimes like a glorious parody of himself, but at all times with the manic energy and enthusiasm of the teenager he hasn’t been for half a century. Gimme Shelter: Keith Richards looked tired at times but enjoyed solo moments that displayed his renowned guitar skills off to their best . Enthusiasm: Jagger sings as powerfully and charismatically as ever and struts and prances with the attitude (and figure) of a teenager . It was a genuinely remarkable . performance, made possible by a metabolism – or maybe it’s a starvation . diet – that keeps him as skinny and narrow-hipped as a boy. The celebrated lips have become the emblem of the Rolling Stones, but it could just as easily be the schoolboy hips. At . the end of a set lasting well over two hours, which began and ended . with two of their greatest crowd-pleasers, Jumpin’ Jack Flash and (I . Can’t Get No) Satisfaction, Jagger looked as if he was ready for more. Richards, . by contrast, looked as if he was ready for a warm malted drink and a . nurse. If a lifetime of drug abuse hasn’t undermined his stamina, maybe . the increasing girth finally has. The poor old boy looked paunch-drunk. Onstage at Glastonbury, Sir Bruce Forsyth, 85, teased the Rolling Stones. Imitating  Jagger’s stage gestures, the veteran star joked: ‘I’m glad the boys did well. I mean, they’re just kids.’ How . does Jagger manage it? His fellow knight McCartney has been rather . found out in recent years, the passing decades having reduced his more . melodic voice to an unconvincing waver. But Jagger shouts just as powerfully, tunefully and charismatically as he always did. His Honky Tonk Women has stood the acid tests of time and of audience appreciation. Much has been made of Jagger’s comment to John Humphrys on the Today programme earlier on Saturday, that he would have found it ‘gratifying’ to have had a career as a schoolteacher. Certainly, it is irresistible to think of all those teachers who have fantasised about being rock stars,  playing air guitar with their slide-rules, suddenly learning that, all the while, the Rolling Stones front man would have rather been wielding a board duster than a microphone. But he was surely being  disingenuous. How marvellous it must be to send away today’s teenagers, convinced they have just attended the ultimate rock concert, having once chalked up the same distinction with their parents and perhaps even grandparents. Could it be, indeed, that there is a generation of fans now in their push-chairs who will yet get to see the Rolling Stones live? Nobody who was at Glastonbury on Saturday, or who watched on television, would bet against it.","Ageing rockers drew unprecedented crowds of more than 170,000 .

"The massive wildfire still raging in the California wilderness may have been sparked by a illegal marijuana farm. During a press conference Friday, Todd McNeal, chief of Northern California's Twain Harte Fire Department, said that they now know that the fire was 'human caused' as there wasn't any lightening in the area when the fire started August 17. While they don't know what for sure started the fire, McNeal said that they 'highly suspect that it might have been some sort of illicit grove, marijuana-grow type of thing.' Scroll down for video . Origins: Experts say that the Rim Fire in Northern California may have been started at an illegal marijuana farm . The place where the fire started was practically unreachable by foot. The only way to access the area was by plane or a challenging hike. The fire is still under investigation by the U.S. Forest Service. A spokesman said there has been progress in the case, but is not sharing further details at this time. As of Friday, firefighters announced that they had contained 35 per cent of the blaze, and plan to have it fully under control by September 20. The fire started in a remote area of the Stanislaus National Forest near Jawbone Ridge on August 17. Toxic: The smoke from the blaze has spread east across the U.S. and traces have been found as far away as Europe . Battle: As of Friday the fire is still only 35 per cent contained. Firefighters hope to get it fully contained by September 20 . At one point the fire grew to the size of Chicago, and smoke from the flames have spread thousands of miles away to Canada and the Great Lakes with traces of the smoke showing up in Europe as well. The fire has destroyed an estimated 213,414 acres which makes it the fifth larges wildfire in California history. It has destroyed hundreds of buildings as well as threatened giant sequoias and San Francisco's power and drinking water. Remote: The fire started in an out-of-the-way area of Stanislaus National Forest, reachable only by plane or a long hike . Historic proportions: So far the blaze has destroyed more than 200 thousand acres, making it the fifth largest wildfire in California history . Ongoing investigation: The fire is still under investigation by the U.S. Forest Service . This wouldn't be the first wildfire started by an illegal grow operation. In 2009, a campfire at an illegal farm run by a Mexican drug cartel near Santa Barbara started a fire that burned 90,000 acres in the Los Padres National Forest. After the blaze, authorities found 30,000 marijuana plants and an AK-47 near the area where the wildfire started. The Santa Barbara County sheriff announced after that wildfire that many Mexican drug cartels were moving their grow operations across the border into California since the tightening of security at the U.S.-Mexico border. 'It's made it much more difficult for the cartels to smuggle into the country, particularly marijuana around the U.S.- Mexico border, which is large and bulky,' Sheriff Bill Brown said. 'It's easier to grow it here.' Growing problem: A photo released by the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's department shows the remains of an encampment where the 2009 La Brea wildfire originated . According to a political leader in the are where the current wildfire is raging, drug cartels have been a problem in the Stanislaus National Forest. 'We know that these illegal pot growers are in out forests and I think this fire just wiped out a whole bunch of them,' Randy Hanvelt, chairman of the Tuolumne County Board of Supervisors told the San Jose Mercury News. 'It's a problem in all the Sierra forests. When we find them, we pull out like 20,000 plants at a time,' he said. He describes the place where the fire started as 'tough' to get to. 'You don't get there by accident,' Mr Hanvelt said.","Firefighter chief Todd McNeal said Friday that they 'highly suspect' the fire originated from an illicit marijuana grove .

"A gang of thugs kidnapped a 14-year-old and told his parents they would chop his head off if they didn’t pay a £40,000 ransom, a court heard. Abdal Miah, 29, Liban Mohammed, 20, Anjam Shaffique, 30, and Carlos Treazure, 27, are on trial accused of snatching the unnamed youngster off the street. The terrified teen was allegedly taken outside an off-licence in Sheffield, South Yorks., dragged into a car, and driven to a rural village - where he was eventually released eight hours later. Snatched: The teenager was allegedly kidnapped on this Sheffield street . Sheffield Crown Court heard the teenager had a hood placed over his head, and was forced to make phone calls to his father and mother relaying his abductors’ ransom demands. Alistair MacDonald QC, prosecuting, said the youngster was talking to friends outside Bir’s Beers on Staniforth Road, when he was snatched at around 4pm on October 31 last year. He said a man approached him and asked whether he was responsible for smashing up his Vauxhall Astra car. 'The man gripped the boy’s wrist and tried to drag him away,' Mr MacDonald said. Jurors heard that another kidnapper arrived when the boy resisted, and they both dragged him behind the off-licence and threw him into the back of a waiting car. 'His head was held down and a hood was placed over his head,' Mr MacDonald said, adding four men were in the car. He said the teenager’s father rang his son’s phone and one of the kidnappers answered. They said they wanted 40 ‘bags’ - slang for thousands of pounds - or ‘his son was coming back in pieces’. Released: The kidnapped boy was released near the village of Ringinglow (pictured) When the boy’s parents failed to raise the money, the amount was dropped to 2,000 pounds, jurors heard. 'There was even a threat to chop the boy’s head off,' Mr MacDonald said. The schoolboy was released at around midnight, and ran to a farmhouse in Ringinglow, where resident Angela Batty helped him to call the police. Mr MacDonald said the alleged kidnappers were snared using DNA evidence and telephone call data. 'Only the kidnappers know why they released him,' he said. The four deny kidnapping and blackmail. The trial continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Abdal Miah, 29, Liban Mohammed, 20, Anjam Shaffique, 30, and Carlos Treazure, 27, 'hooded boy and drove off'

""Please hold for the President of the United States,""' he told reporters today, after qualifying for the 100-meter butterfly semi-final. 'I was like, ""wow.""'

"There has been a five-fold increase in the number of centenarians during the last three decades, figures show. In 1981, there were just 2,420 people aged 100 or over living in England and Wales.

The property company owned by the Duke of Westminster has sold off £240million of luxury homes in central London amid fears the capital's house price bubble may be about the burst. Grosvenor Group said it was cutting its exposure to high-end residential properties after growing concerned that the rate of growth in the London luxury house price market was unsustainable. The company - which is controlled by Gerard Grosvenor, one of Britain's richest men - says it is branching out from its traditional Mayfair and Belgravia turf, and targeting more affordable rental homes south of the river in Bermondsey. 'I'm more concerned about it [high-end residential pricing] than I was last year,' said Grosvenor Group's Chief . Executive Mark Preston, who previously called the rate of growth in . London luxury house prices unsustainable. 'It's . very much a deliberate initiative on our part to capitalise on prices . that we think are high,' he added yesterday as the private company . released its annual report. Grosvenor said it sold off £240million worth of central London homes, including row of mid-19th century terraces in Belgravia for £115million. The sales helped Grosvenor Group British and Irish arms triple their profit . The company now intends to reinvest the money in rental homes in more affordable neighbourhoods. Preston said Grosvenor Group is looking at securing up to three schemes, having already spent £70million on a site in the Bermondsey last year, where it intends to let homes. 'Housing for rent is something that we're beginning to turn our minds to more than we've done in the past,' he said. 'We're recognising that London desperately needs more in that mid-market area where people are literally priced out,' he said.

"This is the moment an explorer who adopted a stray dog that befriended him during a  race through the Ecuadorian jungle introduced his young daughter to the loyal animal who has captured the imagination of the world. Mikael Lindnor was leading his four-strong team of long-distance trekkers through the final two stages of the 430-mile Adventure Racing World Championship when they noticed a tired-looking hound skulking around them. Feeling sorry for the mournful stray, Mikael gave him a meatball in an act of kindness that would create an unbreakable bond between the two for the rest of the gruelling race. From that moment on, the dog refused to leave Mikael's side, swimming alongside the team while they kayaked down rivers, dragging himself up hills  and pulling through knee-deep mud. Scroll down for video . Hey there:  Ecuadorian stray dog Arthur is seen with Mikael Lindnord and his daughter Philippa on arrival at Arlanda Airport in Stockholm . Mikael Lindnord's wife Helena pats Arthur, whose incredible journey has seen him conquer an endurance challenge and switch continents . 'She was just saying “doggy, doggy, doggy” and seemed very interested,' Mikael said. 'I think she was a bit afraid to pat him, but that will work out nicely when he comes to our house. He is a sweet dog' The fifth member: Team Peak Performance walk with stray dog Arthur during a stage of the 430-mile Adventure Racing World Championship. He followed the group of four during the grueling race . Adorable: Soon the family will be reunited when Arthur's lengthy period of quarantine is finally over . Mikael said: 'We have kept those wounds a little bit secret so nothing would jeopardise his chances of coming home with me. But after his visit to the vet in Quito, everything went really well. The vet gave him medicine and sewed all the wounds together' They were so impressed with his loyalty and stamina that they named him Arthur and made him an honorary member of their Peak Performance Adventure Racing team. By the end, Mikael and Arthur were best of friends and Mikael decided to adopt the dog and take him home. When they finally completed the race after six days trekking through the jungle together, Mikael and his team decided to take Arthur to a vet while still in South America to have him checked out. During that time Mikael thought to himself that after their experience, they could not leave Arthur, so he decided to adopt him and take him back to Sweden. He applied to the Jordbruksverket (the Swedish Board of Agriculture) and was made to wait to see if his application was successful. After a tense few days, the team arrived at the airport with Arthur and boarded the plane with him back home. However, because of the lengthy quarantine rules in Europe, Arthur must now wait in an animal isolation centre while vets ensure he is carrying no diseases. Not only will Arthur have plenty of outdoor space in which to gambol, but he will also have access to a dog dentist, Mikael said. He added that his young daughter Philippa can't wait to welcome him to his new home. 'She was just saying “doggy, doggy, doggy” and seemed very interested,' Mikael added. 'I think she was a bit afraid to pat him, but that will work out nicely when he comes to our house. He is a sweet dog.' Mikael today told how he had no idea quite how sick Arthur was when they first met. All terrains: Despite numerous attempts by the team to get rid of the dog, primarily for his own safety, he refused to go. It meant when he got stuck in the knee-deep mud they helped get him out and when he was exhausted, they stopped to take a break . Best of friends: Mikael Lindnord first noticed the scruffy dog when he was sitting down to eat canned meatballs. He fed Arthur one thinking nothing on it, but ended up creating a bond with the dog . 'He was in really bad shape when we took him in,' he told MailOnline. 'He had big and quite deep bleeding wounds on his back with parasites crawling around inside of them. The vet told me that Arthur probably had sustained those wounds around three to six months ago and has been carrying them ever since. 'We have kept those wounds a little bit secret so nothing would jeopardise his chances of coming home with me. But after his visit to the vet in Quito, everything went really well. The vet gave him medicine and sewed all the wounds together, so he was up and running in no time.' 'It makes me very sad of course (to have had to say goodbye to Arthur at the airport),' Mikael went on. 'But we knew that these were the conditions when we decided to bring him here. Jordbruksverket were very clear about the rules and I knew that was not something I could circumvent.' Asked how Arthur will handle the colder climes of Sweden, Mikael said: 'There is snow on the mountain tops of Ecuador, so I think he is quite used to that sort of weather. But he will live inside our house when he gets out of the quarantine. He will have a warm and cozy environment at home.' Adventure Racing is a form of extreme sport that combines continuous hiking, trekking, mountain biking and kayaking over a successive number of days. The world championships held in Ecuador covered three diverse geographical regions - the Andes, the Pacific and the Amazon rainforest. Mikael told Swedish news site Aftonbladet: 'I had just opened a food pack when I saw a scruffy miserable dog in the corner of my eye. For more from Team Peak Performance click here . Determined: Before one of the segments of the race - a 36 mile kayak around the coast - organizers warned the team that taking Arthur along posed a risk to his and their safety. But Arthur swam alongside the boat and ended up being pulled in by Mikael . Grueling: The race takes teams of four around ten days, and involves continuous hiking, trekking, mountain biking and kayaking . Resting: When the team slept Arthur would also curl up and take a nap alongside them . 'I thought he was hungry and gave him a meatball. Then I thought no more of it. He added: 'At one stage we had to take a break and the dog was totally wrecked. We opened two cans of food and let him eat, because he could find no food at all in the jungle.' Before one of the segments of the race - a 36 mile kayak around the coast - organizers warned the team that taking Arthur along posed a risk to his and their safety. They tried to set off without him, but as they left he jumped into the water beside them and started desperately paddling. Mikael, heartbroken by the site of Arthur struggling in the water, picked him up, put him in the kayak and let him stay for the rest of the journey. The gesture prompted a standing ovation and cheers from spectators watching from the banks. The ordeal to get him back to Sweden was documented on the team's Facebook page. In one post Mikael wrote: 'I almost cried in front of the computer, when receiving the decision from Jordbruksverket (Board of Agriculture) in Sweden!' 'The team is overwhelmed and happy knowing that Jordbruksverket has approved Mikaels application to bring Arthur to Sweden. A big important piece in the work to get Arhur on the plane, is done. So far so good. But, There are [sic] still one paper to go. The team are now working hard for the very last piece in this puzzel [sic].' Mikael ended by saying: 'I came to Ecuador to win the World Championship. Instead, I got a new friend.' Star power: Arthur and Mikael Lindnord's story has captured the imagination of the global media . Support: At one point the dog was not able to find any food in the jungle, so the team stopped and gave him some of their canned food . Challenge: As the team neared the finished the tasks began to take their toll on Arthur and he ended up with some injuries . Health checks: When the team finished the race, they took Arthur to Ecuador to see a vet in order to prepare him for the trip back to Sweden . Donations: Team Peak Performance set up a PayPal account while they were still in South America to garner funds for Arthur's care . Spotlight: Team member Staffan Bjorklund takes Arthur for a walk outside the clinic. Their story had already grabbed the attention of the media . Clinic staff carry the hardy animal. Hopefully he will soon be able to join his new master in Sweden . Greeting: Arthur offers out his paw to one of the vets as the team wait in the clinic for him to be checked over . Aftermath: After the procedures were complete he was forced to wear a cone on his head. It was then that Mikael decided to adopt him and take him back to his family in Sweden . Emotional: When Mikael received news that the Board of Agriculture had approved his request for Arthur to be brought back to Sweden, he said he cried while looking at the computer . Happy: Despite his injuries and the toll the final two stages of the race had taken on him, Arthur began to look healthy as he prepared to fly to Sweden and settle into his new home . Attention: The team let passengers stroke Arthur as he wondered around the airport terminal before their flight back to Sweden . Pose: Members of the team stand alongside with flight attendants and a pilot as they prepare to take Arthur home to his new family . Mikael said: 'There is snow on the mountain tops of Ecuador, so I think he is quite used to that sort of weather. But he will live inside our house when he gets out of the quarantine.

"This is the secret weapon which Hitler hoped would help destroy London during World War II. Although 5,000 V1 rockets were launched by the Germans from France and Holland to bomb London, this is a rare Kamikaze-style version. Because the aim of the rockets was so random - the . bombs dropped when they ran out of fuel - 150 of them were modified with . a small cockpit so they could be flown accurately into targets. Dangerous: This is the secret weapon which Hitler hoped would help him to defeat the Allies in World War II . Lethal: This is a rare Kamikaze-style version of the V1 rocket which included a small cockpit so it could be flown accurately. It is pictured on display at the Lashenden Air Warfare Museum in Ashford, Kent . In a high-risk move, the pilot was meant . to bail out of the rocket at the last moment but it was ultimately a . suicide mission as the airspeed would have been 550mph. None of the piloted rockets ever flew in . anger, partly due to the lack of airmen willing to volunteer with the . exception of a few Hitler fanatics. This manned version of the fearsome flying missile, that was effectively a suicidal experiment by the Germans, has been owned by a British museum for over 40 years. The piloted rocket was sent back to Germany to be restored by experts there to the condition it was in when it was found and seized by the Allies at the end of World War II. Now complete after the £40,000 project, it is being returned by road to the museum in Kent. Only six of them exist today, including . the one that has undergone restoration. The other five are in museums in . France, Holland, Canada, the US and Germany. Rare: The piloted V1 rocket is pictured on display in Farnborough in 1945. Only 150 of them were made . Progress: The piloted V1 rocket receives some maintenance work at the Lashenden Air Warfare Museum in Kent . The V1 - or Fieseler Fi103R Reichenberg - is in full working condition, although it obviously does not contain one ton of explosives in the nose as it would have in the war. The V1 rocket was the world’s first cruise missile causing massive loss of life. The flying bomb was also known as the Buzz Bomb or Doodlebug and was developed at Peenemünde Airfield by the German Luftwaffe during the Second World War. They were designed for mass bombing of London and they were fired from launch sites along the French and Dutch coasts. The very first V1 was fired at London on June 13, 1944. During their peak, more than 100 a day were lunched towards southeast England. In order to try and stop the bombs from hitting targets, the British forces used guns and fighter aircraft to intercept the bombs. The launch sites and underground V1 storage depots were also targeted during strategic bombing. In total, the bombs caused about 22,892 casualties, almost all of these were civilians. Trevor Matthews, the founder of the Lashenden Museum near Maidstone, said: 'After 1945 the Fi103R initially made up part of an enemy aircraft exhibition at Farnborough. 'But because the British viewed the V1 as a munition and not an aircraft it was given to the army’s bomb disposal unit. 'We acquired it in 1970 from the army when our museum started up and we had itcosmetically restored then. 'But we have only been able to pull it out of a hanger when the weather has been okay to display it.'In 2000 we began a fundraising project to not only pay for its complete restoration but to also build a new display building for it. 'We found specialist restorers of wartime fighter planes based in Munich and the Fi103R was shipped over there four years ago. 'Since then they have restored it to how it was displayed at Farnborough in 1945. 'All . the instruments in the cockpit were missing when we bought it but the . specialists have sourced period instruments that are in working . condition. 'It is now in full working order, although you would never get permission to fly it.' The . V1 and V2 flying rockets - or Hitler’s vengeance bombs as they were . called - killed thousands of people and carried enough explosives to . wipe out several buildings. Restoration: The piloted V1 receives some maintenance work in 1970. It had recently been sent back to Germany to be restored by experts before heading back to the UK . Suicidal: In a high-risk move, the pilot was meant to bail out of the rocket at the last moment but it was ultimately a suicide mission as the airspeed would have been 550mph . But due to their random nature, Hitler experimented with the idea of getting an airmen to steer them in the direction of a target. Mr Matthews said: 'With a pilot you could aim it at a strategic target, like Buckingham Palace, until the last moment when they were meant to bail out. 'But it was totally kamikaze. 'The Germans dropped the idea in the end, largely because airmen realised it was a suicide mission. 'Also, at the time they were being tested the Allies were over-running their launch sites in France and then Holland.' The rocket is 28ft long, has a wingspan of 22ft and is fitted with an Argus 109-014 pulse jet engine.The museum is due to take delivery of it later this week.","150 V1 rockets were fitted with cockpits so they could be steered into targets before pilots attempted to bail out .
But travelling at 550mph meant escape would almost be impossible and none were used in anger against the British people in World War Two .
Now a museum in Ashford, Kent has completed its restoration of a rare example - and although it will never be flown is considered airworthy ."
"He's a billionaire mining baron with designs on the Australian premiership, and businessman Clive Palmer showed he is willing to do anything to win the young vote - even twerking. While most would-be Prime Ministers try and assert their policies and attempt to emulate the manner of a great world leaders, eccentric Palmer United Party Mr Palmer, 59, looked more like politics' answer to Miley Cyrus during a radio interview.

Despite warning the hosts that he wouldn't be able to 'get down too low', larger than life Mr Palmer was happy to perform the dance once it was demonstrated to him by Mr Sandilands. Egged on by the hosts, Mr Palmer grinned as he hung on to the studio desk, crouched down, gyrated his hips and shook his derriere. As he returned to his feet, Mr Palmer joked: 'If you can't twerk, you can't be Prime Minister.'

Canvassing: Mr Palmer's efforts were greeted with cheers from the show's two hosts . Funny: Mr Palmer grabbed the microphone following his performance and quipped: 'If you can't twerk, you can't be Prime Minister' Would-be Prime Minister Mr Palmer is well-known for his flamboyant nature. Earlier this year, he revealed that he has contracted a Chinese firm to build an exact replica of the ill-fated Titanic, which sunk in April 1912 killing around 1,500 passengers and crew. Like the original vessel, the Titanic II will have nine decks, 840 rooms and retain its first, second and third class divisions. The 270metre-long, 40,000 tonne ship will sail its maiden voyage from Southampton to New York - the same intended route of the the original - in 2016, according to Mr Palmer.

"The widow of a Florida cardiologist is inconsolable after thieves ransacked her Fort Lauderdale home and slit the throat of her beloved dog. When 69-year-old Elaine Vasquez came home just after noon on January 21, she found her back door had been smashed open. When police arrived to investigate, they followed a trail of blood to a closet where the body of Mrs Vasquez's dog, Papi, was found hanging. Devastated: Elaine Vasquez, pictured right with Papi, was inconsolable when she heard the dog had been killed . Connection: Elaine Vasquez with her late husband, Erwin, who owned the dog . A bloodied knife was found in the hallway, and the words 'You next' had been scrawled into the grandmother's front door. When Mrs Vasquez was told that Papi had been killed she was devastated. The dog had belonged to her husband, Erwin Vasquez, who died in 2010. Family friend Sandra Lozano, who works at the free Light of the World clinic Mrs Vasquez's husband had set up, was shaken by the incident. 'What kind of people could do that?' she said to the Orlando Sentinel. 'We were all moved because we knew how much Papi meant to Elaine. He was Erwin's dog, and her connection to him.' 'She babied that dog like she babied her grandchildren,' Ms Lozano added. As well as killing one of the grandmother's dogs, thieves ransacked every room, according to a police report.

"With all of the hype around Grand Theft Auto at the moment, it's easy to forget the other huge titles just around the corner. All except one... Metal Gear Solid V. Metal Gear Solid V is composed of both Ground Zeroes and The Phantom Pain. Ground Zeroes takes place after the events of the previous Peace Walker . game - acting as a prologue to The Phantom Pain.This, in turn, takes place nine years after the Big Boss falls . into a coma. Just around the corner: Snake - voiced by 24 actor Kiefer Sutherland - plans his attack . Powered by Kojima-Productions’ Fox Engine, the game follows Big Boss . and McDonnell Miller investigating an organisation called the XOF – who are responsible . for destroying the Mother Base. Although the gameplay trailer initially looked beyond . current . generation hardware, the Fox Engine is capable of running on both Xbox . and PS3. The 2014 incarnation of Pro Evolution Soccer, for example, runs on a scaled-down version of Fox. It has been confirmed that the game will run at 60 frames-per-second on next-gen hardware, and 30 FPS on current gen. Assassin's Creed: Black Flag also follows this model. Although details are being kept under wraps, Metal Gear creator Hideo Kojima has . described The Phantom Pain as an open world game – giving the player more . choice than ever before. There is rumoured to be a base-building feature - as in Peace Walker, that can be accessed via your smartphone, while a dynamic day-night cycle helps reinforce the feeling of time passing when traversing the huge map. On the run: animation has been overhauled thanks to the power of the Fox Engine . There are new ways to travel, too, for example taking planes, helicopters and motorcycles, while missions can be undertaken in different orders, subsequently affecting the story but ultimately arriving at a similar conclusion at the end of the game. Fan-favourite David Hayter will not be featuring in the games. Speaking to the website Gamestrailers, Kojima didn't involve Hayter because he wants to create a 'completely new type of Metal Gear game'. He is replaced by 24 actor, Kiefer Sutherland. For the first time in the series, facial motion capture will be used on English-speaking stuntmen and actors. Metal Gear Solid V will also include the new version of Metal Gear Online, but this is being kept under wraps by Kojima Productions' new Los Angeles division. Either way, we can't wait.

"Anyone who played 2011’s Rayman Origins will know that it was one of the year’s stand-out games. And Legends is no different – proudly sticking to its 2D side-scrolling roots to provide the most polished Rayman experience to date. This is platform gaming at its absolute best – sprinting, swimming and swinging your way through gloriously-detailed worlds – dying often but not stopping until each level’s complete. Dynamic: It may be a side-scrolling platformer, but every little detail of each level is teeming with life . And how beautiful those intricate levels are – ranging from ocean depths to murky swamps and beyond. They all feel that they belong to Rayman's world - oozing charm and character seldom seen in other platforming games. Add to the mix a quite magical soundtrack and every level becomes as memorable as the last – especially the musical stages unlocked at the end of each world (which are best left a surprise). Murfy takes on a more active role than he did in Orgins, helping our hero by cutting ropes, moving platforms and pocking monsters in eye. Clearly designed with the Wii U GamePad in mind, it’s not quite as smooth on the Xbox 360 and PS3 – and although Murphy positions himself next to objects of interest to counter this, during harder levels it becomes incredibly challenging. But this is but a slight blip in a game where even the ingenious loading screens (where Rayman must try and collect a bonus heart) stand head and shoulders above most games of recent years. In an age of muti-layered gameplay and an obsession with graphical fidelity, Legends is proof that keeping things simple pays dividends.

"A man who fell head-first from a four-storey hotel balcony has had his skull re-built using a 3D printer. Jon Fenton, 27, was on holiday in Barcelona last summer when he slipped and plunged onto a concrete roof. Astonishingly, he survived after his face acted 'like a crumple zone', protecting his brain from serious injury. Jon Fenton (before the accident) was on holiday in Barcelona last summer with fiance Rachel when he slipped and plunged 35ft onto a concrete roof . After breaking every bone in his face and all four limbs, Mr Fenton (pictured today) was flown back to Britain for reconstructive surgery. Doctors used a 3D printer to create a model of his crushed skull - which they then used to rebuild his face . After breaking every bone in his face and all four limbs, he was flown back to Britain the following month for reconstructive surgery. Specialists at the Queens Medical Centre in Nottingham used a 3D printer to create of a model of his crushed skull. During a painstaking 14-hour operation, surgeons in the maxillofacial department broke and re-set almost every bone in his face into the correct position to repair his caved-in features. This week he returned to his home in Beechdale, Nottingham, for the first time since his fall and is now planning to marry fiancé Rachel, 23, later in the year. Mr Fenton and Miss West were staying at a £100-a-night four star hotel in . Barcelona, when he toppled over the balcony while admiring the view of . the city. Surgeons 3D printed a cast of his damaged face (left). They then used it to re-shape his face, breaking all the bones again and re-setting them into the correct position. Skull on the right shows his face as it is today . During a painstaking 14-hour operation, surgeons in the maxillofacial department broke and re-set almost every bone in his face to repair his damaged features . Mr Fenton, who works at B&Q, had been balancing on a chair to get a better view of . Barcelona. He said: 'I don't remember the . fall, but I fell over a chair. I was trying to get a good view of the . city and must have tripped over it and went over the balcony. 'All I can remember is falling four storeys - about 35ft - onto a concrete garage roof.

'From then on, my fiance filled me in on what happened. Coming back round, I had no idea. I woke a few days afterwards and my mum and dad were there and I didn't know why they were on holiday with me. ""They explained what happened. When I was in hospital it was very scary. I was on a hell of a lot of drugs and I was absolutely out of it. 'I had operations in Spain - surgery on my kneecaps, femur and my hip. I was in a bed in Barcelona for six weeks recovering before I was finally fit enough to fly back to Britain.' During a 14-hour operation at the .

Explaining the reconstruction process, his colleague Dr . Dilip Srinivasan, who oversaw the process, added: 'We make the model . and that gives us the exact view of the injury that we have. From there . we can plan things and get ready to operate. 'It was 14 hours - it's a big undertaking. We had to break nearly all the bones in his face. It's like a jigsaw. Jason . Watson, consultant maxillofacial prosthetist at the Queen's Medical . Centre, explained how the surgical team were forced to re-break all 26 . bones in Mr Fenton's face. He . said: 'The medical teams in Barcelona basically patched Jon up and made . sure he would survive but when he arrived home his face was a mess. 'His teeth were misaligned, his cheeks . were splayed so his eyes were far apart. He looked like something out of . the film Predator. Mr Fenton broke all four limbs as well as crushing his face and had surgery on his kneecaps, femur and his hip.Image on the left is a composite X-ray of his body after treatment . 'We took his CT scans and put it through some software which showed his skull in 3D. 'We were able to print this off on a 3D printer so we could examine his injuries and decide where we started.' He added that surgeons could practice operating on the 3D model before surgery which helped plan the operation. 'What the surgeons had to do first was remove all the plates in his face which had been inserted in Spain. 'Some of the bones had fused together in positions which we didn't want so we had to basically break them again.' Mr Watson explained: 'There are 26 bones in the human face and Jon had broken or smashed all of them. 'We started with straightening his teeth and bringing his top jaw forward so it met the bottom. 'This . helped improve his ability to speak, eat and swallow. His cheek bones . were then re-positioned and his eyes were brought into a straighter . line. Mr Fenton recovering in hospital after the accident with fiance Rachel. He remembers nothing about the accident other than falling forward off the balcony . Mr Fenton (pictured before the accident) said: 'The surgeons have literally given me my life back' 'His nose was a challenge because it was totally smashed in the fall. Surgeons grafted bone from his skull and rebuilt his nose from scratch. 'In all we inserted around 20 metal plates into his face which he will probably have for life.' 'It's . complex but it's about planning well. We have to break it into small . pieces and take a bit at a time. This is not an everyday thing. 'We're quite pleased, but it's about Jon and whether he is happy. There's still more work to be done. 'However we have one . of the best labs in the country and the quality of the work here is . fantastic and that makes our job so much easier. 'The biggest reward is when patients say they are happy.' Mr Fenton said: 'The surgeons have literally given me my life back. The work the staff here do is incredible. 'I will keep working with the doctors and . I will make it back to my best. I am so grateful. I know now to take . life every day and enjoy it.'

'It's given us the chance to look forward to something nice - our wedding. It's not been the best year but we're really positive now. 'Six months ago everything was looking really bad but his face operation has gone so well and he looks so much better. Before he was quite disfigured.

"In a year dominated by Xbox One and Playstation 4, it's easy to overlook what the other big developers are bringing to the next-generation table. Enter Nvidia, best known in the PC gaming community for graphics cards, and their ambitious hand-held console, SHIELD. We talked to Jason Paul, Director of Product Marketing of SHIELD at NVIDIA, about the challenges of taking on portable gaming. World at your fingertips: The SHIELD is compatible with Steam - a host site for thousands of games . 1.    What made you want to take on the handheld market? Paul: 'SHIELD was created by NVIDIA engineers who love gaming and envisioned a new way to play. We were inspired by new mobile and cloud technologies that can let us game anywhere, on any screen. We think that SHIELD can do for games what the iPod and Kindle have done for music and books, and let people consume content in a brand new way. 'We built SHIELD because we believe that gaming should be based on open platforms. Consumers can check out Android games from anywhere they want, while also being able to stream games from their PCs, untethered, from anywhere in the house. 'And building it on Android allows consumers to access their existing content library and gives them an enormous base of content to shop from.'2.    What is it about SHIELD that will make people want to buy it? Paul: 'NVIDIA SHIELD is the ultimate gaming and entertainment portable. 'For gaming, SHIELD is the best way to play Android games and gives consumers the best possible gaming experience in a mobile form factor. 'With Tegra 4, a full HD retinal quality display, booming speakers and full console-grade controls, consumers have incredible capability right at their fingertips.  Gamers can also stream PC games over their home Wi-Fi network to SHIELD, allowing them to play PC games from any room in the house. 'For entertainment, consumers can access hundreds of thousands of apps on Google Play store, including Netflix and other popular applications like your photos, movies, e-mail and Facebook.' 3.    How is SHIELD incorporated into next-gen gaming? Paul: 'SHIELD’s Tegra 4 processor brings console quality gaming to a handheld form factor, enabling a new class of immersive, graphics rich games on Android.  And with its PC streaming capability, SHIELD brings the latest, cutting edge DirectX 11 PC games to any room in the house.'4.    What are the key features it has? Paul: 'SHIELD is powered by Tegra 4 for unmatched Android gaming performance and graphics quality. It features a multi-touch full HD 720p retinal-quality display, has integrated bass-reflex speakers for great sound, features a console-grade games controller and runs on Jelly Bean, the latest version of Android. 'It also comes pre-loaded with Google Play, the standard Android OS apps and TegraZone, which allows quick access to SHIELD-optimised games, such as Riptide GP2, Sonic 4 Episode II THD and Expendable: Rearmed.' Screen savior: graphics on the SHIELD have to be seen to be believed - surpassing current-gen offerings . 5.    What is your favourite thing about SHIELD? Paul: 'Being able to play Borderlands 2 in bed with SHIELD’s PC streaming capability.  I also love using SHIELD as a portable music player around the house – the bass-reflex speakers offer near Jambox quality audio.'6.    Have you plans to update the design? Paul: 'We plan regular refreshes of SHIELD but don’t have any details to share on the next-generation at this time.'7.    How does it compare power-wise to the PS Vita and 3DS? Paul: 'SHIELD is built for extended gameplay, so expect great battery life while running 3D games, videos, and apps. It delivers 4-5 hours of gameplay for Tegra 4 optimised games and up to 10 hours of gameplay for typical Android games.' 8.    What kind of exclusives can we expect? Paul: 'With SHIELD, we decided to focus on open gaming platforms – Android and PC.  We are not trying to create closed ecosystems with exclusive content, but rather tap into large existing ecosystems and offer gamers the best way to consume content from these ecosystems.  We think this approach is better for developers and gamers alike, as they can create and consume content across multiple platforms. 'Already there are over 100 Android games on Google Play that are optimised for controllers and work great with SHIELD. Consumers can also access a number of optimised titles, such as Riptide GP2, Sonic 4 Episode II THD and Expendable: Rearmed, that take advantage of Tegra 4 performance and capabilities.' 9.    When will it come out in Europe? Paul: 'We decided to launch SHIELD in the US and Canada first. We don’t yet have a date for European availability, but do plan to bring it to international markets as soon as possible.'10.    What do you worry about with SHIELD? Is it too niche? Paul: 'Not at all – there are over 300M people playing games on Android – many of them playing graphics-intensive genres.  So there is a big market opportunity today.  But we also see SHIELD opening new opportunities. 'We think over the course of the next couple years you’ll see some major changes in how gamers consume their content. 'With the Cloud, gamers will be able to consume high quality content from anywhere they want and SHIELD is an awesome mobile device for not only native Android gaming, but also for playing streamed games.'

"Texting and using mobile devices for long periods of time could lead to a lower life expectancy, according to a new study. Chiropractic experts believe the hunching posture adopted by phone or tablet users can cause breathing problems, leading to cardiovascular issues later in life and a higher risk of death in older age. The study, by the UK United Chiropractic Association (UCA), says that poor posture could pose as big a risk to a person's health as obesity. Phone and tablet users tend to hunch over when they use their devices and could be putting strain on their hearts, leading to major health issues in later life . The new research could also suggest a link between forward leaning postures that people use while texting, going online, sending emails and playing video games, and hyperkyphosis, which is associated with pulmonary disease and cardiovascular problems. The research suggests that when someone drops their heads and rounds their shoulders while looking at a phone or tablet, it is harder for them to take a full breath because of the restriction to their muscles. In addition, the ribs cannot move properly so the heart and lungs cannot function to their full effectiveness. More often than not, people do not know they could be doing serious long term damage to their body because the short term effects are not as noticeable, the study says. The UCA says that it's only in later life that the effects can seriously affect quality of life. The hunched position in some elderly people is a condition called hyperkyphosis, which may become more prevalent in years to come . This has increased fears that younger people, who are society's biggest users of smartphones and tablets, could be knocking years off of their life expectancy. Elderly people with a slight amount of hyperkyphosis have a much higher risk of mortality when compared with those without it. This is similar to the increase in risk of death from having a body mass index greater than 30, according to the UCA's figures. UCA executive member Estelle Zauner-Maughan claimed that the forward-leaning posture has a greater negative effect than medical professionals previously thought. She said: 'We tend to drop our heads forward which rounds the shoulders and this is what we term forward-leaning posture. Definition . Hyperkyphosis . is a spinal deformity that looks like a forward-curved posture of the . head, upper back or thoracic spine - known as a hunchback. It is identified when the curvature of the spine is over 40 degrees. The worsening of the condition over time is associated with a higher risk of health problems later in life. Causes . Hyperkyphosis . can result from conditions such as osteoporosis or thinning bones, as well as  fractures of the vertebrae that result from thin bones. However, there are several suspected causes for the spinal deformity when vertebral fractures are not present. Hyperkyphosis . may result from poor habitual posture, muscle weakness, degenerative . disc disease, ligament degeneration, or hereditary factors. Effects . 'People are now definitely at an increased risk of having problems . through the top of their neck and back because of their posture, which . is causing a change in the curve of the back. 'And there is an increased . risk that they will develop this earlier on in life because of the . length of time they’ve been sitting at computers or using mobile devices.' The UCA is now recommending people get their posture checked by a chiropractor to make sure it is correct and not giving them any potential negative health effects. Putney chiropractor Edwina Waddell has noticed the forward-leaning posture becoming more of an issue in her patients due to the increase in the use of mobile devices. She said: 'It’s something I notice every day and use of mobile devices is a factor. 'So many of us have structured our lives in a way that means we use computers, mobile phones, tablets and laptops at work and in our leisure time as well. 'Posture has been an overlooked factor in our health but research is helping us to raise awareness of it and people are now beginning to realise that good posture is more than about how it makes you look; it’s important for your health on a day to day basis and it can be important in terms of your life expectancy. 'This isn’t alarmist or scaremongering; it’s what more and more research is telling us. 'And the good news is that it doesn’t have to happen because it’s something we all have a degree of control over. 'We can change our habits. For example, restrict the amount of time you spend on mobile devices. 'And bring them up to your eye level, so that you’re not looking down. 'A lot of people might not even realise anything is wrong with their posture.'","People adopt a hunching posture when they use phones or tablets .

"Forget communism – the biggest threat to America in 1962 was an alien invasion. That’s what The Bureau would have you believe, anyway. Known only to a select few, this top-secret government unit is tasked with investigating a string of mysterious extra-terrestrial attacks. Their mission is clear – survive, adapt and overcome the alien threat. Get Carter: As Agent Carter, you can use a variety of different weapons but all feel slightly light weight . You play Agent William Carter, who spearheads a team of three agents. What’s immediately noticeable is just how many elements The Bureau has borrowed from other successful games. Take the responsive, cover-based shooting that feels remarkably similar to Gears Of War. Or the ‘Battle Focus’ mode, reminiscent of the skill and command wheel in the Mass Effect games. Both work well, with the latter allowing you to select one of your agents’ abilities and target specific enemies. These range from putting up turrets to healing and providing cover. Basic commands such as ordering your team to hold position or move to specific points are done via the D-pad. Another nod to Mass Effect is evident in the way The Bureau has interwoven some of XCOM’s role-playing elements into levels. Not only can members of your team die (and when they’re dead, they’re dead), but conversations with NPCs bring up a dialogue wheel that lets you choose how to respond. You answers will then affect the story. Invasion: At its core, this is another cover-based shooter, but Mass Effect-style dialogue wheels help to shape the story. Sadly, there is no multiplayer - a move that may confuse some XCOM fans . Sadly, The Bureau feels like it's suffering from an identity crisis. The preview levels felt linear with little environmental interaction while it remains to be seen if there is enough narrative depth to stop the dynamic conversations feeling tacked on. Firing the guns – be that alien or human – lacked punch, too. Part of Gears Of War's appeal was just how connected you felt to the weapons, and how different each one felt. In The Bureau, even the most powerful-looking ray gun felt like you were wielding a waterpistol. The most shocking omission, though, comes in the lack of any sort of mutliplayer - especially as the team-based nature of The Buerau's core gameplay would lend itself to co-operative modes. Graphically, the demo build was played on a PC and uses the Unreal 3 Engine. It holds up well, and some parts – for example when alien structures burst out of a residential street – are effective. But this is an engine that has been used in hundreds of games and its wow factor has diminished. Seen this before? The Battle Focus is very similar to Mass Effect's on-the-fly battle command system . The Bureau’s narrative will determine . whether this is a worthy entry into the XCOM universe, or one that 2K . will want to sweep under the carpet and deny all knowledge of its . existence. The Bureau: XCOM Declassified is set for release on August 23.
