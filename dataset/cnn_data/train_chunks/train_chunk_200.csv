"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Tsang Tsz-Kwan may look like an average student in Hong Kong with her standard-issue blue shift dress with a Chinese collar and sensible black shoes. But her ordinary appearance and shy manner mask a steely determination to triumph over tremendous odds. She recently scored within the top 5% for nearly all her subjects in the city's college entrance examination -- despite being blind and severely hearing-impaired from a young age. She also lacks sensitivity in her fingertips, which denies her the ability to feel the raised dots of Braille characters. Rather than admit defeat, the 20 year old found an alternative way to read Braille -- with her lips. ""In Primary 1 (the equivalent of Grade 1 in the United States), I noticed that she was always leaning forward,"" said Mee-Lin Chiu, a teacher at the Ebenezer School & Home for the Visually Impaired -- the only special needs school in Hong Kong dedicated to the blind. ""She told me it was because she could read more clearly with her lips than her hands."" Tsang herself admitted: ""I know it's not a common approach and it sounds rather strange. Even I myself don't know how it came about,"" she added, calling it ""miraculous."" In actual fact, the lips, tongue, and fingertips are particularly adept at spatial discrimination â€” they can perceive two points that are only 1-3 millimeters apart, according to the classic anatomy text, Field's Anatomy, Palpation and Surface Markings. In comparison, the legs or back of the hands can only detect two points with a separation of more than 50-100 millimeters. While Tsang may not be the very first person to resort to lip-reading Braille, she appears to be a rare case. ""This is the first I have heard of someone being successful using the lips,"" said Diane Wormsely, a professor at North Carolina Central University who specializes in education for the visually impaired. Chiu also said that Tsang was the only student at Ebenezer to have used their lips -- and is the sole case she is aware of in Hong Kong. Lip-reading Braille is not without its challenges, however. ""Nobody could accept it in the beginning,"" Tsang said. ""Even now, many people find it odd ... It's caused some embarrassment when I read in public places and in front of people that I don't have a close relationship with."" It also poses practical problems, as Braille books are typically large and heavy. Nonetheless, Tsang said she is ""grateful"" to still have a way to learn about the world through the written word. Reading is one of her favorite past times -- a source of intellectual stimulation and psychological refuge. She also believes she can transcend her disabilities through hard work, determination, and the willingness to push herself outside of her comfort zone. ""Without the courage to challenge myself, there is surely no possibility of success,"" she said. At Ebenezer, her classes were comprised of only ten students, whose shared disability enabled them to easily build close friendships. All materials were prepared in Braille and teachers were specially trained to work with the blind. But in Form 1 (the equivalent of Grade 7 in the United States), Tsang decided to leave the comfort of Ebenezer and move to a regular secondary school, wanting to immerse herself in a more authentic, mainstream environment. ""I have to facilitate my adaptation to society when I finish my studies and have to enter the workplace,"" she said. Her transition to the city's Ying Wa Girls' School was not always easy. Classes were much larger and teachers did not have specialized training to work with blind students. Tsang had to send all printed materials to Ebenezer or the Hong Kong Society for the Blind for transcription into Braille. Reading and writing took her twice the amount of time it did for her peers, she said. She learned she had to be more independent and make a greater effort to express her feelings and needs with staff and students, who were welcoming but unaccustomed to dealing with a blind person. One of her teachers, Kwong Ho-Ka, said that staff learned over time when to intervene to help her. ""If she needs something, she will let us know,"" Kwong said, adding that her fiercely independent student walked around the school campus unassisted, eschewing a walking stick and elevators and taking the stairs by herself. Kwong, who clearly holds deep affection for her student, said that while Tsang was never bullied, social integration has been a gradual process. ""She has friends, but she's not part of some big group. For example, a gaggle of girls may be chatting about pop culture, but it can be difficult for her to enter the conversation. She may not recognize who is speaking in overlapping conversations and she lacks familiarity with pop culture."" Attending class with the same cohort of students over the past three years has helped a lot, Kwong said, and students have learned to make an effort to include Tsang in conversations. Tsang said that she has made close friends. ""I am grateful for their acceptance of me as a normal member of their social circle and throughout these years, they have given me a great deal of support and encouragement."" While her academic feats -- she scored 5**, the highest possible grade, for Chinese, English, and Liberal Studies, 5* for Chinese Literature and English Literature and 4 for Math â€” have won her much acclaim in Hong Kong, Tsang admits that she surprised herself. ""I was really astonished and excited when I heard that my results in some of the subjects were far from my expectations,"" she said. ""I felt my hard work this year has finally paid off."" She hopes to study translation at university starting this fall to have a ""balanced development in both Chinese and English."" ""Whenever I come across some thought-provoking and touching books, I really wish I could translate them into different languages so as to share them with more readers,"" she added. As she embarks on the new phase of her hard-won education, Tsang maintains matter-of-fact and philosophical. ""The inconveniences and limitations (my impairments) bring will follow me my whole life ...and I must have the courage to face the facts...I'm going to treasure what I still have."" ""I would like to encourage everyone to have the courage and perseverance to go through all the ups and downs in our lives because I know everyone has their own difficulties. But one thing is for sure: where there's a will, there's a way.""","Blind Hong Kong student learned to read Braille using her lips .

"Washington (CNN) -- O.J. Simpson, Casey Anthony, George Zimmerman: Sensational trials with national buzz covered gavel-to-gavel on television and on the Internet. All ended with verdicts that, to some, seemed to make a mockery of the law. But did they really? Did George Zimmerman really get away with murder as one of the jurors -- juror B-29 -- in the case suggested in an ABC interview? That same juror said she stands by the verdict, even though she clearly agonized over the outcome. 'Boycott Florida' isn't so simple, experts say . From a public opinion standpoint, the question is whether Zimmerman committed a crime for which he was acquitted. But from a legal standpoint, the question is whether the prosecution was able to prove each and every element of its case -- whether murder or manslaughter -- beyond a reasonable doubt. In the Zimmerman, Simpson and Anthony cases, the answer was no. For the prosecution working one of these high profile trials, the failure to prove the case is almost never a result of failure to try. More often than not, it's a result of missing pieces of the puzzle, and the unpredictability of taking a case to trial in the first place. Think about it. Prosecutors and defense attorneys go to war over a defendant. They chose jurors from a pool presented to them. The jurors promise to decide the case on the merits. But each and every juror brings his or her own life experience to the table. And when they start to deliberate the case, they are on their own. While we only get see to the biggest cases on TV, this drama over reasonable doubt plays out all across the country every day. And just like juror B-29 in the Zimmerman case, some of the people who decide the facts walk away with a deep sense of regret that marks them for life. That happened to me, too. I am one of those former jurors who is still haunted by a verdict. Probably my most painful experience with the justice system was when, in the mid-'90s, I was called on to help decide a case. I was chosen as foreman of a jury in a criminal trial in D.C. Superior Court. It was a horrible set of facts. Child molesting. And the outcome is still bitter to me. The child in question -- a little girl -- had been sexually assaulted. And a grown man with a long list of personal problems had been charged in the case. Part of the evidence showed the girl had contracted a venereal disease as a result of the encounter the defendant was charged with. Police: Robbers tell man, 'This is for Trayvon Martin' The defense was simple and straightforward. The defendant had gotten a checkup right around the time authorities said the girl was assaulted. And the defendant's medical report indicated that he had tested negative for the venereal disease. The defendant admitted he had been near the child. But he adamantly denied sexually assaulting her. There were no other witnesses. The trial lasted for a couple days, and I believe we deliberated almost as long. On the first vote, shortly after hearing the judges instructions and retiring to the jury room for deliberations, I was shocked to discover that only two people, myself and a woman juror, had come to the conclusion that the defendant was guilty. I was suspicious of his demeanor. I was skeptical about the medical report. I struggled, I fought. I demanded that my colleagues on the jury use their common sense. I suggested maybe he took penicillin or something. But all that was conjecture, the other jurors said. There was no evidence of treatment for the disease. We insulted each other. We yelled. But we kept coming back to that single piece of paper, the medical report that was impossible to deny. Reasonable doubt. After a truly bitter experience, and fighting for justice for that little girl and her family, I voted not guilty and so did the other ""holdout"". And the most bitter moment of all, as the jury foreman, was the reading of the verdict. I felt I had let that little girl down. I still do. I left the courthouse and sat on a stoop in front with my head in my hands. I will never forget that feeling. Reasonable doubt is a bitter pill to swallow sometimes. But it is the law.","In recent high profile cases -- Zimmerman, Anthony, O.J. -- verdict didn't always match popular sentiment .

"New Delhi (CNN) -- At least 28 people, many of them Hindu pilgrims, were killed and eight were injured when they were hit by an express train at a station in eastern India on Monday, authorities said. The people were getting off a local passenger train when the fast-moving express train plowed into them, officials said. People at the station reacted furiously, setting the express train on fire and severely beating its driver, railway officials said. The collision took place around 9:15 a.m. Monday at Dhamara station in the eastern state of Bihar, said Syed Parvez Alam, a senior local official who gave the approximate death toll. ""It's very difficult to give exact number of casualties right now as bodies are badly crushed,"" a top Bihar police official, S.K. Bharadwaj, told reporters. The deaths are another shocking example of the thousands of people who are reported killed on the tracks of India's colossal rail system each year. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh expressed ""deep sorrow and shock at the loss of lives of pilgrims,"" his office said in a statement. Officials resign after stampede at rail stations kills 36 . A Hindu holy month . Monday is an auspicious day in the holy month of Shravan, when many devotees of Shiva, the Hindu god of destruction, head to holy sites across the country. India's state-run railway authorities said the local train passengers were walking on the tracks when the express train struck them. ""This station is a station in which there were two trains that were already standing because they were supposed to stop there and a super-fast express train was made to pass through there as part of the schedule,"" Arunendra Kumar, the chairman of the Indian Railway Board, told reporters. ""The passengers got out of the train and got on to the track, and they were moving on that track at the time the train came and got run over,"" Kumar said. He said that it wasn't yet the right time ""to talk about responsibility"" and that ""the primary focus is on relief."" Train mows down three elephants in India . Driver 'brutally beaten' But Adhir Ranjan Choudhary, the Indian minister of state for railways, said that relief trains sent to the area had had to stop far away from the scene because of the violent reaction by the people there. The relief trains are waiting for police to reach the scene before they enter the area, Choudhary told reporters. Kumar said the driver of the express train was being treated for serious injuries at a hospital after being ""brutally beaten"" by the angry people at the station. In his statement, the prime minister appealed for calm ""so that the relief and rescue operations can be carried out without any hindrance."" About 15,000 people die each year simply trying to cross India's mammoth network of railway lines, a report by a safety panel said last year. People are dying, it said, because of unmanned train crossings and a lack of barricades, fences and pedestrian bridges.

"Accra, Ghana (CNN) -- The sudden death of Ghana's president, John Atta Mills, on July 24 did not come as a rude surprise. Most Ghanaians already knew his health was failing; he was losing his eyesight and voice. For the seven months that I was in Ghana (Dec 2011-July 2012), he rarely made a public appearance -- and despite official assertions to the contrary, most people did not believe he had the will nor the capacity to campaign for re-election in this year's elections in December. Thousands of mourners pay respects to their late leader . What was remarkable, however, was that within hours of his death, the Vice-President, John Mahama, had been sworn in as the new president. The smoothness of the transition was exactly how Atta Mills would have wanted it. He was a man of peace and ardent believer in the rule of law. Ghana in mourning after president dies . The smooth transfer of power not only attested to the strength and stability of Ghana's democracy but also stood in sharp contrast to the rocky and chaotic transitions that followed the deaths of presidents Felix Houphouet-Boigny of Ivory Coast in 1993; Musa Yar'Ardua of Nigeria in 2010 and Bingu wa Mutharika of Malawi in 2012. Obama hailed Ghana as 'model for democracy' Also standing in sharp contrast to the smooth political transition process is the performance of Ghana's economy. After a stellar performance the past few years, the economy has hit some road bumps. At a time when Europe has been in deep crisis, Ghana's economy galloped at a dizzying 14.5% rate of growth in 2011. In the fourth quarter, the rate was an astonishing 16%. The country achieved a single digit inflation rate of 8.6% and the lowest fiscal deficit to GDP ratio of 4.8% in decades, according to figures from the Minister of Finance. Moreover, Ghana attracted $7 billion in foreign investment -- the highest amount recorded in its history. This economic boom has been sparked by recent discovery and production of oil. However, prospects for 2012 have dimmed. The projected growth rate has been scaled back to 10%, although still impressive. An IMF team which visited the country in June described the economy as ""sick"" -- perhaps, an unintended allusion to the condition of the president. The external value of the local currency, the cedi, has dropped precipitously from 1.4 cedis to the dollar in January 2.2 cedis to the dollar in July -- a drop of 57% in terms of the local currency. That drop has made imports more expensive and pushed the rate of inflation up above 10%. There is widespread grumbling about the rising cost of living. Former Ghana president: Fight poverty with wealth creation, not charity . It may seem skeptics, who questioned the sustainability of Ghana's economic success, are being proven right. They point to Ghana's neighbor, Ivory Coast, which was once declared an ""economic miracle"" back in the late 1990s but then convulsed into civil war and economic ruination in 2005 and 2010. They ask further: Hasn't oil been a curse to such countries as Angola, Cameroon and Nigeria, among others? Is Ghana not destined to follow the same path? To some extent, the skeptics have a point but that is not the whole picture. To be sure, Ivory Coast was declared an ""economic miracle"" in the late 1980s and in 1994, the World Bank declared Ghana to be an economic success story. However, received wisdom and accumulated evidence suggest that doing well economically is not enough. Intellectual freedom (freedom of expression, of the media, etc.) and political reform (establishment of democratic pluralism) are also needed to sustain economic prosperity. Countries that resist them eventually implode, unraveling all the economic gains made. This was what happened in Ivory Coast in 2005 and also in Yugoslavia (1995), Indonesia (1998), Madagascar (2001), Tunisia (2011) and Egypt (2011). In other words, democracy is not necessary to engineer an economic success story but vital to sustain it. In Ghana's case, incomplete political liberalization and fitful intellectual reform clipped its economic success in the 1990s. However, things are much different today. The intellectual environment is much freer now. There are more than 100 private radio stations and over 20 privately-owned newspapers in Ghana. There is a vibrant and vigilant media that sparks intense intellectual debates. Call-in radio programs hold the feet of politicians to the fire and expose their shenanigans. Now and then, the country's Supreme Court rules against the government. Freedom of information bill is wending its way through Parliament, although it has been dragging its feet. Media's role in Ghanaian politics . Politically, democracy is also being entrenched. Since 2000, there have been two successful transfers of power without violence or bloodshed. And the smooth transfer of power after the president passed away is another feather in the Ghana's democracy cap. All these bode well for the sustainability of the current economic prosperity. But still, some serious hurdles lie ahead for Ghana's economic prosperity. First, the non-oil sector of the economy is performing poorly. Agriculture, which employs over 60% of the population, grew marginally at 2.8% in 2011. With food production per capita declining, the country has to rely on food imports to feed itself. The performance of the manufacturing sector has also been weak. It is hard to find a manufactured good with the label, ""Made in Ghana."" As Ghanaians often lament, ""We don't produce anything; we import everything from tooth-picks to toilet paper."" As a result, imports are surging dangerously out of control. Ghana farmers lose out in gold mining boom . The situation is eerily reminiscent of Nigeria in the 1980s when the country neglected its agriculture and manufacturing base and splurged on luxury imports. Army chiefs parked Maseratis and even Lamborghinis outside plush government villas, while their children attended expensive schools in Britain. One even had his Rolls Royce flown from Britain to Nigeria. Nigeria, which used to export food in the 1960s, now spends over $120 billion [latest figure I found] on food imports while 61% of Nigerians now live in poverty. There are other bumps as well on Ghana's road to economic prosperity. The bloated size of the government suffocates the economy. In 1997, there were 88 cabinet and regional ministers plus their deputy ministers in a country with a population of 25 million. By 2004, the number had reached 92 but now down to 84. [The U.S., with a population of 300 million, has 40 secretaries and assistant secretaries.] . Too many ministries means overlapping jurisdiction and functions and a bloated bureaucracy. Indeed, the Vice President, John Mahama, has been complaining persistently about ""excessive bureaucracy and red-tapeism in the public sector"" in the state-owned Daily Graphic. The public sector is riddled with overspending, wasteful practices and financial irregularities and profligacy. The situation has become so dire that the government consumes all it collects in revenue, leaving it with little or no savings to finance investments. For example, in 2011, total revenue stood at GHÂ¢12 billion (or $7.5 billion) but general government expenditures added up to GHÂ¢13 billion, leaving the government with negative savings. Can Africa break its 'resource curse'? However, the biggest hurdle when I was in the country was the high level of anxiety, tension and uncertainty about the December poll. In times of uncertainty, investors hold on to their wallets and the rich park their wealth outside the country. Capital flight and surging imports have evidently contributed to the sharp drop in the external value of the local currency. I left Ghana for the U.S. on July 21 and President Atta Mills passed away on July 24. Most likely, political tension in the country will abate somewhat as Ghanaians put away their differences to mourn their departed president. However, the uncertainty will resurface after the burial. While the new president, John Mahama, is respected and level-headed, he is unlikely to accomplish much before December. One wag has urged Ghanaians to vote for a ""Non-John"" in December. Since 1981, Ghana has had the following presidents: Jerry John Rawlings, John Kufuor, John Atta Mills, and now John Mahama. ""Enough JOHNS. Haba! This is the worst form of name tribalism. Time for a revolution,"" the wag exclaims. Well, Ghanaians will decide in December. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of George B.N. Ayittey.","Ghana, whose president John Atta Mills died in July, is holding elections in December .

"(CNN) -- It is a bittersweet irony that, after a four-decade career which saw Henry Cecil train thousands of racehorses, he will forever be remembered for just one -- Frankel. It is now almost impossible to mention Cecil, who passed away Tuesday at the age of 70 after a long battle with cancer, without mentioning Frankel in the same breath. Yet the master trainer had already done more than enough to stake his claim to being one of the greatest trainers ever to grace the turf before the bay colt with the four white feet arrived at his Newmarket yard in 2010. Cecil was born in 1943 into an aristocratic family. He used to claim, with typical self-deprecation, that he was the first person from his prep school to ever fail the Eton entrance exam. He obtained his training license in 1969 and rapidly began chalking up a string of notable successes. In 1973 he tasted his first Classic success, with Cloonagh in the Irish 1,000 Guineas. Two years later he captured his first English Classic with Bolkonski in the 2,000 Guineas -- a race he later also won with Frankel. He won the first of his four Epsom Derbys with Slip Anchor in 1985, the year he also won the ""Fillies' Triple Crown"" with Oh So Sharp. But the 10-time champion trainer experienced a dramatic fall from grace in the early years of the 21st century. His colorful personal life had taken him from stalwart of the racing pages to the front page of the British tabloid News of the World. At the same time, his relationship with Sheikh Mohammed, one of his principle owners, broke down, resulting in the removal of 40 of the Dubai ruler's horses from Cecil's care. The arrival of Frankel into his yard in the twilight of his career marked a return to prominence after a period in the wilderness in which Cecil later admitted he considered retirement. He became a ""Sir"" after being knighted by Britain's Queen Elizabeth in 2011 for his services to racing. ""He was one of the finest trainers of racehorses that the sport has ever witnessed,"" Professional Jockeys' Association joint president Steve Drowne said. ""His influence over generations of jockeys is renowned and those who rode for him benefited hugely from his knowledge and experience. He will be much missed by all of us."" Frankel, the son of champion sire Galileo, went on to win 14 races in an undefeated three-year career and is regarded by many as the greatest racehorse ever produced. Cecil is widely credited with managing Frankel's career with delicacy and intelligence, allowing the colt to fulfill his potential. In 2006 it had been revealed that Cecil was undergoing treatment for stomach cancer. By 2012, his condition appeared to have worsened and, blighted by ill-health, he missed a number of important races, including Frankel's successful defense of the Group 1 Sussex Stakes at Goodwood. But he was determined to be present at the Juddmonte International Stakes at York, which is where the iconic image of the trainer, braced against the elements in his trilby as he raged against the dying of the light, became imprinted on the racing public's consciousness. As a stunned crowed watched Frankel demolish his rivals on his first outing over a mile and a quarter, a frail and visibly withered Cecil, never one for great displays of emotion, permitted himself a smile. Asked how Frankel's win had made him feel, barely audible, he whispered: ""Young again."" Frankel was, of course, named after legendary American trainer Bobby Frankel, who succumbed to his own battle with cancer in 2009. Frankel is now enjoying a career a stud, with the first of his progeny due to set foot on the racetrack in 2016. It would a fitting tribute to the genius behind Frankel's remarkable career if one of those sons or daughters were to bear the name Cecil.","British horse trainer Henry Cecil dies aged 70 .

"London (CNN) -- France's Marion Bartoli has claimed the women's singles title at Wimbledon with a crushing 6-1 6-4 victory over Sabine Lisicki. The 28-year-old, a losing finalist against Venus Williams in 2007, swept aside her German opponent in one hour 21 minutes to claim her first Grand Slam title. Bartoli becomes only the second French woman to win Wimbledon in the open era, following in the footsteps of Amelie Mauresmo who won in 2006. ""I'm so happy I am holding the trophy. It has been my dream since I was six years old. I would like to thank everyone in the crowd who supported me today,"" Bartoli said. For Lisicki, the vanquisher of Serena Williams in the fourth round and Agnieszka Radwanska in the semis, the disappointment was almost too much to bear. ""Marion has been in that situation before and she handed it perfectly. She deserves it. I hope I get the chance one more time as well."" Lisicki said fighting back tears. Both women started the match nervously losing their opening service games, but it was Bartoli whose game suddenly gelled while Lisicki, appearing in her first Grand Slam title, wilted under the pressure on a sweltering Center Court. With her game in top gear, Bartoli took the first set in just 29 minutes. A more composed Lisicki returned from a bathroom break and held her opening service game of the second set, before Bartoli reeled off five games in succession. Lisicki, who stunned Serena Williams in the fourth round, fought to the end holding serve in the seventh game and breaking Bartoli as she served for the match in the next. Another hold from the German made the score 5-4, but at the second time of asking Bartoli made no mistake, serving out the match to love and finishing with an ace.","Marion Bartoli wins first Grand Slam title at Wimbledon beating Sabine Lisicki in straight sets .

"(CNN) -- Serena Williams refused to get drawn into a pre-Wimbledon war of words with Maria Sharapova Sunday -- claiming she had apologized to her Russian rival for comments made about her personal life. Sharapova used her press conference Saturday to lambast Williams over an article which appeared in Rolling Stone magazine. It included a veiled reference to Sharapova's relationship with Bulgarian player Grigor Dimitrov and also contained a controversial passage about the rape of a 16-year-old girl by two high school American football players in Ohio. ""If she wants to talk about something personal, maybe she should talk about her relationship and her boyfriend that was married and is getting a divorce and has kids,"" Sharapova told reporters. The 31-year-old American is romantically linked with her French coach Patrick Mouratoglou. Sharapova also questioned the wisdom of the World No.1's comments on the rape, for which Williams was later forced to apologize, saying she found them ""sad."". But Williams, who opens her Wimbledon title defense against Luxembourg's Mandy Minella Tuesday, said she had reached out an olive branch to Sharapova at the WTA players' party in London last week. ""I feel like Maria, unfortunately, was inadvertently brought into a situation she should have never been brought into,"" Serena said. ""I personally talked to Maria at the player party. I said; 'Look, I want to personally apologize to you if you are offended by being brought into my situation. I want to take this moment to just pour myself, be open, say I'm very sorry for this whole situation'."" Despite a grilling from the media, Williams refused to get drawn into a row over Sharapova's stinging attack, while repeatedly apologizing for the Rolling Stone article. ""It definitely hasn't been easy. And I feel like I really wanted to say, I apologize for everything that was said in that article,"" she said. She also conceded the controversy may be a distraction as she bids for a sixth Wimbledon title and 17th grand slam crown. Her 16th came when she beat Sharapova for the 13th straight time in beating the defending champion at the French Open.","Serena Williams reacts to Maria Sharapova's stinging attack .

"Johannesburg, South Africa (CNN) -- He has not formally appeared in public for years, and recently he's been battling illness inside a Pretoria hospital. But former South African president Nelson Mandela is still a beloved icon across the world, an international symbol of courage, strength and hope. The 95-year-old Nobel laureate is also one of the world's most recognizable figures. More than just a man, he has become a global brand -- one that's estimated to be worth millions of dollars. Ever since Mandela was released from prison, where he had endured 27 years for fighting apartheid, many South Africans have felt like they'd like to ""own"" a little piece of him. As a result, the smiling image of Madiba, as Mandela is affectionately referred to by South Africans, has been emblazoned on all sorts of memorabilia, items that are usually not associated with his legacy -- everything from t-shirts and place mats to banknotes and even salt and pepper shakers. Read this: Mandela posters mark 95th birthday . Some members of Mandela's own family have also been accused of cashing in on the anti-apartheid icon's legacy, using the world-renowned name for business ventures such as a collection of wines, called the ""House of Mandela,"" or a clothing range branded with his prison number or an image of his hand. More recently, two of his granddaughters -- Zaziwe Dlamini-Manaway and Swati Dlamini --starred in their own reality TV series, ""Being Mandela,"" in which the family showed some of the Mandela-branded products. In answer to critics accusing them of tarnishing the Mandela name, his granddaughters say it's their name too, and that they are treating it with respect and integrity. ""You can't tell people how not to celebrate their father, or grandfather, or great grandfather, because they are using their own name,"" says Sello Hatang, head of the Nelson Mandela Center of Memory, which Mandela founded to continue his work after he retired. ""It would be arrogant ... to say you can't use your name so it's ensuring that we stick to what we believe is the legacy,"" he continues. Speaking to CNN earlier this year, Mandela's daughter Maki, who is behind the wine brand, said that using the family name is important because it promotes South Africa, as well as a good product. She added that her father had told her: ""If you use the name either for commercial or charitable or political (purposes), use it with a lot of integrity and responsibility."" In photos: Global tributes to Nelson Mandela . But how can Mandela's legacy and values be balanced with the commercial potential of his image? Hatang says that when Mandela's name was used by Viagra without permission, there was a public backlash. ""When Madiba was turning 90, they put up their own ad saying, 'Madiba turns 90, Viagra turns 10,'"" explains Hatang. ""And it was members of the public who objected, so it tells you that the legacy of Mandela is not just being preserved by us but it's being preserved and protected by many others."" Watch this: Turning Mandela's life into a blockbuster . While it's still unclear exactly who will control the ""Mandela Brand"" in the years to come, the way Madiba's legacy and image endures seems to depend on all those who have a stake in it -- from his family and his party, the African National Congress, to the people of South Africa. Those who know him say he is comfortable with that, never prescribing how he should be honored. ""We tend to not want to recognize Madiba as a brand,"" says Hatang. ""He represents something in humanity that we should all have. It's that thing that's special in each one of us, where we need to reach deep to find it,"" he adds.","Nelson Mandela is recognized as a global ""brand""

"(CNN) -- Imagine an icy cold day, Arizona. A chilly breeze, southwest California. Snow drifting slowly from low slate clouds, Las Vegas. Now, keep those images close at hand. You're going to need something to help keep you cool as Mother Earth pours a big bucket of brutal heat on your head. ""I'm not worried as much about the people who have lived here a while,"" said Sgt. Troy Stirling, spokesman for the Lake Havasu police in that Arizona city along the California border. ""It's more the tourists coming into the area, even from Southern California, who aren't used to this kind of heat."" Civic and emergency officials throughout the Southwest say that if there was ever a time to worry, this would be it. The reason isn't just the oppressive heat that plagued the region: It's the fact it is expected to hang around, and possibly even get worse, over the next few days. Many of the excessive heat warnings issued by the National Weather Service extend through Tuesday night, with advisories from northern California, including Sacramento, all the way to southern Arizona. Forecasters say temperatures through the weekend could rival a 2005 heat wave that killed 17 people in the Las Vegas area. The culprit is a high pressure dome that's blocking cooler air coming down from the Pacific Northwest, CNN meteorologist Indra Petersons explains. That system won't begin to break up until early next week, she said. As a result, Phoenix residents should see a high of 118 degrees on Saturday. That's the temperature the National Weather Service expects the thermostat will reach in Las Vegas both on Sunday and Monday. It should max out at 115 in the coming days in Palm Springs, California. It's not like sunset will provide much respite, as temperatures may not drop below 90 degrees in many places, even in the middle of the night. Yet all those conditions are practically wintry compared to what's expected in Death Valley, where temps could climb to 129 degrees. The high temps come just a couple weeks before the 100th anniversary of what the National Weather Service calls the ""highest reliably recorded air temperature on Earth"" -- 134 degrees on July 10, 1913, in Death Valley's Greenland Ranch. It likely won't get that bad, but that doesn't mean it won't be dangerous. That's why Stirling said authorities in Lake Havasu City are making sure every police officer on the beat has cool water or Gatorade handy, why waters at the city's aquatic center are being chilled, and why fire stations are offering free cold water to passers-by. Precautions are also being taken in the case of a worst-case scenario -- a power outage that knocks out air conditioning that people need to get through the intense heat. But barring such a calamity, Stirling said, ""Most people know, 'We're going to stay indoors.'"" Of course, there will be those who don't do that -- perhaps because they have to be outside, or maybe because they're convinced they can beat the heat. Those fighting fires -- like a blaze that ripped through a Phoenix salvage yard Friday evening, torching vehicles, sending huge plumes of black smoke into the air and triggering several explosions -- don't have much choice to stay inside. In California, the so-called Mills Fire in San Bernardino County was still raging at 5:45 p.m. (8:45 p.m. ET) Friday, having more than doubled in size to 200 acres over the course of the day, according to California's Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. In addition to firefighters, police pitched in by going door-to-door asking people to evacuate. But the weather wasn't, and won't, be much help at all: Forecasts for the area call for sunny skies and temperatures topping out at 109 degrees both days this weekend. Crissi Zito is one of those people in the heat-drenched zone who ventured outside, even if she didn't have to. Still, when she went out for a run Friday in 100-plus degree heat in Sacramento, Zito was equipped with a water bottle in her hand and the understanding in her mind that now is not the time to push your limits. ""Listen to your body,"" she told CNN affiliate KOVR. ""If your body says, 'I don't feel good, I don't feel right,' go inside, get some shade, get some water.""","NEW: Those fighting wildfires and other blazes must battle extreme heat as well .

"New Orleans (CNN) -- A titanic courtroom showdown with billions of dollars in the balance opened in New Orleans on Monday, with oil giant BP arguing it shouldn't face the government's steepest penalties for the 2010 Gulf oil spill. BP already pleaded guilty to criminal charges and agreed to a record-setting $4 billion fine for the spill. But it could face more than $20 billion in additional environmental penalties if found to have committed gross negligence in the disaster. In a packed federal courtroom Monday afternoon, BP attorney Mike Brock said blame for the disaster wasn't the oil company's alone. A string of bad decisions by Transocean, the company that owned the doomed drill rig Deepwater Horizon; well cement contractor Halliburton; and BP all led to the blowout, he said. ""We do not believe that men and women of BP behaved in willful misconduct,"" Brock said. ""It was a multiparty event."" But Halliburton attorney Don Godwin said BP ignored the contractor's recommendations about the cement job and that Transocean didn't move fast enough to contain the blowout. Transocean settled with the government last week for $1 billion in Clean Water Act penalties but could face additional additional liability in the case that started Monday. Transocean lawyer Brad Brian said that last week's settlement was not an admission of gross negligence and that last-minute changes to the well design by BP had the rig's crew ""at wits' end"" before the disaster. All three companies have been pointing fingers at each other since the April 20, 2010, blowout that sank the Deepwater Horizon, killed 11 men aboard and uncapped an undersea gusher that spewed for nearly three months. The spill's effects on the environment are still being cataloged. The plaintiffs in the civil case that opened Monday include five Gulf states, individuals, businesses and the federal government. ""Evidence will show BP placed huge financial pressure to cut costs, cut corners, and rush the job,"" attorney James P. Roy, who represents the coalition of plaintiffs, said during opening arguments on Monday. And Alabama Attorney General Luther Strange said the oil giant ""was blinded by their bottom line."" ""The spill was tragically inevitable due to BP's corporate culture,"" Strange said. ""The evidence will show that, at BP, money mattered most."" If it is found to have been ""grossly negligent"" under the Clean Water Act, it could be fined as much as $4,300 per barrel of oil spilled into the Gulf of Mexico. If it's found ""negligent,"" the company could be fined about $1,100 per barrel. Attorneys will also likely square off over how much oil gushed into the gulf, another key figure that will be used to calculate how much money BP might owe. Officials have said 4.9 million barrels -- about 205 million gallons -- of oil spilled, while BP says that number is overblown and that authorities should use a maximum figure of 3.1 million barrels of oil when calculating the fine. The trial will also determine what fines the company faces under National Resource Damage Assessment, which aims to restore environmental damage caused by the spill. Environmental groups want to see those fines -- which will put a specific price tag on damage to plants and wildlife -- total around $25 billion. With so much money at stake, each side has brought an army of lawyers to the fight. With almost 60 lawyers filling the courtroom, the judge created a seating chart for all the attorneys. Lawyers representing the federal government and other plaintiffs sat on one side, while the BP lawyers and other companies' lawyers sat across the room. Three overflow courtrooms were also packed on Monday. BP says it has already paid billions in spill-related cleanup and compensation costs and has been barred from new federal contracts. Though Halliburton and Transocean could also face penalties, much of the criticism from environmentalists before the high-profile trial has focused on BP, the undersea well's owner. ""The damage done here is real, both to the environment and to the people,"" said Brian Moore, of the National Audubon Society. ""And BP should not have the chance to get off cheaply on this."" In his statement before the trial began, BP General Counsel Rupert Bondy said the company would push for the court to consider lower penalties, arguing that BP made efforts to do the right thing and ""immediately stepped up"" and acknowledged its role in the spill. ""To date we've spent more than $23 billion in response, cleanup, and payments on claims by individuals, businesses and governments,"" he said. ""No company has done more, faster, to meet its commitment to economic and environmental restoration efforts in the wake of an industrial accident."" CNN's Vivian Kuo and Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.","NEW: The Gulf oil spill was ""a multiparty event,"" BP lawyer argues .

"BELFAST, Maine (CNN) -- As an account manager for credit card giant MBNA, Cate Colombo spent four years speaking to customers, answering questions about interest rates and waiving late fees. Cate Colombo and Kathy Elllingwood say they were told to use agressive selling tactics to push cash advances. Kathy Ellingwood did the same. She lasted only a year and a half before quitting this summer. The women worked in different departments at the sprawling customer call center in Belfast, Maine, yet they share similar stories about aggressive selling tactics they claim they were told to use to push cash advances, sometimes getting customers to max out their credit cards. ""Every customer who calls in is a mark. It's a great big con,"" said Colombo, who estimates that she alone sold almost a quarter of a billion dollars in the four years she worked for MBNA before it was bought in 2005 by Bank of America. Americans now carry $850 billion in credit card debt. Consumer groups are lobbying Congress to include better protection for credit card holders, demanding legislation to prevent what they call unjustified interest charges and deceptive practices, especially in light of the massive financial bailout now being considered. Colombo and Ellingwood said that within seconds of a customer's call, they would have his or her entire credit history on screen, and they were trained what to say to sell people money.  Ex-bank employees spill secrets » . ""I would say 90 percent of the time, people were pragmatic. They would say, 'I don't need $100,000,' and we would find a way to convince them they needed the money,"" Ellingwood recalled. She said they would look for trigger words like, ""I'm in financial difficulty"" or ""I can't make my payments."" Colombo said other triggers were, ""I have to send my son to college. My car is not running. I'm moving."" Colombo said some people even asked about getting a $50,000 cash advance -- usually at zero percent interest -- for a down payment on a house. And although that's illegal, the former employees say they were trained to get around it by saying, ""I cannot give you money to use as a down-payment on a home. However, what I can do is, I can deposit some money into your checking account, and once it's there, the funds are there, it's yours to do with what you please."" Bank of America told CNN, ""Only customers in good standing and with good payment history are able to access cash up to available credit line."" But Colombo and Ellingwood say they were told to sell hard to everyone. Once the customer agreed, they say, they would speed through intricate disclosure notices. Among the details, how a zero-percent or low interest rate could convert to as much as 28 percent if a payment was even a day late. ""You're basically looking at people who need the money most, who may not be able to afford it,"" Ellingwood said. Colombo remembers having a conversation with one man in his 90s. ""He had all this available credit, maybe $100,000. I have my manager screaming, 'Colombo, you need to sell. You need to sell. You need to sell,' "" she said. Bank of America calls its terms ""clear and transparent."" But credit card lending practices have now gotten the attention of Congress. Consumer groups support a bill to curb what they call predatory lending. The American Banking Association opposes it, saying, ""Consumers have benefited from a competitive marketplace that allows for pricing based upon risk."" Americans for Fairness in Lending, which put CNN in touch with Colombo and Ellingwood, wants deceptive credit card practices included in the financial bailout legislation that is now before Congress. Its director, Jim Campen, said, ""We haven't identified any illegal practices. What we've seen are practices that are highly unethical. It's extraordinarily common."" The two women say their conversations were monitored, and the more they sold, the bigger their salaries. ""If you didn't do it, you got yanked off the phone,"" Colombo said. She said a manager once yelled, ""You let your team down. You let the bank down. You let the stockholders down!"" Bank of America said it does not talk about individual cases but calls the allegations by the former employees ""incorrect."" Spokeswoman Betty Reiss said, ""Our call center associates are focused on serving customer financial needs and responding to questions about their accounts."" But Colombo said her performance reviews -- which she provided to CNN -- tell a slightly different story about selling tactics. In one, she is told by supervisors to be more aggressive: ""You cannot sell what you don't offer."" Another reads, ""Understand the importance of selling at the highest possible rate."" CNN asked whether the customer call center in Belfast was perhaps operating independently; both women shook their heads and described an environment in which call centers across the country would compete with one another. ""I worked four 10-hour shifts. The goal was to make $25,000 an hour, which is $250,000 a day, which is $4 million a month,"" Colombo said. Although Colombo does not know whether the practices were widely known at Bank of America headquarters in Delaware, she said this about her immediate managers: ""Everyone on that level knew what we were doing. We were being told to do what we did."" Do the women feel guilty about what they did? ""Yes, without question,"" Colombo said. ""Absolutely,"" Ellingwood added. Americans for Fairness in Lending said it wants the Senate to ensure that consumers are protected from what it describes as the deceptive practices of many of the same financial institutions likely to benefit from the $700 billion bailout. The Credit Card Bill of Rights passed the House this week. But it's opposed by the banking industry and the White House, which said it would lead to less access to credit and higher interest rates for consumers.  For its part, Bank of America would not talk about individual cases or provide a copy of the disclosures that its accounts managers read to customers over the phone. It also refused to answer questions about training procedures for account managers at call centers across the U.S. However, the spokeswoman said the bank ""has nothing to gain by extending credit to people who do not have the ability to pay back.""","Ex-workers say bank told them to sell hard to get customers to max out credit .

"(CNN) -- Babies may be born larger than normal because of a condition called gestational diabetes. That explains why baby Jasleen, born in Germany last week, weighed more than 13 pounds. Her mother had gestational diabetes, but her condition wasn't discovered until she went into labor and checked herself into University Hospital Leipzig. Gestational diabetes develops during pregnancy and resembles other forms of diabetes in that it affects how your cells use sugar (glucose). With gestational diabetes, a mother's blood sugar should return to normal soon after delivery. However, the condition puts women at risk for type 2 diabetes in the future. For every 100 pregnant women in the U.S, two to 10 will have gestational diabetes, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention says. A woman who has gestational diabetes during pregnancy and maintains a high blood-sugar level may have a baby born abnormally large, weighing 9 pounds or more, the CDC says. A baby's large size creates problems for the delivery of the child through the birth canal and may cause nerve damage in the child's shoulder during birth. ""A very large baby has an increased chance of being overweight or obese later in life,"" the CDC says. ""Being overweight or obese increases the chance of also having diabetes later in life."" Gestational diabetes results from hormonal changes that every woman has during pregnancy, according to the Cleveland Clinic. Elevated levels of certain hormones made in the placenta disrupt insulin's ability to manage glucose, a condition called insulin resistance. (The placenta is the organ connecting the baby by the umbilical cord to the uterus and sends nutrients from mother to child.) As the placenta becomes larger throughout pregnancy, it creates more hormones, which, in turn, increases the insulin resistance, the Cleveland Clinic said. The mother's pancreas is typically able to make three times the normal amount of insulin to beat this resistance, according to the Cleveland Clinic. If the pancreas can't produce the required amount of insulin, however, sugar levels will rise, and the woman will have gestational diabetes. You may be at risk for gestational diabetes if you are overweight before becoming pregnant, have a family history of diabetes, are older than 25, have previously giving birth to a baby over 9 pounds, previously gave birth to a stillborn baby, have had gestational diabetes with a previous pregnancy or have been diagnosed with pre-diabetes, the Cleveland Clinic said. Women typically find out whether they have gestational diabetes between the 24th and 28th weeks of pregnancy, according to the Cleveland Clinic. That's when insulin resistance usually begins. If you previously had gestational diabetes or if your doctor is concerned about your risk of developing it, you can be tested for the condition before the 13th week of pregnancy, according to the Cleveland Clinic. An oral glucose tolerance test is used to screen for gestational diabetes. This involves consuming 50 grams of glucose in a beverage. Your body will absorb the glucose and cause your blood sugar levels to rise within 30 to 60 minutes, according to the Cleveland Clinic. Blood samples are taken from a vein in your arm 30 minutes after consuming the sweetened drink so that your doctor can evaluate how your body processes glucose. According to the Mayo Clinic, expectant mothers can control gestational diabetes by eating healthy foods, exercising and, if required, taking medication. Treatment may include monitoring blood sugar four to five times a day, which involves drawing a drop of blood from your finger and testing it with a blood glucose meter. Your health care providers will monitor and manage your blood sugar levels during labor and delivery. Following up with blood sugar checks after the baby is born is also important. You can reduce your risk of developing type 2 diabetes later on by continuing to eat a healthy diet and getting regular exercise.

"Chicago (CNN) -- Chicago school officials said Thursday that they plan to close dozens of schools in a bid to improve education and tackle a $1 billion deficit. The move would shutter 61 school buildings, including 53 underused schools and one program. The cut represents roughly 10% of all elementary school facilities in Chicago Public Schools, the country's third-largest school district. ""Every child in every neighborhood in Chicago deserves access to a high-quality education that prepares them to succeed in life, but for too long children in certain parts of Chicago have been cheated out of the resources they need to succeed because they are in underutilized, under-resourced schools,"" said Barbara Byrd-Bennett, chief executive officer of CPS. ""As a former teacher and a principal, I've lived through school closings, and I know that this will not be easy, but I also know that in the end this will benefit our children. Like school systems across the country where enrollment has dropped, Chicago must make tough choices, and by consolidating these schools, we can focus on safely getting every child into a better performing school close to their home,"" she said. The Chicago Teachers Union opposes the closures, which it says would disproportionately affect African-American students. The union also warns the move would expose students to gang violence and turf wars, an apparent reference to neighborhood loyalties. ""This city cannot destroy that many schools at one time, and we contend that no school should be closed in the city of Chicago. These actions will not only put our students' safety and academic careers at risk but also further destabilize our neighborhoods,"" said Chicago Teachers Union President Karen Lewis. ""We do not have a utilization crisis. What we have is a credibility crisis. CPS continues to peddle half-truths, lies and misinformation in order to justify its campaign to wipe out our schools and carry out this corporate-driven school-reform nonsense,"" she said. The union went on strike last year. The city's nearly 30,000 teachers walked out on September 10, objecting to a longer school day, evaluations tied to student performance and job losses from school closings. Wins, losses and draws in Chicago school strike . With school districts across the country dealing with financial shortfalls and pressures to make reforms, the strike quickly gained national attention. It pitted the teachers union against Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who spoke in support of the school closings Thursday.

""Consolidating schools is the best way to make sure all of our city's students get the resources they need to succeed in the classroom.""

"(CNN) -- The powerful winter storm that moved across the United States this week, dropping record-breaking snow and spinning dangerous tornadoes on Christmas, isn't over yet. It dumped more snow on the Northeast on Thursday and left behind bitterly cold weather, especially in the South. While the Northeast is used to dealing with heavy snow in late December, some parts of the country haven't seen this kind of weather in decades. Canadians were preparing for the white stuff, too. ""If you are in Atlantic Canada ... you are just getting going. If you are in New York City the cold air is coming down the Hudson (River),"" CNN meteorologist Chad Myers said. ""If you are off to the east, you're still going to get snow in Maine on up into New Brunswick. And that snow could be heavy at times. We're talking about another foot in some spots."" Send us your photos and video of ice, snow, storms and sleet. Residents of Little Rock, Arkansas, awoke to a frosty 20-degree morning after Tuesday's record-breaking 9 inches of snow -- the highest Christmas snowfall in 86 years. To navigate the treacherous roads, the Arkansas National Guard deployed four-wheel-drive ambulances to help those needing medical attention in the state's hardest-hit counties. More than 134,000 customers were without power Thursday. The heavy snow and ice overwhelmed trees across Arkansas, where forests cover half the land. ""It was very quiet and still outside, except for the crashing of trees in the nearby forest as they succumbed to the weight of a quarter-inch of ice and 10 inches of snow,"" said Lanny Sutton, who lives in Cabot, outside Little Rock. ""The snow is beginning to melt. It's coming off the trees now. We have three trees in the yard with at least two or three limbs broken off each one."" Since it swept across the country this week, the storm has killed 10 people, including two children in Arkansas and an 81-year-old Alabama man. He died Thursday of injuries he suffered when a tree fell on his house in Georgiana on Christmas, an official with the Alabama Emergency Management Agency said. A 42-year-old man and a 26-year-old woman in Evansville, Indiana, died Wednesday after wrecking the scooter they were on and being hit by a truck, Police Sgt. Karen Kajmowicz said. In Pennsylvania, a motorist who stepped out of his car and was apparently going to the aid of a stranded drive was stuck and killed by another vehicle on Interstate 78 in Lehigh County, authorities said. As the storm moves across the Northeast, it will deliver plenty of snow in northern New England through Friday, including upstate New York, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine. As much as 2 feet of snow is possible in central Maine, leading to hazardous roads, forecasters said. In addition, ""Strong winds will cause blowing snow to create potentially even taller snowdrifts,"" Schneider said. ""Travelers across New England need to pay close attention to changing weather conditions and low visibility."" Caleb Clark, a CNN iReporter in Brattleboro in southern Vermont, called it a 'classic snowstorm.' "" ""(It is) a nice and fluffy New England snow, not too dangerous and you could walk around without mittens,"" he said. Clark measured 6 inches of snow -- with more falling -- on top of his car just after 1 p.m. The storm left thousands of passengers stranded after flight cancellations. On Thursday, more than 700 flights were scrubbed, according to the flight-tracking website FlightAware.com. The site, which doesn't distinguish between flights canceled for weather and those called off because of mechanical reasons, said airlines canceled more than 1,700 flights Wednesday. Greyhound nixed six routes in the Northeast because of Thursday's snow. Winter storm strands travelers . Here's the damage that the winter storm has brought so far: . Traffic nightmares . The storm triggered multivehicle pileups and other traffic nightmares across in the Midwest. In Ohio, nursing student Carrie Winger saw the aftermath of a fatal wreck in Cincinnati on Wednesday, which left one woman dead. She said she shared a photo of the crash site with CNN iReport to warn other drivers to slow down. ""We saw folks driving too fast and too close repeatedly the entire trip today,"" Winger said. ""As soon as we passed this, people were speeding again. They apparently did not realize they had just passed a very immediate and very close encounter of a fatality. It could have been them."" Even drivers in the Northeast had a tough time navigating the icy conditions. Jim DeMarino said a normally four-hour drive from Pittsburgh to northern Virginia took eight hours Wednesday, the day after Christmas. DeMarino, who lives in Alexandria, Virginia, submitted photos of what he called a ""tricky drive"" along highways that were ""scattered with abandoned, crashed and disabled vehicles."" Tornadoes in Alabama, Mississippi . The same weather system that dumped heavy snow in the Midwest and Northeast spawned as many as 30 tornadoes on Christmas -- some with wind speeds over 100 mph -- across the Southeast. Several of Tuesday's powerful twisters struck Alabama. In Mobile County, David Saraceno spotted something ominous as he sped down Interstate 165 on Tuesday. He was traveling with his wife and 1-year-old daughter to visit family when he saw a tornado on the side of the road. His wife videotaped it. ""It looked like it was about two miles away from us,"" Saraceno said. ""I put the pedal to the floor to try and get out of harm's way, but it seemed to be getting closer and closer."" Panicked, Saraceno got off the interstate near the town of Chickasaw, drove in a different direction and then turned around to go home. ""We drove right back into a path of destruction,"" he said. ""It appeared that the tornado turned and came over the interstate about three minutes away from where we would have been if I did not get off the interstate. We saw a roof that must have blown off a house. Cars were pulled to the side of the road. There was a lady whose windows were shattered. It was too close for comfort."" Winter wonderland in Dallas . For others, the winter storm system brought a rare white Christmas. In Dallas, some residents had to change from short sleeves to winter coats Tuesday, as temperatures plummeted from the 60s to the low 20s in one day. ""We knew it was going to be a white Christmas in Dallas this year as per the weather advisory, but were not aware it will turn out to be so beautiful and freezing cold,"" Shail Bhatt said. It's not often that Dallas gets more snow than Chicago, but that's what happened this week. ""Sometimes we wear shorts on Christmas in Texas,"" said Chris Purcell, who told CNN there's still plenty of snow on the ground. ""We built a snowman and went (sledding) and had a snowball fight ... all the basics."" CNN's Daphne Sashin contributed to this report.","NEW: Weather responsible for 10 deaths, authorities say .

"(CNN) -- On June 17 and 18, the political world's focus will be on Northern Ireland, where the Group of Eight summit will take place. Although this is a region defined by its violent history, the summit is already proving to be one of the most complex and wide-ranging security operations Northern Ireland has ever seen. Thousands of additional police officers are being brought in from England, Wales and the Republic of Ireland to assist. During the 2005 event, which took place in Scotland and was the last G8 summit in the UK, four al Qaeda-inspired men detonated bombs on the London transport network, killing 52 people and themselves. Although any kind of incident at or around the summit venue itself remains unlikely, there is the risk of a terrorist attack timed to distract from the event. But this year, unlike the 2005 attack, the focus is on a very different kind of group. If you thought Northern Ireland's troubles were a thing of the past, you'd be forgiven. A brutal terrorist campaign over 35 years that saw almost 4,000 deaths came to an end thanks to a hard-fought political process. What that took should not be underestimated. Years of painstaking mediation and negotiation, risky moves by brave politicians on all sides and the crucial involvement of the U.S. saw hope prevail, despite the occasional setback that threatened destabilization. Communities on both sides of the social and political divide cautiously welcomed the peace process and its negotiated settlements. The ""Troubles"" seemed finally to be over. Former paramilitaries agreed to lay down their arms, and once-sworn enemies eventually learned to share power. Yet, peace in Northern Ireland is still described by many as fragile. In recent times, riots, gunfire and petrol bombs have returned to the streets. The ""flag protests,"" which defined the end of 2012 and the beginning of 2013, have again highlighted the inherent divisions in Northern Irish society. The Union flag, flown proudly over Belfast City Hall for so long, was lowered after a vote by the City Council. Some among Northern Ireland's Unionist community were outraged. Protests escalated. But it is not the rioters and flag protesters who pose the most persistent threat to this fragile peace. Another group watches from the sidelines. They are the ""dissident"" Republicans, splinter groups that have grown in size and impact since the peace process saw the end of the Provisional IRA as we once knew it. The dissidents are responsible for a growing wave of low-level bombings, shootings and threats across the region. They insist that only armed resistance can force Britain's withdrawal from Northern Ireland and lead to a united Ireland. While most people in Northern Ireland view the peace process as having brought stability, the dissidents reject it. Though tactically proficient, the dissidents lack strategic acumen. On the surface, they are united by the idea of ""Brits out,"" with aspirations to achieve a united Ireland through violence and their disdain for the Sinn Fein leadership and the peace process that it has embraced. Traditionally, dissidents have been split by local differences, ideological divergences, petty jealousies and competitive personalities. ""Dissident Republican"" came to describe a range of groups. One calls itself the Real IRA. Then there's the Continuity IRA and Ã“glaigh na hÃ‰ireann, Gaelic for Irish Volunteers. There has been talk of a merger to unite the disparate factions. In July, the ""New IRA"" was announced: a merger of the Real IRA, the Derry-based Republican Action Against Drugs and other previously non-aligned Republicans. But the Continuity IRA stayed aloof from the alliance. The new group's members and supporters may number in the few hundreds, but it seems their ranks are growing. They have killed soldiers, police officers and most recently a prison officer. They continue to target Northern Irish police stations, with weaponry of growing sophistication. They shoot suspected inner-city drug dealers north and south of the Irish border to help embed themselves in their communities while simultaneously undermining the police. These dissident factions are capable of causing sometimes extensive disruption with actual or hoax improvised explosive devices. Just last year, police in Northern Ireland recovered an armor-piercing rocket that included the plastic explosive Semtex in the city of Londonderry. We have monitored the dissidents' steady rise, logging thousands of events and documents in the process. What does it all add up to? In short, the threat posed by dissident Republican groups is evolving, and probably for the worse. Their activity has increased. Their recruitment efforts continue to expand. Many of these new recruits belong to a different generation from their forerunners. They weren't even born at the time of the 1994 Provisional IRA cease-fire, and some of the older members are senior ex-IRA members who bring much needed political acumen, as well as expertise in bomb-making, recruitment, training and targeting. Their activities span the country, north and south, with mostly urban concentrations in Belfast, Derry, Dublin and Limerick. There is increasing evidence of training and recruitment in the Irish Republic, with evidence for some logistical support appearing in England. True, they don't have the kind of support once enjoyed by the Provisional IRA. But the dissidents don't just acknowledge their lack of popular support. They embrace it. They revel in their ""noble isolation."" Terrorism analysts have come to associate this particularly dangerous kind of thinking with Islamist terrorist groups, not Irish Republicans. Yet Ireland's newest dissidents are a different breed and pose new threats. In responding to recent dissident activity, Northern Ireland's politicians have been vocal. We hear, time and again, ""Nobody wants a return to the old days,"" ""They have no mandate"" and ""They will never win."" Those same clichÃ©d responses never deterred the Provisional IRA. In defiance, and in an appeal for support, the dissidents claim the ability to bring their ""struggle to a successful conclusion through military operations."" The 100th anniversary of the Easter Rising, when the progenitors of Irish Republicanism were executed by occupying British forces, is in 2016. Just like their IRA predecessors, the dissidents draw their inspiration and legitimacy from an unyielding view of the past yet find a steady stream of eager recruits in the present. In the years leading up to 2016, it is likely that the dissidents will try to strengthen their support and perceived legitimacy through a proliferation of attacks. They will promote themselves as the true heirs of the 1916 Republicans, heirs who can finally bring about a united Ireland through one last campaign of force. The IRA itself was once just a ragtag bunch of self-appointed guardians of an age-old mission that found relevance in contemporary events. A remorseless logic in what the dissidents say reveals why they are unpredictable, dangerous and ambitious. We have become dangerously complacent about the dissident Irish Republicans. We hope we are wrong, and the G8 summit in County Fermanagh does not become a platform on which they can bring international attention to their campaign. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writers.","Writers: G8 summit in Northern Ireland presents a security nightmare as IRA rises again .

"(CNN) -- Rapper Gucci Mane made his first court appearance Wednesday on charges of aggravated assault and aggravated battery in connection with an alleged attack at an Atlanta night club, the Fulton County Sheriff's Office said. Mane, whose real name is Radric Davis, was denied bond, authorities said, and he will remain in the Fulton County Jail until April 10. The performer turned himself in to authorities Tuesday night after police issued a warrant for his arrest. Mane, 33, is accused of hitting a man over the head with a champagne bottle at Atlanta's Harlem Nights Ultra Lounge club. The man told police the incident occurred after he tried to strike up a conversation with the rapper. ""I'm in the military. I wanted to get a picture with Gucci Mane,"" he told CNN affiliate WSB-TV in Atlanta. ""I was speaking to the security guard, and Gucci Mane hit me in the head with a bottle."" According to police, the man was left with ""a deep gash"" on his head after the reported incident.

"(CNN) -- Frequent flyer programs are meant to breed passenger loyalty. The logic goes that if travelers can earn free tickets and preferential treatment by flying one airline or alliance, they will. A new study shows that this isn't always the case. A poll of 1,005 British citizens conducted by Collinson Latitude found that 40% of those signed up to airline loyalty schemes never redeem miles, which, one would imagine, slightly defeats the purpose. Given the many seeming limitations associated with them -- blackout dates, minimum spends, expiry dates -- it's not surprising. ""It's ironic that what is meant to be a key benefit for travelers becomes a key frustration quite quickly,"" says James Berry, product director for Collinson Latitude. Jay Sorensen, the president of IdeaWorksCompany, which consults airlines on how to build and improve their loyalty schemes, says he doesn't find the study surprising. ""The UK is a bit of an enigma in the market, as their three largest airlines don't encourage people to sign up to their programs,"" he says. British Airways' scheme, titled the Executive Club, is almost exclusively geared towards business travelers, he says, while neither Ryan Air nor EasyJet have designated programs. Is that seat free? Still, if a good loyalty scheme is rated on the ease of acquiring a reward seat, the British carriers aren't the only ones letting customers down. IdeaWorksCompany recently conducted research as part of the Switchfly Reward Seat Availability Survey. Throughout March, they made 7,560 queries for free seats on 25 leading airlines, and tallied the percentages that were available. Air Berlin, GOL and Southwest tied for top spot, each able to accommodate queries 100% of the time. Delta and US Airways tied for last place, with only 36.5% of requests resulting in a potential booking. Read more: Airbus rolls out new A350 XWB . The discrepancy, Sorensen says, simply comes down to the fact that some airlines think making reward seats available is good business practice, while others just don't see it as a priority. Arguably, some airlines are more interested in selling reward miles to third parties, such as banks, who can distribute the miles as rewards to their own customers. The practice is a multi-billion dollar earner for many carriers. ""They love cashing the checks from the banks, they just hate to give up those seats,"" quips Sorensen. More bang for your buck . Another major grievance for those polled by Collinson Latitude was the lack of affordability of reward seats, with 60% complaining it takes too long to earn enough miles to get anything of value. Gary Leff, the cofounder of frequent flyer community milepoint.com, and a consultant on the Freddie Awards, which recognizes airlines with the best loyalty schemes, notes that some carriers have hidden value that one might not realize from simply skimming their policy page online. Infographic: What we spend on business travel . ""Air France-KLM are particularly good,"" he says (the airline recently won four Freddie's for their Flying Blue program). ""They have frequent promotions that allow members to redeem international awards at just half the usual miles."" The best part is that Air France-KLM are partnered with Delta, meaning if a member of Delta's SkyMiles program can't find the reward seat they want at the price they want, they could always try using those miles to book with Air France. Does it make you loyal? As only 60% of those polled seem to make use of their frequent flyer program, it's understandable to question whether these schemes succeed in building allegiance to a brand. Sorensen says sadly, it's a difficult prospect to measure. ""If we had an airline that would turn their program off, we would have empirical evidence one way or another, but no one has done that, because these programs are a weapon no one wants to be without.""","Recent survey found 40% of passengers never redeem loyalty miles .
Many airlines don't see frequent flyer programs as a business priority .

"London (CNN) -- You couldn't make it up: Edward Snowden granted temporary asylum in Russia -- a country with an unrivaled history of listening in to other people's phone calls, bedroom consultations or private discussions -- as a ""whistleblower"" on the American National Security Agency's legally sanctioned and publicly acknowledged activities. What is in it for Moscow? A bit of fun of course, for one thing. The Soviet and now Russian habit has always been to answer criticisms of their conduct with the playground insult ""and you're another."" Snowden in transit through Moscow was a chance to posture as a defender of human rights in answer to Western -- for them most woundingly U.S. -- comments on the recent Russian record. There have also been Russians, concerned to work for human rights in their own country, more ready than ever to believe that the West has let them down in contesting renewed Kremlin pressure on civil society, and who have been willing to use Snowden as a symbol of their commitment to universal values. But President Putin has no sympathy for turncoats; and has no need for extra ways to signal his distaste for the United States. If he or the Russian FSB [ the Federal Security Service in Russia] had supposed that Snowden had valuable intelligence to offer they would have taken him in sooner, and they must have checked that out right away. As a contract worker reportedly determined at the outset to break his contract, Snowden would not seem to be much of an intelligence catch. He would certainly not seem to Putin to be a hero. And the Russian president tried to mitigate the possible provision of asylum for Snowden by the condition that he would not be permitted to harm Russia's US ""partners"" while under Moscow's protection. So if Snowden would not seem to Moscow to be a likely long- or even short-term intelligence asset, or even what Lenin would have described as a ""useful idiot,"" why have the Russians given him temporary asylum? It seems probable to me that he has become an embarrassment, and because they couldn't quite think of anything else to do with him. Snowden has been allowed to stay at Sheremetyevo Airport in Moscow -- or at least so it is said -- for too long simply to be handed over to U.S. officials. If he was to have been sent to face trial in the USA Snowden would naturally be questioned there as to whom he had seen in Moscow, which might or might not be embarrassing to the Russians. Besides, there is no extradition treaty between Moscow and Washington -- and Moscow would have had to explain why they had agreed that Snowden should be sent to the U.S. after all this time. Muddle is often a better explanation for the actions of any government than finely balanced policy making, and Russia is certainly no exception to that rule. Moscow's handling of the Snowden case has been hesitant, with no clear persons or institution directing affairs. Giving him temporary asylum is not a solution. It merely puts the case into a different context, while making it harder for Moscow to return him to face trial in the U.S., to send him off to another country, or to grant him permanent asylum in Russia for that matter. The Russians may hope that the American administration will tire of pressing its case, and that Snowden can be conveniently forgotten. He will not of course be allowed -- if he is given permanent leave to stay in Russia, studies his Chekhov and Dostoevsky, and accepts one of the offers of marriage that he has had -- to take an active role as a human rights activist in his adopted country. But the Kremlin will have absorbed the lesson that the present U.S. administration has been prepared over the years to turn a blind eye to Russian misbehavior for the sake of what it sees as realism in pursuing its immediate foreign policy interests. So why, Russian policy makers may think, make too much fuss over Snowden? There has been speculation of arranging a swap of Snowden for a Russian refugee in the United States. I would prefer to think that too dishonorable for the United States to contemplate. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Andrew Wood.","President Putin has no sympathy for turncoats; and has no need for ways to signal his distaste for U.S., writes Andrew Wood .

"Harare, Zimbabwe (CNN) -- Zimbabwe's prime minister, Morgan Tsvangirai, said late Friday that ""with deep regret and sadness"" he has withdrawn a court case challenging President Robert Mugabe's re-election on July 31. In two-page affidavit filed at Constitutional Court, Tsvangirai said he was not happy that the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC) had not released election material he wanted to use in the court case. ""This in my view seriously handicaps my prosecution of the petition and it has rendered in impracticable,"" said Tsvangirai, who has since 2000 made three attempts to unseat the now-89-year old Mugabe, Zimbabwe's only ruler since 1980. ZEC declared that Mugabe had defeated Tsvangirai with 61% of the vote to 34% in the July 31 polls. In the court challenge, Tsvangirai had said ZEC had rigged the election for Mugabe and his Zanu PF party, which won a two-thirds majority in parliament. ""I shall endeavor to use all democratic means to bring about the successful resolution of this issue,"" added Tsvangirai. The issue of Zimbabwe is likely to dominate the meeting of regional South Afridan Development Community leaders in Malawi this weekend. In 2008, African leaders refused to recognize an election in which Mugabe claimed victory over Tsvangirai. They forced the two to form a fragile power-sharing government that ended with the July 31 elections.","Voters went to the polls on July 31 to pick a new president .

"(CNN) -- ""Heal those people with your music, your movements within your souls."" It's a powerful piece of advice that Todd Twala, co-founder of ""Africa Umoja: Spirit of Togetherness,"" gives to her cast backstage before their opening show in Atlanta, the second city on their first tour in the United States. Africa Umoja is a celebration of the evolution of South African culture through its history of music and dance. Sharing the joy that comes with overcoming obstacles of poverty in their own lives, the cast, which includes former street children, moves its audiences with explosive energy, earth-shaking beats and endless fun. The show celebrates lives of freedom, and encourages people to move past their differences with love. Joe Theron, one of its producers, describes the show as one that ""intertwines all of the hardships South Africa faced, like apartheid, in a manner where you will never feel oppressed. It's uplifting. Even in hard times there is always laughter."" Africa Umoja was originally conceived in 1983 as an outreach program that took displaced and impoverished South African children off the streets. Twala and co-founder Thembi Nyandeni retired from dancing professionally in order to create the project. It began as a course teaching children (who later became the show's original cast) how to sing and dance in traditional ways. Through her training, Twala reminds them to persevere through hardship and ""never, ever give up on life."" Read also: Band keeps youngsters from gang life . Thabo Legae, the show's lead drummer, is just one example of Twala's encouragement. He says that his career with Umoja ""saved"" him from the potential danger that comes with street life, making him a role model for children to make something of themselves, and be grateful for their rich African history. ""Music is life to us,"" says Legae. He says playing the drums is a skill he inherited. ""I feel like my ancestors are talking to me when I play them."" With the beat of his drum, he and the cast take audiences through the evolution of their culture, highlighting multiple milestones in South African history. The show begins with the early days of the drum, with tribal dancers wearing traditional skins, leathers and furs. It continues through the oppressive chaos of apartheid in Johannesburg, as adults retreat to dancing in crowded speakeasies, filled with jazz. As times change, the cast reveals the evolution through the post-apartheid era with remnants of the rhythmic tribal sounds in the beats of contemporary urban ""Kwaito"" music. Twala says music kept people in South Africa motivated during difficult times. ""It was through music that we kept sane during the apartheid so that we could express ourselves through our bodies and our voices."" She says the beat of the drum is vital part of their culture's unity: ""The drum is our heartbeat in Africa. I can't imagine African people without a drum, its beat reminds us that our hearts beat as one."" Read this: Fight club - boxing gives teenagers hope . Having toured close to 50 countries since 2001, Africa Umoja has jumped into new territory after being sponsored by the International Arts Foundation to embark on its tour of the United States. The crowd-pleasing authenticity of each song at the Atlanta show was indicative of how almost anyone can relate to the emotions that come with their sounds. Every song was representative of the diverse ethnicities in South Africa, and featured about nine different languages. Ancestral legacy is a prominent theme in the show. Theron reflects on how the history of many cultures is often neglected and should not be forgotten. ""As the saying goes: 'If you don't know where you come from, how do you know where you're going?'"" he says. By paying homage to those who have struggled before them, Twala has shaped the theme of the show around keeping their stories alive, helping younger generations to learn about their roots and how their lives have been shaped today. She reminds her cast that their success could not be achieved without struggle. ""They should never forget that somebody sacrificed so that you can get where you are today ... Mandela went through hell and back for us. I wouldn't have this show if Mandela didn't sacrifice himself for our freedom."" There is a scene dedicated to Nelson Mandela and his work during the apartheid era. ""Long Road to Freedom"" is a song written specifically for the show, in his honor. Umoja opened its show in Atlanta on July 18 -- Nelson Mandela's 95th birthday. Even though the cast have performed for the former South African president in the past, they agree it was a ""special day"" they will never forget. Read also: Mandela's life in poster art . The standing ovations were evidence that any experience with Umoja will be unforgettable as they continue to lift spirits and share their joy with one city at a time.","Africa Umoja is an explosive musical stage show, featuring traditional song and dance .

"(CNN) -- The Obama administration calculates it's likely North Korea may test fire mobile ballistic missiles at any time, based on the most recent intelligence showing Pyongyang probably has completed launch preparations, a U.S. official said Tuesday. The administration believes a test launch could happen without North Korea issuing a standard notice to commercial aviation and maritime shipping warning them to stay away from the missile's path, according to the official, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the information. He cautioned most of the information comes from satellite imagery, so it's impossible to reach a definitive conclusion because the United States has no means to gather information on the ground. ""We hope they issue a notification, but at this point we don't expect it. We are working on the assumption they won't, "" the official said. He said the launch could be ""imminent,"" but also cautioned that the United States ""simply doesn't know."" The official, along with a Pentagon official, said that the United States has been able to keep satellites over the suspected launch area for most of the past week. The United States thinks the missiles remain at a point about halfway down the eastern coast of North Korea and are about 10 miles inland. Imagery has been impeded by some bad weather, which means there is less than perfect knowledge about what is happening on the ground. But based on what the United States has seen, the belief is that the missiles have received their liquid fuel and are ready for launch. After any launch, U.S. satellites and radars in the region would be able to calculate the trajectory of missiles within minutes and quickly conclude whether they are on a test path headed for open ocean or potentially headed for land areas such as Japan. The United States and Japan would then have to decide whether to try to shoot the missiles down, the officials said. 'Clear and direct' threat to U.S. security . Also Tuesday, the top U.S. commander in the Pacific called repeated North Korean violations of U.N. Security Council resolutions forbidding the ""building and testing"" of long-range ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons ""a clear and direct threat to U.S. national security and regional peace and stability."" ""A major conflict in Korea could have unpredictable, long term and far reaching impacts due to the central location of the Korean peninsula in Northeast Asia and the vital importance of Northeast Asian trade to the global economy,"" said Adm. Samuel J. Locklear, commander of the U.S. Pacific Command. The admiral spoke at a Senate Armed Services hearing and submitted testimony to the committee. He said he's confident that the United States would be able to help defend U.S. forces and its friends. He acknowledged the importance of China's role in reducing tensions on the Korean Peninsula. The hearing came as North Korea issued its latest dispatch of ominous rhetoric Tuesday, telling foreigners in South Korea they should take steps to protect themselves in the event of a conflict. ""Kim Jong Un's stated emphasis on economic development and promises of economic growth have so far yielded little, and are undermined by North Korean missile launches and nuclear tests that lead to further sanctions and international isolation,"" Locklear said, referring to North Korea's leader. ""North Korea's nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs, its illicit sales of conventional arms, and its ongoing proliferation activities remain a threat to regional stability and underscore the requirement for effective missile defense,"" he said. The admiral was asked whether there's ever been a time of greater tension among North Korea, South Korea and the United States since the end of the Korean War in the 1950s. ""I would agree in my recollection, I don't know a greater time,"" he said. The question of China . Asked about China and its longtime close relationship with North Korea, he said the country could play a key role in persuading the North Korean government to engage in ""restraint,"" but ""they could do more."" Senators expressed concerns, skepticism and outright criticism of China. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, called the country ""a communist dictatorship"" that fears individual freedoms. Locklear regards China as neither a friend nor a foe. He said that sometimes, China can be ""more nuanced"" than the United States, and he noted some reporting that the leadership in China has made some statements about the issue. Over the weekend, Chinese President Xi Jinping was quoted as saying that no nation ""should be allowed to throw a region and even the whole world into chaos for selfish gain."" While he didn't mention North Korea, the comments were seen as a reference to Pyongyang. ""There no benefit to the Chinese of having this type of activity occurring on their borders, no possible benefit that I can see from this. So they will, I believe, in time, work this problem to their national interest just like we do and the South Koreans do,"" Locklear said. The saber rattling is making an impact, poll says . Meanwhile, the storm of warlike words coming from Pyongyang appears to have rattled Americans, with more than four in 10 saying they see the reclusive nation as an immediate threat to the United States, a new CNN/ORC International poll shows. That's up 13 percentage points in less than a month, CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said. ""If North Korean leader Kim Jong Un wanted to get the attention of the American public, his strategy is starting to work,"" Holland said. North Korea's unnerving message advising foreigners to secure shelter or evacuate in case of hostilities came as Japan set up missile defenses in Tokyo and North Korean workers failed to turn up for work in the industrial complex jointly operated by North and South Korea. Interactive map: North Korea's missile capabilities . In the statement published by state-run media Tuesday, the North's Korea Asia-Pacific Peace Committee reiterated accusations that Washington and Seoul are seeking to provoke a war with Pyongyang. ""Once a war is ignited on the peninsula, it will be an all-out war,"" the committee said, adding that North Korea doesn't want foreigners in South Korea to ""fall victim"" to a conflict. But staff at the British Embassy in Seoul appeared unimpressed. ""We are not commenting on the specifics of every piece of rhetoric from North Korea,"" said Colin Gray, head of media affairs at the embassy. ""Our travel advice remains unchanged. At this moment, we see no immediate threat to British citizens in South Korea."" And foreign visitors in Seoul didn't appear to be panicking Tuesday. Seoul's message to tourists: Don't be afraid . ""I am concerned, but not enough not to make the trip,"" said Vicky Polashock, who was visiting from Atlanta. CNN Poll: Worries about North Korean threat at all-time high . Threat after threat . North Korea has unleashed a torrent of dramatic threats against the United States and South Korea in recent weeks, including that of a possible nuclear strike. But many analysts have cautioned that much of what Kim's regime is saying is bluster, noting that it is believed to still be years away from developing an operational nuclear missile. A more likely scenario, they say, is a localized provocative move. Amid the fiery words from Pyongyang and annual military training exercises by U.S. and South Korean forces in the region, government officials in Washington and Seoul say they are taking the North Korean threat seriously. In the days before North Korea's latest round of threats and provocations, U.S. and North Korean officials met in New York, although nothing came of the meeting, said a source familiar with what happened. The source described the meeting as part of regular back channel exchanges between the countries. Clifford Hart, the U.S. envoy for six-party talks aimed at North Korean denuclearization, met with North Korea's Deputy UN Ambassador Han Song-ryol in mid-March, according to the source. Hart repeated the Obama administration's call for North Korea to avoid provocative actions and urged a return to diplomacy. Han promised to carry the messages back to Pyongyang, the source said. The North was blamed for two attacks on South Korea in 2010, one on a navy vessel and another on the island of Yeonpyeong. Those attacks killed 50 people. Pyongyang still denies responsibility for the sinking of the South Korean warship, the Cheonan, in which 46 sailors died. Japan deploys missile defense batteries . On Tuesday, Japan said it had deployed missile defense systems around Tokyo amid expectations that the North could carry out a missile test in the coming days. The Japanese government is making ""every possible effort to protect the Japanese people and ensure their safety,"" said Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. South Korean government officials have said they think North Korea could conduct the test launch of a missile as soon as Wednesday, following reports that the North had loaded as many as two medium-range missiles onto mobile launchers on its east coast. The United States had previously said it was moving missile defense systems to Guam, a Western Pacific territory that is home to U.S. naval and air bases. North Korea has cited those bases when listing possible targets for missile attacks. How does North Korea make its money? A symbol of cooperation at risk . The souring situation on the Korean Peninsula was in evidence in the failure of more than 50,000 North Korean workers to show up for work Tuesday morning at the Kaesong Industrial Complex, the manufacturing zone shared by the two Koreas that had operated without such an interruption for eight years. The North had declared Monday that it would pull out its workers and temporarily suspend activities at the complex, which sits on its side of the heavily fortified border but houses the operations of more than 120 South Korean companies. On Tuesday, the South Korean Unification Ministry said the North Korean workers hadn't reported for work in the district, which is the last major symbol of cooperation between the two Koreas. Analysts had expressed skepticism that Pyongyang would follow through on previous threats to shut down the complex, noting that it is an important source of hard currency to Kim's regime. The move also is likely to put pressure on the city of Kaesong itself, where the North Korean workers and their families live. With an estimated population of between 200,000 and 300,000 people, it is one of the impoverished country's largest cities. Opinion: An accident, then war with North Korea? CNN's Elise Labott, K.J.

"(CNN) -- From the moment she steps onto the stage, lighting up the concert hall with her radiant smile and striking flowing dress, to the very last notes of her energy-filled show, which finds everyone at their feet, it's easy to see why Fatoumata Diawara feels right at home while performing. ""I like to be on stage,"" says the 31-year-old singer, one of the latest stars to come out of the seemingly endless reservoir of musical talent that is Mali. ""It's one of my favorite places, I love that."" Indeed, under the stage lights of Yoshi's in San Francisco, Diawara's Malian influence and personal charisma shine through. Guitar on hand, she sings effortlessly in a warm, wavering voice but she can as easily break into powerful vocal solos and high-pitched ululations; as the evening progresses, she takes the audience into a journey of rhythms and emotions. With boundless energy, she strides across the stage, her braided hair swirling around frenziedly as she dances with abandon. First passion . Even as a child, the versatile performer, who was born in the Ivory Coast to Malian parents in 1982, was very much into singing and dancing. But even though she was already a member of her father's dance troupe at a very young age, it was Diawara's talent in acting that first wowed audiences and paved her way to stardom. Read this: Malian kora legend breaks music barriers . At the age of nine, Diawara was sent to live with her actress aunt to the Malian capital Bamako. One day, while she was on the set of one of her aunt's films, the director asked the young Diawara to play a small role. The part was only a few lines, but the exposure would lead to much larger roles. In 2001, she starred as the title character in ""Sia, Le Reve Du Python,"" a highly successful film that boosted Diawara's reputation in Mali -- to this day many people in the West African country refer to her as Sia -- and also attracted interest from abroad. Fleeing marriage . In the 2001 drama, Diawara plays a young woman who flees her family to avoid being sacrificed to a god -- a role that has real life echoes for Diawara. Shortly after the release of the film, Jean-Louis Courcoult, director of famous French theater company Royal de Luxe, traveled to Mali to offer Diawara a part in a new production. But Diawara's aunt, who had guardian's rights, objected to the idea and arranged for her 19-year-old niece to be married to one of her cousins. Going against tradition, Diawara took the bold decision to flee Mali and pursue her dream. After making all the necessary preparations in secrecy, she managed to slip out of her aunt's house and catch a flight to Europe. New life, new career . Once in France, Diawara became a member of Royal de Luxe, traveling around the world for more than six years. Her new career also afforded her many other opportunities, including invitations to record songs with Malian musicians in Paris. After getting a taste of life as a musician, Diawara decided to pursue it on her own. She taught herself how to play the guitar, recorded a demo and stared performing at cafÃ©s in Paris. Read this: Guitar hero of the desert . ""I said, 'OK my voice can be a good way to express who I am; what is my story; where I come from,'"" says Diawara, who released her first album, ""Fatou,"" in 2011. In the critically-acclaimed album, she explores familiar subjects, including women's issues and arranged marriages. ""They wanted to give me to a man/but I refused as I didn't love him/I want to choose a man for myself/who I love,"" Diawara can be heard singing in ""Bissa,"" echoing her personal experience. Giving back . Once she left Mali, Diawara never looked back. That was until last year, when a crisis threatened to destroy the country's rich music heritage. In March 2012, a military coup sent the country's president into hiding. That opened the door to insurgency by Islamic militants who began to enforce their strict interpretation of Sharia law, including a ban on music. Diawara, who was still living in Paris, felt compelled to do something to ensure the great traditions of the music she loves live on. She went back to Mali and rallied 40 of the country's most popular artists, including kora maestro Toumani Diabate and legendary singer Oumou Sangare, to record a song calling for peace titled ""Mali ko."" Once back in her country, Diawara also reconnected with her family, making amends. It was also a chance for her to give back to the beloved country she fled but which still influences her music. ""I'm not a politician, I'm nobody,"" she says, ""but it is about my country; my Earth, where I'm from. My roots, my story, my family."" Back in San Francisco, Diawara takes a bow amid loud cheers as she leaves the stage following yet another energetic performance. ""I enjoy being with my audience because I know what I did to be in front of them,"" she says after the concert. ""That's why I like this moment; it's my freedom,"" she adds. ""Music is my best friend.""","Singer Fatoumata Diawara is one of the hottest music stars to come out of Mali recently .

"(CNN) -- A search of an apartment leased by former New England Patriot Aaron Hernandez recovered ammunition from the same caliber gun used to kill his friend Odin Lloyd, court documents reveal. Massachusetts State Police searched the apartment in Franklin on June 26. Authorities found new evidence, including .45-caliber ammunition and a white hooded sweatshirt, search warrants obtained by CNN reveal. The bullet that killed Lloyd was from a .45-caliber gun, and the white sweatshirt matches one Hernandez was seen wearing on surveillance video on June 17, the night Lloyd died. Who is Odin Lloyd? Hernandez has been charged with premeditated murder. He has pleaded not guilty. Several other items were also found in the apartment, including a baseball cap similar to one Hernandez was reportedly seen wearing outside of a club the Friday before Lloyd was slain. A valet ticket from the nearby W Boston hotel and several shirts with the number 81, Hernandez's jersey number, were also found. Police found out about the apartment from the suspect's acquaintance, Carlos Ortiz. He said, ""Hernandez has a second place that not many people know about,"" search warrants show. He also told police that he and Hernandez stopped at the apartment the night after Lloyd's death, according to warrants. Police then obtained a copy of the apartment lease, which was signed by Hernandez on May 1, search warrants show. The search warrants obtained by CNN are for Hernandez's apartment. The warrants for his home have not been released. Authorities have said Hernandez and two other men picked Lloyd up from his Boston apartment early on June 17. Surveillance cameras captured the car at an industrial park near Hernandez's North Attleborough home. Lloyd's body was found in the industrial park later that day, authorities have said. As Hernandez begins his second week at the Dartmouth House of Corrections, Bristol County Sheriff Tom Hodgson said Hernandez is adjusting to a lifestyle change that has taken him from deluxe accommodations and the adulation of fans to the solitude of a 7-by-10-foot jail cell. Hernandez was ""reclassified"" this week, Hodgson said, meaning the pro football player was granted additional benefits, including three hours per day outside of his cell for making phone calls, walking around in a prison common area and an hour outdoors. Patriots offer trade-in for Hernandez jerseys . The former tight end will also be able to have an account at the prison's commissary, where Hodgson says he can order soup, cookies and toiletries. Hernandez can also see visitors one day per week for a total of one hour. No one has visited him yet, Hodgson said. Hernandez, however, will still have no access to television, Internet or even a weight room. He will also be unable to marry his fiancee while in jail. ""That's for the other side of the wall,"" Hodgson said. His next court appearance is scheduled for July 24.

"(CNN) -- The premise of social discovery seems simple: Uncover the people and events around you, in real time, based on user interests and/or locations. But many worry today's social apps define privacy in very different and sometimes concerning terms. In 2012, Instagram revamped its privacy policy to much protest, and Path settled a case with the FTC over its personal information collection practices. As more of these social discovery applications emerge, two concepts remain key: user discretion and transparency. SEE ALSO: 10 Free iPhone Apps You'll Use Every Day . On the other hand, some users subsets are growing into the new social media landscape, when it comes to privacy. According to ""Teens, Social Media and Privacy,"" a report issued last month by Pew Internet, teens are sharing more information about themselves on social media sites than they have in the past, but they're also taking a variety steps to manage the privacy of that information. The report indicates that 91% have posted a photo of themselves (compared to 79% in 2006); 20% share their cellphone numbers (compared to 2% in 2006), and 16% automatically include location in their posts (very rarely an option at all in 2006). Only 9% say they are very concerned about third parties accessing their data. For one, social media user Jordan Kaneshiro of Honolulu, Hawaii is wary of all things location-based. ""It's one thing to throw a quick status on Facebook or update at the end of the day, but constant updates on where you are or where someone else is doesn't really add value to my life,"" he says. ""The only good use case is if I'm out and about and have nothing better to do. [I] find out someone I know is close, so we can hang out."" We gleaned some insight from developers behind three very different location-based discovery apps — Imo.im, Highlight and Banjo --- along with their users, to find out whether the value of sharing outweighs the apps' ""TMI"" factors. We asked how they aim to make privacy settings more transparent than in years past. Imo.im — a communication tool to call, message and create chat groups with existing friends — recently launched a new broadcasts channel, where users connect with like-minded people and groups. The app targets specific users based on their locations, interests and in-app interactions. Imo.im CEO Ralph Harik says user transparency was key in developing a trustworthy and safe resource, where users would be comfortable sharing with one another. ""Often with new technology, there is a bit of hesitation from users who don't understand how to use it, and what is and isn't okay,"" he tells Mashable. ""Since we started developing the Imo network, we've focused on creating policies that are transparent to our users, as well as building out a user support and safety team."" On Imo, users can block messages from certain people and hide their availability from people not in their contacts. They also have the option to turn broadcasts off and on. In response to users still wary about exposing too much information or sharing with people they don't know, Harik says they can access people they may not be able to otherwise. ""Broadcasts are quite a mixed bag. Because they're public and anyone can post them, it's not uncommon to see some very strange people talking about very strange things,"" ""Broadcasts are quite a mixed bag. Because they're public and anyone can post them, it's not uncommon to see some very strange people talking about very strange things,"" says Imo user Dan Hlavenka of Elmhurst, Ill. ""However, the vast majority of posts I've seen have been really cool. Usually, I'll see people sharing interesting recipes or cool new music, or debating political issues."" To reduce unwanted conversations, Imo broadcasts utilize ""communication points,"" which help users avoid unwanted attention. If a user doesn't have you in his or her contact list, it will cost you points to message them. Earn points by inputting data about yourself, linking social media accounts and inviting others to join the network. ""I'm more than happy to share plenty of details about myself,"" Hlavenka says. ""But when comes to personally identifying information, I'm a lot more wary."" Social discovery app Highlight alerts you when other users or friends are nearby. By giving you the ability to see exactly where they are via map, you also have access to their names, photos, mutual friends, social networks and interests in common. ""The premise sounds really cool: sifting through the people around you to help leverage social networks. But I find it creepy,"" says Highlight user Katherine Stewart of Richmond, Va. ""I think it would be cool in a city like New York or Chicago. In Richmond, there weren't very many users, so you would see the same people every day pop up."" While Highlight founder and CEO Paul Davison sees the app as a ""bird's eye view of the world,"" he says it is going to take awhile to figure out social norms as more products use new technology for sharing. ""Any time a new piece of technology comes out, it has never been an option before, so it might be uncomfortable at first,"" Davison says. ""But over time, the social benefits outweigh the cost of privacy ... Look what happened with Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter and Foursquare."" In turn, he says, users can manage their privacy settings by limiting their profiles to who can find you, and where, even electing ""hiding spots"" that let them go ""off the grid."" ""The service is entirely opt-in; everyone has chosen to do it,"" Davison says. Combining location and social updates, Banjo delivers publicly available posts from social networks — Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Foursquare, LinkedIn and Google+ — from any location in the world, whether from your friends and common connections, or the general public. Users can find posts from specific locations by entering a keyword, something Banjo founder and CEO Damien Patton calls a ""there"" instead of ""here"" experience. A recent app update added channels (sports, music, news, etc.), which allow people to observe live events around the world. Or if you missed it, go back in time and see everything that was posted for the event. An additional Banjo feature alerts users when friends from their social networks are nearby, an in-app commodity that, according to Patton, everyone should be doing. He wouldn't categorize Banjo in the ""social discovery"" realm, though, because it's more location-focused, something he says you can't really talk about without mentioning privacy. ""You have to give the user full control of how they adjust their privacy,"" he says. ""We check the privacy settings you have on every social network connected, so that posts are shared with the intended audience only ... Banjo never shows your location unless you want it to."" He explains that a user's location is determined by his vicinity or region, not his exact position, and that users have control and power over how much they want to share. ""As long as my location is never more accurate than the name of the city I'm in, I don't find it creepy at all,"" says Hlavenka. ""I don't particularly care that a lot of the people I talk to are relative strangers. As long as they've got something interesting to say, I'm happy to listen.""

"(CNN) -- Manchester City's million dollar summer signings were paraded in their first Premier League game of the season but it was City's old guard who earned a priceless first win for new manager Manuel Pellegrini. David Silva, Sergio Aguero, Yaya Toure and Samir Nasri all scored as Manchester City sailed past Newcastle United 4-0. The victory saw City overhaul local rivals, defending champions Manchester United, at the top of the Premier League table after the first round of matches. The result also compounded a dismal start to the new season for Newcastle -- who were reduced to 10 men -- as the defeat saw them rooted to the bottom of the table. Manchester City have splashed the case in the summer transfer window and there was close to $100m worth of new talent on display at the Etihad Stadium. Pellgrini gave full debuts to Spanish winger Jesus Navas and Brazilian Fernandinho in a revamped midfield before bringing on Spanish striker Alvaro Negredo in the second half. Negredo had a goal disallowed late on but the core of the team created by former manager Roberto Mancini had already given the new Chilean boss value for money against Newcastle. ""It's a very good start but I was very confident that the team would play well,"" Pellegrini told the media after the match. ""We worked very hard during preseason, we were trying another style of football and we must continue to improve but for the first match, it was good. ""The most pleasing aspect was the way the team played for 90 minutes, from the beginning the attitude was aggressive and we continued to play that way for the whole match."" City were unleashed at the whistle and Edin Dzeko and Pablo Zabaleta --who signed a new four year contract to stay at City earlier on Monday -- both came close to scoring. With barely six minutes on the clock, Silva headed in Dzeko's cross to see City's lively start to the match rewarded. Aguero found the bottom corner to send City into the break 2-0 up and things got worse for Newcastle when Steven Taylor was show a red card for swiping the Argentine striker with his arm. Toure glided in a free kick to stretch City's advantage and substitute Nasri pounced on a loose ball to complete the rout. The only downside for City was the exit of captain Vincent Kompany with a suspected groin injury. The result underlined City's credentials as championship contenders for their third season in a row. After the first round of Premier League matches, the two Manchester clubs top the standings ahead of Aston Villa and Chelsea. There were also wins for would be title challengers Liverpool and Tottenham while Arsenal suffered the misery of a home defeat to Villa.","Manchester City defeat Newcastle United 4-0 in first match of the new season .

"(CNN) -- A passenger who says she was injured after the nose gear of a Southwest Airlines jetliner collapsed during a landing at New York's LaGuardia Airport filed a lawsuit, according to her attorney. Jacqueline Young's ""injuries include her head, neck, back, and shoulder... she got hurt when she was sliding down the ramp and there was no one there to catch her,"" according to her lawyer, Sanford Rubenstein. According to the city's port authority, 10 people suffered minor injuries as a result of the July 22 landing. Southwest Flight 345 was landing at LaGuardia from Nashville about 5:40 p.m. when the incident occurred. The nose of the blue-and-orange Boeing 737 jet came to rest on the ground after the aircraft came to a stop, and passengers evacuated the aircraft on emergency slides. The lawsuit against Southwest Airlines, filed in Queens, New York, alleges that due to the airline's ""negligence"" Young, 48, ""sustained serious, severe and permanent injuries to her limbs and body, still suffers and will continue to suffer for some time, great physical and mental pain and serious bodily injury."" ""We are unable to comment on pending litigation,"" according to Whitney Eichinger, a representative for the airline. The National Transportation Safety Board said that video and other sources provide evidence that the nose gear contacted the tarmac before the main wheels. Under a normal landing in a big jet, the main landing gear under each wing would touch the runway first and simultaneously -- absorbing the main stress of landing -- and the nose gear then lowered gradually as the plane decelerates down the runway. ""The aircraft skidded down the runway on its nose and then veered off and came to rest in a grass area between the runway and taxiway foxtrot,"" Thomas Bosco, the airport's general manager, told reporters shortly after the crash. It stopped about halfway down the 7,000-foot runway. A total of 150 people were aboard the flight. Initially, the Federal Aviation Administration said the crew reported a possible nose gear problem before landing, but later amended that to say that after it reviewed air controller tapes, no issues were noted ahead of time. ""They are responsible for landing the plane properly ... to have the nose pointed upward so the main landing gear touches down first,"" Rubenstein told CNN Saturday. His client lives in South Carolina. CNN's Mike Ahlers, Caleb Silver and Aaron Cooper contributed to this report.","Woman sues airline over landing in New York .

"(CNN) -- Opposition protests are expected to take place in Tunisia on Tuesday following the interim prime minister's decision not to dissolve the government. Ali Larayedh on Saturday met with political party heads and leaders of the military and professional organizations. Also in attendance were representatives from several labor unions, according to TAP, Tunisia's state news agency. The meeting ""aimed to deepen dialogue around the security situation in light of the terrorist operations that hit Tunisia recently,"" according to TAP. Two opposition groups called for Tunisian citizens to ""participate massively"" in a Tuesday rally in Bardo. The rally will mark the six-month anniversary of the assassination of popular opposition leader Chokri Belaid. Belaid helped lead Tunisia's Popular Front, a coalition of a leftist political parties. He opposed the Islamist-led Nahda party, which swept into power following the revolution that toppled longtime President Zine el Abidine Ben Ali in January 2011. In recent weeks, eight Tunisian soldiers were killed in an ambush and an opposition leader was shot and killed outside his home, which set off protests. Turmoil has beset the North African country that had been seen as a poster child of stability after the 2011 Arab Spring uprisings.","Protests expected in Tunisia as interim prime minister refuses to dissolve government .

"London (CNN) -- Tension in the stadium was at fever pitch, with the world record holder Jonnie Peacock gesturing for quiet from the partisan home crowd as two more star performers in the field settled into the blocks for what was billed as a grudge match. At stake was a London Paralympics 100m gold medal featuring rival runners who had been involved in a spat in an earlier race. But it was also the moment I realized for the first time that I was watching the contest not through the prism of disability but as a genuinely exciting sporting event that had me riveted to the edge of my seat. It was the first of two revelations of the night. As a sports fan and Brit I gobbled up hours of breathtaking competition from the London Olympics but I confess I had mixed views on the Paralympics before the event started. Great for the competitors, great for the home crowd who could be confident of a high medal count, great for the profile of disabled sport -- but would we really be watching a fair contest? For the most part, that reservation has been blown away by a week of heart-warming stories of courage and determination, and of blistering, thrilling athletics, cycling, swimming and a host of other sports I have not explored before. Take blind football for example. It is an astonishing mixture of traditional football and a ballet in fast-forward. Players sprint across the pitch, skilfully tapping the football from foot to foot, while defenders follow the game by sound, listening for the bell inside the ball. You can only wonder at their close control and spatial awareness. It's thrilling stuff and such was their mastery that if you didn't know better, you would swear the players could see. Then there's the passion and aggression of wheelchair rugby, or ""Murderball"" as it has been coined. It's fast, it's furious, and full-on. Never mind that they are in wheelchairs -- the hits are real. The same agility is evident in the wheelchair basketball where the athletes can turn their chairs on a dime. On Thursday night, Olympic and Paralympic sprint star Oscar Pistorius . -- ""Blade Runner"" as he is known -- was pipped for third place in that eagerly-anticipated 100m sprint by his South African team mate Arnu Fourie. Local boy Peacock duly delivered joy for the home crowd by winning gold, and American Richard Browne took silver. It was an explosive race that made a change to the medal table... and my second pause for reflection. Where on earth was the United States of America in all this? Given the size of the United Kingdom, we have no business occupying third slot in the Paralympic Games medal table. Browne ran well in the 100m but the U.S. languished in sixth place despite the team being the third largest represented at the Games. The CNN website has given prominent coverage to the London 2012 Paralympics but U.S. host broadcaster NBC decided to show only four hour-long highlight programs on its sport channel. It's a decision that has drawn criticism from former Paralympian and chef de mission of the U.S. Paralympic team, Aimee Mullins. ""That disconnect between the U.S. being a world leader in disability issues and the broadcast coverage in real time of the Games is disappointing,"" she said in the UK newspaper, The Guardian. The lack of coverage is a terrible shame because American citizens have missed out on the fantastic endeavours of their athletes and could potentially hold back the future aspirations of many more. U.S. athlete Tatyana McFadden has won a heap of Paralympic medals since 2004. But as her own website puts it: ""She probably should not be alive."" She was born with spina bifida, resulting in paralysis below the waist, and spent the first six years of her life using her hands as if they were feet because she didn't have a wheelchair. She was rescued from a Russian orphanage in 1994 by Debbie McFadden -- then Commissioner of Disabilities for the U.S. Tatyana has overcome abandonment, disability and illness to become a world beating athletic star. Eight-time world champion Mallory Weggemann represents the U.S. in the swimming pool and described to CNN the commitment needed to win Paralympic gold. It would be a tragedy if people like McFadden and Weggemann were denied a chance to shine on an international stage. The UK has been creating opportunities for disabled athletes since the end of World War II, and it shows on the medal table. But many nations were only able to send one or two athletes to London. I hope the interest and enthusiasm demonstrated by the sell-out crowds at London Paralympic events will be matched by other countries because the fun attached to inspiring, entertaining sport has been a welcome tonic to the economic gloom. There may still be questions over whether there is a level playing field in all sports in the Paralympics but the exposure and debate can only improve the way the events are organized. Perhaps the real inequality is in the sporting chance that nations give to those who wish to confront their disabilities, excel in sports they have made their own and compete in the kind of activities that the able-bodied take for granted. Perhaps too they deserve better media coverage at home. For my part, I just can't wait for the Rio Paralympic Games. I hope you get to watch them too.","Paralympics showed stories of courage and thrilling athleticism, writes Dave Gilbert .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- During the first seven years of their relationship, Judy Kelly doesn't remember her boyfriend, Bill Horrisberger, ever going to a doctor. Bill Horrisberger, right, put off going to the doctor for more than a month, despite chest pains and shortness of breath. ""On a scale of one to 10, Bill was a zero,"" Kelly remarked when asked about her partner's willingness to get an annual checkup. It turns out Horrisberger, 62, a retired English teacher from Atlanta, Georgia, isn't the only man who is reluctant to put on a hospital gown. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality estimates that American men are 25 percent less likely than women to visit a doctor. ""A lot of times, it's very difficult for them to be convinced that they need to see a physician for a problem,"" said Dr. Allen Dollar, a cardiologist with Emory School of Medicine in Atlanta. ""To a large extent, there is a lot of denial going on, and in some cases, that denial can be deadly.""  Watch the battle to get men to the doctor » . Denial is an understatement for Horrisberger, one of Dollar's patients. Horrisberger was short of breath and experiencing chest pains in early December. Despite Kelly's repeated requests, he put off a doctor's visit for more than a month. ""There might have been some fear. My father had heart disease,"" admitted Horrisberger, who ended up having an operation to replace a faulty aortic valve and triple bypass surgery. ""There are a lot of things in Bill's story that could have been done preventionwise,"" Dollar said. The heart problems ""didn't show up overnight."" Horrisberger admitted he's learned his lesson about getting regular checkups. ""You don't know everything about yourself, so it would be a good idea to have someone else look at you,"" he said. That closer look by a doctor shouldn't be just every now and then when a patient feels bad. Dr. David Dodson, an expert on men's health at the Marino Center in Wellesley, Massachusetts, recommends that healthy men under 50 get a regular checkup every 18 months. After 50, he suggests, men should see their doctors annually. ""Men should take their health seriously,"" said Dodson, who is also the chairman of the Men's Health Committee for the Massachusetts Medical Society. ""It's not just for their own sake. It's because men are part of families, and families depend on them."" Health problems don't just affect older men, he said. Certain cancers, such as those of the testes and skin, are more common in young men. Younger men are also at higher risk than older men for sexually transmitted diseases, Dodson noted. And some men should talk to their doctor about being tested for gonorrhea, syphilis, chlamydia and HIV, the health care research agency suggests. As men age, Dodson said, they are more likely to develop high cholesterol and high blood pressure. Those conditions can increase the risk of heart disease, stroke and diabetes. ""The older you get, the more important those exams are,"" Dodson said. Around age 50, he wants men to be screened for colon and prostate cancer, in addition to regular blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar tests. ""There are so many things that go on in the human body that have no warning signs whatsoever until disaster strikes,"" he said. At least half his male patients end up making an appointment only after they've been prodded by a wife or other loved one, the doctor added. Looking back, Horrisberger wished he had listened to his girlfriend earlier and not waited to see the doctor. ""Once he got started and realized what was at stake, he was a good patient,"" Kelly said with a smile.","American men are 25 percent less likely than women to visit a doctor, agency says .

"Washington (CNN) -- Airplane manufacturer Boeing builds some of the most complicated machines on Earth, but in its efforts to make wireless signals on airplanes better it turned to the produce aisle for help. Wednesday the company announced a ""breakthrough"" in the procedures it uses to evaluate wireless signals in cabins, saying in a news release the tests make ""it possible for passengers to enjoy more reliable connectivity when using networked personal electronic devices in the air."" The new procedures come, in part, thanks to 20,000 pounds of potatoes that were piled in the seats of a decommissioned plane used for the tests. The tubers mimic the way the human body responds to electronic signals, so engineers at Boeing's Test & Evaluation Laboratory used the spud-filled plane to try out the new methods without requiring hundreds of people to sit in the aircraft. Once the engineers had the methods down, they were able to replace the starchy veggies and validate the data with humans. Boeing says the procedures it developed can reduce the time it takes to test wireless signals from two weeks to just 10 hours. ""One of the wonderful aspects of our improved testing is that we can describe both strong and weak signals with incredible accuracy,"" Boeing spokesman Adam Tischler said in a statement to CNN. ""Engineers who are concerned primarily with operational safety of an airplane can see if the strong signals are safe for the airplane's communication and navigation systems. Meanwhile, an engineer who is concerned with getting every passenger a really good network signal can see if the weak signals are propagating through the airplane with enough power to provide a good usability experience."" Most Americans are familiar with wi-fi Internet connections provided on airplanes, but the Federal Communications Commission and the Federal Aviation Administration have prohibited U.S. airlines from allowing cell phones in flight due to concerns about interference. Some countries do allow cell phone use on board planes with specially designed cell phone receivers, devices which Boeing sells and installs. ""We can actually apply this kind of testing to just about any signal,"" spokesman Tischler said. ""This is more than just wi-fi testing. We can test for safety and usability for all manner of personal electronic devices that might get used on an airplane."" As for the potatoes that were used in the tests, Boeing says they were donated to a food bank.","Boeing tests new methods to provide wireless signals to passengers .
Instead of loading a plane with people for the tests, it piles in potatoes .
The tubers mimic the way the human body responds to electronic signals ."
"(CNN) -- A CNN iReport showing people dancing on the floor of the North Carolina House of Representatives near the end of its legislative session is causing a bit of a stir. Carol Edmonds, 60, an iReporter known as SadTimesInNC, said she shot the video the afternoon of July 25 during a break in the second-to-last day of the session. That night, the state Senate passed a restrictive abortion bill, and the House approved controversial voter ID legislation. The iReport was originally titled ""NC House Dances With Joy Over Their Accomplishments"" and suggested Republican lawmakers were doing a victory dance after a contentious session. The iReporter later changed the headline to ""Opinion: Really? On The Day NC's Voters Rights Were Suppressed and Women's Rights Were Assaulted"". Within a couple days, the video racked up nearly 100,000 page views and 31,000 people shared it on Facebook. State Rep. Paul Stam, a Republican, told CNN that the musician playing in the video is his former legislative assistant, Christin Danchi, who is leaving for music school in the fall. The young woman performed a few classical numbers and finished with some bluegrass. The man dancing in the video is state Rep. Phil Shepard, a Republican, and his dance partner is the principal clerk of the House, according to a report from CNN affiliate NBC Charlotte. A few others are seen taking pictures or clapping. Edmonds was in the public gallery of the North Carolina House to document the proceedings. She has also attended most of the weekly demonstrations dubbed ""Moral Mondays,"" organized by the NAACP to voice anger about a key part of the state's GOP agenda. North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory has dismissed Democratic criticism that he is only pushing a conservative agenda. Edmonds acknowledged the music and dancing were unrelated to the passage of any bills but said any celebration on the floor was ""totally disrespectful and inappropriate"" given the gravity of issues the General Assembly was discussing that day and earlier in the session. ""I thought that it pretty much summed up the whole session, how out of touch the legislators had been and the disconnect with their actions to the reality of the people's lives,"" she said. ""They're making such sweeping changes that are ... hitting people of all walks of life really hard."" Stam said in an e-mail to CNN that he received appreciative notes from Democratic representatives as well as Republicans about the young musician's performance. ""We weren't discussing any issues. It was a recess. During that day we handled several dozen bills. ... I think the claim that it was inappropriate is silly.""","iReporter says music and dancing on North Carolina House floor inappropriate .

"(CNN) -- As easier-to-extract fossil fuels are depleted, techniques that involve more effort, environmental destruction and carbon emissions are being developed. Each new wave of more extreme extraction methods, be it tar sands, deep water drilling or mountain top removal, brings a new level of destruction to the area concerned. In the UK, gas production from the North Sea is in terminal decline. Prices have risen and consumption is falling. It is within this context that the UK government has proposed building up to 40 new gas-fired power stations in the hope that some unconventional gas will be found to fuel them. This apparently insane gamble does have some, admittedly warped, reasoning behind it. The threat to the energy corporations, whose influence in government is huge, is not energy shortages, from which they will profit handsomely, but sensible energy conservation which will make people less dependent on them. Whatever the outcome of that gamble, higher prices and less gas are assured, but the destruction of communities and the environment however, is something we do have a choice about. In the U.S., the shale gas boom is fast turning into a bust. Fracking companies are losing money hand over fist, drilling has slumped, prices are rising and gas production looks set to decline. The drop in demand due to the 2008 recession is what has lowered U.S. natural gas prices and emissions, not shale gas. It is clear that the idea being pushed of a shale-fuelled economic miracle is just so much hot air, fuelled by the usual irrational exuberance. The impact which a desperate scramble for unconventional gas will have on the UK would be profound. The tens of thousands of wells and thousands of miles of pipelines would have a vast greater impact than has been seen in the U.S. or Australia. The UK is one of the most densely populated countries in the world. As the evidence of water contamination, air pollution and health effect from the U.S. and Australia mounts up, people in the UK are scared. The UK government is preparing to sell off over half the country for fracking in the next year. It has instituted an Office of Unconventional Gas and Oil to cut though what little regulations previously existed. Plans are also afoot to take planning decisions about these developments out of the hands of regional governments so that local communities will have even less influence of the outcomes. On a global scale the threat from the exploitation of unconventional gas is even more dire. We cannot afford to burn the all the conventional fossil fuel reserves. The three main unconventional gas techniques are shale gas, coal bed methane (CBM/CSG) and underground coal gasification (UCG), which literally involved setting fire to coal seams underground to exploit the energy released. Between them they could unlock enough carbon to cause a five to 10 degrees Celsius global temperature increase. In the UK, as with many countries around the world, ordinary people are organizing to resist this invasion of their communities. Groups are being formed, public meetings are being held, films are being made and protests are being organized. People in the UK do not believe that their health and well-being should be sacrificed for the profit of a few. We take particular heart from Australia where a growing movement of organized communities appears to having some success in resisting the spread of fracking companies. The message is clear -- fracking and associated extreme energy methods like tar sands extraction, are intrinsically destructive to people and the planet. They must and will be opposed wherever they are being imposed on communities. In the end, fracking is a road to nowhere and the sooner we start heading back towards safety ground the better it will be for all of us.","UK campaigners: Shale gas exploration have greater impact in UK than in U.S.
Frack Off: Unconventional gas unlocking could cause huge global temperature rise .
Group: Health and well-being of people in UK should not be sacrificed for profit of a few ."
"(CNN) -- Some die-hard fans are getting all wrapped up in a campaign to defend Paula Deen. They're sending cleaned and origami-folded butter wrappers to Food Network and other companies that dropped the popular chef and cookbook author in the wake of allegations of racism and sexual harassment. Deen later admitted to ""of course"" using the n-word. The wrappers are intended as signs of protest -- physical declarations of ""we're sticking with Paula."" John Schmitt, a hotel night auditor in Indianapolis and the man behind the campaign, says he couldn't abide by the ""betrayal"" of Food Network, QVC and others. He felt he had to do something to express his disgust at the situation. ""She made a mistake 20 years ago,"" he says. ""We all make mistakes. I've said things I regret."" First, he thought about mailing actual sticks of butter. Then he considered two things: the waste of butter (something true Deen fans could never forgive), and the physical ickiness of envelopes steeped in melted butter. He opted for an empty wrapper on which he wrote in black block letters: ""Where is Paula?"" and began cooking up a plan. Deen critics say credit is past due . Wrapping things up . Schmitt created the Facebook page, ""We Support Paula Deen,"" on June 21 and announced the butter wrapper campaign the following week after Deen's now-famous interview with ""Today"" anchor Matt Lauer. ""People on the page are a lot like me,"" he says. ""They support Paula and who she is as a person."" Schmitt and many others say they have sent wrappers to Food Network, the QVC, Wal-Mart, Ballantine Books and other companies that have dropped Deen. Food Network, QVC, Wal-Mart and Smithfield Foods declined to comment. The idea for the butter wrapper campaign arose from Schmitt's desire to do something ""tangible"" as a show of support for Paula, something beyond Facebook posts. Opinion: Half-baked apology is recipe for racial indigestion . Talking with iReporter Chris Ford inspired him to try something different. ""That's when I said, 'You know, this is actually perfect,'"" Ford remembers. ""'The butter itself is Paula, and these wrappers are void of butter just like these companies are void of Paula.' And [Schmitt] said, 'My God, that's it. That's our slogan.'"" The slogan that came out of it -- ""A corporation without Paula Deen is like a butter wrapper without butter"" -- inspired countless posters to pledge their own wrappers for Paula's benefit. Soon the page was smothered in posts and comments from users, gushing over the cleverness of the campaign and pledging to send their own wrappers to the list of companies Schmitt had posted on the site. ""Perhaps somebody somewhere in mail rooms is keeping track,"" Schmitt says. ""I would've loved to see their face for the first one. Like, 'Ew, is this butter?'"" Schmitt sent his in the first week of the campaign, but he hasn't received a formal response yet, just ""canned answers"" from Sears and Wal-Mart. He wasn't necessarily expecting one; the campaign, he says, is more intended for self-expression than for results. Many, like Schmitt, say they weren't expecting personalized responses from Food Network, Smithfield's or any Deen-dropping company. ""I sent a butter wrapper knowing that the chuck-a-lucks down at the Food Network probably wouldn't even open it,"" wrote Liz Vannah, a supporter from Connecticut, in a Facebook message. ""But I felt compelled to do something to show that this kind of railroading, for whatever hidden-agenda-ed reason it happened, is not looked kindly upon by the consuming public."" Comfort food, uncomfortable topics . Paula Love-fests . Schmitt says he's been a Paula Deen fan for years, mainly because it was something he shared with his late mother, Laura Schmitt. They both enjoyed watching the show and shared a deep belief in Deen's ""goodness"" -- a belief that has not been shaken, even following news of Deen's alleged racism. ""In a lot of ways, she reminds me of my mom -- this funny, gracious lady from a different era,"" he says. ""My mom probably used that word and she wasn't a racist."" He points to Deen's work with the charitable Bag Lady Foundation and the sweet stories people have shared on the page as intrinsic signs of this goodness. Joyce Dixon, a Deen fan from Claxton, Georgia, says Schmitt's page caught her eye because of its emphasis on personal stories. She joined as fan No. 102 and later became the volunteer manager of the site. Dixon says she believes the page grew in popularity so quickly because people were attracted to the ""lovey-doviness"" of the stories, videos and photos shared by fans. Now, the page holds regular ""Love-Fest"" nights for followers to share their Deen stories. Dixon has been a fan of Paula Deen since 1997, when she first visited Deen's Lady & Sons restaurant in Savannah, and there met Deen personally. ""She just had black hair with a bit of salt and pepper in it,"" Dixon remembers. ""She wasn't a big personality or nothing. She was very involved with the customers."" Dixon recalls how at the end of the meal, Deen took the time to sit down at their table to ask how Dixon and her friends had enjoyed themselves, even asking if there were any items they'd like to see on the menu. ""That's when she won me over: the one-on-one, the face time,"" Dixon says. ""It's Business 101, and she's got it down."" Since then, Dixon says the characterization of Deen in the media is ""so wrong."" ""You know what? They're the ones that did this,"" Schmitt says, referring to the companies that dropped Deen. ""People [visiting those pages] were angry and upset and saw something they could get behind."" Paula Deen: From the frying pan to the firestorm . Sticking with Paula . Deen supporters from the page argue this ""punishment"" has gone too far. They say Deen has become a scapegoat for media attention -- and Dixon says that is why she dedicates so many hours to a mere Facebook page. She wants to correct the public's perception of the former Food Network star. ""It wasn't about the n-word; it was about the extortion thing, about this one crazy employee,"" Dixon says. ""My interest is in Paula's business. To me, it's about a self-made woman. You have to ask yourself, 'If she was a man, would this happen? If she was from the North would this happen?' And you know, I don't think it would."" Follow Julia Carpenter on Twitter and Google+ and keep up with CNN Living on Facebook. Are you a current or former Paula Deen fan?

"(CNN) -- Upgrading to the new Windows 8 operating system is not nearly as complicated as it looks, despite Microsoft's sometimes muddled marketing. Getting used to using it is a different story. At midnight Thursday, Microsoft's newest operating system is finally on sale. With more than a billion users, Microsoft's Windows is the dominant PC platform in the world. This launch is a big moment for the company, which is trying to keep those users from leaving for more mobile friendly competitors. CNNMoney: Windows 8 -- Microsoft's biggest gamble . Here are the basics for regular, non-techy Windows users curious about getting started with Windows 8. What is Windows 8? Windows 8 is Microsoft's latest operating system. It features touchscreen capabilities and a drastically different interface, and runs on tablets as well as PCs. It can be controlled entirely by touch (on compatible devices), with a mouse and keyboard, or by any combination of your preferred input options. The operating system is a daring effort by Microsoft to stay relevant as PCs are being overtaken by mobile devices. Apple's iOS and Google's Android operating systems are dominating the tablet and smartphone market, and Microsoft is attempting something big, different and risky to catch up. This is Microsoft's first operating system since the well-received Windows 7 was released three years ago. It is a complete reimagining of the desktop computer interface, but it is built on the same base as Windows 7, so all your old applications should continue to work just fine. (Except on devices running Windows RT. More on that later.) What's different in this operating system? The biggest change in Windows 8 is a system-wide shift in attitude. Apple products have the reputation for being fun and creative, Windows PCs for being dull but hardworking. One brand screams ""Angry Birds,"" the other Excel spreadsheets. Microsoft wants Windows to be hip and enjoyable to use, so it has come up with its own tablet-style interface and tried to make it work on tablets as well as PCs. At its best, the result adds some much needed life to an all-work-and-no-play operating system. At its worst, Windows 8 feels like two creatures hastily thrown together, Ã  la CatDog. One interface feels better with a touchscreen and gestures, the other with a keyboard and mouse or touchpad. The familiar desktop view has been pushed to the background to make room for a colorful, touchable, swipeable Start Screen, which acts as your home base. When you start the computer, you'll be greeted with a jazzy array of square and rectangle tiles representing applications, arranged into groups. The tiles can show live information such as your latest e-mail, breaking news, photos, the weather or calendar reminders. This side of Windows 8 runs apps developed for and sold in the Windows Store. But you can also click on a traditional Windows application and it will open it in the desktop view. Windows 8 review: A big, beautiful, slightly shaky step forward . Back on the old desktop view, the most visible change is that the Start button is gone. All your old applications look and feel the same in this retro world, though tapping on buttons designed for a mouse can be tricky. If you get confused, and you will in the beginning, one swipe from the right side of the Start Screen brings up a search tool to help you track down files or applications. Some Windows users will scoff at the attempts to liven up the old system as pandering to more casual computer users, or as somehow making the system less capable of serious work. But there are also many subtle, under-the-hood changes, including performance improvements. Most notably, the startup time is greatly improved over Windows 7. There also is a new feature called Storage Spaces that makes it easy to manage your various storage and backup options. Who should update to Windows 8? The first version of a new operating system is bound to have bugs and issues. Individual Windows users, especially those with just one machine who depend on it for work or school, should not rush right out for that upgrade. Wait until a more stable version comes along that irons out early problems. If you have an non-touchscreen computer, the switch may not be worth it unless you need the under-the-hood improvements. The operating system works on regular computers that don't have touchscreens, but they miss the best parts of the experience. The Start Screen and new tiled interface aren't nearly as satisfying when you can only click on them with a mouse (a touchpad is slightly better). If you are a diehard Windows fan, or just a tech-savvy computer user familiar with the perils of being an early adopter, you'll just need to make sure your current computer meets the system requirements. If you want to buy a new computer, there are already a large number of touchscreen options pre-loaded with Windows 8 from major manufacturers, including Samsung, Sony, Dell and Toshiba. There are ultrabooks, tablets, hybrids and desktops at all prices. There is plenty of hardware available at launch, but the Windows Store software selection is still a bit sparse. Corporate users are usually slower to upgrade their workforces to a new operating system, and without a compelling reason to switch to Windows 8, that will likely be the case this time as well. A recent report from technology research firm Gartner predicts 90% of enterprises will wait to upgrade to Windows 8 until 2015. Companies that depend heavily on mobile devices might be the exception. Which version of Windows should I get? There are four versions of the new Windows operating system: Windows 8, Windows 8 Pro, and Windows RT and Windows 8 Enterprise. While that may seem like a lot, it's actually fewer versions than Windows has offered for its operating systems in the past. Luckily, the decision of which to buy is pretty much made for you. If you are an individual upgrading an existing computer, your only option at the moment is Windows 8 Pro. The basic consumer version of Windows 8 will not be available for standalone purchase until February 2, 2013. For now, Windows RT and the basic version of Windows 8 are only available pre-installed on new computers. The differences between Windows 8 and Windows 8 Pro are minor. The big decision you'll have to make when buying a new system is if you want a Windows 8 or Windows RT device. Windows RT is a different version created for devices with ARM processers. These processers, typically found in phones and tablets, use less power, which means longer battery life. At the moment, Windows RT is only available pre-installed on Microsoft's new Surface tablet and a handful of other devices. CNNMoney: In Windows 8, the iPad has its first real challenger . Windows RT and Windows 8 look the same, but there's one key difference: Windows RT will not run your old Windows applications, only applications available through the Windows Store. That means no downloading any third-party apps from the Internet. The Windows Store has 5,000 apps in stock, but that number should grow over time. This closed approach is similar to the iPad and iPhone, which can only run applications sold through Apple's App Store. Finally, are you a large company planning on buying a large number of licenses? If yes, check out Windows 8 Enterprise. Is Windows 8 difficult to learn? Windows 8 presents a completely new approach to using a Windows computer, and as with anything radically new, it takes some getting used to. Do not upgrade unless you can spare some time to familiarize yourself with the layout and settings. The new look borrows heavily from the iOS and Android mobile operating systems, but isn't nearly as intuitive. Before you get scared off, know that it's not that hard to figure out the new system. It just takes a bit of effort and time, like learning any new program would. Microsoft took a big leap and created something new. Getting acclimatized is just a natural part of the process. Some stores selling the Windows 8 products are offering classes. Staples, for example, will have free personalized training on the new system, as well as help moving old data over to a new computer. How much does it cost? Microsoft is dropping the $200 price of Windows 8 Pro for its big debut. Existing WIndows 7, WIndows Vista and WIndows XP (with SP3) users can upgrade to Windows 8 Pro for $40 online. If you'd prefer a physical copy shipped to you in a nice box, the price goes up to $70. The deal is good through the end of January.","The new Windows 8 operating system is available after midnight Thursday .

"London (CNN) -- Sometimes Jaria Faraj Ali is so hungry that she ties a scarf tight around her waist to make her feel more comfortable. The Yemeni mother of six told the international aid group Oxfam that she has now resorted to begging because food prices are so high and she doesn't have an income. And in Pakistan, 28-year-old Asif Masih says he has to work at two jobs to buy enough food. ""I drive a taxi part time as well as work in an office because otherwise me and my family won't be able to eat,"" he told CNN. Their stories of hardship are echoed across the globe from Tajikistan to Peru where a recent spike in world food prices has hit the most vulnerable, and particularly in countries that rely on imported food. Rising food prices have been blamed on a number of factors -- for example, rising energy costs, changing land use for biofuel production, local conflicts, and an increasing demand for meat and dairy products. But 2012's severe weather events around the world have led to low yields in nations such as the U.S. that export grain. Oxfam fears climate change is responsible and that impoverished people could be facing a future of high food prices driven by extreme weather trends. Oxfam spokesperson Colin Roach said: ""High and volatile food prices spell misery for millions of people like Jaria who face a daily struggle to put food on the table. This is man-made misery in a world which produces enough for everyone to eat."" A recent study commissioned by Oxfam into global warming and food prices, said: ""Against a backdrop of rising populations and changing diets which will see global food production struggle to keep pace with increasing demand, the food security outlook in a future of unchecked climate change is bleak."" Oxfam-commissioned research on extreme weather and extreme prices . It has certainly been a tough year for farmers. While much of North America baked in the hottest July on record and the Mid-West suffered its worst drought in 56 years, the UK endured its wettest summer in a century. Back in September, CNN reported: ""From Ukraine to Yellowstone, in Pakistan and Kazakhstan, the skies have stayed clear, and the earth has been parched. And on the world's commodity exchanges, the prices of corn, soybeans, wheat and tea are surging."" The driest season: Global drought causes major worry . UK cereal farmer Jeff Powell says it was the poorest harvest he had seen in 30 years of farming with low yields and poor quality grain -- and he warns that the full effects are yet to filter into the system. ""Your loaf is going to cost more money this winter without a doubt -- when we get to Christmas bread prices will be up a lot,"" he said. ""It's an absolute nightmare for anyone in the livestock industry -- especially pigs and dairy -- with feed prices going up they can only stand that for so long."" In the U.S. state of Kansas, Donn Teske, who runs a prairie farm, said it was not unusual to have dry years but added: ""What we are finding though is that the extreme weather events are becoming much more extreme. Historically we haven't had these kind of conditions since the 1950s and before that the 1930s."" Find out how high food prices affect people across the world . The implications could be serious. Michael Roberts, an associate professor of economics at the University of Hawaii, wrote in August that lower U.S. crop yields would impact the world's poorest and could lead to social unrest. ""For these people, a huge rise in grain prices is more than noticeable -- it can break their budget. In 2008 and 2011, when corn prices went up to levels nearly as high as today's, the world saw a sharp rise in food riots. Many pointed to wheat prices as a catalyst for revolutions in the Middle East, including Egypt, Tunisia and Libya."" Oxfam says commodities futures markets are indicating there may be another spike in prices in early 2013, but expects high and volatile food prices in the medium to long term. It says governments should do more to prevent famine. ""Putting a stop to food price crisis requires a radical new approach to the way we grow, share and manage food,"" said Oxfam's Colin Roach. ""Governments must kick start the process by investing in small scale producers who feed billions across the developing world, regulating commodity markets; putting an end to biofuels policies which divert food crops into fuel; tackling greenhouse gas emissions which drive extreme and erratic weather and helping poor producers adapt to a changing climate."" There was better news for consumers this week when the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) reported that global rice production for 2012 was expected to outpace consumption, saying improved weather patterns in Africa and Asia had contributed to the rebound in rice inventories. And farmers are trying to adapt. Donn Teske says he will be stocking fewer cattle next year and trying to plant crops with less tillage to preserve the moisture. Some countries are also taking a longer term approach to reducing their reliance on food imports by looking for alternative staple crops. Nigeria has a population of 170 million and according to Debisi Araba, the special adviser to Nigeria's agriculture minister, the country spends 635 billion naira ($4 billion) annually on wheat and an astonishing one billion naira ($6.3 million) each day on rice imports. But Nigeria has a plan to combat this huge cost. Araba said Nigeria produces 34 million tons of the starchy root crop cassava every year and this can be mixed with wheat flour. He said Nigeria was planning to replace 40% of wheat flour with cassava and was ramping up production of rice. Araba believes the country will be able to produce 2.1 million tons of rice by 2015, first becoming self sufficient, and then able to export. Opinion: How Africa could feed the world . For other farmers, it may be more of a challenge to deal with any erratic weather patterns in the future. Jeff Powell said: ""Now with a wet autumn a lot of people are struggling to get their winter crops planted. If we have more years like this [2012] then we may aim to plant more crops in the spring... but the spring last year was bone dry. It's a bit of a catch-22."" Are you affected by high food prices? Tell us your experiences. CNN producer Shaan Khan contributed to this story.","This year's severe weather events have led to low yields in grain exporting nations .

"(CNN) -- World reaction Thursday to the Egyptian military's toppling of the nation's first democratically elected president ranged from applause to calls for the return of Mohamed Morsy to power. African Union . In a statement, the African Union said its chairwoman, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, was closely monitoring the developments in Egypt. ""She is particularly concerned about the tension prevailing in the country and the risks that this situation poses to stability and security in Egypt as well as to the consolidation of its democratic process."" The AU's ""principled position on unconstitutional changes of government"" underscores the need ""to find an appropriate response to the popular aspirations within the framework of legality and Egyptian institutions."" The union will send a group ""of eminent African personalities"" to Egypt to help initiate ""a responsible and constructive dialogue that would help the fellow Egyptian people overcome the difficult situation they are facing."" Bahrain . ""With great honor we take this opportunity to congratulate you on taking over the reins of power in Egypt at this important time in history,"" King Hamad Bin Isa Al-Khalifa said in a letter to Egypt's interim president, Adly Mansour, according to the official Bahrain News Agency. ""We are confident that you will take the responsibility to achieve the aspirations of the Egyptian people."" Britain . Prime Minister David Cameron said his country ""never supports intervention by the military"" but does not condemn what happened Wednesday in Egypt or call for Morsy to be restored to power. ""But what now needs to happen ... in Egypt is for democracy to flourish and for a genuine democratic transition to take place and all the parties need to be involved in that. And that's what Britain and our allies will be saying very clearly to the Egyptians."" France . ""What matters now is that the next elections are prepared in accordance with the civil peace, pluralism, individual freedoms and achievements of the democratic transition, so that the Egyptian people can freely choose their leaders and its future,"" a French Foreign Ministry spokesman said Thursday in a statement. ""We expect from the Egyptian authorities that Mohamed Morsy be treated with the respect due to the position he held. ""We reiterate our commitment to the pursuit of a political transition involving all political forces and sensitivities in respect of human rights and democratic principles, political pluralism and freedom of expression in accordance with the commitments taken."" Hamas . ""We do not fear the fall of President Mohamed Morsy,"" Hamas leader Ahmad Yousef told the Palestinian semiofficial Ma'an News Agency. Hamas is a militant fundamentalist Islamic organization that runs Gaza. ""We fear the dramatic changes that could cause things to go out of hand and lead to bloodshed,"" Yousef said. ""We only care about stability in Egypt regardless of who is in charge. Egypt is a lifeline to us; it's a major factor in the stability of the internal Palestinian situation -- it is our backbone."" Iran . Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Araqchi said Iran is concerned about the ""continuance of clashes between the opposition and Morsy supporters,"" according to the semi-official Mehr news agency. ""Unfortunately, the unrest during last few days left several dead and injured, but Egyptians should be united and stop the violence,"" Araqchi told the news agency. Shiite-led Iran appeared to welcome the ouster of Morsy, a Sunni. Araqchi said Iranian authorities welcomed the ouster of Hosni Mubarak as Egypt's leader in 2011 and hoped diplomatic relations would be restored between the two countries, but Morsy was critical of Tehran and did not allow it to appoint an ambassador in Cairo. Kuwait . ""In his name and the country's name, His Highness expressed his congratulations to the president of the Republic of Egypt, for taking the lead during the transitional and historical stage,"" the official Kuwait News Agency reported. Lebanon . Prime Minister Tammam Salam cabled Adly Mansour to congratulate him for his appointment as Egypt's interim leader, the official National News Agency reported Thursday. Salam also cabled Egypt's top military officer, Gen. Abdel-Fatah El-Sisi, to salute his effort to realize the ""Egyptian people's aspirations,"" according to the news agency. The Netherlands . ""We are following the situation in Egypt closely,"" said Toon van Wijk, spokesman for Dutch consular affairs. ""But there's no reason for us to make reductions to our embassy staff in Cairo or to ask personnel to come home."" Palestinian Authority . Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said he was ""pleased on behalf of the Palestinian people"" to congratulate Adly Mansour on his appointment, according to the Palestinian official news agency WAFA. Abbas ""praised the role played by the Egyptian armed forces under the leadership of (Gen. Abdel-Fatah El-Sisi) in preserving the Egypt's security and preventing it from sliding to the unknown fate, appreciating the role played by the Egyptian people in all its colors and types and sides that stood to save Egypt and deciding a road map for its future in these critical moments,"" WAFA reported.

""We see this as recognizing the will of the people there for the armed forces serving and protecting the people as they should."" Poland . ""It is with concern that we received news of the suspension of Egypt's constitution and the removal of President Mohamed Morsy from power,"" said Marcin Bosacki, Poland's Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman, in a statement. ""Such a solution must be treated as at least a temporary freeze of the democratic process initiated by the Egyptian nation over two years ago.

The Syrian president said he had long known that the Muslim Brotherhood's rule would fail. ""I said their project is a failure before it began and this is what made the Muslim Brotherhood's experiment fall quickly because it is wrong, and what is built on a wrong principle will definitely fall,"" he told the newspaper. Turkey . ""We are deeply sorry over recent events in Egypt,"" Ahmet Davutoglu, Turkey's minister of foreign affairs, told reporters in Istanbul, according to the official Anadolu News Agency. ""It is extremely worrying that Morsy, a president who was elected democratically, was ousted by the army."" He added, ""Powers of Egypt's elected authorities should immediately be reinstated.""

"(CNN) -- ""The political reality is ... that the Jewish lobby intimidates a lot of people up here."" -- Senator Chuck Hagel, 2006 . As a result of those words and his voting record, former Nebraska Sen. Chuck Hagel's nomination has turned a decades-long, bipartisan confirmation process for secretary of defense into an acrimonious one. While some leading figures such as the Anti-Defamation League's Abe Foxman and the Simon Wiesenthal Center's Rabbi Abraham Cooper say Hagel's words are borderline anti-Semitism, I'm less worried about anti-Semitism and more worried about the judgment of a potential defense secretary who thinks Israel has won support because of ""intimidation,"" not merit. Israel is widely supported by the American people because Israel deserves to be supported. Israel is a lonely democratic ally and a steady friend of the United States in a dangerous and tumultuous region. Their people are like the American people -- free, independent, capitalistic and tolerant. A Gallup poll taken last year showed 71% of the American people view Israel favorably while only 19% view the Palestinian Authority favorably and just 10% view Iran favorably. In a Pew Research Center study last month, 50% of adults said they sympathize more with Israel in its dispute than with the Palestinians. Just 10% sympathize more with the Palestinians, while about as many (13%) volunteered that they sympathize with neither side. Contrary to Hagel's logic, Israel doesn't enjoy widespread American support because anyone -- from any faith -- intimidated someone else; Israel earned the support of the American people because of its people's values. Opinion: Hagel is a friend to Israel . The danger in what Hagel said is if he thinks Israel is supported on Capitol Hill because of intimidation, then it's not hard to see why Hagel is so soft in his support for our ally. He sees himself as an independent voice willing to stand up to intimidation, and he wears his anti-Israel votes as badges of honor. But Hagel isn't independent. He's alone. His position on Middle Eastern matters is so outside the mainstream of both parties that almost no one agrees with him. In 2000, Hagel was one of only four senators who refused to sign a Senate letter in support of Israel. Peter Beinart: What's behind Hagel nomination fight . The following year Hagel was one of only 11 senators who refused to sign a letter urging President George W. Bush to continue his policy of not meeting with Yasser Arafat until the Palestinian leader took steps to end the violence against Israel. John Cornyn: Why I can't support Hagel . Contrary to America's longstanding bipartisan position, Hagel has called for direct talks with terrorist organizations Hamas and Hezbollah. In 2007, Hagel voted against labeling the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, the group responsible for the death of many American servicemen in Iraq, a terrorist organization. And in 2008, he was one of two senators on the banking committee to oppose a bill putting sanctions on Iran. One of the measure's biggest backers was an Illinois senator named Barack Obama. I'm a New Yorker and neither of my senators -- Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand -- supports Israel because someone muscled them into that position through intimidation. They both support Israel because the lobby that wants them to support Israel is an American lobby, made up of people from both parties and all religions and from people with no religion or political party at all. But if Chuck Hagel believes that it's intimidation and not sound judgment that has caused his colleagues to support Israel, then Chuck Hagel should not be confirmed as our next secretary of defense. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ari Fleischer.","In 2006, Hagel said 'the Jewish lobby intimidates a lot of people up here'

"(CNN) -- In an attack orchestrated by a Pakistani Taliban commander, around 250 prisoners, most of them militants, were freed this week at the central prison in Dera Ismail Khan in northwestern Pakistan. The commander, Adnan Rashid, had been freed a year earlier, this time at the central jail in Bannu, where 150 Taliban fighters stormed the facility and released nearly 400 prisoners -- Pakistan's largest jailbreak. Both prison breaks happened in the stronghold of the Pakistani Taliban, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, which borders North and South Waziristan, and both were conducted with a high degree of sophistication. This week's attack unfolded in multiple stages, beginning with cutting the prison's electricity, detonating bombs that had been planted around the facility to breach its external wall, and ambushing the security forces that rushed to the scene. Once the militants overwhelmed the guards, they used loudspeakers to contact and locate specific prisoners, freeing them from their cells with hand grenades. At least 13 people died in the attack. Pakistani authorities launched a search operation for the missing prisoners, but few have been recaptured. The others have simply melted away into the mountains. Jihadist militants have been breaking people out of prison across the Middle East and South Asia for years, some with significant consequences for the United States and its allies. Militant group claims responsibility for Iraq prison attacks . A 2006 prison break in the Yemeni capital, Sanaa, led to the creation of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, one of al Qaeda's most virulent affiliates, the one that recruited the ""underwear bomber"" who nearly brought down Northwest Airlines Flight 253 over Detroit on Christmas Day 2009. During the 2006 prison break, 23 inmates escaped through a 460-foot tunnel into a nearby mosque. Two of the escapees went on to become the leader and deputy leader of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. In 2008 and again in 2011, the Afghan Taliban led attacks on the Sarposa prison in Kandahar in southern Afghanistan that freed an astounding number of militants, around 1,700. Like the prison attacks by the Taliban in Pakistan, the Kandahar plots showed sophisticated planning. In the aftermath of the 2011 breach, Afghan officials discovered an intricate network of tunnels under the jail, equipped with electrical and ventilation systems. But perhaps no group has made prison breaks an organizational focus more than al Qaeda in Iraq. On July 21, 2012, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, al Qaeda in Iraq's leader, announced the ""Breaking the Walls"" campaign, a yearlong effort to release his group's prisoners. According to a count by the Institute for the Study of War, since al-Baghdadi's announcement, al Qaeda in Iraq has conducted assaults on seven major prisons. Earlier this month, hundreds of prisoners, including senior members of al Qaeda, escaped from Iraq's Abu Ghraib jail on the outskirts of Baghdad following a military-style assault on the prison. Al Qaeda's Iraqi affiliate claimed responsibility for that attack. Elsewhere in the Middle East, a prison riot and an attack launched from outside Al-Kuifiya prison in Benghazi, Libya, freed more than 1,000 inmates Saturday. Although it doesn't appear that groups such as the Taliban and al Qaeda are coordinating strategies in freeing their fellow militants, it is likely that they are inspiring each other with every successful, and well-publicized, prison break. The attacks are generally well-organized and often free significant numbers of inmates, refreshing the militant groups' ranks, and each successful prison break is a propaganda coup. Insiders assist in varying degrees in these different prison breaks, but the militants are also exploiting the countries' inadequate correctional systems. Many of these prison facilities where convicts have escaped en masse were meant to house criminals, not terrorists, and they often lack the fortification needed to fend off armed assaults. 1,200 inmates break out of Benghazi prison . Security concerns regarding prison facilities are part of the reason that 86 Guantanamo Bay detainees who were cleared for transfer into the custody of their home countries three years ago still remain in jail at Guantanamo. Fifty-six of those men are from Yemen, which has a notoriously porous prison system. The recent prison breaks in Pakistan, Iraq and Libya are reminders that the United States needs to do more to strengthen high security prisons in countries such as Yemen if there is any hope that prisoners who are cleared for transfer -- but have been languishing at Guantanamo for many years -- are ever to return home.","A Taliban commander leads prison attack in Pakistan, freeing 250 inmates .

"Harare, Zimbabwe (CNN) -- South African President Jacob Zuma congratulated Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe on his re-election, urging opposition groups Sunday to accept the results of ""the successful harmonised elections."" Zuma's stance appears to be at odds with the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia, all of whom have called into question Wednesday's presidential and primary polls. Zimbabwe's election commission said 89-year-old Mugabe won 61% of the vote, besting Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai's 34%, to lead the nation for another five years. Mugabe has been the only leader an independent Zimbabwe has ever known. Tsvangirai, 61, called the balloting ""a fraudulent and a stolen election"" -- and said he plans to mount a court challenge. Will of the people? In his statement Sunday, Zuma said all parties should accept the election's results because ""election observers reported it to be an expression of the will of the people."" Election observers and foreign officials raised doubts Saturday about the way the election was conducted, though some of them noted it was peaceful -- in contrast to the last election, in 2008, where post-vote violence left at last 200 people dead and thousands injured. Fast Facts: Robert Mugabe . U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, in a statement Saturday, criticized ""the culmination of a deeply flawed process."" ""In light of substantial irregularities reported by domestic and regional observers, the United States does not believe the results announced today represent a credible expression of the will of the Zimbabwean people,"" Kerry said. Credibility questioned . British Foreign Secretary William Hague, meanwhile, commended the peaceful nature of the vote, but expressed concern over how it was conducted. The reported irregularities ""call into serious question the credibility of the election,"" Hague said. On Sunday, Australian Foreign Minister Bob Carr called for a do-over. ""These appear to have disenfranchised large numbers of voters and raised doubts about the credibility of the election results,"" he said in a statement. ""Given our doubts about the results, Australia calls for a re-run of the elections based on a verified and agreed voters roll."" With his controversial win, Mugabe is set to see his time in power extended to 38 years. Fast Facts: Morgan Tsvangirai . Long reign . Tsvangirai ran unsuccessfully against Mugabe in 2002 and was later arrested several times, jailed on charges of treason and severely beaten in police custody. He faced off against Mugabe in the last election and won more votes than the president, though not enough to avoid a runoff. Violence broke out, and Tsvangirai then pulled out of the runoff claiming widespread voter intimidation and the torture, mutilation and murder of his supporters. Months later, after international pressure and successful negotiations, Mugabe and Tsvangirai signed an agreement giving Tsvangirai the post of prime minister in a Mugabe-led government. It has been an uneasy coalition ever since, one that included a brief boycott of the coalition by the MDC over the arrest of a party leader. Journalist Columbus S.

"(CNN) -- Former NFL player Aaron Hernandez put guns into a black box after returning home the night his friend Odin Lloyd was killed, according to new documents obtained by CNN. Hernandez has pleaded not guilty to murder in Lloyd's death. Another friend, Carlos Ortiz, 27, told investigators that he observed the former New England Patriots tight end putting firearms into a box in the basement of his North Attleborough, Massachusetts, home, including a small handgun that Hernandez had asked Ortiz to retrieve from the floor of the car they were driving. Ortiz then bought it into Hernandez's home, according to the document. Ortiz stated that he also had seen Hernandez enter the home and walk into the basement carrying a large handgun earlier in the day. This is consistent with a statement made by a prosecutor in court in late June. ""The defendant goes walking through the house with the gun in his hand. That is captured in the video. ... And they all go down to the basement,"" said Bill McCauley, first assistant district attorney for Bristol County, Massachusetts. ""Once in the basement, the surveillance gets shut off."" Authorities have said Hernandez, Ortiz, and Ernest Wallace, 41, picked Lloyd up from his Boston apartment early on June 17. Surveillance cameras showed the car at an industrial park near Hernandez's North Attleborough, Massachusetts, home. The documents also reveal the involvement of Tanya Singleton, 38, a cousin of Hernandez. After leaving Massachusetts, Wallace dropped Ortiz off at Singleton's Bristol, Connecticut, residence. Ortiz told authorities that he spoke with Singleton about Lloyd's killing. Singleton lives near a lake in Bristol where a state police dive team was searching for an item linked to Hernandez's case. According to the documents, Singleton also allegedly assisted Wallace in fleeing authorities. She has not been arrested or charged. Authorities collected Singleton's credit cards and cell phone. According to the search warrant, Singleton allegedly purchased a bus ticket for Wallace to travel from Macon, Georgia, to Miami. Authorities arrested Wallace in Miramar, Florida, on June 28. It is unclear how Wallace traveled from Bristol to Macon. Wallace also regularly used a cell phone paid for by Singleton, according to the documents. CNN left a message for Singleton seeking comment. Authorities have accused Hernandez, 23, of orchestrating the death of Lloyd, the 27-year-old boyfriend of Hernandez's fiancÃ©e's sister. Wallace was charged with accessory after the fact to murder and has pleaded not guilty. Ortiz has pleaded not guilty to a weapons charge. Lloyd's body was found in an industrial park near Hernandez's home on June 17. The police believe Lloyd was shot execution style with a Glock .45. The weapon has not yet been found.

"(CNN) -- As a frequent visitor to Egypt, I have never seen the country as deeply polarized along ideological, social, and political lines as it is today -- horizontally and vertically. The current fight pits the Muslim Brothers and their Islamist allies against the military-backed government and a sizeable segment of Egyptians who rally around the flag and populism. Religious frame of reference is pitted against a deeply entrenched nationalist identity that is centuries-old. This fierce struggle over hegemony and the future identity of the Egyptian state has been invested with cultural and existential overtones. Both camps view their rivalry as life-and-death and are locked in a deadly confrontation, a clash that has killed more than 1,000 people, including dozens of members of the security forces and injured thousands. On Sunday the Egyptian government acknowledged that 36 Islamists died in its custody after an attempted breakout and a day later more than two dozen off-duty police recruits were killed by gunmen in the restive Sinai Peninsula. According to the Interior Ministry, the police recruits were returning from leave to their jobs in the border town of Rafah when militants ordered the recruits out of two minibuses and forced them to lie on the ground before shooting them. The recent bloodletting is the most violent episode in Egyptian modern history and shows an unraveling of its social fabric, a rupture with the past. In contrast to neighboring Arab countries, such as Iraq and Syria, with blood soaked history, Egypt is one of the least violent societies in the Middle East and Egyptians are the most peace-loving people. There is a real danger that bloodshed will beget more bloodshed and that unless checked Egypt will be engulfed in politically-driven violence. There are signs pointing to the military-backed government continuing its clampdown on the Brotherhood and possibly attempting a widespread purge, including banning the 85-year-old Islamist organization. Early Tuesday, Egyptian authorities arrested Muslim Brotherhood chief Mohamed Badie, escalating a crackdown that has seen the arrests of dozens of the group's top leaders and more than 1,000 of its followers (in its prolonged confrontation with the Brotherhood, even the Mubarak regime refrained from arresting the top leader or general guide out of restraint). Interim Prime Minister Hazem el-Beblawi even suggested outlawing the Brotherhood and told reporters over the weekend: ""There will be no reconciliation with those whose hands have been stained with blood and who turned weapons against the state and its institutions."" A decision to ban the Brotherhood that would have serious repercussions on Egypt's future. It would pour gasoline on a raging fire and deepen and widen the ideological and social rift that already exists. It would represent a hard blow to the fragile democratic experience in Egypt, a severe setback to the institutionalization of democracy. The Brotherhood has millions of followers and cannot be politically eradicated by a stroke of pen or the barrel of a gun. There will be no institutionalization of democracy without the Brotherhood, the biggest and oldest mainstream religiously based Islamist movement in the Middle East. Moreover, a persecuted Brotherhood whose leaders are either in prison or underground might tempt its young followers to take arms against state and society, as some supporters retaliated violently, following the 21 police stations and scores of Coptic churches burnt already last week. Unless steps are taken to defuse the escalating crisis, Egypt will likely descend into long-term bloodshed and perpetual instability. We may be in for a repeat of the violent insurgency seen in Egypt from 1992 until 1998, an insurgency that killed and injured thousands of Egyptians. Priority must be given to ending the killing and bloodshed and beginning the healing and reconciliation process, a complex task given the country's deepening and widening polarization and the absence of a credible, neutral third force. The international community's role is pivotal, although excessive intervention by the Western powers would embolden the hardliners within the military-security apparatus and allow them to stirrup hyper nationalist sentiments. Beyond the legal and moral pressure that the international community could exert on Egyptian military rulers, there is an urgent need for mediation and stopping the country's descent into all-out confrontation. Of all powers, the European Union, along with the United Nations, is the best equipped to assist the Egyptian people and to bridge the divide between the two warring camps. Unlike the United States which is deeply mistrusted by Egyptians of all walks of life because of its intimate ties with the military and Egyptian rulers, the EU is seen as neutral and trustworthy. Although its previous mission failed to produce a breakthrough, the recent escalation after Muslim Brotherhood camps were broken up, the EU, in coordination with the U.N. and the U.S., must redouble its efforts and impress on the interim government to take concrete steps and confidence-building measures to defuse the crisis, such as stopping the arrests of Brotherhood leaders and releasing others. Political talks would follow on ways and means to assure the Islamists that they would not be excluded from participation in the transitional road map. There is no guarantee of success and a high probability of failure. Nevertheless, the world community cannot afford to remain passive in the face of the unfolding bloodbath in Egypt and the inherent risks to regional stability and international peace. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Fawaz Gerges.","Fawaz Gerges: Egypt is polarized along ideological, social, and political lines .

"(CNN) -- Firefighters battling a massive blaze in Idaho made headway on Tuesday, a top official said. The Beaver Creek fire has devoured 106,000 acres in Idaho's Sun Valley, but authorities could have the fire up to 20% contained by Tuesday night, incident commander Beth Lund told reporters. ""They're making good progress today,"" she said, noting that authorities are ""cautiously optimistic"" about the wildfire, which has threatened thousands of homes and forced residents to evacuate. ""Right now our primary goal is to get people back in their homes within the next day or two,"" Lund said. Thunderstorms forecast for Wednesday are a mixed blessing, she said. Lightning could further fuel fires, but more cloud cover and increased relative humidity would help firefighters, she said. Lightning ignited the wildfire more than two weeks ago. Nearly 1,800 people are battling the blaze. So far, it's cost $11.6 million, officials said. In a mountainous area nearby, another wildfire was also raging Tuesday. The Little Queens Fire has scorched an estimated 8,000 acres, with no containment. As that blaze threatened the tiny town of Atlanta, Idaho, two dozen or so residents ignored a mandatory evacuation on Monday to take a stand against the fiery fury of nature. ""About 70% of the residents have stayed behind to help,"" said Gene Haught, Atlanta's fire chief. By Tuesday, the evacuation order had been downgraded, barring the public from the town but allowing the town's 35 permanent residents to stay. Wildfire chars Idaho, rains flood southern Mississippi . ""What we are doing mainly is looking at areas that might be a problem and cleaning those up. As equipment arrives, we are going to help deploy it to do some structure protection,"" Haught said Monday. Residents have also used their own earth-moving equipment to cut a fire line around the town. What to know about wildfires . On Tuesday, two firefighting crews and three engines joined them. Atlanta, Idaho, is a historic mountain town located about 135 miles northeast of Boise. The community, which includes many second homes, is surrounded by the Boise National Forest.

""I would miss all the beauty of what we got left. We are hoping and praying the fire doesn't come to this town,"" she said, ""I have seen the destruction to other parts of the town.

"(CNN) -- There's more to do in Cairo than just protest. Just look at lifestyle website CairoScene. On Tuesday, for instance, there's Johnny's Karaoke Night, Culturewheel's Mime Festival and the Arab Music Festival Ceremony at the Cairo Opera House. You can get one pizza free if you buy another at Boosters, and it's ladies night at Yasso Lounge. The young Egyptians who put out CairoScene work at a building in an upscale Cairo neighborhood. It's next to Nahda Square, where the Muslim Brotherhood staged a sit-in, and the protests sometimes prevented them from getting to work. Today, the Brotherhood protesters are gone and there's no missing the military presence outside the building. At one intersection, troops stand guard from an armored personnel carrier as pedestrians stroll by. Inside CairoScene's offices, young Egyptians huddle around sparkling white tables and lounge on white couches, peering into computers. They talk about their latest stories and the unrest raging across Egypt. Top Muslim Brotherhood figure among scores arrested . ""We asked for this,"" site co-founder Timy Mowafi said. ""The Egyptian people asked for the army to intervene."" Among many in the newsroom, the military crackdown against supporters of ousted President Mohamed Morsy is necessary, if unfortunate. ""It's devastating to think of the numbers who have died on either side, but there were armed people on the streets,"" Mowafi said. ""This would not be acceptable in any other country."" But not everyone agrees wholeheartedly. ""Personally, I'm not with the military, but I'm also definitely not with the Brotherhood,"" said Eihab Boraie, a senior writer for the site. ""We will have to take up Tahrir again,"" he said, referring to the landmark Cairo square that served as the backdrop for the 2011 protests that led to the ouster of longtime Egyptian strongman Hosni Mubarak. ""And when we take up Tahrir,"" he said, ""it will be against the Brotherhood and against the military, and it will be for peaceful transition to immediate election."" Opinion: Can anyone save Egypt from the brink? 'In God's hands' With hundreds dead, funerals are frequent. One recent day, relatives held the funeral for Ammar Badie, the slain son of the now-arrested leader of the Muslim Brotherhood. He was shot twice in the head last week as security forces clashed with protesters. On this hot, sunny Cairo day, mourners carried his plain wooden coffin into a crypt. Men wept, shook hands, said goodbye. ""It's a disgrace people were saying he was a terrorist,"" said Ammar Badie's cousin, Omar Rabiya. ""He was not -- he was a person of peace, a smart guy -- and he just wanted his country to be free."" Ammar's brother Bilal told mourners not to cry. ""This is in God's hands,"" he said. Egypt's cycle of violence . 'The church is my home' Outside Cairo last week, 67-year-old Shenouda el Sayeh swept up ashes amid the burned ruins of the Virgin Mary Church. The church was one of at least 30 attacked last week amid backlash over the military crackdown on the Muslim Brotherhood. The Rev. Boktor Saad, the church's pastor, said Islamists were behind the attack. ""They started organizing marches and demonstrations, chanting outside the church, chanting down with the church,"" he said. To el Sayeh, the church, now charred and gutted, was home. ""I'm sad,"" he said. ""My religion tells me to come clean. I clean the church. The church is my home."" 'I feel frustrated' Life amid the chaos isn't terrifying for 20-year-old student Mayar Adly. It's boring. ""I don't go out as much as I used to go before,"" she said. ""I'm so bored. My life sucks."" And there are moments of panic. A couple of days ago, the family heard gunshots outside during a protest. ""I thought it was fireworks, but they told me it was gunshots"" Adly said. ""My mom told me to stay away from the window. It was kind of freaky. I was scared."" Barred from protesting by her father, she spends most of her time in a three-room high-rise apartment with her two younger brothers, her parents and five cats. A local market delivers their groceries, and she gets to go out only rarely -- to a cleaning job at a nearby bank. She spends time on Facebook, reading and watching television -- but not the news. ""I'm fed up with news,"" she said. ""I used to be interested in the news, but I'm not as interested as I used to be."" I feel frustrated,"" she said.

"(CNN) -- Australians go to the polls in less than five weeks to vote in elections that will decide on policies as diverse as how the country polices its borders, how it manages its greenhouse emissions and how it plans to roll out a national scheme to connect every part of the vast continent to the Internet. Just weeks after ousting rival Julia Gillard, Prime Minister Kevin Rudd on the weekend called a national election for September 7, rallying the Australian Labor Party faithful to stand behind the party's policies on education and the economy. ""We've got one hell of a fight on our hands,"" Rudd said in an email to supporters. ""I have a positive vision about the country we can be. In this election I'll be talking with Australians across the county about better schools for our kids, investing so we can create good jobs, and about how the NBN (national broadband network) can help keep our economy strong."" So what's at stake: . 1. The asylum-seeker issue . No area of policy is likely to be more contested, however, than border protection. An emotive issue that for decades has been fodder for Australia's strident brand of talk-back radio show hosts, known colloquially as 'shock-jocks', both the opposition Liberal-National Coalition under Tony Abbott and Rudd have policies that would effectively curtail the influx of 'boat people' to Australia. According to Australia's Department of Immigration, this year 218 boats carrying 15,182 passengers were listed as irregular maritime arrivals as of July, 2013 -- most of them refugees from Iraq, Iran, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan and Bangladesh seeking asylum. Rudd has put forward the Papua New Guinea plan to deal with the influx, a $A1.1 billion scheme that would settle asylum seekers outside Australia permanently. Abbott, meanwhile, says he will turn the problem over to Australia's military which would be under orders to tow asylum-seeker boats to Indonesia. Indonesia, however, has remained opposed to the opposition's scheme. Why Australia's PNG asylum plan won't work . 2. Tax and spending . Both parties, meanwhile, plan to axe the country's controversial carbon tax on greenhouse emissions. Uncertainty over the issue was credited with unseating Rudd's first government and both parties have adopted fresh policies. Under Rudd, the government would move one year early to an emissions trading scheme while the Liberal Party plans to scrap carbon trading altogether in favor of a voluntary emissions reduction scheme it has called 'direct action.' On the broader economic front, the government is likely to point to Australia's stellar economic figures which this year pegged growth at 2.5%, a jobless rate of 5.7%, inflation at just 2.4% and interest rates also at a low 2.75%. While Australia has seen a sustained boom, largely thanks to the sale of commodities to a resource-hungry China, the government has racked up a deficit of $A30 billion and Abbott -- a fiscal conservative - is certain to target government-spending in the lead-up to the election. How the Australian political rivals view China . 3. The Internet . The National Broadband Network (NBN), a contentious $40 billion program to connect more than 90 per cent of Australia's premises with super fast fiber optic cables, would be scaled back under a Liberal-National Coalition government, which favors the use of existing, but slower, copper cable networks fed by fiber optic cables to the node. The NBN has proved highly popular in regions where the network has already been rolled out and some analysts say a perceived reversal of the policy could damage the Coalition's chances at the polls. With little differentiating the parties substantively on policy, the role of the media in the lead-up to the elections will be crucial to the fortunes of both parties. Already the right-leaning Daily Telegraph newspaper -- Sydney's largest-selling tabloid -- has called on readers to vote for the Coalition running the headline: ""Kick This Mob Out"". ""The mass media no longer sees the explanations of policies and ideas as a central part of its charter,"" analyst Shaun Carney of Monash University told The Conversation website. ""As it finds itself having to chase eyeballs in order to keep its financial head above water, it becomes more sensational, more attracted to portraying conflict and dealing with what public figures say rather than what they believe or do. ""The parties go along with this model by ramping up the hyperbole.""","Australians will go to the polls on September 7 .
Border protection and the economy set to be key issues .
Both parties likely to agree on education and national broadband policy .

"(CNN) -- Stacy Lewis of the United States conjured up a dream finish on the Old Course at St Andrews Sunday to capture the Women's British Open title. Lewis birdied the famous Road Hole 17th then repeated the feat on the 18th to win by two shots from South Korean pair Choi Na Yeon and Park Hee Young. Lewis, who was claiming her second major after taking the Kraft Nabisco Championship in 2011, carded a final round level-par 72 for eight-under 280. South Korea's Park Inbee, bidding for a historic fourth major of the year, struggled again in the blustery conditions and closed with a six-over 78 to finish tied for 42nd. The 25-year-old from Seoul admitted that she had struggled with the pressure of expectation. ""I've gone through four rounds of intense pressure and I'm sort of glad it is over,"" said the World No.1. ""I almost feel relieved it is all over. It was hard being the center of attention all week and I feel exhausted."" Lewis, who won all five of her matches at St Andrews in 2008 as part of the winning American team in the amateur Curtis Cup, could scarcely take in her victory. ""This is unbelievable,"" said Lewis. ""I fought so hard over every shot all day and then it happened so fast at the end. A couple of birdies and it was over."" She had trailed Choi by three at the turn, but mastered the conditions coming home. Her approach shot to five-feet at the 17th, ""probably the best shot of my career"" proved the key to victory, followed by a 30-feet birdie putt at the last to seal the triumph. Fellow American Morgan Pressel led after the third round, completed Sunday morning after high winds caused play to be abandoned early the day before. Pressel closed with a 76 to finish tied for fourth on five under with Norway's Suzann Pettersen (74).","Stacy Lewis of United States wins Women's British Open .

"(CNN) -- The House of Representatives gave final approal late Thursday night to the $858 billion tax deal negotiated by the White House and top Senate Republicans, sending it to President Barack Obama to be signed into law. After a day of legislative wrangling that delayed consideration of the measure for several hours, the final vote of 277-148 had almost equal numbers of Democrats and Republicans in support. The package includes a two-year extension of the Bush-era tax cuts set to expire December 31. It also would extend unemployment benefits for 13 months, cut the payroll tax by 2 percentage points for a year, restore the estate tax at a lower level and continue a series of other tax breaks. The bill, which cleared the Senate 81-19 on Wednesday, passed despite strong objections from both the left and the right. Among other things, House liberals were  strongly opposed to what they argued was an excessive giveaway to the rich in the form of a lower estate tax. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi depicted the measure as a necessary step to prevent taxes of working class Americans from increasing, even though it also extended lower tax rates for the wealthiest Americans who she said don't need the benefit. ""This is very difficult,"" Pelosi said. ""Nobody wants taxes to go up for the middle class. We just don't see why we have to give an extra tax cut to the wealthiest."" A procedural snag earlier Thursday forced House Democratic leaders to pull the bill from consideration over concerns they lacked support on how the debate would proceed under rules they had set. The House then went into indefinite recess as liberal Democrats seeking changes to the bill huddled with party leaders to work out a solution. Eventually, debate resumed on a new set of rules that would allow the House to vote on a proposed change to the controversial estate tax provision, and then on the full bill itself. Obama strongly praised the Senate vote earlier and urged the House of Representatives to quickly approve the bill. The Senate vote is ""a win for American families, American businesses, and our economic recovery,"" Obama said in a written statement. ""As this bill moves to the House ... I hope that members from both parties can come together in a spirit of common purpose to protect American families and our economy as a whole by passing this essential economic package."" House Democrats, however, repeatedly warned that they may try to change the measure, particularly the estate tax provision. Currently, the estate tax is scheduled to return with an exemption on inheritances up to $1 million and tax amounts above that at a rate of 55 percent. Under the tax package, the tax rate would be reduced to 35 percent on amounts above a $5 million individual exemption. Conservatives argue that an estate tax more stringent than set by the package would, among other things, make it nearly impossible for many family-owned small businesses to be passed down from one generation to the next. Liberals contend that a lower or nonexistent estate tax would merely benefit the wealthy while doing little to aid the economy. A number of House Democrats wanted to change the estate tax to levels previously approved in a separate House bill that would exempt inheritances up to $3.5 million and tax amounts above that at a 45 percent rate. Pelosi said the change would bring in an additional $23 billion, and would affect only 6,600 more families than the lower rate and higher exemption in the negotiated tax deal. However, more than two dozen moderate House Democrats submitted a letter to their House leadership calling for the tax package to be passed unchanged so it could  go directly to Obama to be signed into law. The House Rules Committee decided Wednesday night to allow a vote on changing the estate tax provision to the levels in the previously passed House bill. If approved, the changed bill would then go back to the Senate. If rejected, the House would then hold a separate vote on the Senate version, and with approval send the bill to Obama. However, the House Democratic leadership pulled the bill Thursday when it was unclear whether enough of their caucus would agree to the rules. Republicans traditionally oppose any rules set by Democratic leaders, even on legislation that has GOP support, arguing they want more time to debate and possibly make changes. Pelosi was seen talking to liberal Democrats including Weiner and Rep. Peter Welch of Vermont. Later, the group grew to include House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Maryland, and others. Rep. Rob Andrews of New Jersey said some Democrats wanted the rules to guarantee an up-or-down vote on the version of the bill passed by the Senate. As originally structured, such a vote would occur only if the House first rejected the amended version that altered the estate tax provision. ""We have one overriding goal here -- that every member of the House have a fair chance to express his or her view on final passage,"" Andrews said. At the same time, liberal Democrats, including Weiner and Rep. Peter DeFazio of Oregon, want a chance to vote on further possible changes, including replacing the payroll tax deduction with an extended ""make work pay"" tax credit set to expire at the end of the year, DeFazio said. The liberal Democrats also want a provision to redirect any additional revenue from their desired higher estate tax rate to pay for infrastructure investment projects, as well as a $250 payment to Social Security recipients denied a ""cost of living"" increase this year, according to DeFazio. ""This is the last opportunity we have,"" DeFazio said in explaining the last-minute push by the liberal wing. ""We're on record voting on a whole bunch of things that people aren't paying attention to. People are paying attention now and we think we need to make a strong statement."" However, Democratic Rep. Jason Altmire of Pennsylvania, who supports the Senate version, called the move by liberals to demand more changes a ""mistake."" ""It's delaying the inevitable,"" Altmire told CNN. ""The Senate passed this thing with 81 votes."" In the end, the new rules only added the guaranteed vote on the full bill, while denying the other amendments sought by the liberal Democrats. Republicans involved in the negotiations with the White House on the package have warned that any changes by the House could derail the entire proposal, causing tax rates to increase in 2011. ""If the House Democratic leadership decides to make partisan changes, they will ensure that every American taxpayer will see a job-killing tax hike on January 1st,"" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, said in a statement Monday. With the Bush tax cuts set to expire at the end of the year, Obama and congressional Democrats faced a fast-approaching deadline to reach a deal. Republicans won control of the House and reduced the Democratic majority in the Senate in the new Congress convening in January, which would give Democrats less leverage to negotiate after the current lame-duck session. House liberals were not the only ones objecting to the agreement. A number of conservatives, including likely 2012 GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney, were challenging the deal because it doesn't permanently extend the Bush tax cuts and would add to the deficit.

"(CNN) -- Instagram has had a big, big, big last couple of weeks: Its Android app dropped at the beginning of April, and Facebook recently acquired the photo-sharing service for a whopping $1 billion. The result of all this attention? A flood of new users, swelling Instagram's user count up to 50 million. So what does this mean for the fate of everyone's favorite photo app? It's probably going to get a whole lot more annoying. Yup, those salad days are about to end, folks. That glorious period in which Walden-filtered snaps of Walden Pond mingled with Earlybird-tinged mountainsides and cats made classic with a dash of 1977-bred nostalgia. The end is nigh, we say! Steel yourself: We're about to see an influx of photo-happy parents, drunken college kids and, horror of horrors, even more pheromone-crazed teens with accounts entirely dedicated to prepubescent boy bands. Instagram's passionate users wary of Facebook takeover . In preparation for the onslaught, we're asking you, dear readers, to take stock of your own Instagrammed souls. Dig deep and evaluate how you can help stave off the horror that is blurry shots of food-caked children and one's sparkly manicure. We're all guilty of Inane-gramming (verb: To thoughtlessly snap and share snaps with no regard for our followers' feelings), and while it's your inalienable right to share and share alike, you can probably agree that at least one in five of the transgressions below should be quashed. Translation: Don't do these: . 1). Myspacing all over the place . We get it, Instagram is supposed to be a photo feed depicting your life and all the many interesting factions of it (I knit! I canoe! I collect severed heads in my freezer! Call the cops!). A self-snap is, consequently, totally OK once in a while -- especially if you just got a new haircut/tattoo/head for your collection (seriously, your phone isn't just a camera -- call the cops). However, don't you have any, I don't know, friends? If not, you're not going to make any pouting into the camera, your mien made even more morose via the Inkwell filter. 2). Flooding the feed . Just took 15 photos of your new puppy in various stages of repose (He's in a sunbeam! He just turned over! He shifted a little out of the sunbeam! He just turned over again!)? Awesome! We're glad you're pleased with your pet-buying prowess! Upload one and save the rest to your phone for personal perusing -- we don't need a flipbook. If you must needs overshare, might we suggest downloading GIF Shop? This iPhone app allows you to turn all your snaps into a rad animated GIF. 3). Getting overly textual . This faux pas is more Instagram's fault than users' -- since the app doesn't have private messaging, it can be really hard to flirt with-- I mean, carry on a conversation with another user without cluttering up the comments section of a photo. Luckily for the chattier folks among us, there's instaDM, an iPhone/Web app that makes it easy to converse privately with other users. Once downloaded, please refer to our article about how to hit on people online without being a creeper. 4). Being a camera cheat . Guys: The whole point of Instagram is that it lets anyone with a phone and some vague sense of composition take an awesome photo -- a filter fixes pretty much anything (Even your face! Burn...). Taking a snap with a really good camera and then uploading it to Instagram is like enrolling in a kindergarten-level finger-painting class and bringing your own oil paints (and brush). Leave us to our delighted muddlings -- we implore you. 5). Being an easy target for a parody Twitter account . Check out @textinstagram.

"(CNN) -- As casualties mount before the brutal onslaught of Bashar al-Assad's forces against Syria's pro-democracy protesters, the Russians are being unhelpful again. In Washington and Brussels, even habitually cool diplomats have been showing frustration. On January 31 Russia joined with China to block a plan presented to the U.N. Security Council by Morocco and supported by the Arab League that called on Assad to hand power to his deputy, who would then call a general election. If Assad did not comply within 15 days, the resolution threatened undisclosed ""further measures."" Moscow already had vetoed one resolution denouncing Assad's use of force in October. As Western leaders sought to pry the Syrian dictator from power, his old friends in Moscow sent an aircraft-carrying missile cruiser to Syrian waters in a show of support last month and shipped his troops a consignment of Yakhont cruise missiles. Such actions are just the latest in a litany of obstructionist maneuvers and spoiler ploys whose goal often appears merely to undermine Western international objectives. From Washington, Moscow has seemed determined to soften or delay sanctions on Iran aimed at curbing its nuclear ambitions, to stall in talks with North Korea over its nuclear weapons, to intimidate pro-democracy movements in neighboring states, and to egg on anti-American dictators such as Hugo Chavez. Western commentators typically attribute such behavior to Putin's personal paranoia or to attempts to rekindle the nation's wounded pride and assert Russia's superpower status. Look a little closer, however, and Russia's actions seem motivated more by calculated -- albeit sometimes miscalculated -- realpolitik than by psychological impulses. First, strategic interests are at stake. In Tartus, Syria hosts the sole remaining Russian naval base on the Mediterranean, currently being refurbished by 600 Russian technicians after long disuse. To have to give up this Middle Eastern beachhead would be a shame, as far as the Russians are concerned. Second, although limited, Russia has real commercial interests in Syria. Contracts to sell arms to Damascus -- both those signed and under negotiation -- total $5 billion. Having lost $13 billion due to international sanctions on Iran and $4.5 billion in canceled contracts to Libya, Russia's defense industry is already reeling. Besides arms exports, Russian companies have major investments in Syria's infrastructure, energy and tourism sectors, worth $19.4 billion in 2009. Counting pennies while protesters are gunned down may seem cynical. ""How many people need to die before the consciences of world capitals are stirred?"" Britain's Foreign Secretary William Hague demanded on January 31, clearly thinking of Moscow. But Russian policymakers have developed an allergy to Western leaders' moralizing. Just as it was pressing al-Assad to resign, the U.S. State Department quietly lifted a ban on military aid to the Karimov dictatorship in Uzbekistan, which had butchered its own protesters a few years earlier. (Uzbekistan is important for supply lines to NATO troops in Afghanistan.) Neither did Washington press the king of Bahrain -- where the U.S. Navy has a port -- to step down after he crushed popular demonstrations in his capital. From Washington, the West's recent interventions in the Middle East seem unplanned and responsive, with modest goals. From Moscow, it is easy to see a pattern in the repeated use of force to overthrow leaders -- from Afghanistan and Iraq to Libya -- and diplomatic pressure to dislodge others -- in Tunisia, Egypt and Yemen. President George W. Bush may be gone, but his ""Freedom Agenda,"" it sometimes seems, lives on. Libya is a particularly sore point. Russia's leaders felt they were tricked into supporting a resolution to protect civilians only to see it used to provide cover for airstrikes to overthrow Moammar Gadhafi. Vague phrases like ""further measures"" now set off alarm bells. Beyond commercial and strategic interests, the Kremlin's greatest fear is of instability in the Middle East and Central Asia. Russian policymakers already worry about the northward spread of Islamic militancy and opium if the departure of NATO from Afghanistan leads to Taliban resurgence and state collapse. Rather than a fairytale struggle between the people and a dictator, they see a potentially explosive religious conflict between Syria's ruling Alawis (close to Shi'a Islam) and majority Sunnis. The zeal with which rulers of the Gulf states and some in Washington call for al-Assad's ouster seems part of a broader project to isolate Iran, Syria's ally. Still, unless al-Assad manages to decisively defeat his opposition in short order, the Russians are likely to soften their position -- not because of moral arguments, but simply because they do not want to end up on the losing side. If they alienate al-Assad's successors, the very interests they seek to protect could be in jeopardy. Russian Foreign Secretary Sergei Lavrov hinted at a shift on January 31, saying: ""We are not friends or allies of President Assad."" Picking the perfect moment to dump a congenial dictator is never easy -- consider Washington's contortions over Hosni Mubarak in Egypt and the French embarrassment over their late coddling of Gadhafi. Walking out too soon risks alarming other allies. Waiting too long creates the image that one is both reactionary and out of touch. The Kremlin's policymakers are hardly adept at this, and certainly may wait too long. So far, they believe al-Assad still has a reasonable chance of survival. If his prospects dim -- as seems likely --some minor rephrasing of the U.N. resolution will likely be enough to satisfy Russian concerns and bring them on board. Follow CNN Opinion on Twitter .

"(CNN) -- Tiger Woods sizzled at the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational. With the season's final major a week away, his timing is good. Woods equaled his career-best round on the PGA Tour and matched his own course record in Ohio by shooting a 61, hitting an eagle, seven birdies and not dropping a shot. He also shot a nine-under-par 61 in the second round of the tournament in 2000 -- the year he outclassed his rivals and claimed three majors. But Woods hasn't won a major in five years now, stuck on 14, and struggled on the final day of the British Open last month when he was in contention. The Bridgestone Invitational was the world No. 1's first tournament since Muirfield, and he began with an impressive 66. He bettered that on Friday at a tournament he has captured seven times, beginning with a birdie, eagle and birdie to set the tone. Woods shot the first nine in 30. ""I just let the round build from there,"" Woods said in a television interview aired by Sky Sports. ""I made a couple of key putts for pars. Things like that happen today."" The back nine started just as well, with Woods registering four straight birdies. He was nine under through 13 holes. With a sub 60 round in his sights, though, Woods shot at par the rest of the way, narrowly missing a birdie on the 17th but then avoiding a bogey on the 18th with a stunning putt. He leads defending champion Keegan Bradley and England's Chris Wood by seven shots. ""It put me in a nice position going into the weekend,"" said Woods. The last time Woods shot a 61 at any tournament was at the 2005 Buick Open. Before looking ahead to the PGA Championship, Woods was focusing on finishing the job at the Bridgestone Invitational. Thunderstorms are expected Saturday. ""We got a long way to go,"" said Woods. ""The golf course will be certainly a lot different than it is now with the weather coming in so we're going to have to make a few adjustments and see how it goes."" British Open winner Phil Mickelson was tied for 43rd. The slumping Rory McIlroy was tied for 25th alongside U.S. Open winner Justin Rose, 14 shots behind Woods. Park eight shots behind at St. Andrews . At the women's British Open at St. Andrews in Scotland, meanwhile, Inbee Park has work to do if she wants to become the first golfer in 83 years to claim four majors in a single season. Through two rounds on the Old Course, Park trails fellow South Korean Na Yeon Choi by eight shots after registering a 1-over-par 73 in blustery conditions. She is tied for 22nd. ""A little bit of everything wasn't really working well out there today,"" Park told reporters. ""I think I grinded (it out) really well out there. ""I was a bit unlucky with the draw, getting afternoon today, not playing in the morning when it's lovely."" Choi, last year's U.S. Open winner, leads Japan's Miki Saiki by a shot, with overnight leader Morgan Pressel of the U.S. a further shot behind.","Tiger Woods shoots a 61 at the Bridgestone Invitational to match his career best round .

"(CNN) -- I remember when I was 10 or 11 years old, our Boys and Girls Club director, Billy Thomas, displayed school pennants sent to him by former club members who had gone off to college. I looked up at all those university names and emblems and thought, ""If I work hard and graduate from high school, anything is possible."" The staff at our club in Mount Vernon, New York, insisted that we take our education seriously. Today's kids desperately need that same motivation. As an alumnus of Boys and Girls Clubs and the organization's national spokesman for 18 years, I am deeply concerned about the well-being of our nation's young people. With so many serious issues facing America, we sometimes look past our most basic responsibility as a society: to care for our young. As Proverbs states: ""Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not depart from it."" For too many youth in our country today, that ""training"" is either missing or insufficient. My time at the Boys and Girls Club made an incredible difference in my life. The club gave me the confidence to succeed and to change the course of my life. Mentors like Billy Thomas told me I could do anything I wanted to do. That sounds like a simple thing, but as a kid I wasn't hearing that a lot. They gave me the positive support that I needed. Billy Thomas was far more than a staff person. He gave me that push that I'll always credit with making the difference in my life. I look back now and think about all the time after school that I spent at the club. I started there when I was just 6 and stayed for 12 years. Many of the boys I grew up with -- friends who didn't take advantage of the opportunities the club offered -- ended up in trouble with the law and spent many years in prison. No single snapshot better illustrates the dilemma our country faces than the high school dropout crisis: . -- One-third of America's children do not graduate from high school. That percentage jumps to 40, 50, even 60 percent in many urban and low-income neighborhoods. -- Nationally, 1.3 million students in the Class of 2010 failed to graduate, giving the United States the dubious distinction of being the only industrialized country where young people are less likely than their parents to obtain a high school diploma. The cost to our nation in unrealized potential, and more immediate social ills such as crime, violence, substance abuse and teen pregnancy, is staggering. Many discussions and debates on the state of education in America are taking place and these must continue. But I firmly believe another piece of the education equation is often overlooked -- specifically the role of youth development and mentorship during those unsupervised hours when kids aren't at school or at home, both during the school year and the summer months. We need to reframe the education discussion by adding the out-of-school experience to the equation. Quality time spent with children during the nonschool hours -- including summer break -- builds character, encourages good health habits and increases academic performance. The most profound impact is the eventual outcome -- young people equipped with the attitude, confidence and motivation to finish high school, prepared to succeed beyond. Boys and Girls Clubs of America is making a major commitment to attack the dropout crisis. The organization's graduation strategy -- Every Member, Every Year -- aims to ensure that every Club member advances to the next grade level on time each year. Club staff members do this by emphasizing the importance of education and high school graduation, recognizing academic successes, and reinforcing those habits and skills needed to be successful in school. We can identify young people who are at risk of dropping out and use one-on-one intervention and close collaboration with teachers to help that student develop the academic, emotional and social skills necessary to achieve academic success. We have already seen dramatic evidence that an emphasis on academic success, good character and citizenship, and healthy lifestyles works. Nine out of 10 of our club members graduate from high school or obtain a GED, according to a Harris Survey of club alumni. Nearly two-thirds said that club staff contributed to their success in high school. The question people often ask is ""What can I do to make a difference?"" My answer is that people can help based on their ability. Some can give money. Some can give products or services. Some, like me, can give their time. They can offer their unique skills or experience to make an important difference in a child's life. It doesn't have to be a huge commitment of time. Imagine the good we could do if each of us volunteered just an hour or two a week. I recently met with President Obama and thanked him for supporting our efforts and for continuing to inspire and encourage America's young people to pursue great futures. While the president's support is significant, all of our efforts will be needed if we are to reverse the falling graduation rate before we lose another generation of students. But reverse it we must. Our country's future depends on it. Billy Thomas worked for the Mount Vernon Boys and Girls Club for more than 22 years. Surely you can give some of your time as well.

"London, England (CNN) -- Greenpeace protesters briefly shut down BP stations across London on Tuesday, after the oil company announced its second-quarter results, BP and Greenpeace said. Greenpeace said it had shut down 46 stations, but BP said the number was 40. The protesters dropped off a letter at each station in the morning and, on their way out, pulled a safety switch that cut off power to the station, BP and Greenpeace said. They also covered BP signs with posters reading, ""Closed: Moving beyond petroleum,"" a take on BP's slogan. Most of the stations were operating again by the afternoon and the rest were expected to reopen by the evening, BP said. One of the stations supplied ambulances, BP said. The affected stations were a mix of company-owned and dealer-owned, BP said. Greenpeace said it simply targeted stations that sell BP gas. Asked about targeting stations that may be owned by individuals or businesses other than BP, Greenpeace spokeswoman Beth Herzfeld said they ""don't want to make anybody suffer."" ""We're sorry for any problems that are caused, but the petrol that are sold in these businesses are BP,"" she told CNN. ""BP is determined to chase the last drops of oil, whatever the cost to the natural environment and people's health."" Herzfeld said Greenpeace was aware that one of the targeted stations supplies ambulances, but she said the group was directing emergency vehicles to other non-BP stations nearby. ""We're very careful and very keen to make sure that nobody's safety is compromised,"" she said. The protests came after BP unveiled a massive $17.15 billion loss in the second quarter due to costs stemming from the Gulf of Mexico oil disaster. The oil company said it took a pre-tax charge of $32.2 billion in the quarter to cover costs relating to the oil spill. It also announced its embattled Chief Executive Officer Tony Hayward will step down on October 1, following fierce criticism of the way he has handled the disaster. CNN's Kendra Petersen and Caroline Paterson contributed to this report.","Greenpeace protesters shut down BP stations in London .

"(CNN) -- Nobody's perfect. And despite generally strong reviews and record early sales, the iPhone 4S is no exception. Apple's new phone went on sale Friday in the U.S. and six other countries, and maybe no rollout this massive (Apple reported selling 4 million of the new phones over the weekend) could be expected to be without problems. So far, there's been no 4S equivalent to the iPhone 4's ""Antennagate."" But as folks put their new gadget through its paces, some early complaints have appeared on online message boards. Some of these may be early-run blips (that's how we're going to categorize the problems that some customers had activating their phones over the weekend). Whether they become enduring causes of headaches remains to be seen. (Apple did not immediately respond to our request for comment.) But here are five of the most frequent complaints we've heard about the iPhone 4S: . 1. Slow service on Sprint . The big news on the carrier front for the iPhone 4S was that Sprint would be added as an approved mobile carrier, joining AT&T and Verizon. But some Sprint customers didn't get off to a very good start. Many users were reporting slow data speed for the first couple of days. A thread on the Sprint community forum has 23 pages of people talking about slow data speed. ""Sprint, we need some answer. Are you guys doing iPhone specific throttling?"" one person posted. ""You will lose your customer if the customer finding their iPhone unusable ... "" This isn't the first time Sprint's speed has come into question. In PCMag's June survey of the fastest mobile networks, Sprint trailed Verizon and AT&T in most regions of the country. A Sprint news release said Friday was the biggest sales day of a mobile device in its history, surpassing expectations. ""As always, Sprint is carefully monitoring the performance of the 3G network,"" Sprint spokesman Scott Sloat said in a written statement to CNN. ""We are looking into a small number of reports of slow data speeds when using the iPhone 4S, however there are also reports showing that Sprint's network is the fastest, such as the Gizmodo report that came out earlier today."" 2. Weak battery . At the October 4 presentation unveiling the iPhone 4S, Phil Schiller , Apple vice president for product management, praised its ""fantastic battery life"" that would allow people to talk for eight hours before needing to charge the device again. But that's not the experience everyone is reporting. Apple review site iLounge published a review of the phone, including battery-life comparisons. ""After three days of non-stop testing, we had a clear answer: The iPhone 4S is generally more power hungry than the iPhone 4, and Apple has only made the slightest capacity improvement to the iPhone 4S's battery,"" the review reads. ""Moreover, whereas Apple underpromised with the iPhone 4's battery estimates, it comes closer to overpromising with the iPhone 4S."" The review says that using Wi-Fi consistently and using the phone mainly for calls and Web browsing wears the battery out at roughly the same speed as the iPhone 4, while playing videos and music or using a 3G connection will drain it faster. 3. Siri outside the United States . Demand for the iPhone 4S was clearly global. But one of its biggest selling-points, the built-in voice assistant Siri, only works fully stateside. While many of its built-in features work anywhere, location based actions don't. So, using Siri to, say, find a local business or get driving directions, doesn't work elsewhere. Even queries asking for the time of day weren't working in Canada, according to some reports. Compounding that problem (for some folks both inside and outside the U.S.) is the fact that Siri has trouble understanding heavy accents. It currently works with English, French and German (with more languages coming). But non-native English speakers have reported lots of trouble. We can only imagine how Siri's doing in Scotland. 4. Camera problems . Another big selling point for the 4S is its 8-megapixel camera, which is a pretty significant jump from the 5 megapixels on the iPhone 4 and 3 megapixels on the iPhone 3GS. Reviews of the images the phone renders have been overwhelmingly positive, with users reporting a major difference in clarity. But the same ""shutter speed"" issues users have complained about on previous iPhones appear to be back again. In a forum discussion on Apple's site, some reported that when they'd take a photo, the camera got stuck with the shutter closed or moved really slowly. Others said the camera wasn't working at all, although it looks like they were largely able to fix that by turning the phone off and restarting. 5. Screen appearance . At least it looks like there's an easy answer for this one. Some buyers are reporting a yellowish tint or spots on the screen of their phones, making the resolution fuzzier than older phones. This is an issue that previous iPhones had as well. While Apple has never officially explained it (presumably because it hasn't impacted enough people), technicians have reportedly said it's residue from the manufacturing process. The tint tends to fade after a couple of days.","The iPhone 4S has been massively popular, but there have been some complaints .
Some Sprint customers have griped about slow data speeds .
Tests show that the 4S battery life, in some instances, is weaker than the iPhone 4's .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A sudden surge of pirate attacks off the coast of eastern Somalia in recent days has prompted the U.S. military to put out a new alert to mariners, warning of increased danger in the region. International naval patrols have been stepped up in the Gulf of Aden following increased pirate attacks. The warning came shortly before a U.S.-flagged ship was believed hijacked early Wednesday off Somalia. The pirate attacks, which took place south of the area patrolled by U.S. and coalition ships, shows pirates are changing their tactics and taking advantage of tens of thousands of square miles of open water where fewer military ships patrol, according to U.S. military officials. ""They [pirates] are going where we are not, they are looking for targets where there is limited coalition presence,"" according to a U.S. military briefing document shown to CNN. Coalition ships mainly patrol in the busy sea lanes of the Gulf of Aden between Yemen and northern Somalia as ships come out of and head toward the mouth of the Red Sea. ""Despite increased naval presence in the region, ships and aircraft are unlikely to be close enough to provide support to vessels under attack. The scope and magnitude of the problem cannot be understated,"" according to a news release from the U.S. Navy. Between January and February, only two pirate attacks were reported off the east coast of Somalia, according to the International Maritime Bureau, which tracks piracy attacks worldwide. In March, attacks in the same area spiked to 15, according to the bureau, and the attacks have continued into April. On Monday, pirates seized a British-owned cargo ship in the Gulf of Aden. Also on Monday, a fishing trawler was hijacked and used to hijack other fishing vessels in the area, the bureau said. Pirates typically use small boats with a limited range to attack ships just a few miles off the coastline. The new warning says recent attacks have occurred hundreds of miles off the coast, suggesting that pirates are using more ""mother ships"" -- a practice of using bigger boats with longer range to launch smaller pirate ships from farther out to sea, according to Pentagon officials. The U.S. Department of Transportation's Maritime Liaison Office also issued a warning to mariners April 1. ""Recent activity suggests that pirate activity off the east coast of Somalia has increased. Attacks have occurred more than 400 nautical miles offshore,"" according to the warning. The warning suggests ships traveling along the coast of Somalia and Kenya move to the east side of the Seychelles Islands and Madagascar, hundreds of miles east of those coastlines. Pentagon officials say pirates are holding 15 ships off the Somali coast. And according to U.S. Navy statistics, pirates attacked four ships between Saturday and Monday. The area involved -- off the coast of Somalia and Kenya as well as the Gulf of Aden -- equals more than 1.1 million square miles, roughly four times the size of Texas, or the size of the Mediterranean and Red Sea combined. The length of the Somali coastline is roughly the same length as the entire Eastern Seaboard of the United States, according to U.S. Navy statistics. ""We continue to highlight the importance of preparation by the merchant mariners and the maritime industry in this message,"" Vice Adm. Bill Gortney, commander of the Combined Maritime Forces, said in a statement. ""International naval forces alone will not be able to solve the problem of piracy at sea. Piracy is a problem that starts ashore,"" he said. This year, the U.S. Navy started Combined Task Force 151, a multinational coalition that uses naval ships to fight piracy in the Gulf of Aden region. Navy officials say about 12 to 15 coalition ships are patrolling in the Gulf of Aden and the off the coast of Somalia.","NEW: U.S.-flagged ship carrying Americans reportedly hijacked off Somalia .

"(CNN) -- The ""mommy wars"" that have cropped up repeatedly this campaign season are a figment of political pundits' imagination. The most recent example, of course, was the political and media tempest that followed Democratic strategist Hilary Rosen's comment that Ann Romney, Mitt Romney's wife and a mother of five, had not ""worked a day in her life."" Many made political hay with the remark. The truth is most women aren't fighting about this. They know that work is involved to make everyday life happen: the feeding, and clothing and caring for oneself and one's family, whether earning the money to buy the clothes and food, or being at home, washing those clothes or cooking dinner. All mothers work, nearly all of the time. And so do many fathers. But there is a serious issue hidden in the silliness of the alleged mommy wars, and it is the contradictory, conflicting beliefs we have about the value of taking time to care for other people. Who should take care of young people and their grandparents, and how should they be rewarded? We claim to value families, but we don't really value what it takes to care for them. Let me give you some examples: . Contradiction #1: Everyone seems to agree that women and men should have equal rights. But when was the last time you heard someone say that a man should make fatherhood a ""career""? It is true today that sometimes, men do become stay-at-home dads, but even in the consciously feminist families I wrote about in my book, ""Gender Vertigo,"" men share the ""work"" of raising their children; I didn't interview one man who described fatherhood as a career. And it took me a long time to find couples that really shared the work equally. There are blogs to help parents equally share the work (like Marc and Amy Vachon's blog), but if parenting is truly the socially valued career choice that politicians on both sides of the political spectrum claim, why do so few men identify fatherhood as their primary career? Contradiction #2: Everyone seems to agree that parenting involves sophisticated emotional and psychological skills and not merely grunt work. But if people truly believe that, why does Stanford sociologist Shelley Correll and her colleagues find time and time again that mothers are discriminated against in hiring and promotions? Contradiction #3: Everyone seems to agree that America supports ""family values."" But research published in this month's American Sociological Review shows that women who breast-feed for six months or more pay a mommy penalty in wages for the rest of their lives because of the lack of work policies that protect employed women's right to breast-feed on the job. Why doesn't the U.S. institute the same protections for women's right to breast-feed as other Western industrial countries? Contradiction #4: Everyone seems to agree that when women married to men of means choose to be stay-at-home moms, they are doing so for the good of their children. But when poor women, without access to first-rate child care, choose to stay home with their babies, we tend to call them lazy welfare mothers. Our social policy of providing only very ""temporary assistance to needy families"" comes with the built-in insistence that they take personal responsibility for their children, meaning they should get themselves a low-wage job, often with no choice but to leave their children in less than optimal child care. Sociologist Mirra Komarovsky pointed out these contradictions back in 1953. She argued back then that if society truly believed caretaking was an important and difficult job, nursery school teachers would rate a salary at least equal to the beginning salary of a street cleaner. Not much has changed since then. As Stephanie Coontz, a historian and co-chair of the Council on Contemporary Families, told me: ""It's time for politicians to stop competing over the women's votes and start competing over who has the best programs to support all parents, whatever their employment status or their gender."" Why all these contradictions? Because we have a society in flux. We have inherited both workplace cultures and beliefs from a time in our past when successful men had wives to take care of their homes and children. Workplaces got two employees for the price of one, the husband and his domestic wife. Unions fought for ""family wages"" so working-class men could benefit from women's household work as well. That's not the world we live in today. Now, for better or worse, most mothers of young children -- married and single -- work both inside and outside their homes. Their workplaces, and our cultural conversation full of contradictions, has lagged far behind. Let's call a truce on the fictional mommy wars and start a war on workplaces that don't allow mommies and daddies to live full lives, on the job and at home. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Barbara J. Risman.","Barbara Risman: ""Mommy wars"" are cooked up by politicians and media, not everyday women .
She says women know well the conflicts society presents them over value of their work .

"San Diego (CNN) -- Some elections are fueled by passion. Others are guided by a sense of urgency. This one seems to be driven by ambivalence. That is where we're at as we near Tuesday's Iowa caucuses, the kickoff to the voting portion of the 2012 election. According to the polls in the Hawkeye State, Ron Paul and Mitt Romney are virtually tied for the lead, each with no more than a quarter of the vote. A new CNN/Time/ORC poll finds that Romney has 25% and Paul has 22%, with Rick Santorum, Newt Gingrich and Rick Perry each in the teens. GOP officials would like to convince Americans that they have an embarrassment of riches on their hands, but many of us can see that they're only half right. It's just an embarrassment. A big part of the Republicans' problem is having a ""front-runner"" who can't seem to get out in front. Many voters feel as if the choice has already been made for them, and they're not having any of it. On a recent trip to Washington, I was reminded again that the inside-the-Beltway media and the Republican establishment have ordained Romney the party's presidential nominee and all but declared that the voting is just a formality. Yet, someone forgot to tell the voters, who elevate one candidate after another from the ""anybody but Romney"" pile while keeping the former Massachusetts governor trapped under a 25% ceiling in the polls. As recently noted by The Wall Street Journal, a recent Gallup poll of Republicans put support for Romney at 24%, and last month, his level of support floated between 22% and 25%. It's hard to see how Romney could cobble together a string of second-place finishes, with a possible win in New Hampshire, and wind up as a credible contender for the general election. And even if he does somehow wind up being the nominee, it's even harder to imagine that the more than three-fourths of Republicans who were thoroughly uninspired by him just a few months earlier would suddenly get excited enough to turn out and vote. In fact, even in this late hour, Republican thought leaders such as William Kristol, publisher of the Weekly Standard, are still suggesting that another Republican candidate could enter the race. That is not likely to happen, but the fact that some people would like it to tells us a lot about a level of dissatisfaction with the current crop of GOP prospects. The grass isn't any greener for Democrats. While they have the advantage of knowing who their nominee will be, they also have to contend with the same difficult task that the Republicans face: energizing the base to support the candidate. Many of those who voted for Barack Obama in 2008 don't seem all that eager to give him an encore. He lost much of his support from independents early on, but he also has an enthusiasm gap developing with liberals who think the president lacks courage and caves in to Republicans too easily. According to a new poll by the Salt Lake Tribune, while most Democrats want to re-elect Obama, one in five of them aren't so sure. Just 37% of those surveyed -- Republicans, Democrats and independents --- are certain they want to give Obama another term. And, despite all the campaigning up to this point, nearly 20% of voters are still undecided about whom to support. To be re-elected, Obama needs to recapture the support of two groups of voters: young people and Latinos. Unfortunately for Democrats, he's not doing a good job of inspiring either. Both groups still support Obama, and they certainly prefer him to every possible Republican alternative. The problem is the same kind of enthusiasm gap that Romney is facing with Republican voters. While 18-to-29 year-old Americans remain solidly in the Democratic camp, only 49% of them approve of Obama's job performance, according to a survey by the Pew Research Center. That's a 23 point drop since February 2009. Something similar is happening with Latino voters, many of whom are deeply disillusioned -- even wounded -- by Obama's broken promise to fix the immigration system combined with his heavy-handed deportation policies that have resulted in the removal of more than 1.2 million people in less than three years. According to a new Ipsos-Telemundo poll, the president's support among Latinos continues to plummet. In April 2009, 86% of Latinos approved of Obama's job performance. Today, it's only about 56%. According to an analysis done by Ipsos, that drop suggests that, ""the disillusion among Latinos is more pronounced than among the general public."" Add all this up, and this could be an election with one of the lowest turnouts in history -- for Republicans and Democrats. Voters are sending a message that both parties need to heed: ""Don't just tell me I need to vote for your candidate. Give me something worth voting for."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette Jr.","Ruben Navarrette: We're about to see the start of the voting for Election 2012 .
He says voters in both parties are ambivalent about the choices .

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- The Thai capital is on edge Wednesday as police brace for demonstrations over a bill to be presented in parliament that would grant amnesty to people jailed for acts committed during outbursts of political unrest in recent years. Concerns over the protests have prompted the government to invoke special temporary security measures to prevent demonstrators from entering certain areas of Bangkok, including a zone around the parliament building. Authorities deployed thousands of police officers equipped with riot gear Wednesday to seal off the areas. Proposed by a lawmaker from the governing Pheu Thai party, the controversial bill would absolve protesters charged, prosecuted, and convicted for acts against the state since the military coup in September 2006 that brought down former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra. Most of those convicted are members of the ""Red Shirt"" movement that supported Thaksin. His sister, Yingluck Shinawatra, is the current prime minister of Thailand. The groups organizing demonstrations in opposition to the bill say they fear it could set the stage for Thaksin's return from exile. Thaksin left Thailand in 2008 after he was convicted of conflict of interest charges. He was sentenced in absentia to two years in prison. Tensions between pro- and anti-Thaksin groups reflect deep divisions in Thai society that erupted into violence in 2010. Protests by the Red Shirts against the government at the time led to a military crackdown during which more than 90 people were killed and hundreds were injured. Worachai Hema, the lawmaker from Yingluck's party who has proposed the amnesty bill, says it aims to help people who were unfairly prosecuted for expressing their political views. But human rights organizations have warned that the bill could absolve people who ordered or carried out abuses. ""The ruling party's amnesty bill lets both soldiers and militants responsible for deaths during the 2010 upheaval off the hook,"" said Brad Adams, Asia director at the advocacy group Human Rights Watch.","Thousands of police officers are deployed in Bangkok .

"Cairo (CNN) -- The controversial Qatari TV network Al Jazeera has bought Current TV, gaining access to millions more U.S. viewers and taking a major step forward in cracking the longed-for U.S. market. The move is the network's crowning achievement in the U.S. after years struggling to be accepted in the wake of the September 11, 2001 attacks, when Al Jazeera was vilified by the Bush administration for broadcasting the notorious Osama bin Laden videos and other anti-American material. Read more: Once called 'terror network,' Al Jazeera America dares to enter U.S. cable market . But following the U.S. military withdrawal from Iraq, U.S. relations with the channel improved. Recently Al Jazeera's English-language channel has won several prestigious industry awards, as well as plaudits from senior U.S. policy-makers such as Hillary Clinton. The New York Times reports that Al Jazeera paid $500 million for Current TV, a huge sum by TV industry standards and a big investment at a time when many rival news networks are cutting back on news bureaus and staff. But it's peanuts when one remembers that the man behind the network, the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, is sitting on one of the world's fastest-growing economies and the world's third largest gas reserves. From his point of view, rehabilitating Al Jazeera's image in America was never going to come cheaply and at least now Al Jazeera can access more of the highly lucrative U.S. cable TV market. But this was never about the money. Qatar's priority is drumming up international support in case of another major crisis in the Gulf region that threatens its wealth and independence, like for example a war with Iran or an imploding Saudi Arabia. Having studied at Britain's Sandhurst Military College and spent years as Qatar's minister of defense the emir knows that military defense of his tiny country is impossible. The U.S. is Qatar's ultimate security guarantee and any chance to buy trust with the American people represents an excellent opportunity to secure his country's future further. Compared to the tens of billions his neighbors spend on U.S. arms, the influence afforded by Al Jazeera represents very good value for money. Another important aim behind developing Al Jazeera in the U.S. is to try and present a different, more positive image of Arabs and Islam generally to Americans than the one they are used to seeing. The emir is proudly Arab and Muslim, just like Al Jazeera, and the channel sends a clear message to the West that there is more to the Arab world than terrorism, religious extremism and oil-rich slobs. Whether the wider U.S. public will buy into this vision however or indeed watch the new channel at all remains to be seen. Al Jazeera sets its sights on America . Given the popularity of Al Jazeera English among Americans already, the channel evidently has many American fans besides Hillary Clinton. But as a rule the wider U.S. audience is not very interested in foreign affairs, even without the complication of associations with terrorism and the wrong kind of political Islam. Even closely related foreign broadcasters, like the BBC, have had trouble getting a toehold in the popular U.S. TV market, let alone Qatari ones. What makes Al Jazeera different and gives it its competitive edge in the U.S. is its perspective on foreign affairs, its freedom to operate, and its enormous financial resources. Al Jazeera's English output has a much freer rein than many other news channels, including many western ones. Even the flagship Al Jazeera Arabic TV service, which has a much stronger political impact in the region as it broadcasts in Arabic, has to temper its coverage of the Gulf region on occasions when there is a conflict with other Qatari interests. Lots of state-sponsored channels broadcast news channels around the world, mostly from the U.S. and Europe in the direction of the ""Global South."" But Al Jazeera English, and soon Al Jazeera America, broadcast in the opposite direction, will give quite a different perspective on events to U.S. news channels, especially when it comes to Arab affairs. In particular Al Jazeera's reporting on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is both more in depth and in line with the rest of the world's thinking than that usually found on U.S. TV. Al Jazeera America will reportedly focus on U.S. current affairs, but as in Canada where Al Jazeera was effectively shut down by pro-Israeli groups, future controversy over this issue is to be expected and there will undoubtedly be many more hurdles for the network ahead. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Hugh Miles.","Qatari TV network Al Jazeera buys Current TV, gaining access to millions more U.S. viewers .

"(CNN) -- Police departments in Chicago and New York are trading barbs after a federal judge ruled that New York City's stop-and-frisk policy was unconstitutional. ""Welcome to Chicago,"" a Bronx police officer told the New York Post after the ruling, insinuating that crime rates in New York would approach those of the embattled Midwestern city as a result of the ruling, which mandated changes to stop-and-frisk. Officials in Chicago responded by defending their city's reputation and taking a shot at New York's recent judicial defeat. ""We had significantly less crime, significantly fewer shootings and fewer murders of any year since 1965 without imposing on the right of our residents,"" said Adam Collins, the spokesman for the Chicago Police Department. ""We don't engage in racial profiling."" Names of innocent erased from records . A judge ruled Monday that the NYPD's stop-and-frisk program was unconstitutional and it had been disproportionately used on black and Hispanic citizens. Chicago has its own controversial law enforcement policy called ""contact cards."" Under the contact card policy, police can stop individuals and demand information such as name, phone number and the disclosure of any tattoos. However, under the policy, officers do not make physical contact with the individual in question. Despite the controversies, both cities have seen significant reduction in crime. In 2013, Chicago became the center of a national discussion on hand gun violence when there were more than 500 killings in the city. More than a decade earlier, in 1990, there were more than 2000 slayings in New York in that single calendar year. Both cities have seen more than a 25% reduction in homicides and in shootings in 2013 and are on pace for less than 400 murders for the year. As for what started the whole war of words, ""I'll leave any further opinions on that to other folks,"" Collins said. New York Police Department officials did not respond to CNN's request for comment.","Chicago officers not amused by New York officer's barbs .

"(CNN) -- Witnessing the gruesome devastation of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan in August 1945--68 years ago this week-- the physicists who worked on the Manhattan Project were aghast at the scale of damage their work had wrought. Both cities were obliterated and several tens of thousands of people died instantly. Soon after those atom bombs were dropped, the press, with information scarce, chased after an Austrian physicist who was instrumental in discovering nuclear fission, then working as an exile in Sweden. She was Lise Meitner, and they anointed her the ""Jewish mother of the bomb."" This was far from the truth. She was so opposed to using fission to create an atom bomb that when offered the opportunity to work on the Manhattan Project, she flatly refused. Her refusal arose from a strong revulsion: ""I will have nothing to do with a bomb."" Prescient, as she was, she foresaw the power of fission to unleash untold damage and suffering. Still, the myth persisted. Meitner was born into an enlightened Viennese Jewish family. Unusually for the time, her father strongly supported her education and interest in physics. With a doctorate in physics from the University of Vienna in 1906, she studied under Ludwig Boltzmann and went on to work with Max Planck in Berlin. In May 1938, working at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Chemistry in Berlin, Meitner, Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann discovered that the uranium atom could be split when bombarded by neutrons. They expected this to produce new elements heavier than uranium. At this critical juncture in their work, Meitner had to flee Hitler's Germany, and her participation in the scientific collaboration was cut short. She ended up in Sweden. Later that year, Hahn and Strassman found a puzzling development and shared it with her -- instead of finding a heavier nucleus as one of the byproducts of fission, they detected a lighter one: barium. Meitner and her physicist nephew, Otto Frisch, solved the puzzle by figuring out that the radioactive decay of one of the unstable products of fission had produced stable barium. Meitner's work, along with that of Hahn and Strassman, laid the groundwork for the nuclear bomb. But it was Enrico Fermi and his research group in Chicago in 1942 that made the bomb a reality, by setting up a self-sustaining chain reaction. But soon after Hiroshima and Nagasaki were flattened, the international media hounded Meitner with questions. The newspaper Stockholm Expressen ran an article headlined ""Fleeing Jewess,"" which described her escape from Germany with the secret of the bomb and its handover to the Allies. According to Meitner's recent biographer, Ruth Lewin Sime, the Fleeing Jewess myth started with an article written in 1940 for the Saturday Evening Post by William L. Laurence, the official chronicler of the Manhattan project. His dramatic piece read like a juicy spy novel--from the genesis of the idea of fission, to Meitner's escape from Germany, to her sharing her work with her nephew Frisch, in Copenhagen. Frisch supposedly cabled it to Niels Bohr, who in turn passed it on to scientists in America. Suddenly, the unverified 1940 story turned Lise Meitner into the ""Jewish mother of the bomb."" Not only did she not work on the bomb, she had converted in 1906 to Protestantism. The stories upset her greatly, and she set the record straight during her visit to the United States in 1946. Speaking to Jay Walz of The New York Times, she stressed her support for the peaceful uses of atomic energy. While journalists gave her a starring role in the bomb, she was not credited with the scientific discovery of fission by the Nobel Committee, which awarded the prize to Hahn alone, in chemistry. Debate has continued on whether she was yet another of those invisible women who should have won a Nobel. She finally received recognition when President Lyndon Johnson awarded her, Hahn and Strassman the Enrico Fermi Award in 1966, and the element with atomic number 109 was named Meitnerium in her honor in 1997. When I met the wife of her nephew Otto Frisch at a dinner in Trinity College Cambridge 10 years ago, she talked lovingly of Lise the person and told me that her epitaph read, appropriately, ""Lise Meitner: a physicist who never lost her humanity."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Priyamvada Natarajan.","Priyamvada Natarajan: Atom bombs obliterated Nagasaki and Hiroshima in August 1945 .

"(CNN) -- The death toll rose to 75 Sunday on Brazil's southeast coast after three days of torrential rains unleashed a series of deadly mudslides, an emergency official said. Dozens of people were killed when a large part of a mountain collapsed as mud Friday, sliding into the upscale Sankay Inn resort in Angra dos Reis, two hours west of Rio de Janeiro. More than 3 inches of rain has accumulated in Rio's western regions since the end of last week, according to Geo-Rio, the state official weather forecast center. Brazilian forecasters are predicting more rain to come in Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo. Angra dos Reis is a popular destination for wealthy vacationers and celebrities, many of whom were spending New Year's in the resort town. According to local reports, the 24-year-old son of French President Nicolas Sarkozy was among the vacationers in the area this week. Pierre Sarkozy, 24, was staying at the home of Ivo Pitanguy, a top Brazilian plastic surgeon and a family friend, the reports said. The town is also home to one of Brazil's major nuclear plants -- the Central Nuclear Almirante Álvaro Alberto complex, managed by Electronuclear. Officials at the power plant denied reports they would shut down operations due to safety concerns raised by local officials. The inundations began Wednesday. Erosion caused by the deluge created a massive crack in the Rio-Santos Highway, forcing authorities to shut down the road Saturday night. Rio de Janeiro's  State Governor Sergio Cabral on Friday declared three days of mourning and ordered the state's civil defense rescue teams on duty round the clock. In the poorer suburbs of Rio de Janeiro's Zona Norte, several makeshift homes built on steep slopes fell victim to mudslides, leaving at least 350 people homeless, the officials said. In nearby Jacarepagua, rescuers carried three bodies of a family of four from the wreckage of their hilltop home after it was hit by a mudslide. CNN affiliate Record TV broadcast the rescuers' attempt to find the family's toddler, Mariana. After sifting through rubble, the rescuers heard her cries emanating from beneath the rubble, dug her out and carried her to safety amid cheers. But hours later, the television station reported that the girl had died. Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva told reporters he will send marine and naval forces to aid in rescues in remote coastal areas where more bodies were believed to be trapped.

"(CNN) -- Kieren Keke remembers growing up on the Pacific island of Nauru, the world's smallest independent republic. ""The weather patterns were predictable,"" he says. ""There was a wet season and a dry season, an annual cycle. When there was drought, it was limited."" ""Now it's different,"" he tells CNN. ""There's no predictability -- periods of drought can last seven or eight years, and when we get storms they are more intense. The coastline is being eroded. Now the sea is right up to people's doorsteps."" Keke is now foreign minister of Nauru, and leads the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) at the current U.N. Climate Change conference in Doha, Qatar. The Alliance is fighting a David-and-Goliath battle with the world's biggest polluters -- trying to shame them into tougher action to limit emissions and curb the warming of the planet. Read more: Project to turn desert green trials in Qatar . The 43 members of the Alliance include countries that are literally disappearing amid rising sea levels. And they accuse the likes of India, China and the United States of not addressing climate change with enough urgency. The Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change said in 2007 that sea levels would rise between seven and 23 inches (18 and 59 centimeters) this century, but a rate of ice-melt in the Arctic that is much faster than anticipated has prompted many scientists to raise the projection to about one meter, more than three feet. Among those most threatened are the Marshall Islands, halfway between Hawaii and Papua New Guinea. The highest point on the 29 atolls and five islands is 33 feet (10 meters) above sea level. The capital, Majuro, is just three feet above sea level and was inundated by high tides four years ago. Read more: Arab youth offers hope for Doha climate talks . ""Low-lying atolls across the Pacific are slowly vanishing,"" Keke says. In Nauru, too, people don't have many places to go. The island -- which on satellite imagery looks like a white pebble in the deep blue expanse of the Pacific -- is eight square miles (21 square kilometers) and has a population of some 10,000, almost all of whom live on the coastline. The highest point is 200 feet above sea level, but much of the interior has been ravaged by the effects of phosphate mining. And the nearest neighbors are some 180 miles (almost 300 kilometers) away. Keke says the Alliance wants the 190-odd delegations in Doha to ""ramp up their ambitions"" because current scientific projections about the warming planet will otherwise wipe out a number of low-lying states. But time is pressing. The Kyoto Protocol, the only binding international agreement on emissions, expires in less than four weeks. And the Doha conference is due to end later this week. Read more: Greenhouse gases reached record highs in 2011 . ""Some countries are ready to sign up for a second commitment period to Kyoto,"" which would last from 2013 to 2020, Keke says. Among them the European Union and Australia. But Canada, Russia and Japan are among governments that have already said they won't sign onto an extension of Kyoto, a stance that Keke says is ""very disappointing."" They are demanding that countries like China and India -- now the first and third emitters of greenhouse gases -- to be bound by new targets, along with the industrialized world. China and India, as developing nations, were excused from the commitment adopted at Kyoto by some 40 developed nations to cut their carbon emissions by 5% by this year, compared with the level in 1990. Measuring sea levels among the Pacific islands -- and trying to establish trends -- is complicated by the effects of the weather systems known as El Nino and La Nina, according to climatologists. But beyond the threat of higher sea levels, the warming climate produces more extreme storms, and more acidic water bleaches coral reefs. Then there are the fish. Many of these island states rely on fishing to survive and as a source of revenue, but as ocean temperatures warm, fish move. Tuna don't like it hot and swim toward cooler, nutrient-rich waters. A paper prepared this year by the Secretariat of the Pacific Community forecasts that currents and changes in water temperature will mean that ""tuna are likely to move progressively toward the east"" -- away from the islands of Oceania. ""Traditional food sources and ways of living will be at risk,"" Keke says. AOSIS is asking U.N. officials at Doha not to allow this conference -- the 17th since the Kyoto Protocol was adopted in 1997 -- to degenerate into a last-minute take-it-or-leave-it declaration, as have previous sessions of the U.N. Framework on Climate Change. But these conferences have a habit of coming to life only when the main players turn up in the final days, and past meetings have led to shallow agreements that revised the process of negotiation rather than established real commitments. Whether Doha will be much different, and whether Keke and his colleagues from the Alliance of Small Island States will see a glimpse of hope on the horizon, may become clearer by the end of this week. At present they don't sound very optimistic, releasing a statement Monday that reads: ""We begin the final week of negotiations in Doha with the sober recognition that time is running out to prevent the loss of entire nations and other calamities in our membership and around the world.""","Lands in the Alliance of Small Island States are disappearing amid rising sea levels .

"(CNN) -- With tanned shoulders and a wrinkled smile, Lam Tse-Sing has the easy demeanor of a guy who knows his job. For nearly 30 years, he has worked at the same open-air food stall in Hong Kong -- known as a dai pai dong -- flanked by open flames as he prepares dishes from fried rice to steamed clams. But Lam, now in his 50s, is one of the last examples of a dying Cantonese culinary tradition. Decades of urban transformation have decimated Hong Kong's throngs of dai pai dong, supplanting them with glitzy malls and big name eateries. According to vendors I spoke to, there were hundreds of dai pai dong in the 1960s. Today, there are just 28 left. It's a shame, says Lam. Modern restaurants have ""no culture, no taste."" Stalwarts stand firm . In Hong Kong's Central district where skyscrapers crowd out the surrounding sky, Lam's dai pai dong, named Sing Kee, retains a proud tradition of old-school street life. On a sweltering weeknight, I sit on a sticky blue plastic stool under a faded red umbrella. Patrons tuck into scrumptious dishes delivered by scrambling wait staff and the sound of hearty chatter mingles with the smell of cigarettes and kitchen grease. The key to dai pai dong-style cuisine, he tells me, is wok hei, a Cantonese phrase that literally translates to ""wok essence"" and refers to the distinctive flavor that can only be achieved from a sizzling wok. By using scorching flames, boiling hot oil and a fast, muscular stir-fry technique that launches the food airborne (Lam sometimes sautÃ©s two woks at once), the food is infused with a rich taste that evokes the brash old city. The stir-fried beef noodles (HK$48) are springy, slick and satisfyingly salty. The grouper filet and seasonal vegetable (HK$54) offer slippery bites of soft, savory fish and bok choy stir-fried al dente in a light sauce. They all have that home-cooked aroma that would send me running to the kitchen as a kid. The question is, will Hong Kong's future children be able to experience dai pai dong cooking? ""It all depends on the government,"" explains Lam. Lack of government support . For years, Hong Kong's administration has encouraged the decline of dai pai dong, which are viewed by some officials as fire hazards, health risks and public nuisances. According to vendors, the government has paid hundreds of dai pai dong owners to give up their licenses and no new licenses have been granted in decades. But locals say more should be done to preserve the tradition. ""The government should protect dai pai dong,"" said Yu Tse-Pang, 24, a cashier at a local dumpling restaurant. ""They're friendly, tasty, and cheap. My friends and I eat there all the time."" Lo Kwan-Sing, 81, agrees. ""I don't know any ordinary citizen who wouldn't support them. You get more choices and cheaper food. But if you're a rich guy who eats in hotels all the time, of course you wouldn't care."" Despite their popularity, dai pai dong face an uncertain future. Dai pai dong licenses may only be transferred to relatives, but vendors say their children have no interest in continuing the trade. ""They say this work is too difficult, the weather is too hot,"" says Lam. ""When I pass away, the next generation isn't going to take over."" Until then, Lam will continue doing what he does best. ""There aren't many places that still cook like we do,"" he says. ""But if you're someone who knows how to eat, then you'll know how to appreciate it.""

"(CNN) -- Tempestuous weather is striking the United States on four fronts. It seems as if Mother Nature is trying to throw much of the nation one extreme or another. Here's a roundup: . First tropical storm of the season? An area of ""disturbed weather"" in the Gulf of Mexico, off the Yucatan Peninsula, could bring heavy rain and flooding to the Florida Peninsula and the Georgia and Carolina coasts by Thursday, CNN meteorologist Sean Morris said. Morris says he'll be watching to see if the bad weather becomes the first tropical depression -- or even the first tropical storm -- of the 2013 Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to November 30. At a minimum, the storms could cause a lot of rainfall and flooding on the Florida Peninsula, he said. Fires . A 32,000-acre wildfire is burning some old-growth chaparral that lies in the western tip of the Mojave Desert in northern Los Angeles County. Firefighters have brought the Powerhouse Fire 60% under control, said Ed Gilliland of the U.S. Forest Service. Six homes have been destroyed, but conditions are safe enough to lift evacuation orders and allow people to return to the communities of Green Valley, Leona Valley, Elizabeth Lake and Lake Hughes, authorities said. Higher humidity and lower temperatures should help firefighters, Gilliland said. Added Morris: ""They aren't expecting gusty winds in that area, so the conditions should be favorable for the firefighters to gain some ground there, which they have been."" In New Mexico, a wildfire is burning nearly uncontrollably in the mountains at Pecos. The Tres Lagunas Fire is only 7% contained and has charred 8,500 acres, authorities said, adding that crews are trying to protect structures in Holy Ghost Canyon. Floods . The mighty Mississippi River is now at major flood stage in St. Louis, but the worst of it is over and waters will recede this week, Morris said. The river has risen to more than 10 feet above flood stage. Downriver, however, Cape Girardeau, Missouri, could face flooding as the surge moves downstream, Morris said. But the city will be the last along the river to face such a threat, because the river begins to widen south of there, Morris said. ""We're expecting Cape Girardeau to reach major flood stage tonight and crest at the end of the week,"" Morris said Tuesday. Crews in West Alton, Missouri -- a town just north of St. Louis where the Mississippi and Missouri rivers meet -- were reinforcing their levees with sandbags. The bridge to Alton, Illinois, was shut down after a temporary flood barricade failed. On Tuesday, the Mississippi breached a 100- to 150-foot section of the levee close to the confluence, and authorities have notified 43 homes, said Rivers Pointe Fire Chief Rick Pender in West Alton. Water has reportedly traveled two miles inside the levee. Tornado Alley . Still reeling from deadly twisters, Oklahoma faced a slight risk of thunderstorms Tuesday, but the good news is there's only a slight chance of an isolated tornado, Morris said. There is, however, a chance of large hail and damaging straight-line winds in northwest Oklahoma, he said. ""For most of the state, it's just a very slight risk of severe storms,"" Morris said. There is also a slight risk of severe weather for the southern half of Kansas, far northern Texas and southeast Colorado. Oklahoma's recent storms have killed 19 people, said Shanea Scully, administrative coordinator for the Oklahoma City Fire Department. The tornado that struck El Reno, Oklahoma, on May 31 was declared to be the widest in history, at 2.6 miles, and its damage rating was raised to EF5, the most severe, the National Weather Service announced Tuesday.","NEW: Mississippi River breaches levee near confluence with Missouri River .

"(CNN) -- Royal Caribbean Cruises cut short a seven-day Alaska cruise aboard its Celebrity Millennium and canceled four of the ship's upcoming trips because of a problem with the motor, a company spokeswoman said Wednesday. The Millennium was carrying 2,200 guests and 958 crew members when the motor experienced a ""technical issue"" Sunday, spokeswoman Cynthia Martinez said. The captain decided to return to port at Ketchikan, Alaska, to evaluate the problem, and the company ultimately decided to cancel the rest of the trip. ""It is important to note that the ship can sail at a reduced speed with only one motor,"" Martinez said. ""However, in an abundance of caution, we have decided to cancel the sailing and have the repairs made at the shipyard immediately. The safety of our guests and crew is always our highest priority."" Millennium left Vancouver, British Columbia, Friday and was due to make stops at the Alaskan ports of Juneau and Skagway before ending in Seward in two days. Several charter flights have already departed Ketchikan to take passengers back to the Pacific Northwest, Martinez said. The company canceled cruises departing on the following dates: . August 23, 2013 -- from Seward to Vancouver . August 30, 2013 -- from Vancouver to Seward . September 6, 2013 -- from Seward to Vancouver . September 13, 2013 -- from Vancouver to San Diego, California . Passengers booked on the canceled cruises will receive a full refund and a certificate for a future Celebrity cruise, the company said.

"Jinan, China (CNN) -- With the hotel front desk clerk busy checking me in, her co-worker picked up the ringing phone. ""Do we have any foreign journalists staying here?"" she repeated the question being asked at the other end of the phone. ""No,"" she replied, before the clerk helping me threw her a look. ""Oh yes, three just got here."" With the local authorities now presumably alerted to our presence, any hope we had of maintaining a low profile at the start of our reporting trip to cover the most anticipated trial in China in recent memory had ended. We arrived in the eastern city of Jinan on Tuesday, two days before the local Intermediate People's Court was set to try disgraced Communist leader Bo Xilai, who was once tipped to be a future president but now faces charges of bribe-taking, embezzlement and abuse of power. Bo's spectacular downfall -- complete with tales of murder, corruption and betrayal -- triggered the greatest political crisis for the ruling Communist Party in decades. During his trial, the charismatic and controversial politician is expected to make his first public appearance since April 2012 when he was stripped of his top Party posts. Timeline: The Bo Xilai scandal . Given the high drama and political stakes, it seems prudent for China's top leaders to pick one of the country's blandest cities for the spectacle. Jinan is far away -- more than 780 miles (1,200 kilometers) -- from Chongqing, Bo's former powerbase, or other places where he had held senior positions. The presiding judge is said to be a tested and reliable official in the eyes of Beijing. Coincidentally, Shandong province -- with Jinan being the capital -- is also home to the ancient sage Confucius, whose philosophy emphasizes respect to authority -- an idea that nervous local officials probably wish ""unruly"" foreign journalists would learn quickly. The courthouse sits at the end of a narrow, tree-lined downtown street, surrounded by high-rise apartment buildings. All looked normal and quiet as we exited the car, if not for the dozen soldiers unloading plastic barriers from trucks across the street from the court's main gate. A press pen was in the making. While our cameraman tested satellite signal strength for potential live shot locations, an official directed us to a nearby hotel, where the government had set up a media center. After going through a metal detector and a hand-wand inspection, we entered the building and reached the first position in what seemed to be an assembly line for the credential application process -- involving passport check, form distribution, information verification, data entry and photo-taking. Five steps later, we were told our press cards would be ready the following afternoon. But officials there didn't seem to know much else about the ""open"" trial -- questions about likely courtroom access, live broadcast opportunities or press conferences went unanswered. Almost as soon as the trial date was set last weekend, we had been calling the court trying to apply for a spot inside the courtroom -- only to be kicked around by different departments. As night fell Tuesday, we started live broadcast near a side entrance to the court. A notice posted in the bulletin board by the gate announced Bo's trial information. Pedestrians stopped to snap photos of the notice with their phones. Meanwhile, I received a text message from human rights activist Chen Guangfu, elder brother of the blind lawyer Chen Guangcheng, who had intended to ""witness"" the trial. He said, after he got off the train, state security agents awaiting him at Jinan's west railway station forced him to return to his home village some 125 miles (200 kilometers) away. Hu Jia, another prominent rights advocate, tweeted that the authorities in Jinan had tightened their grip over all activists ahead of the trial. The day before the trial brought a new excitement and a degree of chaos to the courthouse's doorstep. Despite a heavy police presence, some Bo admirers -- he retains considerable support in Chongqing and elsewhere in China -- showed up in the morning, along with onlookers and petitioners with various grievances -- all eager to take the rare opportunity to share their stories and opinions with the gathering foreign reporters. ""During Chairman Mao's time, everyone was equal and we had no corruption -- 'singing red and smashing black' was achieving that and benefited people,"" declared a 66-year-old local resident who only identified herself as Ms. Li, as she referred to Bo's famous campaign to revive Maoist ideology and crack down on crimes. ""He's not a god or perfect, but the masses supported him,"" she added. ""They can't just condemn him to hell -- I want him to have a fair trial."" ""Why bother?"" scoffed 62-year-old retired worker, named Mr. Liu, who stood next to her. ""Bo's a victim of political struggles."" ""You think he actually believed in this 'singing red and smashing black' stuff? It was all for appearance's sake,"" he continued and turned sarcastic. ""We ordinary people should just feel happy to be fed and clothed, and watch whatever news they put on TV."" As the crowd grew larger and louder, the police decided to intervene, shooing off the speakers for disrupting traffic and ordering reporters to stay inside the designated media zone across the street. But an elderly petitioner's cry for help briefly caused new commotion. Wearing a paper headband with the character ""wronged"" written on it, the woman kept yelling at policemen who were dragging her away in front of news cameras: ""I'm 80 years old and have a heart condition -- stop pushing me!"" The atmosphere among the assembled press was just as excitable -- at one point a number of reporters rushed to the city's west railway station as a rumor circulated that a train carrying Bo would be arriving. By late afternoon, a legion of newly accredited journalists -- almost all from overseas media as most domestic outlets are barred from covering politically sensitive events -- had settled in. Some journalists questioned whether a day spent running around in the summer heat to cover a trial where the outcome is all but certain was really worth it. The conviction rate for first- and second-instance criminal trials in China -- where the Party controls the police, prosecution and courts -- stood at 99.9% in 2010, a U.S. State Department report cited the Supreme People's Court as saying. The only ""unknown"" in the Bo case seems to be the sentencing. After a long day of stakeout and live reports, we finally headed back to the hotel two blocks away from the court. As we walked into the Hyatt Regency Jinan, part of a sprawling mixed-use development, I was reminded by the sign that the hotel's Chinese name is Jinan Wanda Hyatt -- a nod to the property's owner, the Dalian-based Wanda Group. The real estate conglomerate -- headed by China's richest man -- saw its business take off in the 1990s, propelled by land deals with the local government when Bo was mayor of the coastal city in northeastern China. Wanda is not implicated in the Bo case, but it seems -- despite the top leaders' best efforts to choose a ""neutral"" location for the trial -- Bo's shadow looms large even in Jinan.","Bo Xilai set to be tried at the local Intermediate People's Court in Jinan .

"(TIME.com) -- Curious about how a disease gets started? Researchers may soon be able to ""street view"" the inner workings of the human body. An international group of researchers have successfully created the most comprehensive map of the human metabolism, called Recon 2, which details how the body's converts food into energy, and assembles all of the hormones and proteins that contribute to a normal day's work for cells and tissues. Genes may form the foundation of the human condition, but it's their activity, in the shape of the products they make â€” from enzymes and hormones to nutrients and signaling factors â€” that dictate how cells interact with each other, and how body systems, such as the way we breakdown food into energy, operate. ""It's like having the coordinates of all the cars in town, but no street map,"" Bernhard Palsson, a professor of bioengineering at the University of California San Diego Jacobs School of Engineering said in a statement. ""Without this tool, we don't know why people are moving the way they are."" By putting together how genes and their products interact across entire networks, Palsson and his colleagues are confident that Recon 2 could help to expose some of the still mysterious causes of diseases like cancer and diabetes, as well as lead to better treatments. TIME.com: Can you be fat and fit? ""Ultimately, I envision it being used to personalize diagnosis and treatment to meet the needs of individual patients. In the future, this capability could enable doctors to develop virtual models of their patients' individual metabolic networks and identify the most efficacious treatment for various diseases including diabetes, cancer and neurodegenerative diseases,"" said Ines Thiele, a professor at the University of Iceland in a statement describing the work. Recon 2 resembles a ""Google map"" since it consolidates all the details of human metabolism functions into one interactive tool and allows users to zoom in to view as much detail, at a cellular level, as they want, or to zoom out to get a broader perspective of all the different metabolic reactions that might be involved in a particular function. Such analyses can reveal patterns in function that might not otherwise be obvious to scientists working on more limited projects. In a release describing the scope of the project, University of California San Diego officials wrote: . ""This is not unlike how you can get a street view of a single house or zoom out to see how the house fits into the whole neighborhood, city, state, country and globe. And just as Google maps brings together a broad set of data -- such as images, addresses, streets and traffic flow -- into an easily navigated tool, Recon 2 pulls together a vast compendium of data from published literature and existing models of metabolic processes."" TIME.com: How exercise can change your DNA . As the name suggests, there was also a Recon 1, which mapped 3,300 metabolic transformations occurring in tissue and cells. Recon 2 more than doubles that number of metabolic activities by covering more than 7,400 different reactions. To develop Recon 2, the original group of researchers from UCSD brought together research groups from around the world to contribute their findings and develop standards for the map. Researchers are already excited by Recon 2â€²s potential in a number of medical applications, including the ability to trace gene expression patterns to specific metabolic pathways, which can lead to more useful targets for drugs that can intervene in these processes and alter the reactions that can lead to disease. ""Recon 2 allows biomedical researchers to study the human metabolic network with more precision than was ever previously possible. This is essential to understanding where and how specific metabolic pathways go off track to create disease,"" said Palsson in a statement. TIME.com: Diet strategies may help in lowering diabetes risk . Although it is the most expansive map of the human metabolism available, it's still not complete. According to the researchers, Recon 2 includes only about 1,800 genes of the estimated 20,000 protein-coding genes in the human genome, so there is plenty more to map in coming years.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- For countries in Northeast Asia, this summer is becoming too hot to bear. A Japanese city has experienced the highest temperature ever recorded in the country. The South Korean government is clamping down on the use of air-conditioning in an attempt to stave off power shortages. And Shanghai has been sweltering under a record-setting run of baking hot days. The searing temperatures have brought a spike in heat-related deaths, as well as harming crops and livestock. A new record . In Japan, of the 52 deaths from heatstroke nationwide between late May and early August, nearly one third of them occurred last week, the Fire and Disaster Management Agency said. On Monday, the temperature reached 41 degrees Celsius (105.8 degrees Fahrenheit) in Shimanto in southern Japan, setting a new national record, according to the Japanese Meteorological Agency. The agency issued a heat alert covering 37 of Japan's 47 prefectures on Tuesday, warning that the high temperatures are expected to continue for about a week in western, central and southern parts of the country. Looming energy crisis . The hot weather has come at a bad time for South Korea, putting a severe strain on the country's struggling power grid. The energy supply was already suffering from technical problems, including the shutdown of some nuclear reactors. Officials have warned of an imminent energy crisis. To try to prevent shortages, authorities on Monday ordered sweltering workers in government offices to turn off the air-conditioning and avoid using elevators. The order came two days after the city of Gimhae clocked a temperature of 39.2 degrees Celsius (102.6 degrees Fahrenheit), the highest in South Korea in more than a decade. The Korea Meteorological Administration on Tuesday issued a fresh heat wave warning -- which means the maximum temperature is expected to be above 35 Celsius for more than two days -- for large areas of the country. Weeks of heat . Parts of China, meanwhile, have been dealing with unusually high temperatures for weeks. iReport: Heatwave scorches Shanghai . After sweating through its hottest July in at least 140 years, Shanghai last week experienced four consecutive days during which the thermometer went above 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit), state media reported. That's the first time the sprawling city of 23 million inhabitants has had a run of temperatures that high, according to the Shanghai Meteorological Bureau. China's National Meteorological Center on Tuesday issued its second-highest heat alert for central and southern parts of the country -- the 20th day in a row that it's issued an alert of that level, the state-run news agency Xinhua reported. But the agency also offered some hope of a reprieve for heat-weary citizens. It predicted that ""the intensity of the heat and the regions it affects will gradually dwindle over the next three days,"" Xinhua reported. CNN's Junko Ogura and journalist Saori Ibuki in Tokyo; and journalist Soo Bin Park in Seoul, South Korea, contributed to this report.","The high temperature in a Japanese city sets a new national record .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Once upon a time, Maxwell's hair would have walked into a room five minutes before he did. When he first hit the big time in 1996, he rocked the biggest, fluffiest Afro this side of the '70s and evoked a distinctly bohemian vibe. Now, the neo-soul superstar is back after an eight-year self-imposed hiatus, and he looks like a new man, with close-cropped hair and a wardrobe of elegantly tailored suits. ""Sometimes I just get sick of myself,"" he confided, alluding to his time away from the spotlight. ""That's kind of what happened in 2001. I didn't want to see another photo; I didn't want to hear me. I just sort of needed a coffee bean in the perfume shop of who I was, you know what I mean?"" But the deluge of media attention is starting to happen all over again. We're backstage at ""The Jay Leno Show"" in Burbank, California, where the mood is jubilant. The night before, the 36-year-old singer-songwriter earned six Grammy nominations for ""BLACKsummer's Night,"" the first in a trilogy of albums rolling out over the next couple of years. It's the comeback story of 2009, especially since Whitney Houston's much-publicized CD failed to garner a single nod from Grammy voters. Interview requests are pouring in. This time, Maxwell insists that he won't lose focus. ""I think I was just more afraid. Fear of failing, fear of having something sort of stop. For me, I was like, 'I don't want to love this too much, because what if this goes away?' I kind of went through that because I'm kind of insecure in that way. But for the hiatus to have occurred, to then come back and to have this -- I feel a lot more settled and a lot more confident."" Maxwell spoke with CNN about his return. CNN: When you were on your hiatus, was there ever a point where you thought, ""I'm not sure I'm coming back?"" Maxwell: I didn't know. I didn't know what people would want of me, if they wanted me back at all. I was always working on some songs. But was there an industry that was ready for me? CNN: Back then, it was all about hip-hop excess and bling. Maxwell: It was so different three years ago, when you think about how hip-hop had completely devoured soul music or R&B. It's all cyclical. The pendulum swings this way, and it swings that way, and I was waiting. I was biding my time because I was like, ""Why swim upstream?"" CNN: Do you think your career would be where it is now had you not gone away for seven or eight years? Maxwell: I don't think so. I think that the person that always shows up to the party is the person that always shows up to the party. I love Sade. She's lived a very interesting code with regards to how she deals with her career. She's been gone for 10 years, and it's a good feeling when you can walk back into it after not seeing a friend for so long, and then you sit down to have lunch or coffee or whatever, and it's almost like time did not freeze. That is what I would love to have with the public -- is to be able to kind of go away and to come back, and it's as if no time had passed between us. CNN: While you were away, it was easy to think you were gone because of something troublesome. Maxwell: When there's no information, people create whatever they want. CNN: You're very mysterious. Maxwell: Am I? CNN: People don't know a whole lot about your life, except for what you write in lyrics. Maxwell: I feel like there's a healthy separation, and I think that it really helps me to have something to say and to not make a spectacle of my day-to-day. I'm not big on reality shows, when they know what toothbrush you use and what soap; all those things that are commonplace now in terms of how people sort of see celebrities. I feel like I'm real old-school that way. I love mystique. I love people like Harrison Ford. He'll make his movies, and then he'll go do his thing, and I think people just leave him to himself. I've seen celebrities -- and I'm talking about big-time people -- literally get off a plane, grab their own luggage, rent a car and drive themselves home. I love the fact that I don't always have to be ""on"" for my friends. And then when it's time to get on stage, it's that other person that kind of comes into the formation. I like those two distinctive worlds. CNN: Sounds like kind of a ""Sasha Fierce"" mentality, where you have your alter ego. Maxwell: I was thinking of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde more -- just on a gender level. I don't think I could rock those heels Beyonce rocks. (Laughs) CNN: Are you ever going to grow your hair back? Maxwell: You never know. I might do that. I might do something else. I just go with the flow. I definitely don't want to be a haircut, definitely don't want to be a gimmick. CNN: But the new haircut kind of signified a new Maxwell. Maxwell: It was just easier to deal with life in the morning, to be honest with you. You probably would have been waiting here like two, three more hours if it was the old strand and bead -- no, I'm just playing. I feel like it's also a rite of passage. You get older and grow, and you should change, you know? If you're frozen in a time capsule, that's something you should be worried about. There are people who do what they do -- they have their superhero outfit, and they keep it on for 20, 30 years. For me, it's about transformation.","Maxwell's return to the music industry has brought Grammy nominations .

"Golan Heights (CNN) -- The Israeli army's Golani brigade recently wrapped up a two-week exercise of ground troops, special forces and air units along Israel's 81-mile-long (130 km) frontier with Syria. The drill was not aimed at preparing for an all-out war scenario but to respond to a new terror threat that has emerged from the ashes of the Syrian revolution. Israel Defense Forces claim that close to 3,000 fighters from the militant group Hezbollah have infiltrated Syria in support of the Assad regime and several hundred are now operating the Golan Heights. Hezbollah -- the Iranian-backed group based in southern Lebanon - has called for the destruction of the state of Israel. Leader Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah has stated that once the Syrian uprising is put down, he will turn his attention to Israel. ""Statements that were made by high ranking officials that the Syrian border will become a border with terror is something we are dealing with every day,"" said Lt. Col. Anan Abbas, the Golani Brigade Commander. ""We are making sure that there will be no penetration through the northern border of Israel."" CNN told: Pakistani Taliban arrive in Syria, more to come . Abbas gave CNN an exclusive tour of the region that has seen a tripling of Israeli forces and intelligence gathering over the last six months. The IDF now monitors the region 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Corporal Chen Holtzman, a soldier working in the IDF's Intelligence Operations Center, said they have the authority to deploy special forces units, artillery and aerial bombings if they suspect a threat to Israel. ""We can see it for a few miles coming at us,"" she said. ""If we see something coming at us, we can tell that immediately and everybody is prepared to do something about that."" In addition to the constant surveillance, Israel is erecting a fence with Syria along its side of the disengagement zone. The mountainous Golan, known for its beauty and favored by backpackers and hikers, is one of the most traveled areas for Israelis. It was captured by Israel during the Six-Day War in 1967 against Egypt, Iraq, Jordan and Syria, but since 1974, right up to the Syrian revolution, the area was a quiet, almost bucolic military posting. Syria's children deserve chance to be kids again . The turmoil in Syria changed the equation and in June, both countries nearly came to a full-on, open confrontation at a crossing post in Quneitra. Syrian rebels overran government-backed forces and for a few hours occupied the area. The Israeli forces watched, ready to intercede if the fighting spilled across the border. ""The shooting began at 5am,"" recalled Abbas. ""It was a morning full of fighting where the Syrian army and rebels were shooting at one another."" To strike back at the rebels, the Syrian army moved several tanks and armored vehicles into area and the IDF went on high alert. ""We had a lot of forces ready to react. Tanks, intelligence, special forces ... artillery, air force -- everything was ready for this incident,"" said Abbas. ""If we would have seen that there was a leakage or direct fire into our territory we would have reacted immediately and destroyed the source of fire."" Even before the skirmish at Quneitra, shots between rebels and Syrian government forces have strayed across the border. The IDF's response to these is to destroy the firing position -- whether rebel or Syrian army. ""I do not differentiate between a force that is Syrian or a force of the rebels,"" Abbas said. ""If I identify armed men next to the fence, we are prepared to face all the threats and respond.""

"Fort George G. Meade, Maryland (CNN) -- Defense lawyers for an Army private accused in the biggest intelligence leak in U.S. history brought up Saturday a purported female alter ego of Bradley Manning's as they seek to establish his state of mind at the time of the alleged crimes. The testimony came on the second day of Manning's Article 32 hearing, which coincided with his 24th birthday. Special agent Calder Robertson of the Army Criminal Investigation Command (CID), testifying by phone from Germany, was asked by one of Manning's attorneys if he knew that the Army private had an alter ego with the name, Breanna Manning. The agent said he was aware Manning used the name in online chats. During questioning by Manning's lawyer, it was revealed that Manning kept a folder of articles about gender identity disorder in his living quarters. Manning is accused of leaking more than a quarter of a million classified Pentagon and State Department documents that ended up on the WikiLeaks website. The special agent was one of four with the Army's CID who testified Saturday. His testimony included information about how the agent took custody of the computers and hardware seized from Manning's base and made exact digital images of them to assure that the information on them would not be lost in the event of an accident during transportation. Another agent testified by phone from Hawaii about searching Manning's living space and office and a storeroom at Forward Operating Base Hammer where he was stationed in Iraq. That agent said she seized several laptops, a hard drive and a device used to link computers to the secret military system where the documents Manning is accused of leaking were available. About a half a dozen computers belonging to Manning, or found in areas where he worked in Iraq and Maryland, have been taken as evidence and analyzed. When pressed on whether people other than Manning could have used those computers, Robertson said he did not know. He testified that Manning's personal laptop, seized in Iraq, was not password protected. A third agent, Mark Mander, who was part of the search of Manning's aunt's house in Potomac, Maryland, which was listed in Army records as his home address, testified that a memory card containing classified information was found among Manning's belongings. It was not clear if the material on that card was the same as what was given to WikiLeaks. Prosecutors also called on Capt. Steven Lim and retired Sgt. First Class Brian Madrid to testify. Madrid was Manning's platoon sergeant at Fort Huachuca, in Arizona, where Manning received his first intelligence training after basic training. Manning got in trouble there for posting a video on YouTube claiming that he was working on ""secret"" and ""classified"" material, Madrid testified. That violated the school's policy, but Manning did not lose his security clearance. Lim, who was an officer in Manning's chain of command at FOB Hammer when Manning served there, spoke about the Army private's strengths at using some computer programs, and his weakness at public speaking. Manning was moved from the night shift in his unit's intelligence office to day shift so he could get ""more supervision,"" Lim said. He was eventually moved back to night shift. Lim also testified about two instances in which Manning allegedly lost his temper and became violent with members of his unit. In one incident, Lim said he understood that Manning flipped a table after being reprimanded for arriving late to work. In that case, Manning was not removed from duty as an intelligence officer. When asked why he was allowed to stay, Lim said: ""We needed the work. We needed people."" In the second incident, which led to Manning being moved from an area where he did intelligence work to a storeroom, the Army private allegedly assaulted a fellow soldier. Finally, Lim testified that a sergeant who counseled Manning about his behavior wrote letters about Manning's emotional problems, but didn't show them to Lim until after Manning's arrest. One of those letters referred to a photograph in which Manning appeared dressed as a woman. The sergeant should have informed him as soon as he learned about Manning's gender identity issues, Lim said, so that action could have been taken. The United States has charged Manning with 22 counts of violating military code, ranging from the theft of records to aiding the enemy. Experts say conviction on the latter charge probably would land Manning in prison for life. But, if a general sees fit, the law would allow Manning to be eligible for the death penalty. Manning's Article 32 hearing, the military equivalent of a grand jury hearing that will determine whether enough evidence exists to merit a court-martial, is expected to last at least a week. Testimony is scheduled to resume Sunday morning. Most of the first day of Manning's hearing on Friday focused on a defense motion seeking the recusal of the hearing's investigative officer. As the investigating officer, Lt. Col. Paul Almanza oversees the hearing and will make a recommendation when it's complete about what, if any, charges Manning should face at court-martial. Defense attorney David Coombs alleged that Almanza may be prejudiced and should step down. Among Coombs' objections was that Almanza, an Army Reservist, has a conflict of interest because of his civilian job with the Justice Department, which is investigating WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. Almanza denied the motion for recusal, and Coombs immediately appealed to the Army Court of Appeals, which denied Coombs' motion again on Friday night.","NEW: Testimony is scheduled to resume Sunday morning .

"(CNN) -- Protesters -- and police -- took to the streets in Bahrain Wednesday as two years of simmering unrest boiled over into demonstrations demanding reform. Police fired tear gas to break up demonstrations. One opposition group said there were 60 protests in different areas. The anti-government opposition bloc called for mass demonstrations in the tiny island kingdom Wednesday, trying to reignite an uprising in which the majority Shiite population protested against the ruling Sunni minority. The government, meanwhile, said there has been an increase in militant activism in the country including injuries to security forces and civilians, and that authorities would act to maintain stability. A government statement Wednesday elaborated, saying ""In recent months, a series of militant tactics have been used across the country, including explosives, shotguns and rocket launchers amongst many others, all constructed in homes."" Wednesday marked the 42nd anniversary of British forces pulling out of the Gulf kingdom. The opposition is using the slogan ""Bahrain Tamarod"" echoing the name of Tamarod, the protest movement that overthrew former Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy. Ahead of Wednesday's protests, legislators last month banned any demonstrations in the capital, Manama. They also approved tough new penalties for those who commit or incite ""terrorism,"" including stripping Bahrainis of citizenship. The government statement Wednesday categorized those actions as ""not based on people disagreeing with the government -- the purpose is to protect lives and livelihood of the majority of citizens."" And the statement said, ""Bahrain has continued to allow citizens to exercise their right to express their grievances on various platforms, including in over 200 authorized rallies in the past year and half alone."" 2011 crackdown . Spurred by uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt, Bahraini citizens demonstrated in early 2011, demanding democratic reforms and other changes in the way the country was run. But the movement failed to gain the traction of other Arab Spring uprisings after a crackdown by authorities. Bahraini security forces were backed by troops from nearby Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Demonstrators say authorities killed dozens of citizens and arrested, tortured and sentenced hundreds of others. Protests continue . Opposition leaders have tried to keep the protest movement alive. ""The thing about Bahrain is that nobody really knows what's going on there because there's not much media coverage but the protests never stopped,"" Maryam Alkhawaja, head of the Bahrain Center for Human Rights, told CNN's Mohammed Jamjoom. ""Every single day between 15 to 25 different areas come out to protest in Bahrain. Every single day,"" said Alkhawaja. But authorities have responded by continuing the crackdown. Global human rights activists have denounced what they call appalling human rights abuses by Bahraini authorities. In April, Human Rights Watch said security forces had raided homes and arbitrarily detained a number of prominent anti-government protest leaders. Bahrain is an ally of the United States and home to the 5th Fleet, a large U.S. naval presence in the Persian Gulf.

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- I like it when I'm right, especially about naked men. Especially about naked cowboys. A federal judge's opinion includes side-by-side photos of the key players in The Naked Cowboy case. When I wrote in April that the lawsuit filed by Robert Burck ""may be the end of the era of the ""naked"" cowboy and predicted he would be able to afford some ""very nice duds,"" my fellow lawyers laughed at me. One close friend -- let's call him Larry -- said as he snickered, ""I read your article. You can't be serious. You really think that the Naked Cowboy is going to cash in? Well, I predict he is going to get thrown out of court. If he doesn't, maybe I will start walking around my office in my tighty whities."" Last week, U.S. District Court Judge Denny Chin didn't throw the cowboy from his steed. In fact, in a lengthy decision, Judge Chin ruled against the makers of M&Ms, rejecting Mars, Inc.'s attempt to dismiss the Cowboy's lawsuit. And it seems that Judge Chin has a sense of humor. On the first page of his decision, the judge pasted photos of the litigating parties side by side and wrote,  ""This is the case of The Naked Cowboy versus The Blue M&M."" And what a case it is. Burck sued Mars in April for $6 million in federal court in New York. The central allegation: trademark infringement under the Lanham Act, arising from a video billboard for M&Ms. Most people, and maybe Mars, thought the Cowboy was just a kooky street entertainer dressed in his underwear. However, I've spoken to Mr. Cowboy, I mean, Mr. Burke, and he didn't seem kooky to me at all. In fact, he seemed kinda smart. Even Judge Chin recognized that The Naked Cowboy is no ordinary street entertainer. Although he performs in New York City's Times Square in little more than underwear and a smile, he has registered trademarks to ""The Naked Cowboy"" name and likeness. And he doesn't just sing in Times Square. He has a Web site http://www.nakedcowboy.com/ with his modeling photos and has a link to nakedcowboy.tv. You can download his music on iTunes. You can buy his tighty whities from his online store for $15. He even has a podcast. Judge Chin observed that ""Burck has appeared as The Naked Cowboy in various television shows, movies, and video games. He has also licensed his name and likeness to companies for endorsements and advertisements. He even appeared in a Chevrolet commercial that aired during Super Bowl XLI. Judge Chin then explained that ""beginning in April 2007, Mars began running an animated cartoon advertisement on two oversized video billboards in Times Square, featuring a blue M&M dressed ""exactly like The Naked Cowboy,"" wearing only a white cowboy hat, cowboy boots, and underpants, and carrying a guitar."" And get this -- the video ""played on a continuous loop every few minutes over a nine-month period."" Mars tried to defend itself by arguing that the Blue M&M was just a parody of the Cowboy and was protected under the First Amendment. Although imitation is supposed to be the sincerest form of flattery, Judge Chin didn't agree with M&M's parody argument. Rather, Judge Chin thought it was a question for a jury to decide and wrote that the complaint ""plausibly argues that consumers would believe that the M&M Cowboy characters were promoting a product rather than merely parodying The Naked Cowboy, and that viewers would believe that The Naked Cowboy had endorsed M&Ms."" Then Judge Chin ordered the lawyers to appear in his courtroom for a pretrial conference on July 11 at noon. High Noon. That Judge Chin makes me laugh. Round One to the Cowboy. Larry, maybe you should start walking around the office in your tighty whities.","Federal judge rejects M&Ms maker's parody defense .

"(CNN) -- With oil prices hitting a record high on Monday, the chairman and CEO of Chevron, David O'Reilly, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., senior attorney for the National Resource Defense Counsel, appeared on CNN's ""Larry King Live"" to discuss America's energy future. Chevron CEO David O'Reilly says his company's profit is about 7 percent. Kennedy: The fastest way for us to solve our energy problems in this country is immediate conservation. If we improve fuel economy standards in our automobiles by one mile per gallon, we generate twice the oil that's in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. If we raise fuel economy standards by 7.6 miles per gallon, we can yield more oil than we are currently importing from the Persian Gulf. O'Reilly: I agree, that first of all efficiency is the very first thing we ought to be working on. And there are new [fuel efficiency] standards in place that will obligate the automobile manufacturers to be more efficient and, in fact, you can see a shift already toward more efficient cars. Kennedy: I'm involved with a company called Better Place, which made a proposal a couple years ago to Israel to get Israel completely off of gasoline cars within three years. And Israel is going to do that. Within three years, they will be off of gasoline automobiles. We can do that in this country, too, using shifting to electricity and electricity gives us a lot more versatility, it allows us to harness wind. We have -- the Midwest this is the Saudi Arabia of wind. We have enough harnessable wind energy in North Dakota, Kansas and Texas combined to supply all the electrical needs of our country, even if every American were driving an electric car. We have the Scientific American just published a report that shows in 19 percent of the most barren desert lands in the desert Southwest, we have enough solar energy to provide all the electrical needs of our country. ... What we need now is a national policy that says, OK, let's go out and get those electrons and get them into the marketplace. O'Reilly: I encourage all these alternatives. I think there's room for all of them. I'm very concerned because the reality is today that these alternatives are a very small percentage. And just like it takes a long time to drill an offshore well, it takes a long time to find and develop and put in the sort of equipment that Mr. Kennedy is talking about. What bothers me about this is everyone portrays it as an either/or debate. It's not and either/or debate. ... We need alternative and we need efficiency and we need conventional oil and gas.  Watch O'Reilly discuss ballooning gas prices » . Kennedy: I really think that they talk windfall profit tax [on oil companies], whether it's good thing or it's a bad thing, it's not a long-term energy policy. What we need is really a long-term -- and drilling off the coast is not a long-term energy policy. What we need is an energy policy. Today, Larry, we are borrowing a billion dollars a day mainly from countries that don't like us to import oil from countries that don't like us. When I was a little boy, our country owned half the wealth on the face of the Earth. We are now transferring that wealth at a historic rate to other countries, again, mainly nations that don't like us. We have solutions. Unfortunately, we have a Congress that's really brain dead. I'll tell you something that the Congress did today. First of all, they killed the investment tax credits for solar and wind which are absolutely vital to the growth of this burgeoning industry. Second of all, today, Congress and the White House declared a moratorium, a two-year moratorium on any solar plants being built on federal lands while they study supposedly the environmental impact. O'Reilly: In the first quarter, we made $5 billion, which is 7 percent of sales and exactly the median for all of the industry. ... The percentage has been about the same. You've got to keep in mind that as the revenues are going up, the costs are also going up. So it's not as if this is all going to the bottom line.","Robert Kennedy Jr. says immediate conservation measures needed .

Bo Guagua, 24, graduated from Harvard's Kennedy School of Government in May. He previously attended Oxford, graduating in 2010. He came under fierce scrutiny this spring as bare-chested photos of him at college balls led to accusations of a party-boy lifestyle, fueling a long-raging debate in China about whether Chinese Communist Party leaders exploit their positions to enrich their families. In a letter to the Harvard Crimson in April, Bo Guagua denied he had ever driven a Ferrari to pick up a date and defended his academic record. ""I am deeply concerned about the events surrounding my family,"" he said at the time, adding that he had no comment on the investigation. Media reports have suggested that Heywood was at one time a mentor to Bo Guagua, paving his entry into England's elite Harrow School, from which he graduated. Heywood was found dead in his hotel room in the southwestern Chinese metropolis of Chongqing, and authorities quickly blamed his death on excessive alcohol. His body was cremated without an autopsy. Timeline: Bo Xilai scandal . On April 10, authorities made the surprise announcement that Gu was being investigated on suspicion of murder, along with Zhang, a family aide. Bo Guagua's father, Bo Xilai, was seen to be a top contender for China's powerful Politburo Standing Committee before his career unraveled this spring after Heywood's death. That same day in April, Bo Xilai was stripped of his seat on the Communist Party's Central Committee for an unspecified ""serious breach of regulations."" Who is Bo Xilai?

"(HLNtv.com) -- It took less than an hour for Joshua Young's defense team to call four additional witnesses, including his aunt and social worker, before resting its case Thursday. Young, who did not testify in his own defense, is charged with complicity to murder for his alleged role in the slaying of his stepbrother, Trey Zwicker, in May 2011. Prosecutors say the 17-year-old acted in concert with his father, Josh Gouker, to kill Zwicker, 14. Gouker, who was Zwicker's stepfather, pleaded guilty to a charge of murder, and was sentenced July 26 to life in prison. Young's defense attorneys argue that Gouker acted alone in killing Zwicker. Young's aunt, Cynthia Guenther, took the stand Thursday in Jefferson County Circuit Court in Louisville, Kentucky, to describe her nephew's demeanor at Zwicker's funeral, calling him ""very sad, very distraught, teary-eyed."" The social worker who visited Young's home once every month between 2007 and 2012 also testified Thursday that she witnessed Young and Zwicker together on two occasions. ""They were sitting together on the couch, playing video games. Very relaxed, kind of joking with each other,"" said Allison Miller about a 2011 visit she made to the home. Miller told prosecutors during her short cross-examination that she witnessed the pair interacting for only about a minute before Gouker told them to leave the room. The judge told jurors he expected them to get the case around lunchtime Friday, after attorneys present their closing arguments. The judge also told jurors to pack an overnight bag in case they don't reach a verdict Friday night, in which case they would be sequestered and continue to deliberate on Saturday.","Josh Young is accused of helping his father kill his stepbrother, Trey Zwicker .

"(CNN) -- If there was ever a reunion for teen soap ""The O.C.,"" which is celebrating its 10th anniversary this week, former star Adam Brody would want it to be in the theater. (Like there wasn't enough drama.) The 33-year-old actor starred in the series as the lovably sarcastic Seth Cohen, and he told CNN that he can envision ""The O.C."" as a stage production. ""I'll do 'The O.C. Reunion: The Play,' "" he said. ""I'd like to do it on stage ... I think that's where it should live."" And if the public demanded a musical, Brody would comply. ""I can't sing really, but I'll do my best,"" he joked. ""I'll take the very low notes."" Since ""The O.C."" ended in 2007, Brody has lined up a number of movie projects, including Friday's release, ""Lovelace."" The film, directed by Rob Epstein and Jeffrey Friedman, tells the story of adult actress Linda Lovelace. Brody plays Lovelace's ""Deep Throat"" co-star, Harry Reems. Aside from seeing ""Deep Throat,"" Brody said he prepared by watching ""'The Devil in Miss Jones,' the next porn with Harry Reems, and I read his biography from the '70s -- very lighthearted, before he sort of fell on hard times and resurrected himself."" But when it came to Reems' unmistakable porn 'stache, the actor says he failed to live up to the task. ""To be perfectly honest, I didn't have the follicles nor the time to grow what I really needed to grow,"" he said. ""Harry Reems is the first male porno star. This is the quintessential porno 'stache. This is the ground zero for a porn 'stache, this is where it all began, so yeah, it is a lot to live up to.

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama postponed military exercises with Egypt last week due to intensifying violence between the military and supporters of ousted President Mohamed Morsy, and warned of potential ""further steps."" Much of the discussion since has focused on the fate of $1.2 billion in American military aid, and Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel reiterated on Monday that ""every aspect"" of the U.S.-Egyptian relationship is on the table. Obama warns of further steps in Egypt . But what does that mean exactly and how much leverage does the United States have on Egyptian affairs? Beyond military support, would holding up financing for economic programs have an impact? What about immigration and visa programs? Would any new action on these issues change the behavior of the Egyptian military? More than half of all Americans in a new poll believe the United States should halt military aid. But experts tell CNN that relations are complex. ""The United States is kind of in a 'damned if you do, damned if you don't' situation,"" said Tarek Radwan, associate director for research at the Atlantic Council. TIME.com: U.S. military aid to Egypt: An IV drip, with side effects . What does the U.S. want? For Jon Alterman, director of the Middle East Program at the Center for Strategic & International Studies, the question really is: What does Washington want to accomplish? ""If you are trying to change the decision-making process of the Egyptian military -- that is very hard to do right now because they believe they are locked in an existential struggle. If what you are trying to do is demonstrate our resolve to the rest of the world and people looking on, that is another issue."" Egypt on edge amid questions of U.S. aid . Though Isobel Coleman, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, says military assistance is pretty much the only card the United States can play to enforce its call for an end to violence and quick return to civilian rule. ""If we mean what we say, than the next step is to suspend our military aid until the Egyptians mean what they say -- which is that they are looking for a political compromise,"" Coleman said. Not a one-sided relationship . Military jets, helicopters and other equipment provided by the United States supports a trilateral peace in the region involving Egypt, Jordan and Israel, which is the largest recipient of American military aid, and related strategic advantages. For instance, the United States has been granted preferential use of the Suez Canal -- an economic hub that connects the Mediterranean and the Red Sea -- and overflight rights, which gives the U.S. military the ability to fly over Egypt on the way to bases in the region. But would Egypt respond to cuts in its aid by restricting access to the Suez and its air space? Unlikely, said Coleman and Radwan. ""The Suez Canal is extremely important. It is important to international commerce,"" Wardwan said, adding that he doubts ""these privileges will be changed"" if aid is suspended. Will cutting aid do anything? The Obama administration has decided to not call the military's ouster of Morsy a coup, which would require an end to military assistance under U.S. law. But Sen. John McCain, a leading authority on military matters in Congress, recently returned from Egypt. He said turning off aid in response to the military crackdown on protesters is more than necessary now. ""We have no credibility. We do have influence, but when you don't use that influence, then you do not have that influence,"" McCain said Sunday on CNN's ""State of the Union."" About half of the money for military assistance this year -- reduced somewhat by budget cuts in the United States -- has been delivered, according to the State Department. Egypt gets another $250 million for economic programs. And a new Pew Research Center survey of 1,000 adults nationwide conducted Thursday through Sunday showed that 51% of Americans believed it was better for Washington to cut off military aid to put pressure on the government, while 26% said it was better to continue aid to maintain influence. With such complexity in the region -- from trading rights to diplomatic advantages -- would cutting aid be an effective way to change policy in Egypt? Likely, no, said the experts -- particularly because Saudi Arabia has said it would consider matching the U.S. assistance if the administration does decide to cut it. ""Our Congress is not about to compete with that amount of money in Egypt,"" Coleman said."" (The Saudis) have deep pockets and they are ready to put them in Egypt's disposal."" There is little agreement among experts over whether such a cut would make any difference. ""Whether or not changing the aid policy is good for the U.S. in the long run, my answer to that is yes,"" Radwan said. ""If we diversify our engagement with Egypt and deepen it beyond the rhetoric we hear, not only the Obama administration, but any administration after would have for more policy flexibility."" Alterman, on the other hand, sounded a warning. ""It is easier to cut things than resume them,"" he concluded. ""What you may have instead of sending a warning shot that gets Egyptians to change their behavior, you may have a spiraling down in our relations."" CNN's Holly Yan contributed to this report.","Experts say relations between the U.S. and Egypt are more complicated than military aid .

"(CNN) -- Nathan Cox-Reed has a toothache. He thinks he needs a root canal, but the full-time student, 22, is uninsured. He can't afford a trip to the dentist. ""I'm only working 30 hours a week. I wouldn't have enough money to do something like that,"" said Cox-Reed, a film and video student at Columbia College in Chicago. While many young adults are now covered by the Affordable Care Act, able to remain on their parents' insurance until age 26, the rules are different for those like Cox-Reed, who grew up in the foster care system. There are more than 400,000 children in foster care in the United States, the Department of Health and Human Services said last year. All are provided with health care coverage as long as they are wards of the state. When foster kids turn 18, they age out of the system and instantly lose their coverage. That's about to change, when another part of Obamacare takes effect on January 1, 2014. Medicaid coverage will be extended for former foster youth until they reach 26, as long as the individual was in foster care and enrolled in Medicaid until the age of 18. ""I definitely think it would be a big relief, and I would definitely feel more secure as far as my health goes,"" Cox-Reed said. But there's a catch. Cox-Reed has dreams of traveling across the nation and becoming a filmmaker. A future relocation could jeopardize his medical coverage. States will only be required to keep former foster children on Medicaid if they continue to reside in the state where they were in foster care originally. CNNMoney: Most individual health insurance isn't good enough for Obamacare . This part of the provision is ""an incredibly troubling aspect,"" said Washington attorney Brooke Lehmann, who founded the child and family advocacy group Childworks. Young adults can be highly mobile as they move for educational purposes, job opportunities and a host of other reasons, she said. ""You can't be on a film set if you are uninsured,"" Cox-Reed said. ""You could get hurt. I definitely think [being uninsured] is limiting and it's a letdown, because what if I do get a job out of state? I might not be able to take it."" While ""it's a great provision,"" said Joan Alker, co-executive director of the Georgetown Center for Children and Families and a professor at the Georgetown University Health Policy Institute, limiting extended Medicaid enrollment because of relocation could threaten the provision's effectiveness. She, Lehmann and other child advocates wrote a letter, circulated by the Children's Defense Fund, to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services at the Department of Health and Human Services, which is working on the revisions before this part of the ACA is implemented in 2014, asking them to reconsider this limitation. Even if this part of the ACA is reinterpreted, former foster children like Cox-Reed may face other challenges with the existing system -- namely, not all doctors and dentists accept Medicaid. Vicki Rodriguez, 20, who grew up in foster care in Illinois, found that out the hard way. She needs someone to remove her wisdom teeth, but can't find a single dentist who will take her Medicaid card and she can't afford to pay for it on her own. ""My tooth on my left side is coming in sideways, and it's pushing my other teeth forward,"" she said. ""I can't go anywhere because it could cost about $3,000 [including] the X-rays and everything else that they have to do before."" Rodriguez believes having coverage extended until she reaches 26 would be ""really awesome,"" but noted that even those with coverage are limited. ""People think, 'Oh yeah, the foster kids have everything covered for them, they can get everything done with their medical card,' but it's not true,"" she said. ""There's really a lot that we can't do."" Former foster youth works on Hill to change child welfare system . Lehmann recalls one of her past clients, who she said was ""actively psychotic and suicidal"": It took two years for her to obtain medication, Lehmann said, because of the difficulty in finding a psychiatrist who would take Medicaid. ""The reimbursement rates are abysmal"" for providers, she said. Health and Human Services has not responded to the child advocates' letter and did not respond to repeated requests for comment from CNN on the matter. The advocates, including Alker and Lehmann, say enrollment in Medicaid should be faster and easier to ensure all eligible young adults are enrolled without obstacles. An outreach campaign could inform eligible individuals so former foster youth are aware of the opportunity, they say. ""States are still trying to figure out how these former foster youth can be identified, how they can let young adults know that this benefit is open to them and how they can enroll,"" Lehmann said. CNN's Jen Christensen contributed to this report.","Foster kids currently age out of health coverage at 18 .

"London (CNN) -- Summer may be drawing to a close but for the eurozone's economy, spring has only just begun. After 18 months in recession, the single currency bloc finally posted some much needed growth in the form of a 0.3% expansion of gross domestic product for the second quarter. Watch more: Europe's new challenges . Brussels was quick to take the credit, claiming its policies of structural reforms had finally started to take hold, whilst the investor community cautioned more work would be needed to ensure the nascent recovery could be sustained. The truth is that yes, things are looking up but it depends where you are in Europe and there's certainly little room for complacency. Predictably, growth in the eurozone's two biggest economies, Germany and France, underpinned the region's revival. But a closer look at individual countries further down the pecking order throws up some unexpected surprises, which I've outlined below. Read more: Can Europe drive a new industrial revolution? Portugal, a nation whose profligacy and lack of competitiveness led to it being bailed out, grew 1.1% while the Netherlands, famous for its fiscal prudence, shrank 0.2% -- its fourth straight quarter of contraction. The economies of Italy and Spain remained stuck in reverse gear as well. So much for the stereotypes and the hard and fast crisis response rules which have taken endless European Union summits to draft. Reading the data one would be forgiven for thinking three years of austerity never happened. In fact it wasn't even mentioned once in Olli Rehn's own communique. Watch more: Why Europe's problems will come back . And yet the challenge for Europe's leaders at a time when some of them are coming up for re-election will be to seize upon the green shoots without dropping the ball on spending cuts. In Germany, which will face a general election next month, business groups are already lobbying any incoming government to boost investment spending. And in France, large firms are still loath to hire due to the government's lack of fiscal clarity and President Hollande's new punitive tax regime. A CEO of one FTSE 100 business with over 60,000 staff across the EU told me Europe was in recovery, and that presented opportunities -- but confidence was needed to ensure the upswing really took hold. Read more: Meet tiny nation bucking eurozone's pain . However, as any business leader will also tell you, confidence is an intangible currency. Indeed, the next challenge for Europe's top brass will be to convince companies the future is bright enough to start hiring again. Across the eurozone and the broader EU as a whole, firms have been amassing huge cash reserves which, in the face of uncertainty, have been neither spent on new machinery nor on the hiring of new staff. Such businesses will need more evidence of a true lift than a mere quarter of expansion before they are to undertake any hefty capital expenditure. The eurozone crisis has dominated the political and economic sphere for more than three years. During that time millions have lost their jobs creating a legacy of high unemployment and long-term underemployment which will take years to tackle. With more than a quarter of their populations out of work today, countries like Spain and Greece will probably still finding solutions to their jobs crisis by the time the next recession rolls around. Explore: How the crisis made the rich richer and the poor poorer . That's not counting a whole generation who missed its first step on the job ladder. If Europe really has learned its lesson, business and government should start setting the wheels in motion now to work together and retrain staff for the jobs available today and tomorrow. More jobs would boost domestic consumption and help provide a counterweight to export-dependency of the growth generators like Germany. But to hire, businesses need to be offered incentives. One incentive is a stable, more robust economy. Another is a benign interest rate environment, which is why what would really give this recovery legs is a rate cut by the end of this year.

"New York (CNN) -- The leaders of the top three U.S. intelligence agencies made an unusual joint public appearance Thursday to make a pitch for companies to cooperate more with the government in cybersecurity efforts, and defended the work their agencies do amid controversy over vast data mining programs that critics say invade Americans' privacy. National Security Agency Director Gen. Keith Alexander, FBI Director Robert Mueller and CIA Director John Brennan said the government does its best to ensure the work their agencies do is focused on protecting the nation from harm, while respecting privacy. The three appeared at a cybersecurity conference at Fordham University, co-sponsored by the FBI's New York field office. Alexander, whose agency is the focus of pressure following disclosures of secret programs by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, said his agency is working to address vulnerabilities from insiders, such as computer system administrators. Snowden's work as a system administrator allowed him broad access to the NSA's secrets. Silicon Valley to feds: Disclose your data requests . He said the agency was working to reduce system administrators by 90% though he acknowledged it was a difficult goal to reach. Much of what the system administrators do could be done by computers, he said, leaving humans to do the most important work to protect the systems. The conference of corporate and government cybersecurity managers made for a friendly audience, applauding the speakers when they defended the work the government was doing. Alexander won applause when he said the NSA programs have been ""grossly mischaracterized in the press"" and that the system the U.S. government has come up with, working with the courts and Congress, works better than anywhere else in the world. Report: Microsoft collaborated closely with NSA . He cited President Barack Obama's comments on a late night talk show, saying of the controversial NSA programs: ""this isn't a domestic spy program"" but rather a program to protect the nation from terrorists. The problem for the intelligence agencies, he said, is that terrorists use the same devices and communications methods as other people do. In light of the recent controversy, it's important to know that ""No one has willfully or knowingly disobeyed the law,"" Alexander said. How to hide your data from Internet snoops . The word ""privacy"" wasn't mentioned until the last few minutes of the 90-minute program. When asked whether Americans had any expectation of privacy nowadays, Brennan said, ""I do believe privacy is important, but privacy can be defined in different ways."" Mueller urged companies to work with law enforcement to help protect crucial infrastructure from cybercriminals, who sometimes are sponsored by foreign state security agencies or criminal syndicates. The three men urged companies to support the Obama administration's effort to pass cybersecurity legislation, an effort that has been sidelined in recent months amid the controversy.

"(CNN) -- They've met in three of the past four men's grand slam finals but after Thursday's draw, Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic can't face each other on the last day of tennis' U.S. Open. World No. 1 Djokovic and Murray, a winner in two of the last three majors he has played in, were placed in the same half of the draw while giants Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer could meet in the quarterfinals. Murray ended Britain's 76-year wait for a men's singles winner at a grand slam and opened his own grand slam account when he toppled Djokovic in the 2012 final in New York. Murray potentially must beat Djokovic and Nadal to repeat -- and he has never overcome the duo in the same fortnight at a major. Nadal's recent surge -- he claimed back-to-back titles in Montreal and Cincinnati leading into New York -- and Murray's slump since capturing Wimbledon saw the Spaniard reclaim the No. 2 ranking. As a result, Nadal and Djokovic couldn't be put in the same section. If the seedings hold, Nadal would battle not Murray but David Ferrer in the semifinals. Nadal owns a 20-4 record versus his countryman but has had it tougher against Murray, 13-5. While 12-time grand slam champion Nadal and 17-time winner Federer have tangled in the finals at the three other majors, they have never faced off in any round at the U.S. Open. Nadal downed Federer in three sets in the quarterfinals of the Cincinnati Masters last week and is unbeaten on hard courts this season. Knee troubles ruled him out of Flushing Meadows in 2012. At No. 7, Federer is at his lowest ranking in 11 years. Williams, Azarenka lead women's field . In the women's draw, world No. 1 Serena Williams and No. 2 Victoria Azarenka appear to be on a collision course, especially since Maria Sharapova pulled out of the tournament due to a shoulder injury. Azarenka has played in the past three hard-court grand slam finals, winning the Australian Open twice and losing a heartbreaker to Williams at the 2012 U.S. Open. She couldn't serve out the match. Azarenka edged Williams in Cincinnati on Sunday in a third-set tiebreak. In an intriguing first-round encounter, Williams begins against Francesca Schiavone. Although the Italian is slumping, she, too, is a grand slam champion and reached the U.S. Open quarterfinals three years ago.","Novak Djokovic could meet Andy Murray in the semifinals at the U.S. Open .

"(CNN) -- I hate public speaking. Or to be more precise, I don't like speaking to an audience sitting in front of me that I can see in real life. I don't mind once I am going, but waiting in the wings to go on is dreadful. For someone who has spent the best part of three decades broadcasting in some shape or form, you might have thought this would be something of a handicap. My career involves speaking to large numbers of people, but here is the point: On television and radio, I can't see you. PART TWO: Quest: 'On the edge of the precipice, and about to fall' If you don't like what I am saying, well, I am sorry but at least I don't have to witness the grimace, the yawn or the shake of the head before you switch off. It sounds so obvious but it makes a huge difference. MORE QUEST: Scandal hit Strauss-Kahn's struggle with public life . So when I saw the poster on the London tube advertising the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts (RADA) course on public speaking for business leaders I thought to myself: ""This is for me."" I did wonder what they would be able to teach me. After all, I have been doing this sort of stuff for quite some time. I was quite skeptical that they had any tricks which this old dog could use. What I was not prepared for was the wholesale rethinking of how I go about my breathing, thinking, and ultimately delivery. It can be described in one phrase: ""Diaphragmatic breathing!"" Most broadcasters speak and breathe from the throat. We have a microphone to help us. So we never learn the art of the actor or opera singer which is to: Project to the Audience in the Upper Balcony. MORE QUEST: What makes the world's best airline . In the world of seemingly unlimited broadcasting it puts our throats under terrible strain because we don't do it properly. Ask any of my colleagues doing hour after hour of breaking news. Eventually our voices become hoarse and give out. RADA was going to put that right. I started off with a whole load of exercises, the purpose of which seemed obscure. Wiggling hips, shrugging the shoulders, stretching the neck, running my tongue around my teeth and then saying the months of the year with a cork in my mouth. Apparently it's all designed to open up the throat and allow the sound to flow from the vocal chords. Then the breathing. From deep down below, right to the bottom of the belly, to allow the air to carry the sound out of my mouth. It seemed to work. According to those who listened, my voice sounded richer and more rounded, less raspy and desperate. I didn't gasp for air. I was delighted. PART THREE: Greatest fear -- the job comes to the classroom . Then we moved onto presentation style and content. I have been told I sound like gargling with broken glass, although I can't hear that. I know I am loud when I speak -- probably 8 on a scale of ten. Tactfully I was told I was too ""full on,"" and that ""less is more."" I needed to be more aware in my style, less thrusting into the audience's face. And suddenly I felt truly out of my comfort zone. This was feeding my insecurities. So I rebelled. I had tried it out a few times while presenting Quest Means Business and the results were uncomfortably bad. I was so busy trying to remember what I was supposed to be doing, I would forget what I was supposed to be saying and what came next. Of course, I was trying to run before I could walk. Claire, my RADA guide, gently reminded me that it takes time to get this right and that I should not expect changes so quickly. So, what did I learn from my RADA course? Fifteen minutes of movement and breathing before I do a presentation works wonders. It both relaxes those parts of the body that are about to be used and prepares them for the onslaught ahead. And when it works it is wonderful. Psychologically I am much more relaxed before I speak because I feel I am ready. I will never really like standing in front of a large audience, hoping they will like me (a therapist would have a field day with that comment) but at least I am no longer nervous to the point of going to the bathroom multiple times just to get away.

"(CNN) -- Samsung may be the latest company to enter the red-hot wrist-tech market. The South Korean company is planning to announce a new smartphone device that's worn on the wrist in September, according to a report from Bloomberg. The Android powered device will be called the Galaxy Gear and will be able to handle the smartphone basics: phone calls, Web surfing and e-mails, said the report. Samsung will announce the product at an event on September 4, just ahead of the big IFA consumer electronics show in Germany. Samsung declined to comment on the report when contacted by CNN. It would be no surprise that Samsung is investing in wearable technology, which could be the next major gadget category. The wearable tech market is expected to hit $1.5 billion in 2014, a huge leap from the $800 million it's raking in this year, according to a report by Juniper Research. Wrists are the most popular body part for the coming wave of wearable devices, followed by heads. The dream of a smartwatch has been around in popular culture for decades -- cartoon detective Dick Tracy had an early version of one -- but recent advances like smaller, cheaper sensors and low-power Bluetooth technology are finally making it possible to pack powerful features into tinier shells. There are still limitations, and the current crop of wearables are primarily satellite devices that need to pair up with a nearby smartphone to access the Web. If Samsung's Galaxy Gear is more smartphone than accessory, it could stand out from the competition. All the major companies are angling for a piece of the action. Apple is likely developing its own smartwatch, Microsoft is rumored to be producing a prototype smartwatch that would run Windows 8, and Acer says it will release a wearable device in 2014, though it did not specific what type. Sony, Pebble, I'm Watch and other manufacturers already have smartwatches on the market. Meanwhile, Google is working out the kinks on Google Glass, its connected headset due early next year. Simple wearable fitness devices like the FitBit are already extremely popular and many of their features, like monitoring heart-rate or tracking movement, will likely be included in the bigger products.","Samsung expected to announce wristwatch-sized smartphone September 4 .

"Boston (CNN) -- After deliberating for 28 hours over four days, a federal jury Friday broke for the weekend without announcing a verdict in the trial of reputed Boston crime boss James ""Whitey"" Bulger. The eight-man, four-woman panel will resume work at 9 a.m. Monday to continue processing testimony from more than 70 witnesses and over 800 exhibits compiled during the seven weeks of the trial. Bulger, 83, is accused of racketeering, including involvement in 19 killings, and also 13 counts of extortion and money-laundering during a 20-year ""reign of terror"" that defined South Boston from the early '70s through 1995, when Bulger fled Boston. After the jury was dismissed Friday, Bulger waived his rights to a forfeiture hearing on the nearly $822,000 and 30 weapons found in his Santa Monica, California, home where he had been living under an alias until he was arrested in 2011. If he is found guilty, the money and weapons will be forfeited to the government. U.S. District Court Judge Denise Casper asked Bulger if he understood he was giving up his right to have the jury decide whether or not his possessions will be forfeited if he is convicted. ""I understand yes,"" Bulger replied."" On Thursday, the jury asked to see one of the pieces of evidence in the case, a gun with an obliterated serial number. The last charge in the 32-count indictment accuses Bulger of possession of firearms with obliterated serial numbers.

Carney, said he was ""very, very proud of the service these jurors have provided to us no matter what the outcome of the trial."" Carney added that it was difficult waiting for a verdict ""because we invested at this point two years of work to get this case ready for trial."" ""The longer the jury stays out the more it shows us they are as conscientious a jury as I have ever seen,"" Carney said. ""I know that the prosecutors also believe that, the judge believes that. We are very pleased at that."" The widow of one of Bulger's alleged victims said separately that she believed ""the jurors are looking at the situation and trying to do right by all of us."" Patricia Donahue, who has been at the trial almost every day with her three sons, added, ""We been putting our lives on hold since this trial started, it's tough, but it's almost over now."" Still, Donahue said, ""If deliberations go for a long period of time I'm going to start to worry about a mistrial."" 'You're a coward!' widow yells at Bulger . During the seven-week trial, jurors heard dramatic testimony from convicted gangsters, bookies, extortion victims, a disgraced FBI supervisor, ex-drug dealers, retired FBI agents and relatives of people Bulger is accused of killing. Prosecutors called 63 witnesses. The defense called 10. Former hit man John Martorano testified for both sides, for a total of 72 witnesses over 35 days. Bulger never took the stand despite repeated hints from his lawyers throughout trial he would testify. In fact, Bulger seemed to want to testify. Questioned by Judge Casper, Bulger called his decision a ""choice made involuntarily."" Bulger was a fugitive for more than 16 years, disappearing after a crooked FBI agent told him he was about to be indicted on federal racketeering charges. The FBI tracked him down and arrested him in 2011 in Santa Monica, California, where he had been living with his girlfriend under an alias.

"(CNN) -- Thousands of registered sex offenders have received U.S. passports, including at least 30 federal employees, according to a Government Accountability Office report obtained by CNN. The GAO report said the Department of State cannot legally deny passports to registered sex offenders, except those specifically convicted of sex tourism. The report concluded that about 4,500 U.S. passports of the more than 16 million issued in fiscal year 2008 were issued to registered sex offenders. ""Federal statutes authorize the Secretary of State to deny issuance of a passport in certain circumstances, such as while an individual is imprisoned or on parole or supervised release for a conviction for international drug trafficking or sex tourism or is in arrearages for child support,"" the report states. ""However, there is currently no comprehensive program to deny passports to applicants who are registered sex offenders."" The State Department called the report ""very misleading"" and adding it ""conveys more 'shock value' than factual accuracy."" In a written response, the department pointed out that only a fraction of 1 percent of the 16 million passports issued in fiscal year 2008 went to registered sex offenders. In addition, the title of the report ""fails to convey that GAO found no lawful reasons for the department to deny or revoke the passports of the case study sex offenders based on their status as sex offenders."" ""The report appears to suggest, without any foundation, that the Department's issuance of passports to certain Americans facilitated their commission of sex crimes abroad,"" the department's response said. ""There are no facts in the report which show that any of the thirty individuals included in the case studies used his passport to travel to a foreign country to commit a sex crime."" The original title of the report, ""Passports Issued to Thousands of Registered Sex Offenders,"" was later changed to ""Current Situation Results in Thousands of Passports Issued to Registered Sex Offenders."" The GAO report was requested by Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, and Sen. Max Baucus, D-Montana. The GAO studied data from the National Sex Offender Registry (NSOR). However, the approximately 4,500 sex offenders who received passports in fiscal year 2008 ""is likely understated because many of the records in the passport database and the NSOR lacked valid Social Security numbers ... In addition, the NSOR does not currently contain a comprehensive listing of all sex offenders from the states."" The GAO found cases that include a sex offender from Texas who received a passport while in prison, a Delaware man with multiple sex convictions who traveled to the Philippines, Germany and France since receiving his passport, and a Georgia man who has traveled to the Philippines, Ireland and Panama. Among the federal employees who received passports was an aerospace engineer with NASA, an employee of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, and a Postal Service carrier who traveled to Taiwan and Japan after receiving his passport. About 50 of those who received passports either lived outside the United States or ""their whereabouts were unknown,"" the report said. A new law took effect in December 2008 that prohibits anyone convicted of sex tourism from receiving a U.S. passport. However, the report said, the Department of State was not even aware of the law until April of this year after the GAO ""brought this statute to its attention."" ""When Congress passes a law and the president signs it, then the Executive Branch needs to execute it,"" Grassley said in a statement. ""I'm shocked that GAO had to inform the State Department that Congress made individuals convicted of sex tourism ineligible for passports back in December 2008. It's inexcusable that the State Department did nothing to enforce that provision for 14 months. Since someone who is late on child support payments cannot receive a passport, then surely these criminals should also be stopped from traveling internationally."" ""It also is disturbing that the GAO found examples prior to that new law where the State Department issued passports to convicted sex offenders who fled law enforcement, received government housing subsidies, and work for the Post Office. This report raises a lot of serious questions about how effectively the government protects us from child predators,"" Grassley said. The report also studied a group of registered sex offenders -- many who held positions of public trust, including a school teacher, religious layman, and health care provider. ""Other cases involve registered sex offenders who owe child support or are currently in prison or whose whereabouts are unknown,"" the report said. ""... Several of our cases showed that sex offenders left the country and moved to Mexico. According to State officials, Mexico does not have a sex offense registration system, so these offenders are likely unknown to authorities and their neighbors."" The Department of State ""has indicated that it would like to study any proposed legislation to provide additional authority to deny passports to sex offenders, including constitutional, policy and practical issues that may arise in its application and use,"" the report said. ""A State official said that the department recently began working with [the Department of Justice] to develop a procedure for tracking these convictions and a procedure to notify State of those convictions.""","The GAO says about 4,500 registered sex offenders received U.S. passports in fiscal year 2008 .
At least 30 federal employees who are registered sex offenders obtained U.S. passports .
The State Department can only deny passports to those convicted of sex tourism .

"Colorado Springs (CNN) -- Nearly 500 homes have been destroyed in what authorities believe is the worst wildfire in Colorado history. Every single one of them has a story, and there are sure to be plenty more told as Friday's forecast predicts more scorching heat and strong winds. Bill and Karen Moreau are sitting in a hotel room 15 miles away from the home they planned to spend the rest of their lives in. For the past three nights, they've struggled to sleep, dreaming fitfully that they are again walking its 7,000 square feet of hardwood floors. They open their huge front doors, and are immediately soothed by the view from large windows, an expanse of lush timber. ""We had the most beautiful home,"" Karen Moreau said. ""It's just so sad that it's gone."" As firefighters and a cavalcade of responders battle the Black Forest Fire near Colorado Springs, families like the Moreaus are torn between absolute gratitude that they are safe, and sorrow that they've nothing left of their homes besides memories. Residents hope for the best, brace for the worst . Around 3 p.m. Tuesday, Bill Moreau got a call at work from a friend warning him that he'd better get home. The Black Forest Fire was headed toward his neighborhood. That day, there was little indication that the fire would pick up as it has, moving with a ferocity that has shocked seasoned emergency professionals. Moreau met his wife, Karen, and their 30-year-old son, Craig, at home and saw smoke billowing two to three miles away. Just as Californians prepare themselves for an earthquake and Floridians for a hurricane, Colorado residents know what they need to grab from home in case of a wildfire. Because the smoke seemed relatively far away, they thought they had time. ""I said, 'Well, let's get some stuff ready,' "" Bill Moreau said. They grabbed their passports, birth certificates and some clothes. Bill got his computer. ""After a while, it was just random,"" Karen said. ""You start to think, 'Well, what else do I take?' "" Every year of their 34-year marriage, Bill has given her a Santa for Christmas. For a moment, she thought about taking them. ""I thought, 'that's dumb, I really don't need to do that,' "" Karen Moreau said. So she left them. Fleeing a fast-moving fire . The family had three cars, so each person took one. Lucy, the family lab, jumped into Karen's car. Karen and Craig drove away, heading toward the Moreaus' other son's house about five miles away. That son, Kevin, and his wife, Sylvia, had a baby eight days ago. Bill lingered a bit. He watched the fire with a local news photographer. Suddenly, the fire lurched toward them. ""It went through the woods like a demon,"" he recalled. ""It was hard to take your eyes away from it. The smoke didn't go straight up. It billowed, and it churned. It was like it had a life. It was chewing up the woods. Study warns of continued wildfires in western U.S. ""You could hear propane tanks exploding,"" he said. ""Every time [the fire] would hit a house, the smoke would turn jet black for a second. It ran through that neighborhood faster than you could run."" Moreau had to get out, and get out fast. So he pulled out and joined the thick traffic of other people trying to get out. Not long after he arrived at his son Kevin and Sylvia's house, the fire had spread their way. Smoke was billowing above the couple's house. Then, police cars raced up to the home, and officers told everyone to leave. ""Huge air tanker planes were flying right over the house,"" Bill Moreau said. Kevin and Sylvia, concerned about their baby Emmet, tried to keep steady and calm. They asked the Moreaus: What should we take? Karen Moreau told them: Your wedding album, photo albums, Emmet's Pack 'n Play. The entire family jumped into their cars and took off. At this point, drivers were moving fast, and some seemed panicked. ""I almost got hit by someone pulling a horse trailer,"" Bill Moreau said. About 15 miles south, they found a hotel far away from the fire. Watch: Woman records wildfire evacuation . The next day . On Wednesday, around 5 a.m., Bill Moreau was feeling anxious. He couldn't sleep. He was worried about his house. The fire couldn't be that bad, he thought, at least not dangerous enough to keep him from driving in the direction of his home with Lucy in the front seat of his Jeep. He parked about a mile away and hiked the rest of the way in. Relief fell over him. The house was fine. So Bill Moreau sat on his deck, sipped some water while Lucy slurped from her water bowl. Before he left to return to the hotel, he even watered his wife's flowers. Back at the hotel, he was feeling pretty good. Things were going to work out and they'd be home soon enough, he thought. At around 5 p.m. Thursday, Kevin and Sylvia came charging down the hotel hall. ""The look on their faces was ... I was thought, 'Oh, no, did the kids' house burn down?' "" ""And then they said to me, 'Your house is on fire. Turn on the news.' "" He, Karen and the rest of the family watched flames lick their roof. The picture was so clear that Bill Moreau was able to see Lucy's water bowl. ""It's just unbelievable to watch your house burn down on the news,"" he said. 'People have been so nice' On Friday, Karen Moreau said sadness just comes over her and she has to take a minute. She broke down in front of a hotel clerk who walked around the counter to hug her. ""People have been so nice,"" she said. ""I just felt better after she did that."" The baby is bringing more joy than they thought possible. ""Emmet is getting held a lot,"" Bill Moreau said. While the Moreaus try to push on, officials say that the Black Forest Fire has scorched close to 16,000 acres and killed at least two people. Authorities said Friday that they are surveying about 7,000 homes in the area. At an 11 a.m. briefing Friday, El Paso County Sheriff Terry Maketa said workers plan to have a couple of updates about homes throughout the day. Marked units are moving through neighborhoods, and if they see a door ajar or flames approaching a home, they call for firefighters, the sheriff said. He said that he feels more encouraged about results of efforts to battle the Black Forest Fire and that authorities ""gained some tremendous ground"" when it came to identifying hotspots and saving structures. ""To me, it was the turning point we were looking for,"" he said, though he acknowledged conditions could change. Some 750 firefighters have helped contain the blaze by 5%. With the help of helicopters and air tankers, they established a loose perimeter. The fire's evacuation area was 93,000 acres, affecting approximately 38,000 people and 13,000 homes, and the flames were estimated to have burned through 15,700 acres, Maketa said. Are you there?

"(CNN) -- Big spending Monaco paid the price for the indiscretion of their fans last season when held to a goalless draw by Toulouse in Ligue 1 Friday. Claudio Ranieri's men were playing in an empty Stade Louis II Stadium as punishment for scenes at their final home game of the 2012/13 campaign when flares where thrown and the pitch invaded. Lacking atmosphere, Monaco's players could find no inspiration after 2-0 wins over Bordeaux and a 4-1 thumping of Montpellier in their opening matches. Emmanuel Riviere, scorer of four goals in those games, and big money signing Radamel Falcao drew blank, but the former did go close twice against his old side in the first half. A shot from Jeremy Toulalan which struck the crossbar late on was the closest Monaco came to scoring but they will top the French standings ahead of the weekend fixtures. Monaco were taken over by Russian billionaire Dmitriy Rybolovlev and his cash injection saw them promoted from Ligue 2 to become one of the favorites for the title this term after bringing in a clutch of star players, including Falcao from Atletico Madrid. Rybolovlev was among the few people allowed to watch Friday night as well as Monaco's Prince Albert, who saw a game played out in a surreal atmosphere. Meanwhile, Borussia Dortmund went three points clear at the top of the Bundesliga with a 1-0 home win over Werder Bremen. Last season's Champions League finalists made it three wins from three games thanks to a goal from prolific Poland striker Robert Lewandowski. He met Marco Reus's cross in the 55th minute to score the only goal of the game. Bundesliga and European champions Bayern Munich can draw level on points with a win over Nuremberg Saturday. Dortmund had the better of the match from the start, inflicting Bremen's first defeat under new coach Robin Dutt.","Borussia Dortmund beat Werder Bremen 1-0 in Bundesliga .

"(CNN) -- Growing up in rural northeast Pennsylvania, the Philadelphia of my childhood was like the Moscow of Chekhov's ""Three Sisters"" -- the promised land, an emergency exit from my semi-provincial life in Wilkes-Barre. During school trips to see the Liberty Bell or Constitution Hall or the art museum, Philadelphia unfolded like a weird and wonderful tapestry of U.S. history, spanning the colonial era through the post-industrial age. This is the city that gave us Benjamin Franklin, Margaret Mead and Noam Chomsky. It's a town unashamed of the working-class grit that bleeds through the cracked sidewalks of every neighborhood, from Germantown to South Philly to Mantua. People who move to Philly find a je ne sais quoi that's mostly alien to those used to the cloistered wealth of every other coastal city besides Baltimore. It's a city of doers, of hustlers; from the manic suit racing past the glass-and-granite facades of the financial district to the guy scrapping up and down Broad Street with a cart of bootleg DVDs. City Smackdown: Explore Detroit beyond the headlines . It's also dirty, noisy and people there are gruff as hell (in an endearing way!). There is a reason why the show isn't called ""It's Always Sunny in Boston."" I moved to Philly for two years after high school, and the short time I spent there was enough to leave an indelible mark on my memory. I make a point to go back whenever the opportunity presents itself. Sooner or later, like an earworm, the city burrows its way inside your brain and lays eggs: Your first bite of an authentic Philly cheesesteak. An afternoon walk across the sun-dappled grasses of Fairmount Park. Frolicking in the fountain at Logan Square. Tailgating at Lincoln Field before an Eagles game. Destination USA: Passion for Portland triumphs . One day, you look down the Ben Franklin Parkway from the top of the art museum steps, and it hits you: The glittering spires of downtown are more than just skyscrapers. They're almost an act of rebellion, a defiant kiss-off to the collapse of industry that devastated the rest of Pennsylvania and saw the population of Philly shrink by a quarter. Philly is so, so much more than the sum of its touristy trappings. It's a city of stories, a journalist's dream. I've played chess in Rittenhouse Square with grizzled old men who regaled me with tales of how mobsters and rum-runners ruled the streets during the Great Depression. I've chatted up the ex-communist who ran a newsstand on Spring Garden and told me stories of Philly's bygone days as a hotbed of revolutionary-socialist activism. The neat, orderly checkerboard arrangement of the city's streets only belies the turmoil and raw action bubbling underneath the surface. Philadelphia is called the ""city of brotherly love,"" but that's a little bit misleading. The city's spirit of fraternal camaraderie springs from its long-running status as a place for cast-offs, misfits and folks who didn't (or couldn't) fit in anywhere else. Philly chose us as much as we chose it. NYC vs. L.A.: And the winner is ... The Pennsylvania State House was the epicenter of America's revolt from British rule. At the dawn of the 19th century, the city was the temporary U.S. capital while Washington was being built. Irish immigrants fled their homeland by the thousands during the Great Famine, and Philadelphia was one of their main ports of call. Freed African-American slaves on the Great Migration out of the post-Confederate South increased Philly's black population sevenfold in the space of a few years. And today, it's a hub for thinkers, artists and weirdos of every stripe, thanks to the comparatively low cost of living (especially in the long shadow cast by New York), and the city's status as a hub for financial services and information technology. Philadelphia is, putting it mildly, the ultimate underdog city: Part Rocky, part Will Smith, all heart. If you ever have the pleasure of visiting, see the Italian Market and cruise the banks of Schuylkill River on Kelly Drive, for sure. But take some time just to walk and observe and listen.

"Washington (CNN)  -- President Obama has declared a national emergency to deal with the ""rapid increase in illness"" from the H1N1 influenza virus. ""The 2009 H1N1 pandemic continues to evolve. The rates of illness continue to rise rapidly within many communities across the nation, and the potential exists for the pandemic to overburden health care resources in some localities,"" Obama said in a statement. ""Thus, in recognition of the continuing progression of the pandemic, and in further preparation as a nation, we are taking additional steps to facilitate our response."" The president signed the declaration late Friday and announced it Saturday. Calling the emergency declaration ""an important tool in our kit going forward,"" one administration official called Obama's action a ""proactive measure that's not in response to any new development."" Having trouble finding vaccine? Share your story . Another administration official said the move is ""not tied to the current case count"" and ""gives the federal government more power to help states"" by lifting bureaucratic requirements -- both in treating patients and moving equipment to where it's most needed. The officials didn't want their names used because they were not authorized to speak on the record. Obama's action allows Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius ""to temporarily waive or modify certain requirements"" to help health care facilities enact emergency plans to deal with the pandemic. Those requirements are contained in Medicare, Medicaid and state Children's Health Insurance programs, and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act privacy rule. Since the H1N1 flu pandemic began in April, millions of people in the United States have been infected, at least 20,000 have been hospitalized and more than 1,000 have died, said Dr. Thomas Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Watch how to find out if you have H1N1 . Frieden said that having 46 states reporting widespread flu transmission is traditionally the hallmark of the peak of flu season. To have the flu season peak at this time of the year is ""extremely unusual."" The CDC said 16.1 million doses of H1N1, or swine flu, vaccine had been made by Friday -- 2 million more than two days earlier. About 11.3 million of those had been distributed throughout the United States, Frieden said. ""We are nowhere near where we thought we would be,"" Frieden said, acknowledging that manufacturing delays have contributed to less vaccine being available than expected. ""As public health professionals, vaccination is our strongest tool. Not having enough is frustrating to all of us."" Frieden said that while the way vaccine is manufactured is ""tried and true,"" it's not well-suited for ramping up production during a pandemic because it takes at least six months.

"(CNN) -- Federal authorities say they've cracked an international gambling ring calling itself Macho Sports, whose customers would place bets with bookies, by phone and online and -- if they lost -- risked paying a painful price. Authorities allege in the indictment, which was filed in the U.S. District Court for Southern California, that the illicit gambling company curried a ""violent reputation"" for its use of ""intimidation, threats and violence."" In addition to the Peru-headquartered organization itself, 18 individuals face racketeering and illegal gambling charges, states the indictment. The former is punishable by up to 20 years in prison, while the latter charge carries a maximum five-year prison sentence. Fifteen of those individuals were arrested earlier Wednesday in Southern California; Oslo, Norway; and Lima, Peru, the U.S. Attorney's Office for Southern California said in a press release. Authorities took Jan Harald Portocarrero, one of the alleged ringleaders, into custody Wednesday night, said U.S. Attorney's office spokesman Andrew Schopler. At that time, two other people -- Young Hee Koh and Dunzmy June Nguyen -- remained at large, Schopler said. ""Criminal enterprises like 'Macho Sports' and their U.S. based 'bookmakers' prey on gambling addictions of their betting customers, wreaking havoc on people's lives and the lives of family members,"" Daphne Hearn, special agent in charge of the FBI's San Diego office, said in a press release. Brothers Jan Harald Portocarrero and Erik Portocarrero, originally from California, set up Macho Sports International in Panama in 2002, according to Panamanian public documents cited in U.S. authorities' probable cause statement. The company moved its headquarters six years later to Peru, where the Portocarreros had family, though its customers were in California and elsewhere. Over the past decade, customers were invited to place bets on sporting events -- from NFL games to mixed-martial arts fights -- either through a system of bookies, by calling a toll-free phone number or through personal accounts set up on two Internet sites. Macho Sports employed phone operators, bookies, ""sub-bookies,"" runners and collectors to deliver winnings and collect debts from customers, U.S. authorities explained. The probable cause statement features excerpts of several phone wiretaps. In one, a bookie openly worries that he might get arrested, to which Jan Harald Portocarrero replies, ""It's not that easy."" The bookie responds, ""Yeah, but you're 8,000 miles away. You're untouchable."" People involved in Macho Sports spoke about gambling-debt collectors' sometimes violent tactics. Jan Harald Portocarrero, for instance, referred to one who he said ""kidnaps people, strikes them with a gun, and he's walking the streets."" The federal complaint claims that proceeds were laundered ""by inducing customers to pay their gambling losses to various entities that appeared to be unrelated to Macho Sports, such as check-cashing businesses. CNN's Elwyn Lopez contributed to this report.","NEW: Other alleged ringleader is detained; 2 of the 18 charged are at large, spokesman says .

"(CNN) -- The man police say opened fire inside a crowded Colorado movie theater may have been planning the attack for months, the local police chief told reporters Saturday. Suspect James E. Holmes, 24, is accused of killing 12 people and wounding 58 in the suburban Denver community of Aurora. He is also alleged to have rigged his apartment with booby traps so that whoever entered it would be seriously hurt or killed. Holmes received a high volume of deliveries over the past four months to both his home and work addresses, which police believe begins to explain how he got his hands on some of the materials used in the attack and those found at his apartment, said Aurora Police Chief Daniel Oates. ""What we're seeing here is evidence of, I think, some calculation and deliberation,"" he said. ""We have the evidence of a deliberative process to commit this assault, and we have the evidence of a deliberative process in his mind to attack whoever opened the door of his apartment."" ""Make no mistake,"" said Oates, ""this apartment was designed ... to kill."" Authorities continued Saturday making headway on the suspect's home. Technicians, with the help of a robot, worked to handle traps, wires and possible explosive and incendiary devices, according to Jim Yacone, a special agent with the FBI who briefed reporters alongside Oates. Two devices were intentionally detonated at the site. The operation proceeded with an eye toward preserving evidence, all of which will be sent to an FBI lab in Quantico, Virginia, Yacone said. By Saturday evening, police said that ""all hazards"" had been removed from the suspect's apartment. Hundreds of residents were evacuated from five buildings, including the modest, three-story brick building where Holmes told police he had rigged his top-floor, one-bedroom apartment with explosives. All occupants except those who live in the suspect's building were allowed to return home Saturday night, police said. Remembering the victims through photos . At least 26 victims of the shooting remained hospitalized Saturday -- nine in critical condition -- in five hospitals. Grief counselors were staffing area high schools. And the city is planning a vigil Sunday night. Also Sunday, President Barack Obama is expected to be in Aurora to meet with local officials and victims' families. ""I think that overall the community is very, very shaken, and I think we're in shock and I think we're still trying to get our arms around how did such a tragedy happen to us,"" said Rhonda Fields, a Colorado state representative. ""There's a lot of hurt. There's a lot of uncertainty."" As the identities of those who died became public Saturday, Town Center at Aurora reopened for business, though its movie house -- Century Aurora 16 -- remained shuttered. Police Chief Oates said he hoped his officers would be out of the theater by Monday to allow the suspect's defense team in there Tuesday. Theater owners could get the auditorium back Wednesday, he said. Investigators have said little about what may have led the suspect to open fire during a premiere Friday of the Batman sequel ""The Dark Knight Rises."" The sold-out theater was filled with fans, some in costume. The incident began unfolding late Thursday, when Holmes bought a ticket to the midnight show and entered the theater, a law enforcement source involved in the investigation told CNN. Families of victims receive tragic confirmation . But Holmes soon went out a rear door leading from the theater to the parking lot, leaving it propped open, the source said. He gathered weapons before re-entering through the same door, said the source, who was not authorized to release the information. He was back inside the theater a few minutes after the movie had begun and was dressed head-to-toe in black, authorities said. Witnesses described him as wearing a gas mask that concealed much of his face and head. Holmes' hair had been dyed red, and he later told police he was ""the Joker,"" according to a federal law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation. The source was not authorized to release details to the media. The federal law enforcement source's information about the suspect's appearance fits with a statement made to reporters by New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly, who said he had been briefed by Colorado authorities. Police Chief Oates declined to release details about Holmes' appearance other than to describe what he was wearing: a ballistic helmet and protective gear for his legs, throat and groin, black gloves and a gas mask. He said he would not release the booking photo ""for investigative reasons."" Police said Holmes set off two gas-emitting devices before spraying the theater with bullets from an AR-15 rifle, a 12-gauge shotgun and at least one of two .40-caliber handguns that police recovered. ""There was blood everywhere,"" Christina Blache, a shooting victim, told CNN's Don Lemon from her hospital bed Saturday. Her friend was one of those killed. ""You're sitting in a movie theater trying to watch a movie with your friends. Who expects to be shot in a movie theater? None of us did,"" she said. Robots reveal unique setup of suspect's apartment . Holmes had bought the guns legally at stores in the Denver area over the past two months, Oates said. More than 6,000 rounds of ammunition were also purchased online, according to the police chief. A receipt obtained by CNN shows Holmes bought some of the tactical gear, including a vest and a magazine pouch, online on July 2. Want to help? Here's how . Holmes surrendered without resistance within seven minutes of the first 911 calls from moviegoers, Oates said. He was arrested in the theater's rear parking lot. ""If you think we're angry, we sure as hell are angry about what has happened to our city, what has happened to these wonderful people who live here, and also what he threatened to do to one of our police officers,"" the police chief said. Witness: 'Longest minute of my life' The Joker has long been a fixture in Batman comics and was famously portrayed by Heath Ledger in 2008's ""The Dark Knight,"" the predecessor to ""The Dark Knight Rises."" Ledger, who died in 2008, won a posthumous Academy Award for his portrayal of the villain who encourages anarchists to take over Gotham City. Holmes, who is being held in Arapahoe County Jail, is scheduled to appear in court on Monday morning. The court file was sealed, according to a court order. Are you there?

"(CNN) -- Hong Kong is cleaning up Tuesday after a severe typhoon struck the city with gale-force winds and rain, shuttering much of the city and injuring at least 129 people. Typhoon Vicente caused the city to raise its strongest typhoon warning for the first time in 13 years. No fatalities have been reported from the storm, which canceled flights, closed schools and delayed the Tuesday opening of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Government agencies received over 1000 reports of felled trees as well as flood damage. The city has so far opened 24 temporary shelters where 268 people have sought refuge, according to the Home Affairs Department. The last time the city raised a No. 10 warning signal -- the highest for the city -- was in 1999 when Typhoon York blew into Hong Kong, according to observatory records. The tropical cyclone warning signal has since been downgraded to No. 3, which allowed the resumption of full public transportation services, but high rainstorm and landslide warnings remain in effect. A No. 3 signal indicates persistent strong winds blowing at 41-62 kilometers per hour, with gusts that may exceed 110 kilometers per hour. An observatory bulletin issued at 10:45 a.m. local time placed the center of Typhoon Vicente 260 kilometers west of Hong Kong, with winds blowing at average speeds of 63 kilometers per hour or more from the southeast. The typhoon is forecast to move at 22 kilometers per hour into western Guangdong province and cross over to Guangxi province. The pre-opening and morning sessions of the Hong Kong Stock exchange were canceled, as per the exchange's guidelines. The stock exchange will open for trading at 1 p.m. Tuesday local time. Typhoon Vicente roared into Hong Kong on Monday, steadily intensifying throughout the day. The Hong Kong Observatory issued a tropical cyclone warning No. 8 signal on Monday 5:44 p.m. local time, eventually raising it to a No. 10 signal at 12:45 a.m. Tuesday. Tropical cyclone warning signals are intended to warn the public of the threat of winds associated with a tropical cyclone. The Hong Kong Hospital Authority reported 129 people, aged between 4 and 86 years old, sought medical treatment as of 9:30 a.m., and 72 people were admitted for their injuries. During the storm, at least 60 flights at the Hong Kong International Airport were canceled and 60 flights delayed.","Hong Kong is cleaning up after a severe typhoon struck the city Tuesday with gale-force winds and rain .

"(CNN) -- The Pennsylvania woman who resurfaced last month after being missing for 11 years has been sentenced to nearly a year in a Florida county jail, a court clerk said Wednesday. Brenda Heist, 54, was ordered to serve 364 days for violating probation, said Lisa Ates, senior court clerk for the Santa Rosa County Circuit Court in Florida. Heist had been reported missing in Pennsylvania in 2002. On February 15, before she admitted she was the missing woman, Heist was arrested in Florida for falsely using the driver's license of a woman for whom she had previously worked as a cleaning lady, according to police documents. Heist was living under the name Kelsie Smith. Daughter to mom: Rot in hell . Heist had been sentenced to three years of probation for the identity theft and for giving false information to a law enforcement officer. After release from jail in April, she failed to report to authorities and a warrant was put out for her arrest, police records say. Heist turned herself in to authorities in Key Largo, Florida, in May, informing them that she thought she might be wanted in another county. Friends tell different story of woman who reappeared . The responding officer checked her name and saw that she was listed as ""missing and possibly deceased"" from Lititz, Pennsylvania, according to the Monroe County Sheriff's Office in Florida. Authorities in Florida then contacted Lititz Borough police, who confirmed her identity as a woman who had gone missing in 2002. Heist last had been seen dropping off her children at school in Pennsylvania more than a decade ago. She was going through a divorce at the time and was struggling financially. After being approached by a two males and one female who saw her crying in a park, she decided, on a whim, to hitchhike down to Florida with them, said Detective John Schofield of the Lititz Borough Police Department. Opinion: Why there are more walk-away moms . She told police she was homeless for the first two years, living under bridges and eating food thrown out by restaurants after they closed. For the following seven years, she lived in a camper with a man she had met, she said. They made money as day laborers, cleaning boats and doing other odd jobs for which they didn't have to show identification and were paid in cash. After that relationship soured, Schofield said, she lived on the street again for another two years. ""Everything seemed to be going against her while she was on the street,"" Schofield said. ""She was just worn out and at the end of her rope. She didn't want to continue on with her secret life down there."" Heist left behind her ex-husband and two children in Pennsylvania.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Amid a glowing sea of candles and rallying calls for justice, a record crowd packed six football pitches at an annual vigil held in Hong Kong to commemorate the 23rd anniversary of the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown. Organizers announced the highest ever turnout of 180,000 people, while police said the figure was closer to 85,000. By even the most conservative estimates, there were 15,000 more attendees than last year. While the vigil typically features singing, speeches, video messages and tributes, the clear highlight of this year's event was a special appearance by Fang Zheng, a former student protester who had both his legs amputated after he was run over by an army tank during the crackdown. Wheeled onto the center of the stage, Zheng, now 46, effusively thanked the crowd for ""twenty-three years of support."" Over June 3 to 4, 1989, Chinese troops used lethal force to quash a seven-week-long occupation of Beijing's Tiananmen Square by pro-democracy protesters, who were largely comprised of students. Estimates of the numbers killed range from hundreds to thousands of protesters and soldiers. In an outpouring of compassion, a continued sense of injustice, and fears for the future, the vigil attracted a broad spectrum of mourners, ranging from people born after the crackdown to elderly residents who have dutifully come every year. The annual vigil in Hong Kong is the only public commemoration of its kind and scale allowed within China's borders. Volunteer Nicole Lai, 7, handed out bookmarks to passersby at the League of Social Democrats booth alongside her mother. ""Many people died so I'm here to pay my respects,"" she said. Further down Great George Street, a 27-year-old man surnamed Chow held up subversive T-shirts for sale. Although he was only four years old at the time of the crackdown, Chow said he chose to volunteer his services with his friends Monday to ""show his opposition toward the Chinese Communist Party and its disregard for the law."" Michael Pang, 17, has attended the vigil for the past three years out of a sense of civic responsibility. ""Even though I wasn't alive during June 4, we need to take the initiative to stand up for our rights and tell our citizens that we have the responsibility to say no to the Chinese Communist Party."" The Hong Kong Federation of Students who took to the stage echoed his sentiment, declaring, ""Our pain and suffering is the same as that of our parents."" Sitting on bleachers with group of elderly men holding lighted candles in paper cones, 73-year-old Fu Kam-tin said he has been coming to the vigils nearly every year since 1989. Fu, who emigrated from the mainland at age 12, called the Tiananmen massacre ""the most apparent example in China's history of the strong bullying the weak."" He says he continues to be ""very angry and unsettled by these corrupt officials who are harming our country and harming the world."" Ms. Chan Shu-ying said she still has a deep impression of attending a protest in 1989 against the crackdown alongside thousands of Hong Kongers in Happy Valley. Now 53, Chan said, ""Coming here every year will fulfill my dream of June 4 being redressed and the democratization of China's political system."" The bumper crowd gathered in Victoria Park amid a politically turbulent year in both Hong Kong and mainland China. Hong Kong's new Chief Executive, Leung Chun-ying, is due to take office on the first of July after being chosen to lead the special administrative region of China. The lack of universal suffrage and uneasiness over the mainland government's influence over local affairs have long been contentious issues in Hong Kong. Leung is perceived by some to take a hard-line approach toward public freedoms. He has been criticized in recent days for refusing to comment on the vigil and the massacre. China has also encountered multiple political scandals in the run-up to the once-in-a-decade Communist party leadership change this fall, most notably the murky corruption-cum-murder case involving disgraced Chongqing party chief Bo Xilai, and the fleeing of blind human rights activist Chen Guangcheng to the U.S. ""All problems need to be solved; evasion is not a way out,"" Chen said, in an open letter urging the Chinese government to institute democratic reforms and address the Tiananmen incident. His letter was posted to the website of the vigil's organizer, the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China. During Monday's vigil, Alliance chairman Andrew Lee Cheuk-yan took to the stage to lead the crowd in chants of ""Never forget June 4!"", ""Redress June 4!"", ""Persevere to the end!"" Lee said that more than 10,000 visitors had already passed through the temporary Tiananmen Square memorial museum in Sham Shui Po, which opened in late April. He said he hoped last night's cash donations and T-shirt sales would help the alliance establish a permanent museum to commemorate June 4 in Hong Kong.","A record 180,000 people attend a Hong Kong vigil to commemorate 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama faces a long list of issues when he steps to the podium in the White House East Room on Friday for a news conference. The last time he took questions from reporters was June 30, during his trip to Africa. Since then, the White House has embarked on a campaign-style tour pushing its economic agenda, while unforeseen issues like the recent unprecedented embassy closures because of a terror threat and the strained relationship with Russia over NSA leaker Edward Snowden have taken center stage. With all those as possible topics for reporters to press the president on -- here are some questions that could come up. 1. The administration recently made the decision to close embassies around the world, evacuate diplomatic staff in Yemen and Pakistan and elevate the terror alert. Does the fact al Qaeda is capable of causing such a reaction contradict your administration's claim that it has been decimated? The State Department this week closed nearly two dozen embassies and consulates in the Middle East and Africa amid fears of an al Qaeda attack. Many in the diplomatic and intelligence community called the decision, which was sparked by an intercepted message among senior al Qaeda operatives, unprecedented. In an interview on Tuesday on the ""Tonight Show"" with Jay Leno, Obama called the threat ""significant enough that we are taking every precaution."" Just before Election Day in 2012, Obama made an impassioned speech in Green Bay, Wisconsin, in which he said, ""The war in Afghanistan is winding down. Al Qaeda has been decimated."" This latest revelation that a message from al Qaeda led to the closures has called the assessment into question. White House press secretary Jay Carney said the White House stood by that idea this week. ""It's leadership decimated and there's no question it's on the run,"" Carney said, drawing a distinction from the terrorist group's leadership and splinter groups. ""There's no question that core al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan has been severely diminished."" 2. Long before admitted NSA leaker Edward Snowden entered the picture, relations between the United States and Russia were deteriorating. Your administration said that your planned summit with Russian leader Vladimir Putin would probably have been canceled even with Russia granting Snowden asylum because there would be little to talk about. How does the United States improve relations with Russia with so many issues between the two countries? On Wednesday, the White House officially announced what many in the media had been speculating: Obama would not meet Putin in September ahead of the G-20 summit in St. Petersburg. The White House cited a lack of progress on a number of bilateral issues, but admitted that Russia's decision to grant temporary asylum to Snowden, the former government contractor who leaked classified documents, was a factor in the decision. In the past, Obama has been dismissive of Snowden. While on his trip through Africa, Obama said he wasn't ""going to be scrambling jets to get a 29-year-old hacker"" and in the ""Tonight Show"" interview, Obama said he wanted to see Snowden back in the U.S. to face trial ""with a lawyer and due process."" A senior administration official told CNN on Wednesday that ""we just hadn't gotten any traction"" on issues that the summit would have addressed, including missile-defense and a reduction in nuclear missiles. Attempts to find common ground on economic and trade agreements as well as differing approaches on Syria also were problematic. 3. Your campaign and other Democrats leveled a number of hard ""War on Women"" charges against Mitt Romney and Republicans. Yet, in the past month, three Democratic politicians -- Anthony Weiner and Eliot Spitzer in New York and Bob Filner in San Diego -- have put their issues with women front and center and are asking for support. As the leader of the Democratic Party, how do you feel that these three men represent your party? And would you vote for them if you were able to? During the 2012 campaign, Democrats and the Obama campaign regularly hit GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney for some of his socially conservative positions. In July 2012, the Obama campaign released an ad attacking Romney's stance on women's issues. ""I've never felt this way before, but it's a scary time to be a woman,"" a woman, staring directly at the camera, said. ""Mitt Romney is just so out of touch."" But in the past few months, Weiner, Spitzer and Filner have made headlines for their issues with women. Eleven women have accused Filner, the mayor San Diego, of sexual harassment while he was mayor or a congressman from California. Weiner -- whose ""sexting"" scandal forced his resignation from Congress in 2011 -- is now running for mayor of New York, all while being dogged by new revelations around the same issue. And Spitzer, who resigned as New York governer in 2008 after it was revealed he had an solicited prostitutes, is now running for New York comptroller. Obama has yet to comment on the issue, but Carney told reporters last month that the president was more focused on economic growth, and that the White House would not comment on Weiner or Filner. 4.) The state exchanges and marketplaces for Obamacare will go into effect in a few months and some states have already begun publishing their new premium costs. What are your thoughts about the increased premiums? Do you think the fact that some states will experience such high increases discredits the law? Will it make it more difficult to meet enrollment goals? Although enrollment in Obamacare state exchanges begins on October 1, with the coverage the plans provide actually kicking in at the start of 2014, many states have been preparing for the health care changes by releasing preliminary plans and rates. In some states, insurances purchasers wouldn't be blamed for suffering from a bit of sticker shock. According to Florida officials, premiums for the mid-level insurance plan will rise between 7.6% and 58.8%, depending on the insurer. The average increase in the state would be 35%. Ohio officials, meanwhile, compared trade association's report of premiums available today with the average premiums expected for the exchange and found the price would increase 41%. Earlier this week, Carney said the implementation of Obamacare ""is very much a high priority of the president's, and he is engaged in discussions about progress being made on implementation, as you would expect, and certainly the rest of the administration is."" 5.) You told Democrats on Capitol Hill last week that you wouldn't negotiate on the debt ceiling when Congress returns in September. Why did you choose to take such a hard line so early? And you have been in these congressional negotiations before -- what have you learned from past debt negotiations that many have said did not go well? When Obama met with Capitol Hill Democrats last week, a senior Democrat told CNN that the president told legislators that he is ""not negotiating on debt ceiling,"" but that he will ""look at a reasonable plan if the Republicans have one."" Jack Lew, Obama's treasury secretary, backed up those comments on multiple Sunday show appearances, including with CNN. ""Congress has to do its work,"" Lew told Fox News Sunday. One of the first things lawmakers must do in September is fund the government past September 30, when the 2013 fiscal year ends. On top of that, according to estimates by economists and budget experts, the nation's borrowing authority, or debt ceiling, will need to be raised sometime before mid-November. Obama has been here before. In 2011, he and House Speaker John Boehner negotiated with one another over the debt ceiling. Those negotiations eventually collapsed -- ultimately ending in acrimony. ""If I look back over the year and a half or so that I've been speaker, my greatest disappointment was that the president and I couldn't come to an agreement in solving our debt crisis,"" Boehner told CNN White House Correspondent Jessica Yellin in a 2012 interview.","Long list of questions Obama could be asked -- from terror threats to U.S.-Russia relations, to the economy .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The judge overseeing Michael Jackson's estate and the custody of his children ordered an investigation into Paris Jackson's apparent suicide attempt. Paris, 15, is in a Los Angeles hospital at least until Saturday for evaluation after an incident early Wednesday in which she cut her wrist and called a suicide counseling hot line. ""We're completely supportive of the judge's action,"" Perry Sanders, the lawyer for Katherine Jackson, said Friday. Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Mitchell Beckloff signed the order Thursday instructing Probate Court Investigator Cary Ornelas ""to prepare an investigation report addressing the status"" of Paris Jackson and ""recent media reports concerning her welfare."" Beckloff appointed Michael Jackson's mother, Katherine Jackson, to be sole guardian of Prince, Paris and Blanket soon after the singer's sudden death on June 25, 2009. Her guardianship was briefly suspended after she disappeared and was out of communication for more than a week last summer. The children's cousin T.J. Jackson, who was appointed guardian while the family matriarch was missing, was then made a co-guardian. In addition to the hospitalization of Paris, the probate investigator may also be checking on T.J. Jackson's participation. A media report said he no longer lives at the Jacksons' Calabasas, California, home. ""It's absolute fiction that T.J. is an absentee guardian,"" Sanders said. ""He's always around.""","Judge cites ""recent media reports concerning her welfare"" as reason for investigation .

"(CNN) -- Last week, House Republicans voted to delay the implementation of the individual mandate of the Affordable Care Act, trying to take advantage of President Obama's announcement that the employer mandate will be delayed for a year. The vote is purely symbolic as there is no chance that the Senate will pass the bill. Striking a populist tone, Republicans argued that individuals should be afforded the same rights as big businesses. The response of the GOP is predictable, as House Republicans have been steadfast in their efforts to block the administration from making progress on any new bills and to cause problems for those that are already on the books. The hope of conservatives like Paul Ryan is that this is just the first step. Karl Rove's Crossroads also released a video called ""ObamaCareNado,"" playing on the television movie phenomenon ""Sharknado,"" with the announcer warning that ""Nobody is safe from its wrath."" The video throws in a healthy dose of IRS images, just in case anyone thought that scandal would be soon laid to rest. And on yesterday's ""Face the Nation"", Speaker John Boehner called Obama's health care law ""not ready for prime time"" and promised further action to seek to block it, saying, ""we're going to stay at it."" But if House Republicans keep pushing too hard against the Affordable Care Act, they could easily open up more internal fissures, creating a party that is even more fraught with tensions as the presidential election of 2016 comes closer. The strategy of congressional Republicans toward the health care program has evolved. At first, Republicans were relatively unified in their opposition, both during the debate over the passage of the legislation in 2009 and 2010 and in the two years that followed with the early stages of implementation. During that time, almost every Republican consistently challenged the argument that the legislation would improve the overall quality of the nation's health care system and make it more equitable. Republicans also challenged its constitutional legitimacy. But those arguments started to fade away among Republicans, first when the Supreme Court ruled that the law was constitutional in June 2012 and then when President Obama was re-elected. The internal tensions among Republicans became worse over the past few months as the states needed to make decisions about whether to take an infusion of federal Medicaid funding that was part of the legislation, a key component that would help insure more of the poor. Not only did many red-state Republicans believe this funding would help constituents, but they also heard from doctors and hospitals that depend on Medicaid to survive. When Congress originally passed the bill, most Republican governors had steadfastly insisted that they would not accept the funds. But those objections started to fade away for many in the GOP when the money was actually before them. Many stalwart conservative governors, like Rick Scott in Florida, John Kasich in Ohio, and Jan Brewer in Arizona said they would take the funds despite previous statements. They found themselves in open conflict with their own Republican legislatures over the issue. Those tensions have not all been resolved, but the support of Republican governors for the money changed the political dynamics quite significantly. Now the challenges for the House Republicans who are still opposing the bill are becoming even more difficult -- despite all the press about how the delay in the employer mandate signals huge challenges -- as concrete benefits start to roll out. This was already clear when younger Americans under 26 started to enjoy continued coverage under their parents' plans, a fact not forgotten in the election when the youth vote swung to Obama once again. Now the challenges are intensifying. The same week that there was all the discussion about the delay of the mandate, and as Republicans were trying to seize advantage from the delay, The New York Times reported more visible signs of what the program may bring. For those who don't receive benefits through their employers and will purchase benefits through health care exchanges, the cost of insurance will fall by 50% or more. In New York City an individual could see his or her bill drop from $1,000 a month to $308 a month. Similar declines have been reported in California and Oregon. Unless something goes terribly wrong for ACA, House Republicans might want to think twice about continuing with their attacks on this program. As ACA gets further away from the period when the program was most vulnerable, and as the administration is getting closer to the period when the benefits start rolling out, more constituents -- in red and blue states -- will cast a skeptical eye toward any legislator who tries to take away their benefits. Speaker John Boehner, already struggling as House Republicans make decisions on immigration that could have detrimental effects on the political standing of the party, might want to move on to different issues. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer.","House Republicans voted to delay Affordable Care Act's individual health care mandate .

"(CNN) -- Rotterdam is home to Europe's largest international port. But as countless vessels pass through the bustling shipping hub each day, the environmental toll is far from light. In fact, Rotterdam emits a whopping 29.8 tonnes of carbon per capita, one of the highest in the world. In comparison, the Dutch city beats London's carbon emissions at 9.6 tonnes per capita and Shanghai at 11.7 tonnes per capita. To put that into perspective, the global average is about 4.6 tonnes per capita. Now Mayor Ahmed Aboutaleb has plans to make Rotterdam the most sustainable port city in the world by cutting its carbon footprint by 50 percent. With a greener future ahead, CNN takes a look at five sustainable initiatives planned for the Dutch port city. 1. Floating homes . To cope with rising sea levels, Rotterdam plans to build floating urban districts calling for 13,000 climate-proof floating homes in by 2040 -- of which around 1,200 would be built on top of the water. To showcase how this might work, the Rotterdam Climate Initiative commissioned the ""Floating Pavilion"". Constructed by Dura Vermeer, the three transparent interconnected domes are perfectly positioned in the Rotterdam City Harbor, Rijnhaven. Not only is the structure almost entirely self sufficient due to the solar powered heating and air conditioning, it's also built with a special plastic material, which is 100 times lighter than glass. 2 .Water plazas . Rotterdam's waterways may be responsible for a bulk of the city's prosperity -- but that's not to say that the day to day living below sea level is easy for its residents. To combat the heavy rainfall, urban design and planning company De Urbanisten came up with the concept of constructing water plazas that serve as the perfect solution to holding excess water and take the pressure off the sewerage system. When the city's water system has enough capacity, the rainwater in the plaza can be diverted to the nearest open water. What's more is the water plazas can also be used as a playground when dry. Read more: One thing you'd change in your city . 3. Green rooftop revolution . Nothing paints a more sustainable urban picture than green rooftops. While Rotterdam already has some 100,000 square meters of sprawling green across its skyline, the city expects to cover 160,000 square meters by the end of 2014. To spur the green rooftop movement, Rotterdam kicked off a scheme to help residents fund the installments. Not only do green patches provide a buffer to help absorb excess rainwater, but they also clear the atmosphere and slow down roof erosion, according to Rotterdam Climate Initiative. So far, you can find the greenery on top of a slew of the city's buildings including the Municipal Archives, the Central Library, the head office of Unilever Nederland, the Maasstad Hospital, the Sophia Children's Hospital and the museum Villa Zebra. 4. Sustainable port . Rotterdam's Port Authority says it wants to become the most sustainable port city in the world by 2015 and it has also committed to cutting its carbon emissions by half of 1990s levels by 2025. One way it hopes to reach this goal is by allocating 80 hectars of land around the port to biobased companies. While Rotterdam has more than 45 chemical companies, five oil refineries and several power plants, the port also houses 10 production companies that use renewable energy as their raw material. Dutch scientists have also examined how to better capture and store CO2 emissions by developing a new ship coating that will lower algae growth. Another proposition in the works is to examine the usage of new collapsible containers that could save space and in turn cut trips. Read more: Rise of London's pedal culture . 5. Public transport for nature . A sustainable city is one that looks after not only its human population, but also its wildlife, plants and insects. That's why Rotterdam's landscape architecture firm Openfabric has proposed a way to utilize the city's public transport network to ""make them suitable for both humans and the biodiversity"". Dubbed ""Diverse Networks"", the initiative would allow them to link up some of the hotspots for the city's wildlife. Rotterdam's public transportation could be transformed into green corridors that could bring butterflies, dragonflies, crickets and grasshoppers into the city center. If implemented, bus stops and metro stations could provide shelter for the people and foraging for the birds and insects.","Rotterdam's population totals 615,000 .
90% of the city is below sea level and is therefore facing a high risk of flooding.
Rotterdam aims to become the most sustainable port city in the world."
"(CNN) -- A gun assault and a separate bombing have killed at least 40 people in two days in the city of Quetta in Pakistan. Both attacks seemed to target local officials. Militants sprayed bullets into cars near a mosque Friday in the capital of the province of Balochistan, killing 10 people on the Muslim holy day of Eid, police said. At least 30 others were wounded in the attack before prayers. On Thursday, a suicide bombing tore through the funeral of a police official in Quetta, killing 30 people and wounding at least 40 others. In Friday's attack, a former provincial lawmaker was stepping into the mosque when about a dozen men opened fire, said police spokesman Mir Zubair Mehmood. Half of those killed where the politician's bodyguards. The others were civilians. The assault drew intense return fire, which lasted for half an hour, a witness said. The battle sent people rushing for cover into the mosque, said Muhammad Ejaz, who was there to pray. Police have arrested eight suspects who had explosives and weapons. ""We have launched search operations in different parts of the city,"" Mehmood said. They have also tightened security after the two attacks. There has been no claim of responsibility in either Thursday's or Friday's attack. Elsewhere in Balochistan, militants stopped a bus Tuesday, kidnapped 13 people and took them to nearby mountains, where they shot them to death. Many possible assailants . The area around Quetta is plagued by strife. It is close to the border with Afghanistan, and members of the Taliban often cross into Pakistan. Local militants in the province, which is rich in natural gas, have been fighting Pakistani national military forces for self-rule. For years, the Balochistan Liberation Army has complained that the government pays little attention to people and their economic needs. During national elections this year, the province saw violent attacks on polling places. Bombers struck voters who had just cast their ballots as well as candidates and their supporters. The Pakistani Taliban, or Tehrik-i-Taliban, are also believed to foment unrest in the province in the country's southwest. Sectarian attacks on ethic Shiite Muslims by fundamentalist Sunni Muslims are also common. CNN's Simon Harrison contributed to this report.","NEW: Police tighten security after violence Thursday and Friday .

"Washington (CNN) -- Roughly half of all Americans now think the White House was behind the Internal Revenue Service decision to target conservative political groups, according to a recent CNN/ORC International poll, a growing belief at odds with information recently provided to CNN by congressional investigators. The information includes a full transcript of the May 21 deposition of Holly Paz, a high-ranking IRS official placed on administrative leave as a result of her role in the scandal. Paz was questioned extensively by investigators from the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, which is chaired by one of the administration's fiercest congressional critics, California GOP Rep. Darrell Issa. The transcript of Paz's deposition, examined by CNN this week, shows an agency plagued more by bureaucratic ineptitude than partisan political scheming. IRS agents are revealed as politically tone deaf and blind to what was being done, or not done, in different offices that presumably should have been in closer contact. ""Politics was not something they were interested in,"" Paz told investigators. ""Because they are so apolitical, they are not as sensitive as we would like them to be as to how things might appear."" Paz is a top official at the IRS division responsible for reviewing applications for tax-exempt status. Some critics argue the division intentionally intimidated and harassed tea party and other conservative groups, often delaying the processing of their applications for months or years. An inspector general's report released last month found that an IRS unit in Cincinnati had used criteria that included conservative labels such as ""tea party"" to target certain groups for extra questioning. IRS rules prevent groups engaged in excessive political activity from becoming tax exempt, but the agency has struggled to develop clear guidelines on the matter. The targeting began in 2010 and ended last year when senior IRS officials learned of it, according to the report. Boehner: 'Who is going to jail' over IRS scandal . Last month, 37% of the public thought the White House was tied to the IRS controversy. Now, 47% say the White House was directing the IRS, according to the latest CNN/ORC International survey. Democrats are sensitive to the charge, which some analysts contend has contributed to a recent drop in President Barack Obama's approval ratings. Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings, the top Democrat on Issa's panel, released the full transcript on Tuesday of the deposition of a self-described ""conservative Republican"" IRS manager who has denied any administration involvement in the scandal. The manager also insisted that the initial decision to flag tea party groups for additional scrutiny originated with lower level IRS staff in Cincinnati, not upper management in Washington or elsewhere. ""This interview transcript provides a detailed first-hand account of how these practices first originated, and it debunks conspiracy theories about how the IRS first started reviewing these cases,"" Cummings said. ""Releasing this transcript serves the best interest of Congress and the American people by ensuring that there is an accurate and fair picture of the management challenges facing the IRS."" Obama: IRS actions ""intolerable and inexcusable"" The move by Cummings drew a sharp rebuke from Issa, who has also released certain elements of the investigation at different points. ""I am deeply disappointed that Ranking Member Cummings has decided to broadly disseminate and post online a 205 page transcript that will serve as a roadmap for IRS officials to navigate investigative interviews with Congress,"" Issa said. ""Americans who think Congress should investigate IRS misconduct should be outraged by Mr. Cummings' efforts to obstruct needed oversight."" Issa and Cummings have both promised in appearances on CNN's ""State of the Union"" to release transcripts of all of the depositions conducted in the investigation. For her part, Paz told investigators from two House committees that questions about certain applications often remained unanswered because IRS agents were simply ""waiting for guidance"" from Washington that was never provided. Meanwhile, agency leaders in Washington remained unaware that applicants were not receiving final answers. Paz was under the impression that the ""tea party"" label was internal IRS shorthand for all cases regarding groups involved in campaign politics. ""It was really just an efficient way to refer to this issue,"" Paz told investigators, noting that the first case identified with political campaign activity related to an application from a tea party group. ""It's like calling soda 'Coke' or you know, tissue 'Kleenex.' They knew what they meant, and the issue was campaign intervention."" Applications for tax-exempt status ""was an area that did not get a great deal of attention ... outside the IRS,"" Paz added. ""It's only been in recent years that it's something that has gotten, you know, more media attention and congressional attention."" Many IRS employees have been with the agency ""for decades"" and ""were used to a world where how they talked about things internally was not something that would be public or that anyone would be interested in,"" Paz said. ""So I don't think they thought much about how it would appear to others. They knew what they meant, and that was sort of good enough for them."" Paz insisted she never took part in any discussion about targeting conservatives. She also noted other cases in recent years involved a denial of tax-exempt status for liberal groups, an assertion challenged by critics. ""I had no indication that we were not being balanced in what we were doing,"" she said. Paz noted that she was personally involved in a review of roughly 40 cases in the fall of 2010, an acknowledgment undercutting claims that the Cincinnati office was solely to blame for the debacle. Roughly half of the cases involved groups with the words ""tea party"" in the name. Tea party and other conservative activists are planning to hold a rally on Capitol Hill on Wednesday to protest the IRS actions.","Deposition of IRS official Holly Paz shows no political motivation behind IRS scandal .

"(CNN) -- Here is a look at what you need to know about the solstice. Summer solstice will take place on June 21, 2013. Summer solstice in the Northern Hemisphere occurs on June 20, 21, or 22, when the sun reaches its most northerly point, directly overhead at the Tropic of Cancer (23 degrees 27 minutes north latitude). The summer solstice is the longest day of the year and marks the beginning of summer. Winter solstice in the Northern Hemisphere occurs on December 21 or 22, when the sun appears at its most southerly position,directly overhead at the Tropic of Capricorn (23 degrees 27 minutes south latitude). The winter solstice is the shortest day of the year and marks the beginning of winter. It is the exact opposite in the Southern Hemisphere. A solstice is different from an equinox, the two times each year when the sun is directly above the Earth's equator and day and night are of equal length. Equinoxes mark the beginning of spring (March) and fall (September). Solstice loosely translated in Latin is ""sun stands still"". For several days before and after each solstice the sun appears to stand still in the sky, i.e., its noontime elevation does not seem to change from day to day. Historically, the solstice has been celebrated by numerous cultures around the world. Thousands of people annually celebrate the summer solstice at Stonehenge in Wiltshire, England. At sunrise at Stonehenge on the longest day of the year, the rising sun appears behind one of the main stones, creating the illusion that the sun is balancing on the stone. The site was closed for 16 years after rioting broke out between police and revelers for several years at solstice gatherings. Stonehenge was re-opened to the public on Solstice in 2000.","The solstice happens twice each year when the sun is at either its northernmost or southernmost position .

"Colombo, Sri Lanka (CNN) -- A day after a simmering dispute over the location of a new mosque in Sri Lanka's capital escalated into an attack by a Buddhist mob, the government says the issue has been resolved. The incident happened Saturday night in Grandpass, a northern sector of Colombo, which is home to a large Muslim population. Police officials say at least five people were injured in the violence, including two police officers. Police commandos and riot squads were moved into the area, and police reimposed a curfew for a second night Sunday. Colombo's Muslim mayor called it a ""dastardly attack,"" and told CNN that this was the latest in a string of such incidents. ""We appeal to the government to ensure such attacks do not recur since the right to worship is enshrined in our Constitution,"" said A.J. Mohamed Muzzamil. ""The government should bring the perpetrators of this attack"" to justice immediately, he added. The U.S. Embassy in Colombo also expressed its concern. ""This incident is particularly troubling in the light of a number of recent attacks against the Muslim community in Sri Lanka,"" the embassy said in a statement. ""Targeting any place of worship should never be permitted and we urge calm from all sides. We call for prosecution of perpetrators in this attack and an end to religious based violence. The right of all Sri Lankans to practice the religion of their choice should be protected."" The rumblings of trouble began about a year ago, when the mosque opened. It was built to replace an older place of worship about half a mile (800 meters) away, which had been earmarked for demolition in line with city development work. The new mosque was just a thousand feet away (300 meters) from a Buddhist temple, and many Buddhist worshipers had objected to the proximity. Their grievance came to a head Saturday night, just a day after Muslims celebrated the end of Ramadan. Dozens of local Buddhists took to the streets to vent their anger. But after holding talks with Muslim leaders and the clergy on both sides, the government announced Sunday that the dispute had been sorted out. Technology Minister Champika Ranawaka, who is also the general secretary of a Buddhist nationalist group, told reporters that the new building would cease to function as a mosque. Instead, the mosque will move back to its original position, and the demolition order will be rescinded. Extensive restoration will be carried out on the building. However, the area remains under tight security. Muslims make up about 7% of Sri Lanka's population of 20 million, the majority of whom are Buddhists.

"(CNN) -- Florida's endangered manatees have long suffered from human activity, but this year they face an especially deadly threat hidden in the waters where they swim. An algae bloom off southwest Florida, called Florida red tide, has killed 174 manatees since January, the highest number to die from red tide in a calendar year, state wildlife officials said Monday. A red tide is a higher than normal concentration of a microscopic algae that appears in the Gulf of Mexico. At high enough concentrations, the algae can turn the water red or brown, hence the name. Red tides happen almost every year in southwest Florida and sometimes last just a few weeks, but this year the red tide has lingered and settled in an area of warm water where the manatees have migrated. ""It's kind of filled in an area where they've congregated and are feeding on sea grass where the toxins settle on,"" said Kevin Baxter, a spokesman for the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. Those toxins can affect the central nervous systems of fish and other vertebrates, causing the animals to die. Wildlife officials and their partners have this year rescued 12 manatees suffering from the effects of red tide. They asked the public to alert them to other ailing manatees who may be showing a lack of coordination and stability in the water, muscle twitches or seizures, and difficulty lifting their heads to breathe. Unlike other algae blooms, red tides are not caused by pollution, the wildlife service said. ""Red tides occurred in Florida long before human settlement, and severe red tides were observed in the mid-1900s before the state's coastlines were heavily developed,"" the commission said. The blooms usually develop 10 to 40 miles offshore, away from man-made nutrient resources, it added. Red tides were documented in the southern Gulf as far back as the 1700s and along Florida's Gulf coast in the 1840s, the commission said. ""Fish kills near Tampa Bay were even mentioned in the records of Spanish explorers."" Manatees are listed under the Endangered Species Act of 1973. Conservation efforts have led to an increase in the manatee population, the commission said, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is working on a rule that would reclassify the manatee from endangered to threatened. Most manatees die from collisions with watercraft or from ""cold stress"" in chilly waters, Baxter said.","174 manatees have died since January .

"Fort Hood, Texas (CNN) -- The prosecution rested its death penalty case Tuesday against the Army psychiatrist charged with a shooting rampage at Fort Hood that left 13 people dead, clearing the way for the man acting as his own attorney to put on a defense. Maj. Nidal Hasan, 42, is defending himself against 13 counts of murder and 32 counts of attempted murder in the November 5, 2009, attack, raising the question of whether he will take the stand. ""If you choose to testify, it is your choice and your choice solely,"" the judge, Col. Tara Osborn, told Hasan. ""If you do testify, you have to ask yourself questions. ... You can't simply give a statement. It has to be in a question-and-answer format."" Will Hasan testify? Hasan previously indicated that he intended to call himself and two witnesses to the stand. If he testifies, Hasan is expected to discuss religious justification for his actions. But there was a question whether Hasan would even put on a defense after he told the court Tuesday morning he no longer wished to call Dr. Lewis Rambo, an expert on religious conversion. A day earlier, he told the court he would not call Tim Jon Semmerling, who specializes in mitigating factors in criminal cases. Even so, the judge ordered Rambo to appear in court to speak with Hasan before he made a decision, prompting Hasan to challenge the order. ""I object. I'm not going to be using him,"" Hasan said. ""To waste his time when he has more pressing matters to attend to doesn't seem fitting."" The judge noted his objection, but ordered the witness to appear in court. ""Then if you decide you don't want to have him as a witness after you talk face-to-face, then that's fine,"" Osborn said. Fast Facts: Soldier-on-Soldier Attacks . Much has been made of Hasan's defense or, as his stand-by attorneys have said, the lack of it. The judge declined a request by Hasan's attorneys to drop out of the case. The attorneys argued that they were helping the prosecution put him to death. Hasan admitted to opening fire in a processing center for soldiers deploying to Afghanistan and Iraq, telling a military jury of 13 officers during his opening statement: ""The evidence will clearly show that I am the shooter."" The judge has barred Hasan from arguing he acted in the ""defense of others,"" claiming he carried out the shooting to protect Taliban leaders in Afghanistan from the U.S. military. Declining to cross-examine witnesses . Just as he has throughout most of the court-martial, Hasan declined to cross-examine the prosecution's final witnesses -- most of whom testified about the chaotic final minutes of the shooting. Fort Hood victims feel betrayed . The day of the shooting, photographer Steven Bennett was taking pictures of a college graduation ceremony for soldiers who had obtained their degrees. Bennett took pictures of the final minutes of the shooting, capturing images of Hasan outside the deployment processing center and then the shootout with police. The final photo shows Hasan lying on the ground bleeding as a police officer checks his pulse. Asked if he recognized the man in the courtroom, Bennett pointed at Hasan: ""The bearded individual."" Hasan has refused to shave, citing his religious beliefs. The judge on Monday raised again concerns about Hasan acting as his own attorney after he admitted last week he did not understand that by listing someone as a witness he gave up the right of privileged communication with that person. ""Remember when I told you that I thought you would be better off with a trained lawyer?"" Osborn asked. Hasan responded: ""Repeatedly."" ""I've advised you before and I'm advising you again that it's not a good policy to represent yourself. ... Do you understand that?"" Osborn said. Hasan said: ""Yes, I do.""

"(CNN) -- A Pennsylvania man is facing charges after he, possibly with the help of his own sons, allegedly doused his girlfriend's 7-year-old son in nail polish remover and filmed the child being set on fire. Edward Myers, 35, of Saxonburg, Pennsylvania, was home with his two sons and then-girlfriend Laure Halliwell's 7-year-old son beginning around 2 p.m. on May 25, according to court documents. Halliwell told police that when she returned, her son was sitting on the couch with burns on his neck and face. She brought him to the hospital and doctors called police to the scene. The boy told authorities that at some point in the afternoon, Myers and his two sons had started shooting him with pellet guns and that Myers threw a substance from the stove that ""felt like sand"" at his face. All the while, the child told authorities Myers was filming him with a cell phone camera. Myers then allegedly followed the boy to the bathroom and poured nail polish remover over him. The boy said that his shirt was then purposefully lit on fire by either Myers or one of his sons, ages 11 and 15, according to the complaint. There is no evidence that an ambulance was called to the house to help the boy, who had third-degree burns on his chin, neck, chest and face, covering approximately 10% of his body, according to documents. He also had a hematoma on his forehead, which was consistent with his claims of being hit with pellets. According to the criminal complaint, Myers initially claimed he had been cleaning hair dye from the sink and had spilled nail polish remover on the boy. He told Halliwell that her son had then walked into Myers' son's room, where a lit cigarette fell onto his shirt, causing it to ignite. Police searched the Myers residence on May 26 and seized several cell phones, a pellet gun, a paintball gun, and an Air Soft pistol. Police said during the search Myers and his two sons repeatedly referred to the 7-year-old as ""the princess."" Myers, who was arraigned Wednesday, was charged with aggravated assault, recklessly endangering another person and simple assault, as well as possession of a controlled substance and paraphernalia after police allegedly seized a container of marijuana and a smoking pipe with suspected marijuana residue during their search. He is currently being held on $250,000 bail. Reached for comment, Myers' attorney Gerald Lee Cassidy said he was ""not comfortable"" talking about the case. ""I don't see how it's going to help my client,"" Cassidy said.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Eight years ago, Leanne Rowe was in a serious car crash that resulted in a broken back and jaw. But when the former bus driver and Australian Army Reserve member recovered, she was left with something completely unexpected: a French accent. Rowe, who is now unable to speak with her original Aussie accent, said she has become a ""recluse,"" and often has her daughter speak for her in public. ""I am not French,"" Rowe told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) on Sunday. ""It makes me so angry because I am Australian."" How can this occur? Foreign accent syndrome is an extremely rare condition in which brain injuries change a person's speech patterns, giving them a different accent. The first known case was reported in 1941, when a Norwegian woman suffered shrapnel injuries to the brain during a German bombing run -- and started speaking with a German accent. Since then there have been only a few dozen reported cases. ""It's an impairment of motor control,"" said Dr. Karen Croot, one of the few experts in foreign accent syndrome. ""Speech is one of the most complicated things we do, and there are a lot of brain centers involved in coordinating a lot of moving parts. If one or more of them are damaged, that can affect the timing, melody and tension of their speech. ""In a sense it's not a communication impairment -- a person can make themselves understood perfectly well."" But foreign accent syndrome can be psychologically difficult for sufferers. ""There can be a lack of understanding of how difficult it can be for the person with the acquired accent,"" said Croot. ""There's sort of a response of, 'get rid of the accent, stop putting it on, go back.' If you think about your own accent, it's a part of your identity. Changing your accent projects a different identity."" Severe migraine gives British woman Chinese accent . In 2010, Sarah Colwill, a 35-year-old British woman, began speaking with what sounded like a Chinese accent after suffering a serious migraine. ""To think I am stuck with this Chinese accent is getting me down,"" she said. ""My voice has started to annoy me now. It is not my voice."" Yet other patients don't mind as much. ""One of the ladies I worked with was an English speaker who started sounding Irish. She reported feeling positive about it. For her it was sort of an interesting new persona."" Other patients eventually see their speech return to normal. ""I worked on a case of an Australian who was in a car accident, and consequently had an American accent. That accent went away about 5 months later,"" said Croot. According to Croot, sufferers may try to regain their former accents by doing exercises. ""They need to practice repositioning their mouth, just as they would practice a tennis serve. It's motor skill practice."" Treatments used for similar motor speech disorders, apraxia of speech and dysarthria, have also been deployed for patients of foreign accent syndrome in the last few years with ""positive"" results. Rowe, however, has decided to stop trying to ""hold in"" her accent. ""For me, it was not healthy,"" she said. ""It has affected her life greatly,"" her daughter explained. ""People see the funny side of it, and think it's really interesting... but I've seen the impacts on mum's life.""","Car crash eight years ago left Aussie woman speaking with a French accent .

"CHICAGO, Illinois (CNN) -- Michelle Obama, wife of Democratic presidential hopeful Sen. Barack Obama, Friday called questions early in the campaign about whether her biracial husband was ""black enough"" to appeal to African-American voters ""silly.""

""That has nothing to do with me or Barack -- that has to do with the challenges we are facing in this country and we shouldn't be surprised by them because we still haven't worked through this stuff,"" she said.

Since then, Obama's support has vastly increased with black voters. He took 78 percent of the black vote in a South Carolina primary he won handily and 73 percent of the African-American vote in Florida, although delegates from that contest, which Clinton won, won't count because of a scheduling squabble between state and national Democratic officials. Obama, a senator from Illinois, and Clinton, a New York senator and former first lady, are the two remaining challengers for the Democratic nomination and remain locked in a tight race. Obama won the season-opening Iowa caucuses and the South Carolina primary, while Clinton won New Hampshire, Nevada and no-delegate contests in Florida and Michigan, which also got in trouble for pushing ahead in the primary schedule. While she said she initially tried to talk her husband out of running for president, Michelle Obama said she doesn't share the concerns voiced by Alma Powell, wife of former Secretary of State Colin Powell, who is black, that her husband's safety might be threatened over a quest for the White House.

"(CNN) -- As politicians and barge companies express fear of a shutdown or significant disruption, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is tackling one of two significant problems presented in the drought-stricken Mississippi River. The Corps, aware that barge traffic could be disrupted as early as next week because of sharply lower water levels, can't do anything about ice forming in northern portions of the river, impeding adequate water flow. But it is using contractors to remove rock formations in the river near Thebes, Illinois, to help maintain a 9-foot-deep channel for navigation, said St. Louis District spokesman Mike Petersen. Blasting, one of the removal measures, began December 21. The removal of 890 cubic yards of limestone will continue until the end of January, Petersen told CNN on Thursday. Dredging has been ongoing since early July. A historic drought and excessive heat reduced water levels and scorched wide sections of the Midwest. Flooding last year may have worsened the situation on the Mississippi by leaving deposits of silt and debris in areas that would normally be clear. Two trade groups expressed concern Thursday that the portion of the river near Thebes -- about 125 miles south of St. Louis -- may be impassable for many vessels around January 3 or 4. They urged the administration to release water from Missouri River reservoirs. ""This potential supply-chain disruption could amount to a staggering loss for the U.S. economy, affecting nearly 20,000 jobs,"" said the statement from the American Waterways Operators and the Waterways Council, Inc. Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Missouri, and Senate colleagues from the Midwest and South late last month called on President Barack Obama to ensure commercial navigation of the river. The letter mentioned the need for sufficient water flow into the Mississippi River from the Missouri River. ""Significant curtailment of navigation...will threaten manufacturing industries and power generation, and risk thousands of related jobs in the Midwest,"" the letter read. It cited in particular the stretch of the river between St. Louis and Cairo, Illinois. Corps officials recently met with Illinois leaders to discuss its operations, among them the release of additional water from Carlyle Lake, 50 miles east of St. Louis in south-central Illinois. Mark Fuchs, an hydrologist with the National Weather Service in St. Louis, said bitterly cold air expected in Minnesota and Iowa was expected to freeze much of the flow from the Upper Mississippi late this week. ""However, that may not have much impact on levels this far south unless the ice makes significant progress southward, roughly past Iowa,"" Fuchs said on Friday.","Mississippi River faces possible traffic disruptions .

"(CNN) -- Smart policies are essential to America's ""war on obesity."" The latest idea in that fight is a curious proposal from Mayor Michael Bloomberg of New York City. He's planning to ban the sale of sugary drinks 16 ounces or larger in public venues such as restaurants and movie theaters. Critics are crying that the move is an infringement on personal freedom. But the bigger question is: What's the rationale behind targeting a single dietary factor in the sea of unhealthy foods and drinks that barrage us every day? Is it scientifically sound? A typical 16-ounce soft drink contains about 180 calories, nearly all from sugar. It doesn't contain any fat. While Bloomberg's ban will make it illegal to sell large-sized sugary drinks, it's perfectly legal to sell plenty of other beverages (milkshakes, anyone?) and foods (how about some ice cream?) that pack far more calories per amount served as well as very high levels of fat, sodium or other laboratory-engineered chemicals. Opinion: Bloomberg's visionary move against obesity . And what about the typical meal that goes along with a soft drink? A fast food meal contains tons of calories and is loaded with ingredients that are known to increase risks for diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. And, it is consumed in a matter of minutes. If Bloomberg's ban goes into effect, fast food restaurants can easily game his policy by offering a regularly portioned sugary drink that will likely come with free refills. Many academic scientists in the field of obesity prevention support Bloomberg's efforts. After all, the track record looks good. New York City hit a home run when it banned the use of hydrogenated vegetable oils in restaurants. Granted, scientific evidence have consistently showed that these cooking oils are hazardous to health. Experts have claimed that sugary drinks are a leading cause of obesity. If you make it more difficult for people to consume excessive amounts of these drinks, then shouldn't we see a drop in obesity? Overheard on CNN.com: Doughnut lovers' lament, washed down with a giant soda . It seems so simple on the surface, but it's not. Obesity is the result of an extremely complex interplay of factors, including dietary habits, environment, genes, etc. One of the best studies available, appearing last year in The New England Journal of Medicine, tells a more complicated picture. The study shows that if you increase drinking sugary beverages by one serving per day, it will lead you to gain an additional pound of body weight over four years. A similar amount of weight would be gained from eating an additional serving of red or processed meat daily for four years. But when it comes to potato chips, there seems to be a stronger relationship with weight gain (1.65 pounds). And French fries blew away the numbers (3.65 pounds). Does this look like good scientific evidence for banning the sale of large portions of soft drinks? Not really. Especially since the floodgates are open for selling enormous sizes of French fries and bacon double cheeseburgers, which seem to have more effect on weight gain. We can argue about whether a change in body weight of a quarter of a pound per year is meaningful and how much faith we can put in these studies of self-reported diet. But there have been no authoritative research showing whether consuming sugary drinks is directly linked to a rise in obesity. So, there is really no way to draw any conclusions about the scientific basis for Bloomberg's ban. It's guesswork for all we know. Controversy fizzing over Bloomberg's soda ban . The proposal does represent a baby step into uncharted waters that should be navigated. A policy aimed at changing people's level of portion size couldn't hurt in our national struggle to reduce obesity. If people are going to the drive-through to pick up a fast meal and the large drink they're getting is no longer as large, then they would be consuming a little bit less sugar than they would otherwise. However, the high profile targeting of a single dietary factor, based on shaky obesity science, may be setting us up for disappointment if there is no measurable public health impact. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Mark A. Pereira.","Mayor Bloomberg of New York City plans to ban sale of large sugary drinks .

"(CNN) -- The National Council of La Raza responded to accusations on Wednesday by critics such as conservative commentator Rush Limbaugh that the civil rights organization has not been vocal enough during the Trayvon Martin controversy. ""We really regret people trying to use this to divide blacks and Latinos,"" said Lisa Navarrete, a spokeswoman for La Raza. ""It's disturbing to us that Rush Limbaugh has this theory. The only time he apparently cares about what happens to a Latino is when they may have happened to kill a young African-American man."" In response to a caller on his radio program on Tuesday, Limbaugh suggested La Raza, the largest national Latino civil rights and advocacy organization in the United States, has not stood behind Zimmerman after it was publicized that he identified himself as Hispanic. ""You know, that's an interesting point,"" Limbaugh said in response to his caller. ""You're right. I haven't heard a word from La Raza about this."" Outcry mounts; answers sparse . Limbaugh went on to criticize the group's president, Janet Murguia, for not referencing Zimmerman as Hispanic in her sole commentary on the Trayvon Martin incident, which was released on March 22. ""The fact that George Zimmerman is Latino is irrelevant to his actions,"" Navarette, who is an adviser to Murguia, said in response to the criticism. ""Personally that's the media's fault. Everything has to fit into a narrative and a paradigm. Initially it was a white guy who shot a black kid. Now they've split the difference,"" she said. What the witnesses are saying . ""Unfortunately, being Hispanic does not mean that you aren't capable of bigotry or discrimination,"" Navarette said. ""It does not condone or preclude him (Zimmerman) from having acted in a discriminatory manner."" As for why La Raza has not been more vocal about the incident, Navarette said behind the scenes the group has been showing its support since the beginning, despite the perceived tensions between blacks and Latinos. Evolution of the hoodie . Although La Raza has been largely out of the spotlight during the controversy, other Latino groups have stepped up to show their support. On March 20, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus released a statement asking for the Department of Justice to pursue the matter as a federal hate crime. ""The Department of Justice is sending a message to the Martin family and to communities of color that our children's lives have value and deserve equal protection under the law,"" said Rep. Charlie Gonzalez, D-Texas, leader of the caucus. In Orlando, Navarette said one of the first people to reach out to the Martin family lawyer was Marytza Sanz, who is affiliated with La Raza and runs a Latino leadership nonprofit near Sanford.

"(CNN) -- Fifteen patients have been hospitalized in Texas after getting calcium gluconate injections, according to the Food and Drug Administration. The FDA has issued a national voluntary now for all sterile-use products produced by Specialty Compounding LLC, based in Cedar Park, Texas. What is a compounding facility? The people hospitalized have a bacterial infection in their blood, and doctors think it might have come from the injection. A culture taken from a sample of this injection shows bacterial growth that is consistent with a Rhodococcus species (PDF) of bacteria, according to the FDA. ""The FDA believes that use of these products would create an unacceptable risk for patients,"" said Dr. Janet Woodcock, the FDA's director for drug evaluation and research. ""Giving a patient a contaminated injectable drug could result in a life-threatening infection."" Compounding pharmacists customize medications to fit an individual's needs. Doctors prescribe these custom medications when the manufactured drug won't work -- for example, when a dosage is too large, or a patient has an allergy to a dye or ingredient in the original product. Calcium gluconate infusions are typically given to people with a calcium deficiency or high potassium levels. People with low calcium levels have an increased risk for osteoporosis and bone fractures. High potassium levels in the bloodstream can lead to cardiac arrest and death. The FDA says that none of the sterile-use products from the facility should be used. The company told the FDA that its products have been distributed directly to patients in every state except North Carolina. They've also been sent to hospitals and doctor's offices in Texas. The FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will continue to investigate just how far the potentially contaminated materials have spread. Over the past year, the FDA has stepped up its investigations of compounding facilities after dozens of people died and hundreds more were made sick by contaminated injections from a compounding facility in Massachusetts. A bill with bipartisan support is under consideration in Congress: The Pharmaceutical Compounding Quality and Accountability Act would step up some of that regulation. A federal investigation (PDF) by the Government Accountability Office, which released a report in July, found a ""lack of consensus"" about who was actually supposed to regulate these facilities and, because of that, a serious gap in oversight and inspections. Before the recent deaths, the FDA did not inspect the compounding facilities unless it got complaints or reports of adverse events. Compounded drugs make up about 1% to 3% of the U.S. prescription drug market.","FDA issues voluntary recall for all products made by Specialty Compounding LLC .

"(CNN) -- As Zimbabweans awaited presidential election results, the ruling party declared victory Thursday as the opposition dismissed the vote as a ""huge farce."" Vote counting was under way in the election that pitted incumbent President Robert Mugabe against Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai for the third time. Mugabe, 89, has been at the helm since 1980, the only president the nation has known since it gained independence from Britain. A win would extend his time in office to 38 years. Even though the nation's electoral commission has not released any numbers, a ruling party official claimed victory. ""There is no doubt whatsoever that we have seen results everywhere in the country so far that ZANU-PF has won,"" said Didymus Mutasa, a party secretary. Tsvangirai's party called the vote ""null and void,"" alleging widespread fraud. ""This has been a huge farce,"" Tsvangirai, 61, said at a news conference in the capital, Harare. ""The credibility has been marred by administrative and legal violations which affect the legitimacy of its outcome."" He said irregularities included voter intimidation, unauthorized voter migration and lack of transparency in printing ballot boxes. But Mutasa dismissed the fraud allegations. ""That is stupidity. If all the leaders were as stupid as Tsvangirai, the world would be a very sad place to live in,"" he said. Opinion: Is Zimbabwe ready for elections? End of coalition government . The election marks an end to an uneasy coalition government between the two leaders formed after violence marred the last poll. At least 200 people were killed and thousands were injured in post-election violence in 2008. Regional leaders dismissed that election as a sham and pressured Mugabe to form a power-sharing agreement with Tsvangirai, which led to the tense coalition in 2009. Rights groups have accused the government of intimidating and beating up opposition supporters, and interfering with the polls in the latest election. But Mugabe has denied the accusations and extended a conciliatory message to his main rival. ""I've got my fair share of criticisms and also dealt back rights and lefts and uppercuts. But that's the game. Although we boxed each other, with Tsvangirai, it's not as hostile as before. It's all over now. We can now shake hands,"" Mugabe said. Mugabe to West: Back off . The elections were held under a new constitution endorsed in a March referendum that limits the president to two five-year terms. Mugabe is allowed to seek another term because the rule does not apply retroactively. Last week, he had a few words for critics of the election, especially the West. ""Keep your pink nose out of our affairs, please,"" he said in response to criticisms from the United States on his push for elections without key reforms. About 6.4 million voters in Zimbabwe -- half of the country's population -- were eligible to cast their ballots, according to the electoral commission. Long lines snaked at polling stations, an indication of high voter turnout. Zimbabwe, seeking election funding, turns to neighboring countries . 'Will this be the moment?' Citizens say this year's election is crucial in more ways than one. Despite the setbacks, it provides another shot at democracy. ""We are still a young country ... our democracy is still young,"" said Nigel Mugamu, who lives in Harare. ""A lot of African countries have changed leadership at least once or twice. We haven't seen a new face. From that perspective, it's an exciting time. Will this be the moment it will happen?"" Hope after hyperinflation . Mugamu said a peaceful election will boost investment, a major concern for the nation, which has tense relations with its major donors. This is the first poll since Zimbabwe battled hyperinflation that left investors jittery and led many to abandon the country's currency. In 2009, the nation introduced a 100 trillion-dollar bill that was worth about $300 in U.S. currency. At the time, a loaf of bread cost about 300 billion Zimbabwean dollars. The hyperinflation forced traders to insist on international currency to hedge against losses. Big strides . Despite widespread poverty, the nation has made major strides in its economy since then, experts say. Since then, the nation's gross domestic product ""has grown by an average of over 7% and inflation has remained in the low single digits,"" the International Monetary Fund said last month. ""Government revenues have more than doubled from 16% of GDP in 2009 to an estimated 36% of GDP in 2012, allowing the restoration of basic public services."" And as the nation returns from the brink of a crippled economy, Zimbabweans are hopeful. ""Whoever wins, the country needs to move forward,"" said Linda Mukusha, a Harare resident. Journalist Columbus Mavhunga contributed from Harare, andâ€Ž CNN's Brian Walker from Atlanta.","Mugabe's party says there's ""no doubt"" he has won .

"(CNN) -- It's fitting that Warren Buffett would be making political headlines the same month that reviews started tumbling in for the new book ""Leak: Why Mark Felt Became Deep Throat"". Both Buffett and Felt are cautionary examples of what happens when journalists drop their skepticism to embrace a source who says what they want to hear. The Deep Throat of ""All the President's Men"" lore, revered by two generations of young reporters, was a shadowy but selfless G-man with intimate knowledge of the administration, who reluctantly but decisively chose to reveal corruption going all the way to the top of the Nixon White House, out of a sense of decency and patriotism. What Max Holland reminds us in his new book is that Felt, who was outed as Deep Throat in 2005 not long before his death, was motivated by the much baser impulse of wanting to get the FBI director fired so that he could take his place. In the process, Felt allegedly spread misinformation to Watergate reporters and committed his own indecent and illegal abuses of power, including overseeing the burglarizing of various anti-war groups. You'd think that Washington journalists wouldn't need reminding that sources have their own tawdry motivations for using the press, but when the subject is as important as the criminal venality of Richard Nixon -- or better yet the irreplaceable role of the fourth estate in safeguarding democracy -- then there is a disincentive to treat corroborators with the skepticism they deserve. It detracts from the story journalists want to tell. Which brings us to Warren Buffett. The Oracle of Omaha, as he was reliably referred to when his pronouncements were mostly limited to the financial pages, has become the general-interest media's (and President Barack Obama's) go-to billionaire for quotes, policy ideas, and other bon mots. Why? Because he's a rich dude who -- like his new fans -- wants his fellow rich dudes to pay more taxes. Buffett has been making his crowd-pleasing calls to tax the rich for more than a decade now, but it was his 2006 announcement that he would give away most of his massive wealth -- or ""claim checks on the activities of others in the future,"" as he put it -- that triggered a journalistic standing ovation that shows no sign of abating. During the financial crisis in September 2008 and the ensuing wave of bipartisan bailouts, Buffett was routinely treated as an almost impartial voice of wisdom and calm, advocating the Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP), the stimulus, a mortgage-restructuring plan, and increased spending on high speed rail. Left out of most press accounts: He profited enormously from every one of these programs. As Peter Schweizer put it in a recent excerpt from his new book, ""Throw Them All Out,"" Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, beginning that fall, began buying up large chunks of Goldman Sachs and General Electric on extraordinarily favorable terms, in addition to its growing stakes in Wells Fargo, Bank of America, American Express, M&T Bank, and the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway. ""All told,"" Schweizer wrote, ""TARP-assisted companies constituted a whopping 30% of Buffett's publicly disclosed stock portfolio."" As of July 2009, Buffett's investment in Goldman Sachs alone had already netted him $2.5 billion. (Buffett has objected to Schweizer's critique, pointing out in an interview with the Omaha World Herald that TARP was passed after his investment in Goldman Sachs and under the Bush administration which he said he didn't support: ""Anyone, he said, could have invested in banks or other stock based on statements by Federal Reserve Board Chairman Ben Bernanke that the Fed would 'do whatever it takes' to help the ailing financial system."") Earlier this month, an Obama administration foreclosure settlement increased the potential value of Buffett's Bank of America holdings by $154 million in a single day. The man who has become the left's favorite billionaire in the service of bashing plutocrats could be perceived as the single most successful crony capitalist in the country. This does not mean, as New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said earlier this week, that Buffett ""should just write a check and shut up."" It's a free country, and Buffett's recommendations should ultimately be weighed on their own merits. But on that score, it's worth noting that Buffett has profited one hell of a lot more than the country that was supposed to benefit from all these Buffett-approved bailouts and stimuli. He gets billions; we get a big coulda-been-worse! Meanwhile, even the sitting treasury secretary acknowledges that the country's fiscal trajectory is ""unsustainable,"" with no solution in sight to the bailout-exacerbated problems of debt and entitlement-commitments. I'm not one who thinks that Warren Buffett needs to write a $10 billion check to the government in order to prove his policy sincerity. But it is worth noting that his big 2006 media breakthrough came not by pledging his fortune to the U.S. Treasury, but to private charity. It's clear which vehicle he finds the most effective use of his personal money. Which suggests an ultimate test for raising the federal tax burden in a way pleasing to Warren Buffett, Barack Obama, and most of the fourth estate: Are we currently getting our $3.8 trillion worth of services? Has the rapidly increasing price tag of government -- from $1.9 trillion in Bill Clinton's last proposed budget -- come with a commensurate increase in quality? If not, then we need to be cutting and improving government, not having it swallow up more of the private sector. If so, then that's an argument the media should be having, instead of just uncritically high-fiving a billionaire with massive vested interests. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Matt Welch.","NJ Gov. Christie says Buffett ""should just write a check and shut up"" about tax rates .

"London (CNN) -- Royal watchers eagerly await the arrival of a child who will be heir to the British throne. Here's what you need to know and the latest developments: . • The appearance of a couple looking very like William and Catherine outside the hospital where she is expected to give birth provided a moment of excitement -- but it was a stunt organized by The Sun, Britain's best-selling tabloid newspaper. • As the wait for the royal baby continues, so does the debate over the Duchess of Cambridge's actual due date. Britain's Telegraph newspaper reports Friday, citing ""well-placed sources,"" that medical staff at St. Mary's Hospital -- where Catherine is expected to give birth -- were told the due date was July 19. • A royal source told CNN that her due date was July 13. She and Prince William announced at the start of the year that the baby was due in July, but did not announce the date. Why are some babies overdue? • The Duchess of Cambridge is expected to give birth in the private Lindo Wing of St. Mary's Hospital, next to Paddington Station in London. It's where William was born, as was his brother Harry. Catherine's mother, Carole Middleton, is likely to be on hand at the hospital. • Could the world's media be camped outside the wrong hospital, though? The Telegraph reported that a contingency plan is in place for Catherine to give birth at the Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading, if she goes into labor while staying at her parents' home in Berkshire, and its swift progress means the journey back to London is impractical. • There's no doubting the media interest in the royal birth. The Sun newspaper is streaming live video of the entrance to the Lindo Wing, as is Stylist magazine. The days-long vigil outside the hospital has also inspired a spew of #GreatKateWait tweets from the waiting media pack -- as rounded up by New York Magazine. • One person who won't be at the Lindo Wing is Home Secretary Theresa May. Asked by a fellow lawmaker whether she would be attending the royal birth, as was formerly customary, she replied: ""In fact, it is no longer the case that the home secretary is required to attend a royal birth. The tradition -- now defunct -- goes back many centuries, she said, explaining that ""the home secretary had to be there to evidence that it was genuinely a royal birth and that a baby hadn't been smuggled in."" • Some people are thinking further ahead already. An Ipsos Mori poll released Thursday revealed almost two-thirds of those surveyed think William and Catherine's child should have a normal job before taking on royal duties. One in five disagrees. However, 70% of those polled think that it is impossible for the children of royalty to have a normal upbringing. The same survey found support for Britain's monarchy remains high, with more than three-quarters in favor of a monarchy over a republic. • There's been plenty of speculation about the baby's name -- and betting is going strong. The famous Battersea Dogs and Cats Home in London, which takes in and finds homes for lost and unwanted pets, has gone a step further and named a litter of kittens after the bookies' favorites: Alexandra, Charlotte, Elizabeth, Victoria, Grace, James and George. • Queen Elizabeth II is among those keen for the new baby to greet the world. On a visit to northern England on Wednesday, she was asked by a little girl whether she wants her great-grandchild to be a boy or a girl. The queen replied: ""I don't think I mind. I would very much like it to arrive. I'm going on holiday."" • Prince Charles' wife, Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, said Monday that the family was on tenterhooks for the baby's arrival -- and suggested it could be very soon. ""We're all waiting at the end of a telephone,"" she said, in an exchange filmed by ITV. ""I hope by the end of the week, he or she will be there."" • The baby will have the title His or Her Royal Highness Prince or Princess (the baby's name) of Cambridge, St. James's Palace said this month. However, it could be as long as 10 days before the baby's name is announced. • Anyone born in Britain on the same day as William and Catherine's baby will receive a special coin from the Royal Mint: a silver penny, dated 2013, that will come in a blue pouch for a boy or a pink one for a girl. • The first indication that the royal baby is on its way will be an announcement in the media that the duchess has been admitted to the hospital in the early stages of labor, royal sources tell CNN. The next public announcement is expected to be that of the birth. It will be made in the form of a formal bulletin, signed by medical staff and rushed in a car with a police escort to Buckingham Palace. There, the notice will be placed in a gilt frame positioned on an easel -- the same one used to announce William's birth -- and placed in the palace forecourt for all to see. • The first to know about the royal baby will be Queen Elizabeth II, Prime Minister David Cameron and the governors general of each of the commonwealth nations, along with the rest of the royal and Middleton families. If the baby arrives in the middle of the night, it's unlikely the queen will be awoken, so there is a chance in that instance that an official announcement will not be made until the following morning. • Celebratory gun salutes will be sounded by the King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery in Green Park (41 rounds) and the Honorable Artillery Company at the Tower of London (62 rounds) after the baby is born. • William and Catherine did not want to know the sex of their baby beforehand, royal sources say. There has been speculation it is a girl, however, especially after a member of the public said in March that the duchess almost uttered ""daughter"" while at a public event in Grimsby. The woman said the duchess was given a teddy bear and replied, ""Thank you, I will take that for my d--"" but then stopped herself. • The baby will be third in line to the throne after Prince Charles and Prince William, regardless of gender. A rule change in 2011 ended centuries of male primogeniture, which decreed that the crown passed to the eldest son and was bestowed on a daughter only when there were no sons. It means that if the next royal baby is a girl, she will eventually become queen; previously, a younger male sibling would have taken precedence. • The queen's cousin, Margaret Rhodes, told CNN's Christiane Amanpour she hoped the child would have a normal childhood. ""I imagine and hope that its early life, until it's at least in its teens, will be just a jolly, happy, ordinary child's life,"" she said. • It's not known where the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge plan to spend the days and weeks following the birth. William is expected to be given the usual paternity leave of two weeks by the Ministry of Defence, royal sources say. He will then return to his job as a helicopter search and rescue pilot. • The revelation that Catherine was pregnant came after she was admitted to a London hospital in December for acute morning sickness.","William and Catherine lookalikes prompt a flutter of excitement outside hospital .

"Washington (CNN) -- Nobody seems to have a positive word for Mayor Michael Bloomberg's proposal to ban oversized servings of sugary drinks in New York's food-service establishments. The mayor has been decried as a nanny. He has been accused of selective enforcement. (A Starbucks 20 ounce drink can have more than 500 calories, but will be exempt from the ban because it contains more than 50% milk.) The beverage industry complains that solutions to the obesity problem ought to be more ""comprehensive."" One important conservative magazine called the mayor's actions a form of ""fascism."" So let's defy the trend here and say: Good for Bloomberg. Obesity is America's most important public health problem, and the mayor has led the way against it. This latest idea may or may not yield results. But it is already raising awareness. Even if it fails to become law, it ought to prod the beverage industry into acting as more responsible corporate citizens. Sugary drinks now provide 7% of the calories in the American diet, the largest single national source of calories. Teen boys average more than a quart of sugary soda per day. Even adults who say they are trying to lose weight still drink more two 12-ounces cans per day, on average. There is little doubt about the serious health effects of sugary soda. Just one soda a day doubles a woman's risk of diabetes, according to the Harvard Journals of Public Health. Two sodas raises her risk of heart disease by 40%. Americans drink more soda for the very simple reason: it's getting cheaper. The inflation-adjusted price of soda has declined by an estimated 48% over the past 20 years. Improvements in packaging account for much of this price decline. It costs barely anything more to manufacture a 64-ounce ""double gulp"" container than to produce the former standard sizes. Opinion: Big Gulp? Meet Big Brother . Some object that the mayor's proposal to restrict serving sizes will restrict liberty. But the liberty restricted is not the liberty of the soda-drinker. If they wish, soda drinkers can buy a 2-liter bottle of soda at the grocery for about $1.70 and pour as much of it down their throats as they wish. The liberty that is being restricted is the liberty of the soda seller to manipulate known human weaknesses to the seller's advantage and the buyer's detriment. Human beings are not reasoning machines. We are animals who have inherited certain propensities not always well-adapted to modern urban life. We evolved in conditions of food scarcity. Our bodies have adapted to store food energy against famine; our subrational minds crave sweetness. The sugary beverage industry has invested massively to understand better how to use our very human natures against us. The ever-increasing size of the standard soda serving has changed our understanding of what is and what is not an appropriate amount of sugar to consume at a sitting. The beverage industry works on Americans before they have learned to read; even before they have learned to speak. In 2010, children and teens were exposed to twice as many full-calorie soda TV ads as they were in 2008, according to a study by the Yale Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity. The beverage industry is correct that a soda crackdown alone will not on its own address the obesity problem. Americans spend twice as much time in cars as in the 1970s and average more than 26 hours per week of sedentary entertainment. Some 80% of Americans do no physical exercise at all. As I've written before in this space: . ""The campaign against obesity will have to look a lot less like the campaign against smoking (which involves just one decision, to smoke or not to smoke) and much more like the generation-long campaign against highway fatalities, which required the redesign of cars, the redesign of highways, and changes in personal behavior like seat-belt use and drunk driving."" But if a restraint on soda serving size will not do everything, it may still do something. Or possibly not. The idea may fail. The idea is an experiment, and most experiments fail. We learn from failure how to design a better effort next time. And when we do at least succeed in this difficult struggle for public health, we will all owe New York's visionary mayor our thanks for leading the way. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.","New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg being criticized for his stance on soda .

"Washington (CNN) -- ""Electronic cigarettes"" that vaporize nicotine juice to inhale instead of smoke from burning tobacco do not deliver as promised, according to research at Virginia Commonwealth University. ""They are as effective at nicotine delivery as puffing on an unlit cigarette,"" said Dr. Thomas Eissenberg, at the school's Institute for Drug and Alcohol Studies. His study, funded by the federal National Cancer Institute, is the first by U.S. doctors to check the function of so-called ""no-smoke tobacco"" devices, which are unregulated in the United States for sale or use. The units are shaped like a cigarette and contain a battery that heats a filament to vaporize liquid nicotine in a refillable cartridge. Smokers buy the devices to get around no-smoking restrictions and to attempt to quit conventional cigarettes. Some users nickname what they're doing as ""vaping"" instead of smoking, to reflect the vapor produced by the heating element. The devices are marketed as an alternative to smoking, but retailers avoid making claims about health or safety. Fans have established a Web site, www.e-cigarette-forum.com. Founder Oliver Kershaw said the site ""is the largest e-smokers community online with some 26,000 members, most of whom are in the U.S."" Jimi Jackson, a former tobacco smoker in Richmond, Virginia, who sells electronic cigarettes, is convinced there are immediate health advantages in avoiding the known cancer-causing substances in the smoke of a burning cigarette. ""I smoked 37 years, and when I found them, I was, like, 'Thank, you Jesus,' "" Jackson said with a laugh, as a reporter visited his shop, No Smoke Virginia, coincidentally just a few blocks from where the research was conducted at Virginia Commonwealth. In March, the Food and Drug Administration imposed a ban on continued imports of the devices, pending regulatory review for any health risks. The latest clinical evidence suggests users are not getting the addictive substance they get from smoking tobacco. ""These e-cigs do not deliver nicotine,"" Eissenberg said of the findings he expects to publish in an upcoming issue Tobacco Control, a product of the British Medical Journal Group. This past summer, Eissenberg recruited smokers without prior experience using e-cigarettes to volunteer to use two popular brands of the devices for a set period. The 16 subjects were regularly measured in a clinical setting for the presence of nicotine in their bodies, their reported craving for conventional cigarettes, and certain physiological effects such as a change in heart rate. ""Ten puffs from either of these electronic cigarettes with a 16 mg nicotine cartridge delivered little to no nicotine,"" the study found. But the units may deliver hazardous chemicals, according to preliminary checks by federal regulators. In a notice to importers, the FDA blocked continued shipments after finding diethylene glycol, a chemical used in antifreeze that is toxic to humans. The government's statement noted there are no health warnings on the products, and that ""the FDA analyses detected carcinogens, including nitrosamines."" The notice of the import ban says ""the product appears to be a combination drug-device,"" that ""requires pre-approval, registration and listing with the FDA"" in order to be marketed in the United States. A company challenging the import ban claims in federal court documents to have sold 600,000 of the devices in a year's time through a network of 120 distributors in the United States. ""We are on the verge of going out of business, which is why we are suing the FDA in U.S. District Court,"" said Washington, attorney Kip Schwartz, representing a company called ""Smoking Everywhere,"" a U.S. wholesaler that was importing the devices from China. The lawsuit questions the FDA's authority to block shipments of a non-tobacco product, and says the agency has violated its statutory process for product review. Liquid nicotine is available on the open market through pharmaceutical houses and vendors who sell e-cigarettes. A judge January 14 ruled the FDA does not have such authority, but the agency has taken the matter to the U.S. Court of Appeals, which has yet to decide the case. The appeals panel issued a stay against the judge's ruling until it can rule on the agency's appeal. Meanwhile, based on the judge's ruling, lawyers for the importers have filed a request to compel the FDA to lift its import ban, saying the agency is not likely to win its appeal. The filing says ""although e-cigarettes have been sold since 2007, FDA has not identified a single instance, either in this Court or below, of an adverse health effect from e-cigarettes."" President Obama, who has described himself as an occasional smoker, has been offered one of the devices by Florida Rep. Cliff Stearns. The Republican lawmaker's office said the president did not respond. An administration spokesman last year said the White House was not aware of the offer. In a copy of a letter to the chief executive dated March 26, Stearns wrote, ""I have recently given out e-cigarettes to a few members of Congress and they have become quite a hit."" Sales of the devices continue at shopping mall kiosks and small storefront retailers, apparently drawing from stock imported before the FDA began to block shipments from overseas suppliers.","Nicotine delivery system same ""as puffing on an unlit cigarette,"" researcher says .

"MINNEAPOLIS, Minnesota (CNN) -- Alicia Babatz was on her way to pick up her 2-year-old daughter Wednesday when she felt the bridge give way beneath her.

Fighting what she called ""excruciating pain,"" Babatz, 22, escaped through a window and swam to the rubble of the collapsed bridge. ""I was crying for help, but there were cries for help all around me,"" she said. It took Babatz about 30 minutes to get out of the water. She said she looked back, and her car was gone. ""It's still hard for me to believe that I took that fall, I went through all that ... but I'm here, and that, to me, is just amazing,"" she said.  Watch Babatz describe her harrowing experience » . Survivor Lori Patterson also witnessed the Interstate 35W bridge collapse -- she was jogging under it moments before it crumbled. Patterson said she heard a loud explosion and turned around, thinking it was construction or dynamite testing. ""It was eerily still and quiet. Like a movie set,"" she wrote in an e-mail she sent to friends and family letting them know she was not in danger. Patterson said that as she watched the dust settle, she began to realize what had happened. More than 100 people were injured Wednesday when the Interstate 35W bridge collapsed into the Mississippi River. Five people are confirmed to have died, but the toll is expected to rise as the underwater recovery effort goes on. As divers searched the murky waters Friday, there was relief when one woman feared missing was found alive and well, the Hennepin County sheriff said. The woman's car was found at the disaster site, but she was not. Investigators tracked her down Friday morning at her workplace, Sheriff Rich Stanek said. However, Stanek would not say how many people are still missing. Stanek had said Friday morning eight people were unaccounted for, but said later: ""We're not convinced only eight are missing."" Minneapolis Police Department spokeswoman Ameilia Huffman had previously told CNN the sheriff's count was ""speculative,"" and Police Chief Tim Dolan had estimated 20 to 30 people remained missing. Four bodies were recovered Wednesday and one was recovered Thursday, Hennepin County Sheriff's Capt. Bill Chandler said at a Friday morning news briefing. The Minneapolis Fire Department recovered the fifth body from the bridge decking, he said.  See photos of the disaster » . At least 100 people have come to hospitals with injuries, said Dr. John Hick of the Hennepin County Medical Center. Authorities reported Thursday that at least 79 people were injured. The number went up because some people waited before going to hospitals complaining of ailments from the collapse -- which is expected, once the adrenaline and initial shock from the experience wear off, Hick said. Friday morning's recovery effort went more smoothly than anticipated, Stanek said. Four submerged vehicles were checked and found to contain no victims, he said. A fifth was not checked because another car is on top of it; heavy equipment would eventually be brought in, he said. Chandler said the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers had adjusted a nearby dam to drop the river's water level by 2 feet and was regulating the current to make it easier on the divers, whom Chandler directs. Stanek said National Transportation Safety Board investigators had told him that 60 vehicles were visible at the collapse site. The five people confirmed dead were all identified by Friday evening. They were Sherry Lou Engebretsen, 60, of Shoreview, Minnesota; Julia Blackhawk, 32, of Savage, Minnesota; Patrick Holmes, 36, of Mounds View, Minnesota; Artemio Trinidad-Mena, 29, of Minneapolis; and Paul Eickstadt, 51, of Moundsview, Minnesota. Stanek said he has visited three times with missing people's family members at a nearby Holiday Inn. ""When you go over there, it's quite heart-wrenching,"" he said Friday morning. ""These people just want some information. They have hope that something will come."" First lady Laura Bush visited the site Friday. ""I'm so sorry,"" she said upon meeting Minneapolis Mayor R.T. Rybak and other officials. ""If there's anything good about it, maybe we can look at other bridges."" She greeted and thanked police officers, firefighters and Red Cross volunteers. ""God bless you all,"" she said. President Bush, who on Thursday pledged federal aid to rebuild the bridge, will visit the disaster site Saturday. The disaster prompted U.S. Transportation Secretary Mary Peters on Thursday to urge all states to immediately inspect all bridges of the same design. There are about 750 of them across the United States, according to Brian Turmail, a spokesman for the Transportation Department. (See the bridges in need of immediate inspection) Peters on Friday ordered the Federal Highway Administration to offer federal help -- mostly likely in form of engineers -- to all 50 states to complete the inspections.

"New York (CNN) -- The U.S. Open tennis umpire who last year was accused in her husband's death until charges against her were dropped will be back at work later this month when the tennis classic takes court in Flushing, New York. Lois Goodman, 71, was reinstated as a line judge with the United Tennis Association on December 20, after Los Angeles police dropped their charges, and has worked at minor tournaments in Los Angeles earlier this year, according to her attorney, Robert Sheahen. ""To their great credit the United States Tennis Association reinstated Goodman, almost immediately after the criminal case was dropped,"" said Sheahen. U.S. Tennis Association spokesman Chris Widmaier confirmed in an e-mail that Goodman was re-instated in December. ""I would only be speculating, but my guess is she is happy to be returning,"" Widmaier added. Last August, as she was in New York preparing for the U.S. Open tournament, police arrested Goodman and accused her of bludgeoning her 80-year-old husband, Alan, with a coffee mug, and then fatally stabbing him with the broken mug's shards at their California home in April, 2012. After a lengthy investigation, authorities dropped the charges in November. ""We received additional information regarding the case,"" Sandi Gibbons of the Los Angeles County district attorney's office said in November. ""Based upon this information, we announced that we are unable to proceed with the case at this time. The court granted our request to dismiss the case without prejudice."" The district attorney and police were still investigating the case, and would not ""make any further statements that might compromise that investigation,"" Gibbons added at the time. Last Wednesday, Sheahen filed a complaint against the LAPD seeking unspecified punitive damages and the reimbursement of $100,000 in legal expenses. Attorney Sheahen said the suit against the LAPD claims false arrest, malicious prosecution and civil rights violations. ""It was their complete lack of training and over-zealousness. The LAPD seemed motivated by their own twisted need for publicity,"" said Sheahen. ""They did not go by the book. They alerted the media to the arrest. It was just bizarre how the LAPD went on about it."" As of Monday, the LAPD had not received a copy of the lawsuit, according to LAPD Sgt. Albert Gonzalez. Sheahen described Goodman as ""the dean of the tennis officials."" ""She's a really respected lady in her field, at home and in temple and that why the charges were even more outrageous,"" he added. Sheahen said Goodman would not be making any statements to the media.","Lois Goodman is described by her attorney as ""the dean of the tennis officials""

"(CNN) -- Texas authorities are investigating ""the safety of children"" at a ranch occupied by about 400 followers of polygamist sect leader Warren Jeffs, officials said Friday. An aerial view taken last year shows some living quarters at polygamist leader Warren Jeffs' Texas ranch. Authorities have sealed off the 1,900-acre ranch near Eldorado and no one is allowed to enter or leave, officials with Child Protective Services and the Department of Public Safety said. The people living at the ranch are cooperating, authorities said. Escorted by police, social workers entered the compound in south central Texas at 8 p.m. Thursday after receiving ""a referral,"" said Child Protective Services spokeswoman Marleigh Meisner.  Watch police seal off the compound » . Child Protective Services ""is conducting an investigation into safety issues of the children who live within the compound,"" she said. Meisner would not provide details about the referral but did say officials responded ""within days"" of receiving it. As of Friday morning, Meisner added, her agency had ""not determined that there is a safety issue with these children."" Several law enforcement agencies are assisting with the investigation, said Tela Mange, of the Texas Department of Public Safety. ""The people at the ranch have been cooperative and they are providing the investigators with everyone they want to talk to,"" she said. Jeffs' Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (FLDS) bought 1,900 acres near Eldorado four years ago and built the ranch, which they call the YFZ Ranch. It is now home to as many as 400 members who relocated from their Arizona and Utah compounds. Jeffs, the 52-year-old leader and ""prophet"" of the 10,000-member church, was convicted in Utah last year on two counts of being an accomplice to rape, charges related to a marriage he performed in 2001. He still faces trial in Arizona on eight charges of sexual conduct with a minor, incest and conspiracy. State and local law enforcement agencies set up roadblocks around the ranch Thursday evening, preventing journalists from seeing what was happening on the property, according to Randy Mankin, editor of the Eldorado Success weekly newspaper. ""This came totally out of the blue,"" Mankin said. There were no indications of any violence around the ranch, he said. When CNN crews have visited the ranch, it was guarded by armed men equipped with night vision gear and other high-tech surveillance tools to prevent intruders. When CNN flew over the ranch in a small plane last year, the crew saw a massive temple, the three-story housing units where Jeffs' chosen followers live, the water tower, the school and community center, the dairy and cheese factory and a massive concrete mill. The FLDS church openly practices polygamy in two towns straddling the Arizona-Utah state line -- Hildale, Utah, and Colorado City, Arizona., but members living on their Texas ranch rarely venture into Eldorado, four miles to the south. Critics of the sect say it arranges marriages for girls as young as 13, and that competition for brides may be reduced through exiling young men. If male followers are excommunicated, the critics claim, their wives and children can be reassigned to someone else. Jeffs is now being held in the Mohave County Jail in Kingman, Arizona, where he will be tried on charges of being an accomplice to incest and sex with minors. In November ,Jeffs was sentenced to 10 years in jail after being convicted of two charges of accomplice to rape.

"(CNN) -- For nine seasons, Rainn Wilson delighted audiences worldwide as the eccentric but lovable Dwight Schrute on NBC's ""The Office."" Wilson's performance earned him a place in American pop culture history. But in his work off screen, Wilson is building an entirely different legacy. ""When I started getting well known as an actor on 'The Office,' I got inundated by requests to be a spokesperson for various charities. And I had an opportunity, I thought, for me to explore what was most important to me in my heart, and what I felt could make the greatest impact in the world,"" Wilson says. Wilson then found the perfect match. The Mona Foundation, based in Wilson's hometown of Seattle, supports grass-roots educational organizations both internationally and in the United States. ""They support about 20 different schools and educational initiatives in about 15 different countries, and the more I learned about them, the more I loved. They target women and girls, and that's how you transform a community,"" says Wilson. A major difference from other organizations, Wilson points out, is that the Mona Foundation finds programs that already exist and are working but underfunded. It is then able to bring in the support to improve the program and build a foundation for long-term success. Wilson says this ensures that the community will get what it really needs and can sustain. It empowers members of the community to take control and move in a positive direction. Working with the Mona Foundation is a family affair for Wilson. It's a project to which he and his wife, Holiday Reinhorn, are both fully committed. They visit the schools under the Mona Foundation umbrella frequently and sometimes bring along their son. Wilson and Reinhorn have visited the Mona Foundation schools in Haiti a handful of times -- both before and after the devastating earthquake in 2010. ""One of the things my wife and I do together is we teach arts workshops for adolescent girls. They're the most at-risk population in Haiti and through most of the developing world: teenage girls, preteen girls. Targeting them to empower them and educate them is really the most crucial thing. We do arts and leadership workshops with them,"" Wilson continues. ""We're sponsoring some girls and giving them scholarships to get jobs training and English training. English training is very important, because it leads to jobs. It's not like a Western egotism thing, like oh, you should learn to speak American. It really is -- if you learn to speak fluent English, you can get a job as a translator or in a hotel or a restaurant or for an NGO or for any number of different places. It's actually a very important skill set to have. So, I love weaving the arts in with leadership, helping give these girls a voice.""","Star of ""The Office"" Rainn Wilson supports The Mona Foundation .

"(CNN) -- Wher woud some of us bea withoot spell check? The sometimes annoying, but frankly indispensable computer aid has spared billions of typographical blushes. Now, an ingenious prototype pen developed by a German start-up is promising to give our longhand writing a similar sort of safety net. Lernstift (German for ""learning pen"") is a digital pen with a difference, carrying not only ink inside its casing but also a tiny computer that alerts users to spelling errors. Daniel Kaesmacher, co-founder of Lernstift told CNN: ""Basically there are two functions. The calligraphy mode which helps you correct individual letters, and the orthography mode which vibrates when a word is misspelled."" The AAA battery-powered Linux computer includes a vibration module and a patent pending non-optical motion sensor which recognizes specific movements and shapes of letters and words. The pen employs a menagerie of sensors, including a gyroscope (for measuring orientation), accelerometer (for calculating propulsion) and magnetometer (a device that measures the strength and direction of magnetic fields) -- all to calculate the pen's 3-D movements. Interactive: The future of 3D printing . Lernstift recognizes all writing movements, the company says, written on paper or in the air and built-in Wi-Fi allows scribblers to connect with smartphones, computers or other pens in a network. The pen was invented by software developer and Lernstift founder Falk Wolsky after seeing his wife's frustrations at watching their son struggle with his homework. Why can't pens give instant feedback on mistakes? she asked. His imagination fired, Wolsky set about constructing a prototype before assembling a team of hardware and software experts late last year. ""We are at the stage where the individual components do their job. We haven't put it together yet, but the response to the idea though has been overwhelming,"" Kaesmacher said. The pen has been designed primarily as an educational tool and the Munich-based company are hopeful that dyslexic children will find the new pen particularly useful. Greg Brooks, Professor Emeritus of Education at the UK's University of Sheffield gave the pen a cautious welcome. ""It's a neat idea in principle, but as ever the proof will be in the using of it,"" Brooks said via email. ""Will it learn individuals' quirks of handwriting, or insist on one style? I can see how it might be programmed to spot obvious spelling errors (non-words), just as the spellcheckers in word processors do -- but none of those can yet cope with real-word errors."" A Kickstarter campaign recently got underway looking to raise £120,000 ($180,000) and tests in schools will begin later this year. The first pens will initially recognize only English and German spellings, but other languages will follow, says Kaesmacher. ""Learning your native language is one thing, but it's also the perfect tool to adapt for foreign language students,"" he says. ""From a cultural point of view, the pen is a wonderful bridge between cursive and technological worlds."" Eventually, the company plan to offer pencil, fountain and ballpoint pen options with a launch price between €120-150 ($160-200) falling to under €50 ($60) depending on how fast the company grows.","Prototype ink pen vibrates when users make mistakes writing letters and words .

"(CNN) -- The process to extradite Joran van der Sloot from Peru to the United States to face criminal charges has begun, according to Maximo Altez, van der Sloot's Peruvian attorney. Peruvian judges in January sentenced the Dutchman to 28 years in prison for the murder in 2010 of Stephany Flores. He is also the prime suspect in the disappearance of American Natalee Holloway. U.S. authorities want to try van der Sloot on charges of extortion and wire fraud in the Holloway case. According to court documents obtained through Altez, a Peruvian judge has approved a U.S. request for provisional detention. This is the first step in the extradition process between Peru and the United States. The document says a formal extradition request has yet to be submitted, but will follow. The document names the U.S. Embassy as a party in the proceedings. InSession reached out Monday for comment but did not receive a response. The Peruvian Justice Ministry also did not return a request for comment. The only hold-up to the extradition is van der Sloot's appeal, which should be finished in about a month, Altez said. ""I think he will be extradited within the next three months,"" said Altez. ""He will go to trial in the United States. Once he is sentenced, he will return to Peru to finish serving his 28 years, and then go back to the States to serve whatever sentence he gets there."" In June 2010, a federal grand jury in Alabama indicted him after allegations that he tried to extort $250,000 from Holloway's mother, Beth Holloway. Van der Sloot offered to provide what turned out to be bogus information about the whereabouts of Holloway's remains in exchange for the money, according to the indictment. He was allegedly given $25,000, which authorities say he used to travel to Peru for a poker tournament. If found guilty of extortion, he could be sentenced to 25 years in prison. Van der Sloot admitted to killing Flores, 21, in his Lima hotel room. The judges gave him a sentence two years short of the 30-year maximum. They ordered he be expelled from Peru at the end of his sentence and required him to pay about $74,500 in reparations to Flores' relatives. Van der Sloot confessed to robbery in addition to murder, admitting that he stole Flores' belongings, including more than $300 in local currency, credit cards and the victim's van as a means to leave the country. He fled to Chile and was arrested a few days later. Another van der Sloot attorney, Jose Luis Jimenez, said his client was under special stress the day of the 2010 murder, which marked five years after Holloway, an 18-year-old from Alabama, disappeared while vacationing on Aruba. Van der Sloot, who was among the last people seen with Holloway, was detained twice but has not been charged in the case. ""The world had been against him for five years before this case, for a murder he said he never committed and for which there is no evidence whatsoever,"" Jimenez said. Investigators have said they believe van der Sloot killed Flores after she found something related to the Holloway case on his computer while visiting him in his hotel room. The two met while van der Sloot was in town for the poker tournament. Judges described how Flores hit van der Sloot in the face after reading the item on Holloway, leading him to hit her in the face with his elbow. Flores fainted and van der Sloot tried to strangle her, but she was still breathing, so he suffocated her with his shirt. Van der Sloot then tried to clean the room by removing the sheets and changing his bloodied shirt, they said. He was caught in a taxi near the Chilean central coastal city of Vina del Mar. Holloway's body has not been found, and no one has been charged in relation to the case in Aruba. About 6Â½ years after Holloway went missing in May 2005, Alabama Probate Judge Alan King signed an order declaring the teenager legally dead.","NEW: An attorney predicts Joran van der Sloot will be extradicted within three months .

"(CNN) -- Seven-time champions AC Milan took a decisive step towards qualifying for the group stages of this year's European Champions League with a 1-1 draw at PSV Eindhoven Tuesday. The Serie A giants will go into the second leg at the San Siro with the crucial away goal after Stephan El Shaarawy put them ahead in the 15th minute as he headed home a cross by Ignazio Abate. Mario Balotelli should have doubled the lead soon afterwards but a youthful PSV team enjoyed much of the play and deserved to equalize on the hour mark. Christian Abbiati failed to hold a Stijn Schaars shot and Tim Matavz was on hand to score. Andrea Poli might have given Milan a late winner, but they will be favorites to progress from the return in the San Siro next week. Seven-time French champions Lyon will be struggling to qualifying after going down to a 2-0 home defeat in their Stade Gerland to Spanish side Real Sociedad. Both have made excellent starts to their league campaigns, but it was the visitors who dominated the first leg of their showdown and went ahead to a superb opener from Antoine Griezmann on the volley. The Basque side's second goal was even better as Haris Seferovic struck a blistering volley of his own home from long range. Lyon attempted to rally but Milan Bisevac was sent off for a second yellow card to end a miserable night for the home side. Meanwhile, Scottish champions Celtic, who reached the last 16 last year, are facing an early exit after going down to a shock 2-0 defeat in Kazakhstan to Shakhter Karagandy. Shakhter captain Andrei Fionchenko gave his unfancied side a 12th minute lead before Celtic nearly equalized with a number of close efforts. The best saw Kris Commons hit the woodwork, while James Forrest's was kept out by home goalkeeper Alexsandr Mokin with a desperate last ditch save. Celtic's hopes dipped when Sergei Khizhnichenko headed past visiting keeper Fraser Forster as his side bid to become the first Kazakh side to go into the group stages draw. In other matches Tuesday, Viktoria Plzen beat Maribor 3-1 and Zenit St. Petersburg were 4-1 winners at Pacos de Ferreira, with Roman Shirkov scoring a hat-trick for the Russians. Wednesday sees five further qualifying matches with English Premier League Arsenal facing a tricky first leg tie in Turkey against Fenerbahce.","AC Milan hold PSV Eindhoven to 1-1 draw .

"(CNN) -- Her name was Alice Guy-Blache, and you've probably never heard of her. That's understandable. Her heyday was a century ago. She was French and spent only a few years in the United States. Her work -- what little of it has survived -- generally lives on in museum collections. But perhaps you should find out who she is. For Guy-Blache, who died in 1968, was a pioneer in the film industry. She was the first female director. She was perhaps the first to create a narrative film. She was an innovator in storytelling and in business. Pamela Green is trying to raise her profile. Green and Jarik van Sluijs, her colleague at the Los Angeles design firm PIC, have created a Kickstarter campaign to secure funding for a documentary on Guy-Blache. The work-in-progress, called ""Be Natural"" -- after a common Guy-Blache acting instruction -- is attempting to raise $200,000. Green was inspired by a special about female pioneers in cinema, which also included Mary Pickford and Lois Weber. ""Alice stuck with me,"" says Green. ""And when it was over, I was surprised that I didn't hear (more) about her."" Given her contributions to motion pictures, you'd think Guy-Blache would have attracted more notice. She was present practically at the creation of the industry, joining French businessman Leon Gaumont -- whose company was one of the first movie producers -- as a secretary in 1894. Two years later, when she was just 23, she helmed a one-reel short, ""La Fee aux Choux"" (""The Cabbage Fairy""). She started her own company, Solax Films, in 1910, and set up a state-of-the-art studio in Fort Lee, New Jersey, two years later -- the first woman to own a studio. She oversaw more than 1,000 films, many noted for their pioneering use of light, composition and even synchronized sound. ""She had a very important place in film history,"" says Thomas J. Slater, a film scholar at Indiana University of Pennsylvania who specializes in the silent era. ""She was more than just a filmmaker -- she also knew how to organize a production company and get her work out there."" Slater suspects that a combination of factors caused Guy-Blache to fall into anonymity. The business moved to Hollywood; Guy-Blache never really made the move. At the same time, her husband, Herbert Blache, took control of Solax, and she eventually returned to France and divorced him. And there was also the matter of her sex. Even 100 years later, women struggle for positions of power in Hollywood -- particularly behind the camera. It was big news three years ago when Kathryn Bigelow won best director for ""The Hurt Locker,"" only the fourth woman to even be nominated in that category. It was a different atmosphere in the teens and early '20s, says Slater. At the time a number of women were screenwriters and directors. But once the business started consolidating, women's creative positions ""dropped off drastically,"" he says. Even Weber, one of the most accomplished directors of the teens, was largely forgotten. Indeed, from the beginning of the sound era in 1927 until the 1970s, about the only female directors of note in Hollywood were Dorothy Arzner and Ida Lupino. In the case of Guy-Blache, says Green, ""maybe her experience and her accomplishments were something that worked a little bit against her. They didn't want people who knew too much. She kind of encompassed that."" Though the film will make use of old stills and Guy-Blache's work, Green and van Sluijs want it to have a modern look, where -- thanks to computer effects -- the viewer will practically feel inside the frame. The two have the experience: as established creative directors, they've produced sequences for such films as ""The Cabin in the Woods,"" ""42"" and ""The Muppets."" The trailer for ""Be Natural"" invites you into another time. A number of film luminaries have gotten behind ""Be Natural's"" Kickstarter campaign, including Robert Redford and Jodie Foster, but the campaign is still well short of its financial goal. (An FAQ explains that despite some stars' participation, ""this is not the type of project that gets traditional Hollywood funding, nor is it the type of film that qualifies for educational grants."") Green is hopeful they'll make it across the finish line. After all, just because she's little known doesn't mean that Alice Guy-Blache is any less inspirational, says Green. ""There's an Alice in all of us,"" she says. ""This is a piece of history, but that's not the story. The story is about a woman who saw the opportunity in a time where she had nothing but obstacles, and she went and did it. The message is, if you have a dream, and you visualize it, you can do it.""","Alice Guy-Blache was pioneering female director .

"Mexico City (CNN) -- A clandestine mass grave found near Mexico City may hold the answer to what befell 12 youths who were kidnapped from a bar in the capital back in May. Federal investigators swarmed a ranch east of Mexico City on Thursday, where they confirmed that at least seven bodies had been found, and that two arrests were made near the location. A lawyer representing the families of five of the missing, however, told CNNMexico that he received a call from a source who said the bodies of the youths may be found there. The lawyer did not reveal his source. The apparent kidnapping of the 12 youths from an after-hours club called Heavens shocked residents of Mexico City, who for the most part have been spared from the violence seen in other areas. The lawyer, Ricardo Martinez, said his source told him there were 13 bodies found at the ranch, possibly in two mass graves, one that held the remains of the males, and the other, the females. Mexico City's attorney general on Thursday said there was one grave so far that was being investigated. Officials have not confirmed the identities of the bodies, and CNN could not independently confirm the claims of the attorney. Martinez said that a suspect in the disappearance of the youths led authorities to the ranch. Families of missing haunted by mystery . Mexico City Attorney General Rodolfo Rios said investigators were taking DNA samples to identify the remains, which could take several days. The site where the bodies are found is the town of Tlalmanalco, in the state of Mexico, about 30 miles east of Mexico City, the state-run Notimex news agency reported. Local, state and federal police were all at the scene. A gang was involved in the mass disappearance, officials have said. The May 26 incident at the after-hours bar jolted the capital city, given it took place in daylight on a Sunday morning. Video footage shows a gang of about 17 people arriving in eight vehicles at the fashionable Zona Rosa district, according to authorities. The owner of the bar, a co-owner and two bar employees have been arrested in the case.

"(CNN) -- San Diego Mayor Bob Filner, accused of sexually harassing women, will resign if the San Diego City Council accepts a proposed mediation agreement, local TV stations reported Thursday. The resignation would be effective Friday, according to the stations, including CNN affiliate KGTV. ""It is still our understanding that his resignation is part of the deal that the San Diego City Council needs to sign off on during tomorrow's closed session,"" an official familiar with the negotiations told CNN's Lindy Hall. The source emphasized that ""until that happens, I don't believe you will see an official resignation."" City Councilman Scott Sherman said he had not seen the agreement, but is hopeful it includes a resignation, KGTV reported. ""The quicker he's out of office, the quicker it is to get back into city business,"" Sherman told the station. Filner has been under intense pressure to resign in the wake of allegations of serial sexual harassment of women, including inappropriate touching, kissing and comments. He has acknowledged improper conduct and recently underwent therapy. But he has previously resisted the resignation demands, saying his conduct was not enough to force him from office. He even has been locked out of his City Hall office, though Filner indicated in a statement that he returned to work as mayor in that very office on Wednesday. That was the same day that, according to Filner and others involved, three days of mediation talks yielded a tentative agreement. City councilors and others have been reluctant publicly to divulge details on the deal, given the guidelines set by the judge overseeing the mediation talks. Filner, for example, said in a statement Thursday, ""Due to the confidential nature of mediation and settlement discussions, we are unable to comment or make statements about any of the terms."" City Council President Todd Gloria, who is among the nine City Council members calling for a resignation, was similarly tight-lipped. But that should change sometime after the City Council meets -- after a public comment period -- in a closed session around 1 p.m. (4 p.m. ET) Friday to decide on whatever pact is on the table. ""The business of the city of San Diego is being pushed forward as best we can,"" Councilman Kevin Faulconer said, adding that the last seven weeks have been ""very difficult"" but haven't stopped the city government from functioning. ""We love our city."" Whatever the final deal is, lawyer Gloria Allred -- who represents Filner's former communications chief Irene McCormack Jackson, who has filed a sexual harassment lawsuit against her former boss, and who has spoken alongside several other accusers -- said Thursday that she hopes it includes not only his resignation, but no future payments to him for legal fees or otherwise. ""There should be no payoff for Mayor Filner,"" Allred told reporters Thursday. ""His parting gift should be good riddance instead of a handout."" Allred said that while she took part in the mediation talks, neither she nor her client signed off on any deal, nor did she have details on it. She stressed that Jackson has not dropped her case against Filner, saying, ""Our lawsuit is not settled."" Out of rehab, locked out of the office . News of the reported mediation agreement comes after yet another woman came forward to accuse Filner. Businesswoman Dianne York told CNN that Filner put his hands on her buttocks during a photo opportunity that followed a meeting three months ago. York said there were witnesses to what happened. She said both her advisers and Filner's were in the room at the time. Did mayor target victims of military sexual assault? York is the 18th woman to accuse Filner of improper conduct. Jackson quit her job and sued the mayor in July, saying he subjected women to ""crude and disgusting"" comments and inappropriate touching. Other women have accused him of touching their buttocks and putting them in a headlock and trying to kiss them, among other allegations. And amid the storm of allegations, Bronwyn Ingram ended her engagement to Filner. She had campaigned alongside him during his run for mayor, and was known -- even though the two weren't married -- as the ""first lady"" of San Diego before ending their relationship. But speaking Thursday alongside Allred in her first public comments since the scandal broke, Ingram said she now wants Filner to resign as mayor. ""I'm hopeful that tomorrow will begin a healing process,"" Ingram told reporters, ""and that attention will return to the needs of the people."" Opinion: Will 'Mayor Naughty' please step down?

"San Diego (CNN) -- An agreement has been reached with San Diego Mayor Bob Filner after three days of mediation, the city attorney told reporters Wednesday. City Attorney Jan Goldsmith said details of the proposed deal would remain confidential until they are presented to the City Council in a private meeting Friday at 1 p.m. (4 p.m. ET). Immediately after the meeting, a report may be out at a public council meeting, Goldsmith said. ""Any rumors you hear about the proposal you may deem to be untrue because the people standing here are the ones who know of it and we have all committed ... that we will maintain the confidentiality of the mediation,"" he said while flanked by individuals involved in the effort. Asked about Filner's response to the agreement, his attorney declined to comment. Filner has been in mediation talks on the heels of undergoing intensive two-week behavioral therapy amid multiple allegations that paint him as a serial perpetrator of sexual harassment. Navarrette: Will 'Mayor Naughty' please step down . So far, 18 women have come forward to say that Filner acted inappropriately, with accusations ranging from one woman's claim that the mayor gave her ""tush a pat,"" to another woman's assertion that he ""put me in what I guess now is the famous headlock."" The embattled mayor has steadfastly resisted efforts to force him out of office in recent weeks. Filner's office has not responded to multiple CNN requests for comment. Last month, he acknowledged he ""failed to fully respect the women who work for me and with me"" and that he was ""embarrassed"" by his actions. But he also said he will be vindicated by ""a full presentation of the facts"" and that he would not step down. But he might be considering resignation anyway. CNN affiliate KGTV, citing anonymous sources, reported that the mediation was ""designed to include a review of a potential resignation."" Though the city chief of staff changed the locks on Filner's office during his time away, it was to preserve evidence rather than to keep him out, the city attorney's office has said. Filner, 70, was elected mayor in 2012 after 20 years in Congress. His accusers range from a singer at a campaign fundraiser to his former communications director, who called him unfit for office. Volunteers hit the streets of San Diego over the weekend to begin collecting signatures for a recall. They need more than 101,000 signatures by September 26. Filner has rebuffed calls to resign from all nine City Council members and from fellow Democrats, including California's two U.S. senators. His supporters, who include some labor unions and Latinos, say Filner is being denied due process, and the recall effort is orchestrated by those who oppose his political agenda. CNN's Kyung Lah, Josh Levs, Ed Payne and Dana Ford contributed to this report.","Details of the proposed deal are confidential, San Diego's city attorney says .

"(CNN) -- Florida A&M University said Thursday that its famed Marching 100 band will return to the field for the first time since its suspension after the hazing death of a drum major nearly two years ago. The band had been one of the top university marching bands in the United States, but Robert Champion's death and other reports of hazing damaged its reputation. ""We have made a thorough assessment of the students who have auditioned for the band and firmly believe that we are ready to return and positively represent Florida A&M University and its proud students, faculty, alumni and community,"" Sylvester Young, director of marching and pep bands, said in a statement. 'Enough is enough': Roommate sentenced in band member's death . ""We embark on this season reflective of the circumstances that led to the band's suspension and are optimistic that this is a new day for the band and the university. Our goal is to support the mission of the university and use this program to recruit top scholars and elevate the stature of the university,"" he added. The band will perform during the halftime show at the MEAC/SWAC Challenge presented in Orlando, Florida, on September 1, and at other games during the football season. Trayvon Martin's father honored as FAMU band captain . The university stressed in the statement that positive steps have been taken since Champion's death. It created an anti-hazing plan that includes a revised student code of conduct, a new anti-hazing website, scheduled campus training and beefed-up procedures for reporting and investigating hazing allegations. Champion was beaten on a bus after a November 2011 football game in Orlando, as part of a band hazing ritual. The 26-year-old died ""within an hour"" of the beating, medical examiners reported. The Marching 100 was suspended shortly after his death.","Drum major Robert Champion died after being beaten in a hazing incident .

"(CNN) -- In March, a young woman talking to a friend on the phone said she heard someone coming in the back door of her Kentucky apartment. She hasn't been heard from since. The NamUs Web site has helped in closing 147 missing persons cases and ID'ing 149 decedents since its launch. Decades earlier, on March 15, 1967, the remains of a woman clad in a blue dress and white shoes were discovered in a field in Baltimore, Maryland. The two cases are separated by nearly 500 miles and more than 42 years, but authorities are hoping they can both be solved with the help of a federal database that went online this year. The National Missing and Unidentified Persons System (http://www.namus.gov//) is designed to help law enforcement agencies and medical examiners across the country unravel the mysteries of cold cases involving missing persons and unidentified remains. It also gives countless families a place to look for loved ones and a chance to find answers and peace of mind. Launched in January, the database was created after the Department of Justice was tasked with finding ways to help solve the thousands of missing persons and unidentified decedents cases in the United States, according to a statement on the Web site. It's funded through a cooperative agreement from the National Institute of Justice, which is part of the Department of Justice's Office of Justice Programs. NamUs communications director Christine Vivian said the project ""was created to address the issue of the estimated 40,000 unidentified dead nationwide, and give families a tool to assist in finding missing adults."" ""As more cases are entered into the system, more people in every area -- law enforcement, victim advocacy and the general public -- can become part of the conversation that will resolve cases,"" Vivian told CNN in an e-mail. The database offers what may be the most comprehensive public search engine to date for this undertaking. ""With advances in forensic sciences, there is always the possibility of closing an old case,"" NamUs Operations Manager Billy Young told CNN. ""No matter how old the records are, we have someone looking at them."" NamUs is operated by the National Forensic Science Technology Center in Largo, Florida. It has two separate parts: a database of missing persons information containing 1,996 cases -- of which 147 have been closed -- and an unidentified decedent data system, which lists 5,569 cases. Of those, 149 people have been identified. Information entered in the missing persons file is automatically cross-referenced with the unidentified remains cases to see if there are any matches, the Web site said. The woman in the blue dress in Baltimore is not one of them. Her skeletal remains were found in a field in the winter of 1967, but forensic experts believe she probably died the previous year. She was 5 feet, 3 inches tall and between the ages of 21 and 45. The young woman in Kentucky is listed on the missing persons database. She is Crystal Hall, of Pikeville. On March 1, the 24-year-old who called herself ""Red"" was in her apartment and told a friend on the phone that someone was trying to enter her home from the rear door. It was the last time anyone has heard from her. Hall was last seen wearing a red shirt, dark blue jeans and large hoop earrings. She has the name ""Willy"" tattooed on her left leg and another tattoo of a heart on her right arm. Her case file is typical of thousands of other entries for both NamUs databases, which contain detailed information on physical characteristics, clothing, accessories, police reports, photographs and dental charting. Typical also is case 5593, which describes a man believed to be in his 30s who was found intoxicated and unconscious on the ground in New York on May 31. He was taken to a hospital with a traumatic brain injury and died on June 3. The man, who had black hair and was wearing blue jeans, had several scars on his body. He was also missing part of a finger on his right hand. Young hopes that posting the man's case on the Web site will provide answers to family or friends who may be searching for him. ""It lets them know that someone is constantly looking for their loved ones and they are not being forgotten,"" he said. ""It gives them hope that one day they will be able to get closure.""","Web site www.namus.gov was launched in January .

"(CNN) -- Children of the '80s and '90s fondly remember a time when MTV actually played music videos. It was an era filled with art and glory and rebellion, and our parents were convinced this devil channel would surely encourage us to snort drugs and murder puppies and alter our report cards so that a D in math looked like a B. Truth be told, I almost got away with that last one. It was definitely worth a shot. But I hardly fault Guns N' Roses for my dishonesty. I blame long division. Of course, these days, MTV is known for its reality programming, and the network has basically become a giant bouncy castle for America's drunk, tanned, and pregnant. As a viewer, it's kind of like virtually enrolling at Arizona State. However, on Thursday, to celebrate the Fourth of July, MTV and VH1 decided to go with 12 straight hours of music video programming. And news of this decision played out nicely all over the Web as excitement built for a short taste of that bygone era. Though, to be fair, the online anticipation rather reeked of moth balls. The younger generation probably didn't care. Damn kids. Get off my lawn. After reading a few of the many trending articles about the upcoming ""Music Independence Day,"" I actually spent some time Wednesday afternoon nostalgically searching YouTube for old videos from what many argue were MTV's glory years -- when Nirvana competed for airtime with Eric Clapton and Van Halen and Metallica and R.E.M. and Sir Mix-a-Lot. Yes, those were the days. Or maybe THESE are the days. The very thing I was doing -- instantly calling up videos on YouTube -- is part of the reason why MTV doesn't air them in the first place. We've got everything we want just one mouse click and Twitter link away. So, don't hate on MTV. It's a business. And if there was money in music videos, that's what they would show. But there's not. The real money is in watching rich kids try to boink each other on Laguna Beach. However, not during America's Independence Day! Thus, as a civic duty to my generation, I decided to dedicate one full hour of my afternoon to channel surfing between MTV and VH1 just to see what the music video experience feels like in 2013. Yes, it was tough investigative journalism. But at least it didn't require pants. My mission started just around 1 p.m. when, after several minutes of cable box confusion, I finally clicked over to the low-numbered SD channel for MTV. Apparently, I don't get it in high def. And I have to say that being out of the 800s felt dirty and weird. ""People actually watch this crap?"" Nevertheless, I bravely entered a proletariat cave of low technology, and the first video already playing was 'N Sync's ""Tearin' Up My Heart"" from the late '90s. Of course, it was that absolutely terrible boy band music, but at least it was fun to see a young Justin Timberlake in the early stages of his world domination. The next video was Maroon 5's ""Moves Like Jagger,"" at which point I promptly moved like Jagger over to VH1. Mind you, the song is totally fine, but there's just a whole lot going on in the video -- too much movement -- and I was fairly certain I was about to have a seizure. MTV's sister network, on the other hand, seemed to be dedicating the bulk of its airtime to emerging indie bands, and I was immediately introduced to a duo called Johnnyswim and their video for ""Heart Beats."" It was decent, actually. And slower. Thus, I was no longer foaming from the mouth. So, things were looking up. Throughout the rest of the hour, I surfed back and forth, catching videos from artists I'd never heard of like Nabiha and Flume. And I also saw some hits from more mainstream talent like Eminem, Outkast, and Gwen Stefani. The highlight was actually LMFAO's ""Party Rock Anthem."" And I can't believe I just wrote that. But it's a video that simply doesn't disappoint. It's colorful and happy and absurd, and somehow it just fixes any situation. ""I'm afraid the test results show you have syphilis."" ""It's all good, doc. Everyday I'm shufflin'!"" ""Right. But seriously. You're gonna need some penicillin."" In the end, my hour of modern music videos definitely wasn't what I remembered from my youth, but it was still interesting and fun while it lasted. That said, I admit I was more than happy to turn off the TV and move on to other things. I'm a busy man, and it's not like I can outsource my regularly scheduled 2 p.m. nap. Not that it matters, what with all the noise coming from outside. Damn kids. Get off my lawn.","For Independence Day, MTV and VH1 dedicated 12 hours to music videos .

"New York (CNN) -- The New York City Police Department has agreed to clear its database of people who were stopped under the controversial stop-and-frisk practice but were cleared of criminal wrongdoings, according to the settlement issued Wednesday in the New York Supreme Court. In a move to settle the state lawsuit filed by the New York Civil Liberties Union in 2010, the NYPD has agreed to erase the database within 90 days. ""Though much still needs to be done, this settlement is an important step towards curbing the impact of abusive stop and frisk practices,"" said Christopher Dunn, associate legal director of the NYCLU and lead plaintiffs' counsel in the case. Information to be cleared from the electronic database includes names and addresses of all people who have been stopped, arrested or issued a summons in castes that were later dismissed or resolved with a noncriminal violation. NYPD officers say they had stop-and-frisk quotas . In July 2010, a state law was enacted prohibiting the NYPD from keeping a computer database of the names and personal information of people who were unjustly stopped, questioned or frisked by police officers and were neither arrested nor issued a summons. ""The NYPD had been in full compliance with the relevant legislation since it was passed in 2010. Accordingly, there was no practical reason to continue this litigation,"" said Paul Browne, deputy police commissioner. One of the lead plaintiffs in the case, Clive Lino, was stopped more than once and was issued summonses that were later dismissed. ""It is a relief to know that my personal information will be cleared from the stop-and-frisk database,"" said Lino. Lino, who is black, has been stopped at least 13 times by NYPD officers, according to the NYCLU. ""It is humiliating enough to be stopped and frisked for no reason, having your name and address kept in a police database only prolongs the indignity of it,"" he said. Report: Most 'stopped and frisked' are minorities . The controversial method in which police stop, question and possibly search those they consider suspicious is used to deter crime, the police department has said. ""New Yorkers who are the victims of unjustified police stops will no longer suffer the further injustice of having their personal information stored indefinitely in an NYPD database,"" said NYCLU Executive Director Donna Lieberman. The NYPD database will only erase records of those who were cleared of any wrongdoing, but will continue to maintain details of all other aspects of police stops. There is also a federal class-action lawsuit that is still in the hands of a judge. The lawsuit claims that police officers routinely stop minority men, particularly black and Latino men, without legal reasons. It also seeks to reform stop-and-frisk under the supervision of a court-appointed monitor.","New York's stop-and-frisk policy allows police to stop those they consider suspicious .

"Perugia, Italy (CNN) -- Raffaele Sollecito was a 23-year-old computer science student when his girlfriend's roommate, Meredith Kercher, was found dead in the house she shared with Amanda Knox in Perugia, Italy, four years ago. The discovery proved to be the beginning of what he calls ""a nightmare."" He and Knox were detained for questioning days later, and charged with murder the following summer. In December 2009, they were convicted, though lawyers for both suggested the crime was carried out solely by a third man, Rudy Guede, who was convicted in a separate trial. There's dispute about the evidence linking him to the murder. Prosecutors say his DNA was found on a bra clasp belonging to Kercher, while the defense says there is too little genetic material for a positive ID and that the clasp could have been contaminated by police handling. His alibi proved impossible to verify -- he says he was at home on the night of the killing, but his computer showed no activity during the time Kercher was killed. In the end, the jury sided with the prosecutors, sentencing him to 25 years in prison for the murder and related crimes. (Knox got an extra year because she was also found guilty of defaming bar owner Patrick Lumumba by accusing him of the killing.) It was not the result Sollecito was expecting. ""When the sentencing was read, I didn't understand what was happening and even now it seems impossible and still I don't understand why I was convicted,"" he said in a prison interview through his lawyer the week after the sentencing. He continues to believe he has a future outside prison, he said. ""Otherwise, I would go insane. I think especially about studying and obtaining a post-graduate degree,"" he said. He has finished his computer science degree in prison, according to press reports. Sollecito was not studying at the same university as Knox, and is not being held in the same prison. He said it is difficult to remain hopeful. ""The world has collapsed on top of me with this verdict. It collapsed on me and Amanda,"" he said. He denied that he is still in love with her. ""But I feel close to her because I consider her my companion in misadventure,"" he said. He rejected the idea that Knox is capable of murder. ""I don't even dare think a thing like that. It is absurd and inadmissible. She is a very sweet girl,"" he insisted. As their joint appeal came to a close this month, his lawyer, Giulia Bongiorno, rejected media portrayals of Sollecito as a patsy who fell into the clutches of a femme fatale, Knox. ""The lives of this kid and his parents have been destroyed. You must today evaluate if -- if -- if these kids committed the crime,"" Bongiorno told jurors. Sollecito may well head for home if the jury decides in his favor. Sollecito is from Bari, on the Adriatic coast, far south of the central Italian university town where he was studying, and in his prison interview he said he misses the smell of the sea. ""Above all my family,"" he said in the interview conducted via attorney Luca Maori. ""I also miss my friends, the everyday life, the walks in my town's square. And I very much miss the smell of the sea."" If he does go home to Bari, he hopes simply to blend in, he said. ""I only hope to be forgotten; the sooner the better. I want to have a normal life,"" he said from behind bars. ""I don't want to be recognized when I leave the prison."" --CNN's Hada Messia contributed to this report.","Sollecito was a 23-year-old computer science student when Meredith Kercher was killed .

"(CNN) -- Sally Ride became the first American woman in space when she flew into orbit aboard the Space Shuttle Challenger in 1983, but that was far from her only achievement. The 61-year-old astronaut, who died Monday after a 17-month battle with pancreatic cancer was an inspiration to women around the world and a passionate advocate of female advancement in the fields of science, technology and mathematics. She founded Sally Ride Science in 2001 -- an educational organization which sought to encourage girls and young students to pursue their passion for science -- a predominantly male-dominated field. Ride also wrote a number of children's books, earned several degrees (including a PhD in Physics from Stanford University) and returned to space on her second and final mission in 1984.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- MIchael Jackson and Dr. Conrad Murray tried to recruit an anesthesiologist to join them on his comeback tour, according to testimony in the AEG Live wrongful death trial. Murray arranged the meeting in March 2009 in which Jackson asked Dr. David Adams to travel with him to London, Adams testified. Adams said that after he offered to take the job for $100,000 a month guaranteed for three years, Murray stopped communicating with him. ""I texted basically, you know, 'what's going on, I'm on board,"" Adams said. ""And no response."" Just weeks later Murray accepted an offer from an AEG Live executive to be Jackson's personal physician on his ""This Is It"" tour for $150,000 a month. Murray told investigators he began infusing Jackson with the surgical anesthetic propofol to treat his insomnia in April, a treatment that eventually killed the pop icon. Debbie Rowe: Paris Jackson 'has no life' since father's death . Jurors in the trial of Jackson's last concert promoter viewed the video depositions of Adams and two other witnesses Wednesday ahead of a six-day break in testimony. Jackson's mother and children are suing AEG Live, contending the company's executives negligently hired, retained or supervised Murray, who was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in Jackson's propofol overdose death. AEG Live's lawyers argue it was Jackson -- not its executives -- who chose and controlled Murray and that they had no way of knowing about the dangerous treatments he was giving the singer in the privacy of his bedroom. Jackson: 'Help me get my rest' Adams, who administered propofol to Jackson during cosmetic dental procedures in Las Vegas four times in 2008, said Jackson and Murray never told him what his duties would be if he took a job with the tour. ""I said 'I don't sing and I really can't dance, so to do what?"" Adams testified. ""He says 'Well, you know, I'm entertaining, I'm jumping around, I'm doing this. Every once in a while I need an IV,"" Adams testified. ""And he says 'I just need you to help me get my rest.' They were pretty vague, but on hindsight I know what they were talking about."" Jackson and Murray, however, never mentioned that administering propofol or treating his insomnia would be one of his responsibilities on tour, the anesthesiologist testified. Jackson never asked him to do anything medically inappropriate, Adams said. Adams hinted that there was jealously on Murray's part when Jackson courted him for a tour job. ""Murray really looked like he had just lost his best friend"" when Jackson was discussing it, Adams said. ""Oh, he was truly upset."" Defense expert: Promoter didn't pressure Jackson's doctor . Murray told CNN's Anderson Cooper in April that Michael Jackson had ""his own stash"" of propofol in his home before he began treating him with it. ""I did not agree with Michael, but Michael felt that it was not an issue because he had been exposed to it for years and he knew exactly how things worked,"" Murray said. ""And given the situation at the time, it was my approach to try to get him off of it, but Michael Jackson was not the kind of person you can just say 'Put it down' and he's going to do that."" Jackson lawyers argue that AEG Live was negligent for not checking out Murray's distressed financial situation before agreeing to pay him $150,000 a month. It created a conflict of interest that led Murray to ignore safe practices and his responsibility to Jackson's health, they contend. AEG Live executives also ignored a series of red flags that should have warned them that Jackson's health was deteriorating under Murray's care and another doctor should have been called in, they argue. Adams was in a Las Vegas operating room on June 25, 2009, when he learned Jackson had died. ""I texted Murray 'I'm sorry to hear what happened. Take care,'"" he said. Murray never responded, he said. Dr. Murray's connection to Michael Jackson . Murray did respond that night to a phone call from another Adams. Jeffrey Adams is the person who initially introduced him to Michael Jackson in February 2007 when the singer needed a doctor to treat one of his children in Las Vegas. Jeffrey Adams -- no relation to Dr. David Adams -- had known Murray for years and the cardiologist had treated his father's heart ailment in 2007. His video deposition was shown to jurors Wednesday morning. He testified that he called Dr. Murray to offer his help after he saw on television that Jackson had died. ""I told him he had taken care of my father for me and I would be at his side until this situation was complete,"" Adams testified. Murray told him that night ""he was going to need a lawyer,"" he said. He and Murray ""did everything together"" from June 26, 2009 --a day after Jackson's death -- until November 7, 2011 -- the day Murray was convicted of involuntary manslaughter, he said. Jeffrey Adams said he served as Murray's bodyguard for more than two years without pay. Despite his close relationship to Murray, Adams said he has not spoken to the doctor since he was put in handcuffs in the courtroom and taken to jail. Murray is expected to be released from jail on October 28, 2013 -- after serving two years of a four-year prison sentence, according to his lawyer. Doctor's competed to give Jackson painkillers, ex-wife says . Murray and Jackson: ""Seemed very odd"" Murray's relationship with Michael Jackson ""seemed very odd,"" according to Las Vegas plastic surgeon Dr. Stephen Gordon. Jurors also watched his video deposition Wednesday. ""He presented himself as being Mr. Jackson's personal physician and spokesperson to some extent"" when Murray accompanied Jackson on an appointment to have cosmetic filler put in his face on May 14, 2007, Gordon said. Gordon had treated Jackson several times four years earlier, but not when Murray was with him -- and he even wrote a $1,300 check to pay for the procedure, he said. ""The whole situation seemed very odd and it didn't add up and that caused me not to fully trust the person,"" Gordon testified. ""I felt like a successful cardiologist doesn't go around being somebody's private physician and speaking for them, in my experience."" Jackson, however, appeared to be capable of dealing with doctors on his own, Gordon said. ""He gave me the impression that he was used to telling doctors what he wanted them to do."" Jackson personally called him in 2002 when he was looking for a doctor in Las Vegas to give him collagen and Botox treatments, he said. ""At first I thought it was somebody playing a prank, one of my friends fooling around,"" Gordon said. He realized it really was the pop star when he called him back at his hotel -- asking for him under his alias ""Michael Jefferson,"" he said. Wednesday was the 74th day of testimony on the trial, which the judge predicted would last another month.","""I just need you to help me get my rest,"" Michael Jackson tells anesthesiologist .

"(CNN) -- Elizabeth Smart stormed out of the courtroom Wednesday during the trial of Brian Mitchell, charged with kidnapping the Utah teenager in 2002, CNN affiliate KSTU reported. Visibly upset, she left the courtroom during the testimony of a defense witness, Dr. Paul Whitehead, a forensic psychiatrist at the state mental hospital who treated Mitchell from 2005 to 2008. Whitehead testified about Mitchell's desire to bear children with Smart, KSTU reported. ""Mr. Mitchell was talking with Ms. Smart about having babies to the point where Ms. Smart actually picked out a name in case that happened,"" Whitehead testified. That statement prompted Smart's departure. She was followed by her mother. Mitchell's federal trial had been halted a day earlier when Mitchell suffered a medical problem in court. On Tuesday, KSTU posted a picture of Mitchell on its website, showing him wearing an oxygen mask and sitting on a stretcher as he was being loaded into an ambulance. Mitchell, as usual, had begun singing when he was led into the courtroom Tuesday: ""O Holy Night,"" KSTU reported. U.S. District Judge Dale Kimball began the proceedings by raising an issue in a note sent from jurors. As Kimball asked for jurors to be brought in, Mitchell began to wail and dropped to the floor, KSTU said. Defense attorney Wendy Lewis told Kimball, ""He's having a seizure, your honor."" An ambulance was called, and paramedics came into the courthouse to examine Mitchell, according to KSTU. ""The judge told the jury that an issue had come up and the trial would be suspended,"" said Melodie Rydalch, a spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office in Utah. Rebecca Woodridge, Mitchell's stepdaughter, told KSTU he has suffered seizures before. ""He's had a few of them in the past year. I don't think there's any reason for him to fake this,"" she said. Defense attorney Robert Steele said outside the courthouse that Smart herself had testified about Mitchell suffering a seizure during her time in captivity. ""We watched a seizure,"" he said, according to KSTU. ""It really happened."" Mitchell, 57, faces charges of kidnapping and unlawful transportation of a minor across state lines in Smart's abduction. Then 14, she was kidnapped from her bedroom in her family's Salt Lake City, Utah, home. Nine months later, she was found in the company of Mitchell -- a drifter and self-described ""prophet"" who called himself Immanuel -- and his wife, Wanda Barzee. Mitchell's trial resumed Monday after taking last week off. Barzee earlier testified as a defense witness. Defense attorneys are mounting an insanity defense for Mitchell, hoping to prove that mental illness clouded his mind to such a degree that he did not understand that his actions were wrong when he abducted and held Smart. The defense said Tuesday in court that they plan to conclude their case late this week, perhaps Thursday. The prosecution said it has up to five days of rebuttal witnesses, but both sides assured Kimball that they would be finished with closing arguments by December 10. CNN's Ashley Hayes and Michael Martinez and In Session's Jean Casarez contributed to this report.","Psychiatrist was testifying in trial of man accused of kidnapping smart .

"(CNN) -- We all have bad habits. Nobody's perfect. Especially the booger eaters. Most everyone will agree that one of the very worst habits -- if not THE worst habit -- is cigarette smoking. Because, really, as far as poor life choices go, it's right up there with setting your DVR for ""Two and a Half Men."" Nothing good can come from it. But one horribly addicted man in Turkey is determined to quit, and he's taking his efforts to a hilarious new level. Because, after 26 years of cigarettes, Ibrahim Yucel has decided to encase his entire head in a metal cage. And, hell, it might just work. Though, generally speaking, that kind of self-imposed personal torture is usually best reserved for adventurous bedroom shenanigans with shady (yet willing) people you meet on Craigslist. So I've heard. But Yucel is serious about kicking his two-pack-a-day habit, and, as a last-ditch effort, it's all come down to the metal head cage. Which has now gone somewhat viral. A video detailing his master plan recently surfaced on YouTube, and amazed viewers got to watch Yucel's wife literally lock him in for the day before he headed off to work. Which, despite his positive, health-conscious intentions, is a terribly misguided decision. As someone who had to wear orthodontic headgear as a kid, I can assure you there's no glory being seen in public looking like Hannibal Lecter. But our hero doesn't seem to care, and perhaps this low-tech solution IS the solution. Amazingly, Yucel created the device all by himself using 130 feet of copper wire. Which, on the down side, means if he ever wears it into the wrong neighborhood, it'll be gone in less than 10 minutes. ""Come on!"" But, until then the cage, which has only two keys that are kept by his wife and daughter, should prevent him from getting cigarettes up to his mouth, while providing just enough room for sliding in crackers and a flattened drinking straw. Yucel is motivated by the memory of his father, who died of lung cancer, and I applaud the man for trying to quit. I wish more of you would do the same. Not so much because I care about your health, but because my biggest pet peeve in life is when people throw their butts on the ground. It drives me crazy. Unfortunately, even the kindest, most law-abiding citizens do it. Apparently, at some point in history a bunch of old dudes got together to make the rules of life and officially agreed that, for whatever reason, this would not be considered litter. ""Beer bottles?"" ""Litter!"" ""Fast-food wrappers?"" ""Litter!"" ""Hey, what about cigarette butts?"" ""Shut up, Dan."" To me, tossing butts on the ground is a habit almost as bad as actually smoking. It's rude. It's unsightly. And it's definitely worse than booger eating. Fortunately, though, the majority of personal bad habits are rather innocent and don't have any real negative impact on society as a whole. For instance, I drink waaay too much Diet Coke, and none of you are any worse off because of it. Save for my distracted co-workers who sit near the men's room. ""Hi. Me again."" Sadly, there are some habits that are so bad to the point where they don't even technically qualify as habits. For example, setting things on fire really shouldn't be ""your thing."" ""Good grief, Wayne. You gotta stop doing that."" ""I know, right?"" But smoking is still pretty bad. So, if you're not interested in donning Yucel's giant metal cage, and if the patch and the gum aren't working, I know of only one other sure-fire way to quit: Move to Sydney, Australia. Never in my life have I seen cigarettes so expensive, where bumming one on the streets is basically like asking a stranger to pay your next mortgage bill. Mind you, I'm not a smoker. But when I visit a foreign city I find you can often get a pulse for the general cost of living by how much they charge for beer and cigarettes. And, at least from my travels, that's about as bad as I've seen it. So, go to Australia, and I promise you'll be well on your way to better health. Unless, of course, you simply get killed just by virtue of being in that country. Fun fact: Nine out of ten things in Australia are venomous. Including most office supplies. But if all your foreign travel money is being spent on cigarettes in the first place, maybe you should settle for Yucel's giant metal cage. Even if it doesn't work, at least you'll still have it for the next time you browse Craigslist. And that can be fun. So I've heard.

"(CNN) -- George Carlin once said, ""I don't automatically wash my hands every time I go to the bathroom. You know when I wash my hands? When I s**t on them."" A few years before he passed away, I actually had a chance to shake George's unwashed hand. And while I certainly don't regret getting to meet the man, I am, now, slightly concerned with whether or not I immediately enjoyed any post-introduction Doritos. That cheese residue on your fingers -- it's so good. Of course, George's hands were probably just as unclean as anybody else's, considering only 5% of us actually wash properly in the first place, according to a new trending study from Michigan State University. Mind you, this startling statistic is not to suggest that the other 95% of us simply stare at a bar of soap, silently drool a little, and then wear it as a hat. For the most part we all get the general concept of soap. But what it really means is that many people don't actually wash for long enough to kill infectious germs. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, one must spend at least 15 seconds scrubbing with soap and water to effectively clean away the disgusting remnants of whatever the hell it was you just picked off your thigh. ""Give it to me straight, Doc. Is it cancer?"" ""It's a Skittle."" Fifteen seconds of washing doesn't sound like much, but it is. Seriously. Try doing anything for that long, like reading or helping others. It's damn near impossible. In fact, right now I want you to start mock-washing your hands while counting up. I promise you'll start feeling silly by the time you get to seven. Which is only halfway, and a full second longer than the average wash, which lasts six seconds. Yet, a solid 15-Mississippi is what's required of us so we don't go around town dirty and diseased, recklessly giving each other burning sensations. That's what Bangkok is for. I saw that ""Hangover"" sequel. So, to find out all this gross and unfortunate information, Michigan State University researchers stealthily observed 3,749 people in public restrooms. Which I'm sure wasn't at all creepy. ""What? You don't take a camping chair to public bathrooms?"" In addition to discovering that most of us fail to wash properly -- especially men -- they also learned that 33% of people don't use soap, and 10% didn't even bother to wash at all. And, sadly, there's a pretty good chance one of those individuals just made your sandwich. And by ""made"" I mean smothered it in little tiny particles of human filth. Carl Borchgrevink, professor of hospitality business and lead investigator in the study, noted that, ""These findings were surprising to us because past research suggested that proper hand washing is occurring at a much higher rate."" So, it seems we've gotten lazy. Which is why some food and (especially) health care businesses are turning to technology. The basic message: You're all dirty and gross, so we're bringing in robots. For example, there's CloudClean which issues food service employees an ID badge. When a server or cook walks into the restroom, a wall-mounted sensor notes the individual's arrival. Another sensor is located on the soap dispenser. If Suzie forgets to wash her hands -- which is rather likely since she was probably only in there to smoke pot during her break -- the ID badge will gently beep as a reminder. Then, if Suzie completely fails to wash before leaving the room, the system automatically updates her Facebook status with embarrassing photos. When it comes to punishment and public humiliation, CloudClean doesn't mess around. Actually, the system just notifies management that Suzie probably shouldn't be on fish duty. But the other idea would definitely work, too. Another similar system, Biovigil, also uses electronic badges. When a doctor or nurse enters a patient's room, the badge reminds the individual to use sanitizer. Then, he or she holds a hand up to the badge which detects alcohol. If sanitizer has been used, the badge turns green so everyone knows. And all this is recorded in a central server. It actually seems like a great system for busy and distracted health care workers, hopefully making germs one less thing to worry about. As opposed to all those cancerous Skittles growing on your thigh.","Michigan State University study says only 5% of people properly wash their hands .

"JERUSALEM (CNN)  -- Israel's military advocate general said the use of cluster bombs by the country's armed forces during last year's war with Hezbollah in southern Lebanon was done so in accordance with international law and, as a result, he will not file charges against any military officers who ordered their use. A Lebanese man sits with a cluster bomb, other Israeli shells and mines that failed to explode upon landing. The findings were reported by Brig. Gen. Avihai Mendelblit on Monday. ""Based on the evidence gathered by the Investigating Officer, it was clear that (the) majority of the cluster munitions were fired at open and uninhabited areas, areas from which Hezbollah forces operated and in which no civilians were present."" The enormous collateral damage and civilian casualties in southern Lebanon caused an outcry by rights groups and Arabs governance about the use of cluster bombs. Last January, preliminary findings of a State Department investigation into Israel's use of U.S.-made cluster bombs in the war showed the Israeli army likely violated agreements with the United States governing their use, a State Department report said. ""There may -- likely could have been some violations,"" State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said. The State Department sent a report to Congress laying out the preliminary findings, he said. Agreements under the Arms Export Control Act govern use of munitions sold by the United States. Those agreements are confidential. While there is no international treaty in effect regulating cluster bombs, according to Human Rights Watch, their use is restricted under international humanitarian law.

"(CNN) -- In two weeks, economic policymakers from around the world will gather in Washington, D.C., for the World Bank-IMF Spring Meetings. As has been the case for the past five years, there will be much talk of economic crisis and of strategies to restore confidence, kick start growth, and create jobs. There is growing evidence that we are on the right track, but this agenda still requires much more work. The meetings, though, also offer an occasion to look beyond the short term crisis-fighting measures. It is a chance for leaders to adopt a long-term perspective and assess where we stand and where we are headed. If they do, they will see that today we are at a moment of historic opportunity. For the end of absolute poverty, a dream which has enticed and driven humanity for centuries, is now within our grasp. READ MORE: Bono on how to fight poverty . In recent decades the world has made impressive progress in the fight against poverty, a fact too often lost in the headlines of immediate crisis conditions. On the strength of robust private sector growth underpinned by improved economic governance, today extreme poverty is in retreat across the developing world. In 1990, 43% of the developing world lived on less than $1.25 a day. The World Bank estimates that by 2010 this figure had dropped to 21%. The first Millennium Development Goal, to halve extreme poverty, was achieved five years ahead of time. As we look forward, while we of course cannot take high growth for granted, the conditions are in place for this strong performance to continue. Indeed, the successes of past decades and an increasingly favorable economic outlook combine to give developing countries a chance -- for the first time ever -- to end extreme poverty within a generation. Our collective duty now must be to ensure that these favorable circumstances are matched with deliberate decisions to realize this remarkable opportunity. READ MORE: Is Africa much richer than we think? No one knows . The world can end extreme poverty by 2030. This feasible but ambitious goal should bring unity, urgency, and energy to our collective efforts in the fight against poverty. Meeting this deadline will require strong, stable growth across the developing world, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. It will require policies to enhance inclusiveness and prevent increases in inequality, and ensure that growth translates into poverty reduction, most importantly through creating jobs. It will require transformational changes in fragile states, which are home to an increasing share of the world's poor. And it will require that potential shocks, such as climatic disasters or new fuel, food, or financial crises, are averted or mitigated. It will not be easy, and will demand concerted global action from governments, donors, civil society, and the private sector. But is there anyone, anywhere, who doubts that the reward will be worth it? READ MORE: Study shows speed of global warming . Of course progress toward ending poverty will need to be sustained over time and for all future generations. We must promote shared prosperity, helping vulnerable people so that they will not fall back into poverty. And, crucially unless the world takes bold action now, a disastrously warming planet threatens to reverse past advances. Climate change is not just an environmental challenge: It is a fundamental threat to economic development and the fight against poverty. At the World Bank Group we have no pretence that we will be the key actor in ending poverty. Progress toward this goal, as it always has, will continue to depend primarily on the actions of developing countries. But we will be there to help. We will work with our partners to share knowledge on solutions to end poverty. We will closely monitor and observe progress toward this goal, reporting annually on what has been achieved and where gaps remain. And we will use our convening and advocacy power to continually remind policymakers and the international community what is at stake. By acting today, there is an opportunity to create a world for our children which is defined not by stark inequities but by soaring opportunities. We can and must achieve a world free of poverty.

"Editor's note: Since the FBI arrested a Brooklyn businessman in late July on federal charges of organ trafficking, CNN has been conducting a worldwide investigation into the sale of kidneys using willing donors and willing recipients from China to Israel to the United States. Nick Rosen says he got $20,000 to donate his kidney and lied to the hospital's transplant team. TEL AVIV, Israel (CNN) -- Four years ago, a young, cash-starved Israeli answered an ad in a newspaper for a kidney donor. ""I decided I wanted to make a positive change in my life and do something different,"" Nick Rosen told CNN. ""So I saw an ad in the paper and it said, 'Kidney Donor Wanted.' And called the ad in the paper, and they asked me my blood type."" Ultimately, Rosen flew to New York and underwent surgery at Mount Sinai Medical Center to remove one of his two healthy kidneys. ""Let's say I donated a kidney and received compensation,"" he said. Rosen's story is one of several that have come to light in recent weeks as part of a worldwide CNN investigation into what appears to be a widespread black market in human organs currently under scrutiny by authorities in the United States and Israel. Rosen says he was paid $20,000 for his kidney -- something he admits he lied about in interviews with the hospital's transplant team. Watch Rosen explain how he sold his kidney » . What Rosen did -- and what the man who received the kidney did -- violated a 1994 U.S. federal law that forbids the selling or purchase of live organs for cash. He not only got his money, but made an 11-minute documentary film he called ""Kidney Beans"" to show how easy it was to sell an organ. A portion of the documentary shows him lying on a bed, covered in cash he says he was paid. In a written statement, Mount Sinai told CNN: ""The pre-transplant evaluation may not detect premeditated and skillful attempts to subvert and defraud the evaluation process."" ""Mount Sinai's transplant screening process is rigorous and comprehensive, and assesses each donor's motivation,"" the hospital said. A hospital medical source put it more bluntly: ""We were duped."" According to kidney transplant doctors, the process of pre-screening, blood-type matching and other related medical issues normally takes two months before any surgery. During that time, both recipient and doctor have to make several visits to a team of doctors, social workers and perhaps even ethicists before a final decision is made. Hospitals often ask donors to sign documents which ask whether they have received any compensation for donating a kidney or other organ. But no documentation is required to prove a family connection. The chief of nephrology at Mount Sinai later said hospitals and doctors are primarily concerned with medicine. ""We're not detectives. We're not the FBI,"" Dr. Barbara Murphy said. ""People can, on occasion, deceive us."" But what Rosen did was not unique, according to the World Health Organization, which says 10 percent of kidney transplants worldwide are believed to be illicit. Dr. Eli A. Friedman, a leading kidney specialist, teacher and researcher at Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn, said the United States leads the world in kidney transplants. About 16,000 of them are performed every year, he said. ""That would mean that somewhere between 1,500 and 2,000 transplants in the United States might fall in the categorization of being illegal,"" Friedman said. He added, ""I have had several experiences with patients with data that says they got a kidney from their brother, their sister or from their parent when they don't have a brother or a sister, "" Dr. Friedman told CNN. "" The transplant was performed under false circumstances."" And Friedman said he's been offered bribes of $5,000 to $10,000 by kidney brokers. ""Of course I was very happy to see them leave the office very rapidly,"" he said. The extent of the underground network came to the surface in late July, when FBI agents arrested a Brooklyn businessman on charges of organ trafficking. A federal complaint against Itzhak-Levy Rosenbaum said he had offered to provide a new kidney for a relative of an undercover FBI agent for about $160,000. According to the complaint, Rosenbaum told the agent he could buy the kidney for about $5,000 and gave instructions on exact procedures and methods to avoid detection. The complaint quoted Rosenbaum as bragging: ""So far, I've never had a failure."" Ronald Kleinberg, the attorney for Rosenbaum, told CNN he could not comment on the FBI complaint ""because I have not had enough time to assess the information."" He said CNN's ""assertions are incorrect,"" and that law enforcement's account of Rosenbaum's network was inaccurate. But law enforcement sources said Rosenbaum had been the centerpiece of a kidney-for-sale operation, which he called ""United Lifeline,"" that operated extensively for nearly a decade. The donors and patients in this network were linked by one common theme -- they were Jewish. Investigators say the donors usually came from Eastern Europe, were mostly poor and willing to sell their kidneys to U.S. and Israeli patients. According to one expert on organ trafficking, the FBI had been alerted to Rosenbaum's activities years ago. Nancy Scheper-Hughes, an anthropologist at the University of California at Berkeley and founder of a newsletter called ""Organs Watch,"" said she had told the FBI about Rosenbaum and her suspicions about him seven years ago. ""I think they thought it was a very few bad apples,"" Scheper-Hughes said. The FBI said would not officially comment on her assertions, but an FBI source later said, ""We developed our own leads."" According to Scheper-Hughes, the same day she spoke to CNN, she had learned of another illegal transplant surgery taking place at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles. The donor, she said, was a young Korean national who had received more than $25,000 for one of his kidneys. ""This is a kid that does not speak much English, who is terrified and shaken,"" she said. ""And he thought, 'Maybe I've made a mistake to do this, but $25,000 is a good amount of cash.'"" Scheper-Hughes said the cash had been handed over in two increments, with the second paid to a relative in a hospital bathroom. In a statement, Cedars-Sinai spokeswoman Sally Stewart said living donors ""must state they are not receiving payment for their kidney."" ""If at any time during the evaluation process, the transplant team suspects the donor is inappropriately being paid for a kidney, the transplant is canceled,"" she said. But a hospital source later told CNN, ""We do not give lie-detector tests to our patients."" According to Scheper-Hughes, who is in the final stages of writing a book on organ trafficking, much of the world's illicit traffic in kidneys can be traced to Israel. ""Israel is the top,"" she said. ""It has tentacles reaching out worldwide."" Until March 2008, Israeli law allowed Israeli citizens to go abroad for live organ transplants from non-related donors. But there was no way for Israeli authorities to keep track of how many of those cases involved money changing hands, the country's Health Ministry said. Israeli investigators are looking intensively at illegal organ trafficking under the new law, the ministry said. And prosecutors in Nazareth sent nine Israelis to jail in 2007 after uncovering a black-market ring that was buying and selling organs. Gilad Ehrlick, the assistant district attorney for Israel's Northern District, said he was shocked by the case. Secretly recorded conversations showed that Arab and Russian newspapers were targeting low-income Israelis and Palestinians with ads saying there would be payment in exchange for providing a kidney. ""The idea was the people were calling out of despair, out of urgent need who needed a quick way to make money,"" he said.","CNN investigating what appears to be a widespread black market in human organs .

"Toronto (CNN) -- I've been camping countless times in the forest -- as one does -- and without fail, there's always plenty of wood just lying around. Plenty of concrete might indicate that, perhaps, you've somehow pitched a tent in Pittsburgh. But in the forest, there's definitely wood. Lots of it. Everywhere. That's how forests work, and it's actually the first question in their job interview. ""Do you make wood?"" ""Yes."" ""Lots of wood?"" ""Yes."" ""Congratulations. You are a forest. Here is your bear."" Yet, despite all the trees, at no point in my many outdoor adventures have I ever consider whipping out a saw and hauling back a medium-sized log with the intention of selling it to sheltered city folk as an ironic, rustic home furnishing. That would just be ridiculous. Which is why -- of course -- a furniture store exists in Toronto where they've literally price-tagged a plain stump of wood for $98 Canadian. Which, these days, counts as real money! Mind you, this stump -- which isn't intricately carved or decorated or manipulated in any way from its natural form -- will not charge your iPhone, it won't make you an omelet, and I'm pretty sure it doesn't come with Netflix. It's just a stump. And it costs $98 (that's $94.84 in American dollars). I first learned of this uber-log the other day when, prior to a work trip to Canada, I was searching Reddit for popular and unusual topics relating to Toronto. Almost immediately, I found a link to a photo of the log with the topic headline, ""I submit proof that Toronto is the Hipster Capital of the Universe."" Though that original post was actually created more than a month ago, it remained popular within the Toronto sub-Reddit. Thus, when I got to town I simply had to see if this thing was for real. So, when I had a few spare minutes, I made a special trip over to DesignRepublic, a trendy little store in the heart of the city, just to have a look. And there it was. The exact STUMP from Reddit. Only now somebody had added a ""Y"" to the tag so it read ""STUMPY."" Perhaps this was a shout out to the animated series ""Ren & Stimpy,"" which, when I initially saw the log online, was the very first thing that came to my head. Back in the early 1990s, the completely warped (and brilliant) somehow-for-children's cartoon gave us a musical segment called ""Log Song."" It was a parody commercial where a bratty kid pines not for a bike or a video game but for a giant piece of wood. The song ends with a jubilant cry: ""Come on and get your log! Everyone needs a log!"" It was meant to be silly, of course. No kid would ever want a log over other exciting toys. Maybe a Lincoln Log if they're desperate. Or if they just really, really enjoy choking. Either way, log appears to be making a comeback. I spoke with a sales clerk at DesignRepublic who (quite rightfully) seemed both uneasy and taken aback by my multitude of questions regarding the stump. But I'm a serious journalist, and I needed answers. And he was the unlucky bastard who had to deal with me. ""People live far from nature,"" the clerk politely explained before finally conceding, ""but if you live in the country, you're like, what the hell is that?"" He also enthusiastically added, ""Wait till you see the new stumps we have!"" I'm sure they're wonderful. But what may be more interesting than this $98 chunk of wood is the Redditor declaring Toronto as the hipster capital of the universe. Because, really, what IS the hipster capital of the universe? From an international perspective, Berlin, Tokyo, London and Reykjavik all seemed to pop up on several online lists. Toronto never made an appearance. Here in the States, Travel + Leisure ranked the best overall U.S. cities for hipsters, and Portland, Oregon, came out No. 1, followed by Seattle. But multiple other websites suggest the true hipster mecca is either Silver Lake in Los Angeles or Williamsburg, a funky neighborhood in Brooklyn. As I kept seeing the word Williamsburg pop up, it took me a few minutes to figure out where this actually was. At first I thought everyone was talking about COLONIAL Williamsburg. And that sort of blew my mind. I was dumbfounded that, perhaps, hordes of bearded dudes with cutoff shorts and bicycles had somehow sacked the city and turned Ye Olde Shoe Cobbler into Ye Olde Crappy Record Store. But fear not. Colonial Williamsburg has not been taken over by hipsters, and it delightfully remains a family-friendly tourist destination in Virginia where you can relive the glory days of smallpox. Regardless, if people want a quality, medium-sized chunk of hipster wood, apparently they'll have to visit DesignRepublic in Toronto. Because it's either that or venture from your tent to find a stump somewhere in the deeps of the forest. Just beware of the bear. Note: After this column was published, I received an e-mail from the store's owner, David Wieler, who was kind enough to give me a little more of the stump's backstory. In his own words: ""It's a small piece of a 160 year old barn with the original hand-squaring marks from the poor pioneer bastard who made it with a straight axe and a lot of sweat."" Still looks like a chunk of wood to me, but I definitely dig the history!","A store in downtown Toronto is selling a tree stump for $98 .

"Fort Hood, Texas (CNN) -- The Army psychiatrist defending himself against charges that he killed 13 people in a shooting rampage at Fort Hood, Texas, concluded his case on Wednesday without calling a single witness. Maj. Nidal Hasan ended days of speculation over whether he would take the stand with three words: ""The defense rests."" Closing arguments were scheduled to begin Thursday morning before the case is handed to a military jury, which will determine whether Hasan is guilty of 13 counts of murder and 32 counts of attempted murder in connection with the November 5, 2009, attack. It was unclear if Hasan, who faces the death penalty if convicted, planned to deliver a closing statement. Fort Hood victims feel betrayed . Hasan's decision not to offer a defense was an anticlimactic end to the testimony portion of a court-martial where prosecution witnesses, primarily survivors, painted a horrific picture of what unfolded inside the processing center during the attack. Inside the courtroom, the liaison for the family members of those killed handed out packages of Kleenex ahead of the day's proceeding. As they have nearly every day of the trial, some of the wives and mothers of the 12 soldiers and one civilian killed had their eyes fixed -- some in a cold stare -- on Hasan. There is no question about whether Hasan carried out the shooting rampage as he took credit for it at the outset of the trial, telling the jury of 13 senior officers during opening statements that the evidence will show ""I was the shooter."" The judge, Col. Tara Osborn, has refused to allow Hasan to argue ""defense of others,"" a claim that he carried out the shootings to protect the Afghan Taliban and its leaders from U.S. soldiers. Is Hasan's strategy martyrdom? Much has been made of Hasan's defense or, as his stand-by attorneys have said, the lack of it. The judge declined a request by Hasan's attorneys to drop out of the case. The attorneys argued that Hasan was helping the prosecution put him to death. There may be something to that claim. The judge barred Hasan from pleading guilty at the start of the court-martial. Under military law, defendants cannot enter guilty pleas in capital punishment cases. In recent weeks, he has leaked documents through his civilian attorney to The New York Times and Fox News that appear to offer a glimpse of Hasan's justification for carrying out the attack. The documents included a mental health evaluation conducted by a military panel to determine whether Hasan was fit to stand trial. ""I don't think what I did was wrong because it was for the greater cause of helping my Muslim brothers,"" he told the panel, according to pages of the report published by the Times. He also said, according to the documents: ""I'm paraplegic and could be in jail for the rest of my life. However, if I died by lethal injection I would still be a martyr."" Military prosecutors called 89 witnesses and submitted more than 700 pieces of evidence before resting their case, hoping to show that the American-born Muslim had undergone what they described as a progressive radicalization. Hasan challenges witness account of shooting . They have argued to the jury that Hasan, who was scheduled to deploy to Afghanistan, did not want to fight against other Muslims and believed he had a jihad duty to kill as many soldiers as possible. Over the course of 11 days, prosecution witnesses painted a horrific picture of the shooting rampage that began inside the deployment center, with a number recounting how the gunman rose from a chair, shouted ""Allahu Akbar"" -- Arabic for ""God is the greatest"" -- and fired more than 146 rounds in the room. The prosecution witnesses called Tuesday described the final minutes of the attack, a police shootout that ended with the gunman shooting a police officer before he was shot. Hasan was paralyzed from the chest down. The final witness called by the prosecution, Dr. Tonya Kozminski, testified about what Hasan told her would happen to the Army if he were deployed. ""The last thing he said ... 'They will pay,"" Kozminski said. Fast Facts: Soldier-on-soldier attacks .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A joint task force Saturday was investigating a string of 35 fires across several Southern California communities, and one mayor called them a ""new form of domestic terrorism."" Despite a $60,000 reward, authorities had not made an arrest by Saturday afternoon. The 21 initial fires, set in rapid succession in the Hollywood area, prompted authorities in California to post the reward in what they say is one of the worst arson sprees in recent memory. The fires were set within a span of about five hours early Friday morning, and in nearly every case they were started on parked cars, officials said. Some of the fires spread to nearby buildings. Among the homes damaged was one that was once occupied by Doors frontman Jim Morrison. The street where the house sits -- Rothdell Trail -- was the inspiration for the Doors song, ""Love Street."" Seventeen fires were set in Hollywood; four others in West Hollywood -- all of them within a 2-square mile area. The fire department's Capt. Jaime Moore told CNN Saturday an additional 14 fires were reported. Investigators will determine whether they are arson and related to the other fires. ""This area of concern involves vehicle fires and fires involving vehicles in structures,"" the Los Angeles Fire Department said in a statement. ""Ten of these fires were located in the North Hollywood (Burbank) area and the last three were located in the Fairfax district (southwest of Hollywood). The Los Angeles County Fire Department has reported one fire meeting this criteria in the Lennox area."" West Hollywood Mayor John J. Duran told CNN the arsonists ""are using cars as an incendiary device to set buildings on fire."" Many of the buildings are close to each other and house senior citizens who are not mobile, he said. ""We have a full-force deployment out tonight,"" Duran said. ""When you have millions of people living with millions of cars in these very dense neighborhoods, this is becoming a new form of domestic terrorism that really has got our community in a very bad spot."" County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky told reporters Friday afternoon that authorities are ""dead serious about trying to apprehend the individual or individuals who are responsible"" for the arson fires. ""We want to get these SOBs before they hurt somebody,"" he said. Fire officials said they were relieved no one was hurt, although a firefighter suffered a non-life-threatening injury. ""If you're setting something alight when people are going to bed, you obviously don't expect them to wake up,"" resident Mark Todd told CNN affiliate KTLA. ""It sort of goes past arson to attempted murder."" The Hollywood area is home to about 20,000 people per square mile, said Los Angeles fire spokesman Erik Scott. He also said the fires caused $350,000 in property damage -- a ""conservative estimate."" Authorities deployed extra police officers after sundown. The Los Angeles Fire Department's arson unit called in additional investigators to review surveillance footage and pore through the ashes. ""While our police officers and our fire departments are working on high alert in coming days, everyone must remain vigilant,"" said Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa. CNN's Adam Shivers contributed to this report.","NEW: Arson a form of ""domestic terrorism,"" West Hollywood mayor says .

"(CNN) -- Eighteen people were killed and 43 seriously injured after the bus they were traveling in plunged into a ravine in a mountainous area south of the Indonesian capital, authorities said. The crash took place Wednesday morning in Puncak, West Java, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the national disaster agency. The passengers on the bus were members of different churches in Jakarta who were returning from a retreat. The cool, mountainous area of Puncak is a popular holiday destination for Jakarta residents. Nugroho said there were indications that the driver lost control of the bus after its brakes stopped working. The bus then rammed into a parked truck and fell into the ravine, he said. The injured are being treated in hospitals in the area. The rugged area is prone to road accidents, and road safety is generally poor in most parts of Indonesia.","The crash took place Wednesday in Puncak, West Java, authorities say .

"Madrid (CNN) -- The judge in charge of the investigation into a horrific train crash in Spain last month has presented preliminary charges against the state-run rail infrastructure company, Adif. Until now, attention has focused on the driver of the train, which derailed near the northwestern city of Santiago de Compostela, killing 79 people and injuring scores more. Read more: Rail chiefs quizzed over safety . Francisco Jose Garzon faces 79 counts of homicide by professional recklessness and an undetermined number of counts of causing injury by professional recklessness. But preliminary charges have now also been filed by Judge Luis Alaez Legeren against ""the person or persons from ADIF responsible for the traffic safety in the stretch of the rail line between the stations of Ourense and Santiago on July 24,"" according to documents posted on a court website Tuesday. It's not yet clear who the individuals are. The judge also requested more information on traffic safety and speed limits on that stretch of line from both Adif and state railroad company Renfe, and asked the Transport Ministry for details of any other incidents there. A spokeswoman for Adif declined to comment on the charges Wednesday but told CNN the company would work with authorities as far as possible. Garzon took control of the train at Ourense station, about 35 minutes before the crash occurred, a senior rail official told lawmakers during a rail safety briefing called after the disaster. Lawmakers heard that the route the train was on, from Madrid to Ferrol, includes a mix of conventional and high-speed track, with the latter allowing high-speed trains to travel at over 200 kilometers per hour (124 mph.) Two different safety systems are used in Spain: the European Rail Traffic Management System for the high-speed track and another known as ASFA on conventional lines. The train and its engineer were switching between the two kinds of track and operating system in the course of the journey. One such transition occurred shortly before the crash. Court officials have said the train was traveling at 153 kph (95 mph) when it derailed, nearly twice the speed limit on the curve where the accident happened. The driver, Garzon, has been given conditional release while the investigation continues but has surrendered his passport. CNN's Laura Perez Maestro reported from Madrid, and Laura Smith-Spark wrote in London.","Judge widens charges to individuals at Spain's state-run rail infrastructure firm, Adif .

"FERNANDO DE NORONHA, Brazil (CNN)  -- Forty-one bodies have been recovered from the crash of Air France Flight 447, the Brazilian Navy Command and Aeronautical Command said Tuesday. Brazilian military personnel on Tuesday carry the remains of one of the passengers of the Air France crash. Sixteen bodies pulled from the Atlantic Ocean Tuesday were taken to Fernando de Noronha for transportation Wednesday afternoon by helicopter to the air base in Recife, Brazil. The 25 bodies previously found were put aboard a Brazilian frigate. Searches for the remaining bodies will continue overnight, the navy and aeronautical command said in a written statement. The Airbus A330 crashed in the Atlantic Ocean June 1 en route from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to Paris, France, carrying 228 passengers and crew. The first bodies were recovered about 320 kilometers (200 miles) northwest of the Brazilian archipelago of Saint Peter and Saint Paul; Tuesday's recoveries were 80 kilometers (50 miles) away. It was not clear whether the bodies had drifted in the 1-2 knot currents or whether their separation suggested that the jet may have broken apart in the air. Watch bodies being returned to land » . Meanwhile, the French, who are leading the investigation, were increasing their naval efforts. The nuclear submarine Emeraude was expected to reach the search area Wednesday to search for wreckage, including the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder. And the French sent two tugs towing 40 tons of recovery equipment, a surveillance ship and a ship equipped for amphibious operations. The United States is also sending equipment to help with the search. Watch challenges faced by search crews » . Brazilian authorities said the plane debris will be taken to France for investigation but the bodies would undergo forensic tests in Recife. The cause of the crash is not known, but investigators are looking at the possible role of airspeed sensors known as Pitot tubes, among other factors. Air France has agreed to replace the sensors on its Airbus A330 and A340 jets, a pilots' union said Tuesday. The airline said Saturday that it began replacing its fleet's sensors last month. Another Air France pilots' union, ALTER, has advised its pilots not to fly planes until their Pitot tubes are replaced. ALTER, the smallest of three Air France pilots' unions, would not say what percentage of the carrier's pilots it represents. Watch an explanation of what could have caused the crash » . The biggest union, SNPL, said Tuesday it has accepted Air France's assurances that no Airbus A330 or A340 will take off unless at least two of its three Pitot tubes have been replaced. Union spokesman Eric Derivry added that there is no indication that the Pitot tubes caused the accident. Air France said over the weekend that it began to notice in May of last year that Pitot tubes sometimes briefly iced up at high altitude on A330s and A340s. That caused ""a loss of airspeed data,"" according to the airline -- that is, the pilots didn't know the plane's speed. Air France decided to replace all its probes starting April 27, following laboratory tests earlier in the year, the airline said. That is the program the pilots say the airline has promised to complete within days. The location of the crash has not been determined, because ocean currents have moved the bodies and debris. Map of Flight 447's flight path » . The ocean depth where the debris and bodies have been found varies, but averages about 3,000 meters (nearly 9,900 feet) deep, according to the University of New Hampshire/National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association Joint Hydrographic Center. The search area covers 200,000 square km (77,220 square miles), nearly the size of Romania, Brazilian officials said. Brazilian officials emphasized Monday that finding bodies was their main priority. The French are in charge of finding the voice and data recorders. Fourteen aircraft -- 12 Brazilian and two French -- were participating, along with five Brazilian ships and one French frigate. The U.S. Navy will contribute two high-tech acoustic devices to listen underwater for the emergency beacons that are attached to the voice and data recorders. The ""towed pinger locators,"" which help search for emergency beacons on downed aircraft to a maximum depth of 20,000 feet -- will be placed aboard two French tugs that are part of the search efforts, the official said.

"(CNN) -- Serena Williams battled back from the brink of defeat to claim her 15th grand slam title and win the U.S. Open for the fourth time with a 6-2 2-6 7-5 victory over world No. 1 Victoria Azarenka on Sunday. The American added to her 2012 Wimbledon and Olympic crowns after being pushed to the limit by the Australian Open champion, who forced the 30-year-old to drop her first set of the tournament. ""I honestly can't believe I won. I was preparing my runner-up speech because she was playing so well,"" Williams said courtside after the match, which lasted two hours 18 minutes. ""I'm so shocked. It's remarkable."" It was the first time in 17 years that the women's final went the distance in New York, and it ended Azarenka's run of 12 successive victories in matches lasting three sets. ""Serena deserves to win. She showed how true a champion she is,"" Azarenka said. ""I definitely gave it all today. Stepping off this court I will have no regrets."" Williams won the hard-court tournament for the first time as a 17-year-old in 1999 but has not enjoyed much success since her third win in 2008. She lost in an ill-tempered final last year and was also fined in 2009 after being involved in another incident during her semifinal defeat. The former world No. 1 won the opening set in just 34 minutes, as she threatened to steamroll Azarenka as she has all opponents since bouncing back from her first-round defeat at the French Open. However, unlike in their Wimbledon semifinal clash in July, her 23-year-old opponent picked herself up and dominated the second set with some power play of her own. Azarenka broke to lead 2-1 in the deciding set but was immediately pegged back by the fourth seed. A break to love in the seventh game put her in the position of serving for the title at 5-4, but Williams rallied to win the next three games and leave Azarenka in tears after missing a golden chance to win her second grand slam title. Williams took her record in grand slam finals to 15-4, becoming the first 30-something to win a major since Martina Navratilova at the 1987 U.S. Open, as she claimed the $1.9 million first prize. It was the first time since 2002 that a woman has won Wimbledon and the U.S. Open in the same year, when Williams also won the French Open. She joined her older sister Venus and Steffi Graf as the only women to win Wimbledon, the Olympics and the U.S. Open in the same year. It has capped a remarkable comeback for Williams, who spent almost a year out of the game following her 2010 Wimbledon triumph. She needed surgery after cutting her foot in a freak accident at a restaurant and then suffered life-threatening complications when blood clots formed on her lungs.","Serena Williams beats world No. 1 Victoria Azarenka in the final of the U.S. Open .

"(CNN) -- Egypt's former president, Hosni Mubarak, left prison Thursday for a military hospital where he'll be under house arrest, state-run media outlet Al-Ahram reported. A court ordered Mubarak released this week, but Egypt's military issued a decree to place Mubarak under house arrest while he awaits a retrial on charges of inciting violence against protesters during the 2011 uprising, Egyptian media reported. The 85-year-old Mubarak had been held since shortly after he was removed from power in 2011. He was convicted last year on charges of inciting violence against protesters during the popular uprising that led to his ouster. He was sentenced to life in prison but appealed, and a retrial was granted early this year. Wednesday, the court ordered Mubarak's release because he has been held past the maximum time he can be detained before being convicted. His release comes as Egypt's interim military government extended its crackdown on the Muslim Brotherhood on Thursday, arresting the group's spokesman, state-run television al-Masriya reported. Ahmed Arif is the latest key member of the group to be taken into custody. Muslim Brotherhood's spiritual leader is arrested in Egypt . Earlier in the week, the military arrested Mohamed Badie, the group's spiritual leader, and Safwat Hegazy, a preacher and hardline supporter of the movement. They were among about 100 members of the Muslim Brotherhood taken into custody on Tuesday. President Mohamed Morsy, who was removed from power by the military amid widespread protest over his rule, has been held since early July. Egypt has been in turmoil since Morsy's removal from office, with the military battling Muslim Brotherhood members and other Morsy supporters. Life during chaos: Egyptians talk about coping . Over the past week, about 900 people -- security personnel as well as citizens -- have been killed. The deaths occurred when the military used force to clear two pro-Morsy sit-in sites in Cairo on Wednesday last week and violence raged after pro-Morsy supporters staged demonstrations Friday. Mubarak's release is an an ""extraordinary development"" and a ""potent symbol,"" said Robin Wright, a Middle East analyst with the Woodrow Wilson Center. But the impact could be muted by the long list of worries Egyptians are already dealing with on the ground -- violence, curfews, economic woes. ""It may not play as big there as it does here,"" she said. Mubarak ruled Egypt, the most populous Arab country, for three decades under an autocratic system marked by widespread human rights abuses. He was forced from power in 2011 after demonstrators opposing his rule took to the streets as part of the Arab Spring revolutions across Africa and the Middle East. Egypt explained: 6 key questions .

"SAN FRANCISCO, California (Reuters) -- Sony has cut the price of the PlayStation 3 by $100, or 17 percent, in the United States, a move that should boost the video game console's lackluster sales. Starting Monday, the current PS3 60 gigabyte model will cost $499 -- a $100 price drop. The PlayStation 3, which includes a 60-gigabyte hard drive and a Blu-ray high-definition DVD player, will now cost $500, or $20 more than the most expensive version of Microsoft's Xbox 360. The PS3 still costs twice that of Nintendo's Wii console, whose $250 price and motion-sensing controller have made it a best-seller despite its lack of cutting-edge graphics and hard disk. ""Our initial expectation is that sales should double at a minimum,"" Jack Tretton, chief executive of Sony Computer Entertainment America, said in an interview. ""We've gotten our production issues behind us on the PlayStation 3, reaching a position to pass on the savings to consumers, and our attitude is the sooner the better."" The price drop Monday was widely anticipated by industry analysts despite Sony President Ryoji Chubachi telling Reuters last week that the company had no immediate plans for one. Wedbush Morgan analyst Michael Pachter said Sony's price reduction would not double sales but may boost them by 50 percent to about 120,000 units a month. ""The greater significance is that Sony is signaling to the market that we're coming down the cost curve pretty fast in making this thing. It's a pretty consumer-friendly move,"" Pachter said. Sony's move comes two days before the start of the video game industry's annual E3 trade show in Santa Monica, California, where some expect Microsoft to respond with its first price cuts on the Xbox 360. Nintendo, whose Wii is selling so well that it is still hard to find in stores eight months after its launch, is not expected to budge on pricing. The Xbox 360 and Wii have outsold the PS3 by several times in the crucial U.S. market, leaving Sony, whose PlayStation 2 dominated the last console generation, in the unfamiliar position of playing catch up. Sony is counting on the price cut to help it significantly grow sales of the PS3 ahead of the crucial holiday shopping season that accounts for most of the annual sales of highly profitable gaming software. Sony is also introducing a new version of the PS3 featuring an 80-gigabyte hard drive and a copy of ""Motorstorm,"" an off-road racing game that has already sold a million copies. The new model will sell for $600 and is aimed at gamers who expect to download a lot of games and other content from Sony's burgeoning online network. Sony also hopes the PS3 will win some converts following Microsoft's admission last week that the failure rate of its Xbox 360 console had been unacceptably high, forcing it to book $1 billion in repair costs. ""We're especially proud of the fact that the PlayStation 3 has the lowest failure rate of any PlayStation product. It's absolutely the gold standard,"" Tretton said. ""The quality of the product and long-term viability is what ultimately wins.""  E-mail to a friend . Copyright 2007 Reuters.

"(CNN) -- Tiger Woods will go into the final round of The Barclays four shots off the lead after completing his second successive round of two-under-par 69. It marked a slight improvement after the world No. 1 ended his rain-delayed second round five shots behind the same pacemaker, Matt Kuchar, earlier Saturday. However, Kuchar -- who can move to the top of the FedEx Cup standings above current leader Woods if he wins the $1.44 million first prize -- was caught at the top by fellow American Gary Woodland after 54 holes. Kuchar carded a third-round 70, while Woodland went around two shots better to join him on 12 under. They were one shot ahead of Kevin Chappell, who broke the course record at Liberty National in New Jersey with a flawless nine-birdie 62. It was the second time he has posted that score this season, and lifted the 27-year-old up from 43rd place at the halfway stage. Kuchar, 35, triumphed at The Barclays in 2010 when it was played at Ridgewood Country Club, and is seeking his third victory this year. Woods -- who has won a leading five times on the PGA Tour in 2013 -- moved up from a tie for eighth as he birdied two of his last three holes. He also started with a birdie, but three bogeys in five holes in the windy conditions set him back again. However, the 14-time major winner got a shot back at the eighth hole and picked up another at 13 before a strong finish left him in a tie for fourth with Englishman David Lynn, who also shot 69. U.S. Open champion Justin Rose was in a group tied for sixth on seven under, along with Bubba Watson, Jim Furyk and Rickie Fowler. Masters winner Adam Scott dropped back to a tie for 13th after suffering a double-bogey in his 72. The Australian was level with former world No. 1 Rory McIlroy, who had three birdies and three bogeys in his 71, 2012 U.S. Open champion Webb Simpson (74) and Sergio Garcia (71). British Open champion Phil Mickelson moved up nine places to a tie for 34th after a 70, but was not happy with his game. ""I hit a lot of good shots and made a lot of good swings,"" the veteran left-hander said. ""I was sloppy, though, and I didn't score well, and Sunday is going to be an important day for me, because I just want to put it together."" Last year's FedEx Cup champion Brandt Snedeker, in his third tournament since several months off battling bone disease, missed the halfway cut by one shot after a 71.

"(CNN) -- What does a Russian airline still shaking off a dubious reputation have in common with one of the biggest football clubs in the world? A match made in branding heaven if you're the marketing men for Aeroflot and Manchester United. Earlier this summer the Russian carrier signed a five year deal with the English Premier League champions to be the club's official airline. If it raised a few eyebrows among fans around Old Trafford who wondered if their team would be flying to their European fixtures via Moscow, the view from Russia is that the deal means a great deal indeed. ""Manchester United is one of the leading clubs in the world, with a fan base of 600 million,"" said Aeroflot's Alexander Lukashin. ""We share common values of teamwork and are both leaders in the market."" The airline might be a market leader in Russia, but it has a way to go before becoming a major international airline. Yet the deal is just one instance of how much airlines are valuing alliances with successful sports teams. ""Manchester United often talk about having hundreds of millions global fans, including 18 million in Russia. (Aeroflot) are desperate for the traffic and to migrate some of those fans onto their planes,"" said Dave Chattaway, Brand Finance's Head of Sports Valuation. According to Brand Finance, Aeroflot is the 19th most valuable airline brand, while Manchester United are second behind Bayern Munich on the company's list of most valuable football clubs. With privileged access to players for airline promotions and pitch-side advertisements, Lukashin expects the airline to ally with the most eye-catching parts of Manchester United. Expect a Manchester United branded plane, TV spots with the likes of Robin van Persie and Ryan Giggs in the not too distant future and their faces to loom large on Aeroflot billboards around the world. Go inside an Airbus A380 with Google Street View . Deals between airlines and football clubs are nothing new, but the size of the deals and scope of the partnerships have boomed in the last few years. Most of Europe's top clubs have an official airline partner, while Barcelona this year broke its 113-year tradition of having no corporate sponsor on the front of their shirt to display Qatar Airways. Extending these airline partnerships is a logical step for football clubs, says Chattaway. ""These days it's more a question of why haven't all top ten English Premier League teams got an official airline,"" he said. ""There are cross-selling opportunities for both clubs and airlines and huge awareness opportunities for airlines."" The help in logistics for the clubs is one benefit of the deals. Manchester United were whisked around their pre-season tour of Asia on a private jet equipped with lie-flat business class seats, while rivals Manchester City have shirt sponsors Etihad to help with the team's travels. Chelsea FC entered into a deal with U.S. carrier Delta last year to be the club's official airline sponsor. Aeroflot says it will offer Manchester United ""strategic travel advice."" The real pay-off however comes from the boost in finances as clubs seek new way to grow revenue and reach emerging markets. Aeroflot declined to say how much the deal with Manchester United was worth, but industry observers believe they out-bid Turkish Airlines, the club's previous airline sponsor, for an alliance with the club. If the Aeroflot Manchester United deal seems slightly incongruous, it is perhaps because the biggest players in sponsorship deals have hitherto been the booming airlines from the Middle East-- Emirates, Qatar Airlines and Etihad Airways -- with Emirates a long-time supporter of sports teams, not just football, around the world. Emirates aim for high-flyers with private jet service . The Dubai-based airline's name can be seen on the shirts of some of the world's best known teams -- Arsenal, Paris Saint-Germain, AC Milan -- and it also boasts a sponsorship deal with Real Madrid. ""Emirates have a habit of sponsoring clubs when they open new routes,"" said Chattaway. ""It can help them bring in promotions and advertise new routes."" Chattaway believes the number of deals and their value will only increase in years to come, as brand positioning and the desire to find new markets becoming more important for both football clubs and airlines. ""When (Indonesian airline) Garuda said it wanted to become a five-star airline, one of the first things it did was partner with a global brand,"" he said. Steven Gerrard, the England and Liverpool FC captain, can now be seen with other club players smiling at passengers on a Garuda plane in one of the airline's TV adverts. ""Airlines have realized that partnering with sports is the quickest way to make tag lines like Turkish Airways' 'Globally Yours' a reality,"" said Chattaway.","Aeroflot became official airline of Manchester United earlier this summer .
Value of five-year deal was not disclosed .
Airlines increasingly seeing value in aligning their brand with football teams .
Both clubs and airlines look for new international markets and fans ."
"Washington (CNN) -- The Obama administration is likely to come under new pressure to take more decisive steps in Syria following opposition claims that Bashar al-Assad's government used chemical weapons to kill more than 1,000 people. While the regime denied the fresh accusations, the administration said it could not immediately verify the accuracy of newly released videos online purportedly showing civilians suffering from chemical agents outside Damascus. Still, the images were searing and prompted the United States to seek an urgent U.N. investigation, demand accountability, and not rule out additional help. ""There is an investigation team that's on the ground in Syria right now. And we are hopeful that the Assad regime will follow through on what they have claimed previously, that they are interested in a credible investigation that gets to the bottom of reports that chemical weapons have been used,"" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said. Earnest added the administration has regularly considered increased aid for the rebels. ""The conduct of this investigation, the results of this investigation or the efforts by the Assad regime to inhibit this investigation will certainly impact that calculation about possible additional aid,"" Earnest said. Key questions would immediately surface if the latest troubling development from a region wracked by civil war for more than two years were to change the overall calculus for the United States. What new steps would it take? How would it address uncertainty about the rebel makeup? And how would it approach what some believe is a worsening multidimensional trust gap on the issue of rebel assistance? The administration has rebuffed calls for a stronger military aid response, opting to push for a political solution and provide humanitarian, logistical and limited weaponry and other hardware. Syrian activists: Videos show chemical weapons used . A chief problem has been identifying those rebels the United States would happily deal with vs elements said to be militants, including some with ties to al Qaeda. ""Syria today is not about choosing between two sides but rather about choosing one among many sides,"" Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey wrote this week to Rep. Eliot Engel of New York. ""It is my belief that the side we choose must be ready to promote their interests and ours when the balance shifts in their favor. Today, they are not,"" he said in the August 19 letter. Inherent political mistrust amid sharp partisan divisions in Washington coupled with close congressional vetting also have influenced the response to Syria. Congress is currently on vacation until after Labor Day. Also critically, mistrust cuts both ways. According to experts who have traveled to Syria during the war, opposition groups have little faith in the United States. Syrian refugees stream into Iraq . ""Our credibility wasn't high to begin with and obviously didn't improve with time,"" said David Lesch, Middle East history professor at Trinity University and author of ""Syria: The Fall of the House of Assad."" ""They basically shrug their shoulders and say, 'Oh well, what is new?' They feel like they are on their own on this."" Lesch said the administration had not had enough contact with oppositions groups from the outset. ""There is just a lack of knowledge of these groups,"" he said. This is the second time the administration has faced questions about chemical weapons use in Syria. Last August, President Barack Obama said using those weapons would cross a ""red line"" and provoke a U.S. military response. His administration confirmed in June that chemical agents were used in April and it resulted in an uptick of military aid. But the ""red line"" tag has seriously damaged U.S. credibility in the region, said Andrew Tabler, author of ""In the Lion's Den: An Eyewitness Account of Washington's Battle with Syria."" ""Reacting way too late - that has been our policy on Syria for some time,"" Tabler said. ""(The United States' credibility is) very low because of its inability to keep to its word. We have done absolutely nothing to enforce the red line. What kind of signal does that send to the Syrian people?"" But in his letter, Dempsey warned that even limited military action in Syria could lead to deeper involvement -- a point the military has made previously. The administration has said it has no plans to put ""boots on the ground."" A team of U.N. chemical weapons inspectors landed in Syria this week to begin probing chemical weapons allegations, and the U.N. Security Council planned a meeting on Wednesday to address the issue. CNN's Samira Said, Ed Payne, Jessica Yellin, Dana Bash and Chloe Sommers contributed to this report.","NEW: White House won't rule out more help for rebels, hasn't verified latest claim on chem weapons .

"(CNN) -- Travelers planning to attend the 2014 World Cup in Brazil better get cracking on their accommodation bookings. Organizers from FIFA and tournament sponsors have already started making mass hotel bookings for next summer, and private home owners in Brazil have responded, renting out apartments for the World Cup period, according to the Rio Times. Although projected numbers vary, approximately 600,000 foreign visitors and 3 million domestic tourists are expected to travel to or within Brazil for the World Cup. A large percentage of those travelers are expected to be looking for alternative accommodations, such as private homes, bed and breakfasts and hostels. According to the Brazilian daily, some four-room penthouses in Ipanema are asking $150,000 for one month's rental. A studio apartment in Copacabana is being rented out at $7,000 for four weeks, while a villa is using the deposit from a booking already made for next summer to renovate the house for more such rentals. Hotel infrastructure for Brazil's most anticipated mega-event has been a concern, but the local hotel industry says it's confident it will be ready to face the onslaught of tourists. The city also plans to berth six cruise ships as tourist accommodation. Marcelo Rocha e Silva Zorovich, a visiting researcher at the University of Miami, told the Los Angeles Times last month that providing enough hotel rooms for the event was a big concern. ""We'll make it to the Cup but the infrastructure won't be ready,"" Zorovich said. According to the Times, Rio is planning to construct around 22,000 new rooms, but experts are skeptical that number will be reached in time.","Organizers and sponsors have completed bulk hotel reservations for World Cup 2014 in Brazil .

"(CNN) -- A 2-year-old Chinese girl -- who was ignored after being hit by two cars last week, later sparking a fierce debate about the state of China's morals -- has died, a nurse at a military hospital said. Wang Yue died about 12:32 a.m. Friday, according to officials at the Guangzhou Military Hospital, in Guangzhou. ""Her little life has left this world,"" said Su Lei, director of intensive care unit at the hospital. ""We feel deep pain and shame as everybody does."" Video captured by a nearby security camera showed a pair of drivers, one after the other, hitting Yue, in Foshan in Guangdong Province. More than a dozen people walked, cycled or drove past the toddler as she lay bleeding in a busy market. The girl was eventually rescued by a 58-year-old scavenger, who pulled her aside and tried to get help. The toddler's mother, Qu Feifei, later said her daughter was in critical condition at a hospital, with her brain showing little activity despite earlier subtle movements in her lower body. The video footage sparked a global outcry about the state of morality in China's fast-changing society. That included generating a flurry of activity on Sina Weibo, China's equivalent of Twitter, and spurring a ""Stop Apathy"" online campaign. Two government offices in Guangdong province, where the hit-and-run occurred, offered the Good Samaritan, identified as Chen Xianmei ,a total of 20,000 yuan (US $3,135), according to state-run Xinhua news agency. The young girl's mother has said she did not understand the behavior of the passersby, but wanted to focus on the positive. ""Granny Chen represents the best of human nature,"" she said of her daughter's rescuer. ""It's the nicest and most natural side of us."" On Sina Weibo, China's equivalent of Twitter, the story was the No. 1 topic this week, at one point generating more than 4.5 million posts along with a ""stop apathy"" online campaign. As the outrage over morality continued, a steady procession of well-wishers pours in, offering gifts, money and support to the toddler's family.

"(CNN) -- Politics might be a tough profession, but in few places is it as bruising as in Australia where mudslinging and name-calling occur on an almost daily basis in parliament. To outsiders, the Australian parliament can look like a bear pit and throughout its history, it's had some legendary brawlers. George Reid, Australia's fourth prime minister from 1904 to 1905 was famously heckled in parliament over his fat stomach when an opposition politician shouted from the benches: ""What are you going to call it?"" Without pausing for breath Reid shot back: ""If it's a boy, I'll call it after myself. If it's a girl, I'll call it Victoria. But if, as I strongly suspect, it's nothing but p*** and wind, I'll name it after you."" In many respects, Australia's electorate expects its politicians to come out of this mold and few have disappointed. Former Prime Minister Paul Keating (1991-96), when pressed to name an election date, told the leader of the opposition he wouldn't reveal the date because, as he said: ""I want to do you slowly."" More recently, former Prime Minister Julia Gillard gave the opposition a spirited lecture in sexism that went viral and even drew praise from U.S. President Obama. But not since leader of the Labor opposition Mark Latham broke a taxi driver's arm in a dispute over a cab fare in 2001 have Australians had the chance to elect a real brawler as premier. Latham's bid for prime minister failed, but in Tony Abbott, the leader of the Liberal-National Coalition who is tipped to be Australia's next leader, the country may have found a natural successor. Combative in debate and with the media, Abbott may have shown little of his predecessors' verbal flair -- recent gaffes had him talking about the ""suppository,"" rather than the repository, ""of all wisdom"" and praising a female candidate for her ""sex appeal"" -- but he has displayed the kind of dogged aggression that Australians like to see in their sportsmen. So far, it's played well with the electorate. The boxer . A former Rhodes Scholar who won an Oxford Blue in boxing, he allegedly punched the wall either side of the head of a female political rival during his student days in the 1970s. Abbott claims the incident ""never happened."" For one former alumni from his Jesuit secondary school St. Ignatius' College, Riverview, in Sydney, the episode would not have been out of character. ""All I remember is his rictus grin and the rolled-up sleeves of his short-sleeved shirt, giving his biceps something to rub up against,"" the former classmate, who now works in the Hong Kong banking industry, told CNN. ""What struck me was the raw emotion he could elicit just by being him. You could pour an enormous bucket on him, and he was not only impervious in terms of being hurt but would grin back at you and give it back -- with compound interest and probably a compound fracture,"" he added. While Abbott is a polarizing and pugnacious character to the electorate, the socially conservative politician is known to hold complex views in some areas of policy. READ MORE: Internet, economy and boat people key issues in Australian election . He has been known to defend areas of Medicare -- the country's national health system normally championed by the Labor Party -- and even opposed his own party on industrial relations reform, arguing that it was too harsh on workers. Early beginnings . Born in England in 1957 to an Australian mother and an English-born father, he graduated in economics and law from Sydney University where he became involved in the rough and tumble world of student politics. Avowedly right-wing at a time when the prevailing orthodoxy on campuses was deeply left-wing, Abbott, according to one of his biographers Michael Duffy, was beaten up at a student conference. Briefly training as a Catholic priest before working variously as a concrete contractor and as a journalist for The Australian newspaper, he entered politics in 1994 when he was elected to represent the affluent Warringah district of Sydney. Under former Prime Minister John Howard's government, he served as an employment minister between 1998 and 2001, and as minister for health and aging in 2003. In 2009, he narrowly beat then leader Malcolm Turnbull in a party leadership vote, winning 42 votes to Turnbull's 41. He also polled well in Australia's 2010 general election, which was called following Gillard's ouster of Kevin Rudd as prime minister, denying the government a majority and delivering a hung parliament that Gillard's government could only hold together with the support of independents. Labor Party infighting boosted Abbott's standing in the polls and -- under Gillard -- the Labor Party faced certain defeat at elections this year. While the installation of Rudd as prime minister for a second time has clawed back some of the ground Labor lost under Gillard, many analysts say his arrival has come too late to save the Australian Labor Party. Catholic values, populist instincts . Abbott supports lower taxes, smaller government and tough border controls and backs the government's policy of processing asylum seekers -- many of them illegal boat arrivals -- offshore. He recently announced that almost 32,00 asylum seekers who already in Australia will never be granted permanent settlement. He has also pushed a ""tow-back"" policy that would see asylum seekers' boats turned around when it is safe to do so. Dismissing the climate debate as faddish and fashionable, Abbott has vowed to roll back the controversial carbon tax put in place by Gillard, which he has condemned as ""socialism masquerading as environmentalism."" He has pledged to get rid of the 30% mining tax introduced by Labor, saying that it is a serious disincentive to investment in Australia's booming commodities sector. READ MORE: How Australia's prime ministerial candidates view China . On social issues, he has remained true to his Catholic faith, consistently voting against relaxing abortion laws, gay marriage and stem cell research. He has stated that he wants abortions to be ""safe, legal and rare."" As health minister in 2005, he opposed the use of the abortion drug RU486, but it was later overturned by parliament. Australian journalist David Marr, author of Abbott's latest biography ""The Making of Tony Abbott,"" says the leading contender to become Australia's next prime minister is nothing if not the sum total of his contradictions. ""He is a highly successful, aggressive, populist politician but all throughout his career he has argued there is another side to him -- that there is a deep commitment to values -- and they are very traditional Catholic values,"" he told ABC's Question Time. However, he added that while his values informed his political views, he was able to shift and adapt them to prevailing political reality. ""There's no occasion in his political career where those values have stood in the way of his politics. When it comes down to it, Tony Abbott is an absolutely secular politician.""","Tony Abbott, the man tipped to be Australia's next leader, is known for his aggression .

"(CNN) -- As Britain continues to celebrate Andy Murray's Wimbledon title, things aren't going quite as well for Roger Federer. Federer, who owns a men's record 17 grand slam titles, slumped to his lowest world ranking in 10 years when the new standings were released Monday. The Swiss dropped from third to fifth in the aftermath of his upset loss in the second round to Sergiy Stakhovsky at Wimbledon, matching the ranking he last held in June 2003 when he wasn't yet a grand slam winner. Federer, a month away from his 32nd birthday, responded to the defeat by entering a pair of smaller clay court tournaments in Europe in a bid to reverse fortunes. He is sixth in the calendar-year points standings, with the top eight earning a berth at the year-end championships in London. Federer will play at next week's German Tennis Championships in Hamburg before contesting the Swiss Open in Gstaad the following week. ""I'm really looking forward to playing in front of my home fans in Gstaad this summer,"" Federer told his website this month. ""I have got a lot of great memories of the tournament in the mountains of Switzerland."" Federer last played in Gstaad in 2004, winning the event for the only time. He lost his first four matches there before reaching the final in 2003 a week after his maiden grand slam triumph at Wimbledon. While Federer frets over his drop in the rankings, man of the moment Murray is very much on the up. He has spectacularly recovered -- with the help of coach Ivan Lendl -- from losing his first four grand slam finals and in the 2011 semifinals at Wimbledon to Rafael Nadal when he was firmly in control. He has now captured two of the last three grand slam tournaments he has competed in and replaced Federer as the world's best grass court player, having also claimed Olympic gold at Wimbledon in 2012 and a Wimbledon warm-up in London last month. ""Under pressure right now Andy has two majors and a gold medal,"" his coach Ivan Lendl told British newspaper the Telegraph as he reflected on Murray's Wimbledon victory over Novak Djokovic on Sunday. ""Novak is a great player, don't get me wrong. He has had a phenomenal last 12 months, basically since the start of 2011, so the rankings look at all of that. ""[But] if somebody has two majors and an Olympic gold medal, and everybody else has only one major . . ."" Lendl added, before tailing off. ""Everybody can make their own opinion on that."" When the Scot downed world No. 1 Djokovic in straight sets in Sunday's final, it ended a 77-year wait for a British men's singles champion at tennis' most prestigious tournament. Murray said Monday that he only had one-hour of sleep after his victory -- and that he didn't want to go to sleep at all because he thought when he woke up it would all be a dream. The Queen was one of those to congratulate Murray and he is being tipped to receive knighthood. The Scot's last loss on grass was to Federer in the 2012 Wimbledon final. ""I didn't always think it was going to happen,"" said Murray of his Wimbledon conquest. ""I didn't doubt myself so much after last year's final. ""It was the best I'd recovered from a grand slam loss. Maybe a couple of years ago when I lost in the semis to Rafa when I was up a set, maybe a break as well or had break points, and didn't get that, that was a tough, tough one for me."" And Murray said he doesn't expect his motivation to dip after his historic fortnight at Wimbledon. ""I hope I don't lose hunger -- I think I should be able to use this as motivation,"" said the Scot. ""I know what it's like losing in a Wimbledon final, and I know what it's like winning one. And it's a lot better winning. ""I just need to make sure I don't get side-tracked by anything.""","After losing in the second round at Wimbledon, Roger Federer drops to fifth in the rankings .

"(CNN) -- A sign over the Java Juggs latte stand reads ""Some Like it Hot"" and features a seductive image of a silhouetted woman in high heels, a devilish tail and horns, and seemingly little else. Inside, authorities allege, customers got more than a sizzling beverage to kickstart their day. Eight people were arrested Tuesday in connection to latte stands in Washington state that, the Everett police department says, served as fronts for prostitution and lewd conduct. Those detained include the owner of seven stands in question, 51-year-old Carmela Panico, who state public records link to the Java Juggs establishments. Other records, including health inspection reports, indicate some stands targeted by police operated as Twin Peaks. Panico was arrested for conspiracy to promote prostitution and permitting prostitution, according to police. But she is hardly the only one in hot water. So, too, is Snohomish County Sheriff's Office Sgt. Darrell O'Neill. The 30-year office veteran was arrested and booked Tuesday into Marysville Jail for conspiracy to promote prostitution and official misconduct, police said. It was no secret that the stands were offering more than just coffee. A post on Java Juggs' Facebook page included -- in addition to pictures of women in lingerie -- an invitation for patrons to ""come and watch our girls dance on our new Stripper Pole."" But having baristas work wearing scantily clad outfits is not illegal. Prostitution is another story. In October 2012, authorities opened an investigation after getting complaints about alleged lewd conduct at a latte stand in Kent, which is about 20 miles south of Seattle. The probe -- Everett police Deputy Chief Dan Templeman told CNN affiliate KING that it included video and in-person surveillance -- eventually widened to include seven such stands tied to Panico and one residence. This law enforcement effort wasn't helped by the Snohomish County sergeant who, a barista told detectives, tipped off workers about the undercover probe and ""engaged in inappropriate behavior while on the job,"" police said. O'Neill, 58, has been placed on paid administrative leave and is the subject of an internal investigation, according to the Snohomish County Sheriff's Office. CNN's Chandler Friedman and Greg Morrison contributed to this report.","8 are arrested in connection to latte stands in Washington state .

"(CNN) -- There were so many golden moments at the London 2012 Games, but for me, the moment that Team GB's Mo Farah won the 10,000 meters was a wonderful collision of electricity. I was performing stand up, downstairs at the Soho Theatre in London -- I was about fifteen minutes in to the gig when I heard the whole of the cool and trendy Soho district of London explode into noise. I ran offstage to get my iPhone and I got the BBC live feed streaming just in time to see Mo Farah hugging his American training partner, Galen Rupp, who took silver. I was recounting all this live on stage to the audience. That was quite a moment of running, internet technology and 'where were you when?' rolled into one. The thing about Mo -- apart from his endless speed, dedication, humility and talent -- is that he came to Britain as a refugee from Somalia, one of the world's most war-torn countries. Some people in the UK stupidly want to denigrate refugees, so you knew these people were having a bad day when Mo won. That same night, he was asked in a press conference whether he'd have preferred to run as a Somali. Mo just laughed and said: ""Look mate, this is my country. This is where I grew up, this is where I started life. This is my country and when I put on my Great Britain vest I'm proud."" Olympics have redefined how Britain sees itself . During these Olympic Games, I have felt very proud to be British and proud of the British. What Mo said set Twitter alight. It also set everybody talking about the Britain we are in 2012. He spoke for us all, and made the whole country proud to be British too. I think the London 2012 Games will come to be seen as a shining time for the UK. It has been a time when athletes of all races and backgrounds have come together, and people have understood what modern multicultural Britain is all about, and that it obviously is working - no matter that David Cameron says it isn't. Hosting the Olympics has also united people from all corners of the country. Instead of seeing ourselves as English, Scottish, Welsh or Northern Irish, we have felt British. Right from the moment of the opening ceremony, it has felt as if Britain suddenly had the confident voice it had been looking for since the height of the Industrial Revolution. Danny Boyle, the British director behind films like Slumdog Millionaire, had produced his idea called Isles of Wonder. Instead of recycling the usual cliches about quaint old Blighty, he gave us something between incredible spectacle and political theater. One of the central pieces of the whole event was a tribute to Britain's National Health Service, probably our country's proudest achievement. God knows what the rest of the world made of patients singing in hospital beds, but we knew exactly what he meant -- and they could work it out. Britain is quite a shy country (unless we've had a drink). We don't like to blow our own trumpets. We don't wear our stiff upper lips on our sleeves (which is actually quite difficult to do). But we've all found our own ways to be patriotic (as opposed to Nationalistic). I had one of my nails painted with a Union Jack, as is my right as a marathon-running transvestite who supports Team GB. London 2012 has been the best British performance in an Olympics for 100 years, and the country has gone wild. 2012 Games leave London with a golden glow . Before the Olympics, I ran with the Olympic flame in my old home town of Bexhill-on-Sea in the south of England, which was a tremendous honor. There I have sponsored an art project by sculptor Richard Wilson as part of the UK's Cultural Olympiad. He balanced a large bus on the roof of a large art center building there to recreate the final moment of the original version of the film ""The Italian Job."" Why? Well, well because it is ballsy and artistic and British and crazy. And so, above all, I hope the word goes out from our Olympics that not only do we run excellent world events, but we also balance buses on the edges of buildings like no one else ever could. Next, it's the Paralympics. I can't wait to see how our atmosphere carries on. Once a small gathering of British veterans of the Second World War, this will be the moment the Paralympics comes home. I've been lucky enough to have had a similar view of the United Kingdom as the Olympic flame did as it traveled my country, because in 2009, I ran 43 marathons -- 1166 miles -- around the British Isles, and I saw first hand, how positive and supportive the real British people can be. Over the past few weeks you have seen that Britain -- my kind of Britain -- in action. I hope you all enjoyed it -- we did!

The photograph -- which may never before have been seen by the public, RR Auction says -- offers a glimpse of the future wife of Prince Charles lying down, perhaps on a bed, wearing a light sweater or top. Only her head and arms can be seen. Behind her a young man leans against the wall, reading, his book resting on her shoulder. The future princess looks relaxed, half smiling at the camera. A bottle of whiskey can be seen on the windowsill. Another man is half seen in the foreground, but there is no clue as to who he or Diana's other companion might be. Large, black wording across the top of the photograph states ""Not to be published,"" and there are two dark lines under the words and above Diana's head. A lighter circle encompasses the words, Diana and the man reading the book. The only indication of date is a stamp on the back of the print saying 26 February 1981 -- two days after the engagement of Diana, then 19, and Prince Charles was announced by Buckingham Palace. They married in July of that year. The photograph likely was taken a year or two earlier. Bidding for the image, described by RR Auction as an ""uncommon early 10 x 8 glossy news photo of a young Diana lying in bed,"" opens on January 17 and starts at $200. British media reports suggest it may have come from the photo archive of the Mirror or Sunday Mirror newspaper. Diana, Princess of Wales, was fatally injured in a car accident in Paris in 1997, a year after she and Prince Charles divorced. Their sons, Princes William and Harry, are second and third in line to the throne respectively. CNN's Joseph Netto reported in Atlanta and Laura Smith-Spark in London.","The photograph shows Diana looking relaxed, lying next to a young man .

"Beijing (CNN) -- An American businessman who said he was held hostage by dozens of his Chinese employees was released Thursday after six days. Chip Starnes, co-founder and president of Specialty Medical Supplies China, had been trapped in the company's suburban Beijing factory since Friday. Starnes reached an agreement with the workers after a pay dispute. Officials said 97 employees signed a new compensation agreement. On Tuesday, Starnes told CNN's David McKenzie from behind the factory's gates that he was being held hostage. ""I tried to leave a day and a half ago, and there was like 60 or 70 of them here inside every entrance, and every exit was barricaded,"" Starnes said. ""I can't go anywhere."" He said workers had hindered his sleep by banging on doors and windows, but said they had not inflicted any physical harm. The dispute . The incident started when the company laid off about 30 workers in its injection molding division. He said he transferred workers to another division, but some workers did not want to move. So the company gave them severance packages. Starnes said the problem arose when workers who already moved to another division also wanted severance packages. But workers who spoke to CNN from behind the factory gates gave an entirely different account. Some said they're owed two months' worth of back pay and feared everyone at the plant would be laid off, as they claimed no new materials had entered the factory. Starnes disputed that, saying there are no outstanding balances and that the workers had heard bad information. CNN's CY Xu reported from Beijing; Holly Yan wrote from Atlanta. Journalist Connie Young contributed to this report.","Chip Starnes was held in a Beijing-area factory for six days over a pay dispute .

"(CNN) -- It has the world's tallest unoccupied building, it puts on the world's biggest annual show and it's sometimes prone to petulant nuclear threats. But what else do you know about North Korea? 1. North Koreans brew great beer . North Koreans love a pint and have a thriving beer brewing culture. Taedonggang Beer is one of the best-known local beers. In 2000 the state-run brewery bought up an entire British brewery, shipped it to North Korea and two years later opened for business just outside Pyongyang. Taedonggang Beer is a full-bodied lager and is named after the capital's Taedong River. 2. High heels are in . Women love their high heels and many wear four-inch heels day and night, to work, to do the shopping, in the military -- we even spotted a woman working on a construction site in a pair. The wedge heel made its appearance in the isolated state four or five years ago -- a trend that made its way across the border from China. Today there are still plenty of wedge heels about, but it's the thin heel that is Pyongyang's must-have fashion accessory today. 3. You can bring your mobile . Visitors no longer need to leave their mobiles behind. As of January, you can bring your phone into the country and buy a local SIM card from a booth at the airport. The SIM card allows you to make and receive international calls and call other foreigners in Pyongyang who have mobiles -- you can't call locals as they are on a different network. A local SIM card for two weeks goes for â‚¬50 ($66), but be warned -- calls are expensive ($6.60 a minute to call the United States). North Korea's Koryolink has more than 2 million subscribers. The local cell phones allow all the functions of a regular mobile -- make calls, listen to music, take photos -- with the exception of access to the Internet. Given the regular power outages, the ""light"" function on mobiles gets plenty of use. 4. People love to sing . Most North Koreans can carry a tune and if you ask someone -- politely -- to sing a song they will probably oblige -- on the spot, with no accompaniment. Pop music is big, especially songs with lyrics. The best-known Western group is still the Beatles -- ""Hey Jude"" and ""Yellow Submarine"" are high on the list -- and Celine Dion and the Carpenters also go down well. No surprise then that most bars have karaoke. The all-girl band Moranbong is the most popular local group. The girls -- who were apparently hand-picked by North Korean Leader Kim Jong-un -- wear skimpy dresses and belt out pop tunes, the North's answer to K-pop. 5. Car park volleyball . Volleyball is one of the most popular sports and North Koreans often strike up a game in their lunch hour. The games can be fast and fun, men and women often playing together. The lack of a net is no obstacle and many games start up casually in a car park or any open space. Korean wrestling is also very popular. Behind the veil: Rare look at life in North Korea . 6. The Metro is seriously deep . The Pyongyang Metro is 100 meters underground and it takes a couple of minutes to ride the escalator down to the station. The journey is long enough that some commuters sit on the steps -- despite the signs asking passengers not to. There are no advertisements on the walls to distract you on the ride down to the station -- just bare white walls. (There are only five advertising billboards in Pyongyang, all owned by the same car dealership). The underground network has two lines and 17 stations. Inspired by the grand Moscow Metro, many of the stations have ornate chandeliers and paintings and murals on the walls. 7. Crazy about kimchi . Kimchi -- spicy pickled vegetables -- is the national dish and it's said that every woman makes a different kind of kimchi. The dish is time-consuming to make and the traditional recipe requires women to lovingly swirl and smear hot pepper paste over cabbage leaves for hours. Simon Cockerell of Koryo Tours, which specializes in travel to the reclusive socialist state, says: ""There's a saying that you must taste a woman's kimchi before you marry her."" 8. Single-hearted unity . North Koreans seem to have an innate ability to form a line -- not a queue, but dead straight lines. The training begins as young children and by the time they are in their teens a crowd of hundreds can organize themselves into any number of parallel lines, equally spaced, in a minute. Whether it's factory workers walking down the street, people gathering to lay flowers beneath a statue of the Great Leader, or soldiers jogging, moving in formation, showing ""single-hearted unity"" is the order of the day. And it's catching. Spend a week touring the capital and your guides will make sure you get give plenty of practice forming lines. 9. You won('t) see that . The local currency is the won, but foreigners are not allowed to use it. Instead visitors must use hard currency -- U.S. dollars, euros and renminbi. Bizarrely, given the proximity to China, the Renminbi offers the worst exchange rate. Euros get the best rate at present. Pyongyang isn't a shopping destination. North Koreans do most of their shopping in the local markets -- there is a blue-roofed market in most neighborhoods, but foreigners aren't allowed to visit these. Officially, visitors aren't allowed in department stores either, but this is a rule that is given much more flexibility. Visitors tend to be herded into the Foreign Language Bookstore and stamp and souvenir shops where you can stock up on propaganda posters, North Korean stamps and postcards and books by Kim Jong Il (he wrote -- or ghostwrote -- hundreds). 10. Kim pins . All North Koreans wear a ""Kim pin"" on the left breast of whatever they are wearing. The pins show a portrait of Kim Il Sung or his son, Kim Jong Il -- and sometimes both. Surprisingly given that everyone wears one -- from infants to old folks -- there are no shops selling the pins. Instead they are given out sporadically -- on special occasions and to mark significant events -- and there are lots of different styles. The style doesn't denote anything, just the period it was given out. There is a story that North Koreans will be punished if they give a Kim pin to a foreigner, but that's a myth and they are occasionally given to visitors.

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Terrorists increasingly favor using women as suicide bombers to thwart security and draw attention to their causes, a new FBI-Department of Homeland Security assessment concludes. Female suicide bombers can use devices to make them appear pregnant, a security assessment says. The assessment said the agencies ""have no specific, credible intelligence indicating that terrorist organizations intend to utilize female suicide bombers against targets in the homeland."" But it points out that women have been reported as attackers in the Russian breakaway republic of Chechnya and in India, Iraq, Pakistan, the Palestinian territories, Sri Lanka and Turkey. The notice was distributed Monday to law enforcement officials throughout the United States, and CNN obtained a copy of it. Officials want to make sure security officers are alert to the possibility of female bombers and to familiarize themselves with behavior patterns that such attackers have used in the past. ""Even as military and security forces are paying more attention to the use of female operatives, terrorists are adapting their suicide attack tactics to compensate for enhanced security measures,"" the advisory said.  Watch how U.S. authorities profile terror suspects » . The assessment highlighted the February 1 bombings in Baghdad in which two women, who appeared to have Down syndrome, attacked two pet markets. The attacks forced FBI and DHS officials to rethink a belief that those responsible for such incidents had the mental discipline ""to accomplish the operation."" The two agencies also echo what experts have said before -- that ""female suicide bombers may have an advantage over their male counterparts in accessing targets."" For example, the assessment points out women can hide explosives in prosthetic devices that mimic the look of pregnancy.

"Atlanta (CNN) -- A Georgia judge Thursday sentenced Hemy Neuman to life in prison without the possibility of parole after jurors convicted him of fatally shooting a father outside a suburban Atlanta day care center. DeKalb County Judge Gregory Adams delivered the sentence less than two hours after a jury of nine women and three men found Neuman guilty of malice murder ""beyond a reasonable doubt, but mentally ill."" ""This situation was brought about by your hands,"" Adams said, adding that the act ""appeared to be a planned execution."" In November 2010, Russell ""Rusty"" Sneiderman was shot multiple times in the parking lot of Dunwoody Prep after dropping off his then-2-year-old son in what police described as a ""cold and calculated murder."" The jury had three options, after beginning deliberations Tuesday: to find Neuman guilty of murder, to find him guilty but mentally ill or to find him not guilty by reason of insanity, as he'd pleaded. They chose the second course. That meant Adams could either have sentenced Neuman to life in prison with the possibility of parole in at least 30 years, or life in prison without the possibility of parole. Neuman will be evaluated for mental illness in prison, and if diagnosed as mentally ill will be treated while incarcerated. After the verdict was delivered, Steve Sneiderman described his 36-year-old brother as a ""good provider,"" ""devoted son,"" ""wonderful brother"" and a ""great father"" to his two children. ""He had limitless potential, which now can never be realized because of this man,"" Sneiderman told the court Thursday, referring to Neuman. Neuman himself spoke a short time thereafter, saying ""everybody lost"" in this case -- making specific reference to Sneiderman's son and daughter and his own three children. He called the man that he killed ""a good man."" ""I am so, so, so sorry. I can't say it enough,"" Neuman said. During closing arguments and again Thursday after the sentence was handed down, defense attorney Doug Peters claimed that the victim's widow had ""manipulated our client, who was mentally sick."" ""I believe she preyed upon him and used him to commit the crime that she is responsible for,"" Peter said Thursday, noting that he did not believe that Andrea Sneiderman knew specifics of the shooting plan even as he suggested she inspired it. She has not been charged. Following the sentencing, DeKalb County District Attorney Robert James did not elaborate on whether Andrea Sneiderman might be charged later. He said only that ""it is something that we have under review right now."" ""Justice has been served here,"" James told reporters, saying the focus Thursday should be on Rusty Sneiderman and not his widow. ""I want to thank God that finally, after a year and a half or more, this family -- a good family -- is able to begin the process of healing."" At the time of the shooting, Neuman was Andrea Sneiderman's supervisor at work and both the defense and prosecution accused her of having an affair with the defendant. She denied the accusation in her testimony during the trial. ""There was no affair. Who kills someone else's husband?"" Andrea Sneiderman said, claiming that Neuman said he'd cared about her, her husband and her family before the shooting. The jury also found Neuman guilty of using a firearm in the commission of a felony. Adams sentenced Neuman to five years in prison for that charge, to be served concurrently with his life sentence. Witnesses testimony and evidence presented during the trial showed Neuman tried to disguise himself, staked out the victim, conceal his plan and later conceal evidence tied to the shooting. On the day of the murder, witnesses told police they saw a man -- later proven to be Neuman -- come up from behind Sneiderman and open fire in Dunwoody, a community about 15 miles north of Atlanta. The shooter then fled the scene in a silver minivan without a valid license plate. Sneiderman, a native of Cleveland, Ohio, received an MBA from Harvard and was an active volunteer with the Georgia chapter of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. Neuman, then 48, was arrested nearly two months after the shooting. During his trial, which began last month, the prosecution had argued that Neuman was not insane. James, the district attorney, urged jurors to ""use your common sense ... and you apply it to determine whether or not somebody is malingering or telling the truth."" ""He's insane, he sees angels, he sees demons, he's crazy. 'Something's wrong with me,'"" James said, repeating assertions made by Neuman and his defense team. ""If you cannot trust the ingredients on this insanity sandwich, then I'm going to ask you -- don't eat it."" Doug Peters said that he and other defense team members plan to talk soon with Neuman, to discuss what their next step will be. But he suggested that an appeal should be forthcoming. ""We still do believe that a jury should return a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity,"" Peters said. ""We didn't get that this time, but we're not about giving up."" An attorney for Andrea Sneiderman released a statement late Thursday saying her client ""is grateful for and relieved by the jury's guilty verdict and sentence."" ""Nothing can bring back her husband, but it is reassuring to her that, after all of the noise and distractions surrounding this case, some measure of justice has been done for Rusty,"" said the lawyer, Jennifer Little. InSession's Nancy Leung contributed to this report.","NEW: A defense lawyer says they may appeal, adding ""we're not about giving up""

"(CNN) -- Police in Tennessee have arrested the ex-wife and mother of Adam Mayes, the man suspected of kidnapping Jo Ann Bain and her three daughters, state authorities said Tuesday. The mother, 65-year-old Mary Frances Mayes, and the ex-wife, Teresa Ann Mayes, 30, were arrested Monday, according to the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation (TBI). Teresa Mayes has been charged with four counts of especially aggravated kidnapping, while Mary Frances Mayes has been charged with four counts of conspiracy to commit especially aggravated kidnapping. They appeared before a judge Tuesday morning and were being held in the Hardeman County Jail, Deputy court clerk Pat Kirk said. According to an arrest warrant, Teresa Mayes admitted driving a vehicle containing Jo Ann Bain and her three daughters from Hardeman County to Union County, Mississippi. Bain and her oldest daughter, Adrienne, suffered ""serious bodily injury as a result of their removal or confinement,"" according to the warrant. Convictions carry possible sentences of 15 to 60 years in prison under Tennessee law. Bond has been set at $500,000 for Teresa Mayes, while Mary Frances Mayes' bond was set at $300,000, Deputy Clerk Rhonda Sipes said. Both women were assigned court-appointed attorneys and are slated to make their next appearance in court on May 22. The bodies of Jo Ann Bain and her eldest daughter, Adrienne, were found Saturday at a home in Guntown, Mississippi, that has been linked to Adam Mayes, the TBI said. Investigators are are still searching for Adam Mayes and Bain's two younger daughters, Alexandria Bain, 12, and Kyliyah Bain, 8. ""We are absolutely hopeful. Currently that's what we believe, and we do believe that they are still with Mayes,"" said FBI Special Agent Joel Siskovic, addressing whether he thought the two girls are alive. At least 17 law enforcement agencies are involved and hundreds of people are working on the investigation, he said. Siskovic declined to comment on a possible motive in the case and said the focus, for now, should stay on the missing girls. Bobbi Booth, Teresa Mayes' sister, spoke to CNN's Anderson Cooper on Tuesday about Adam Mayes and his relationship with her sister, who she said has mental health problems. ""I've known Adam for at least 25 years, and he's always been weird and unusual ... but I never dreamed he would do something like this,"" she said. She described him as aggressive and not trustworthy. He beat and threatened to kill her sister, said Booth, who pleaded with him through the interview to him to ""do the right thing."" ""Just let the children go. This has gone on way too far. And we need to figure out what's going on, and it's not fair to the children,"" she said. Adam Mayes, 35, is considered armed and dangerous, and authorities have asked for the public's help in tracking down him and the two girls. In Mississippi, authorities continued to stop and search cars at checkpoints set up to look for them, state Highway Patrol Master Sgt. Johnny Poulos said. ""Everybody is tense,"" Peggy Guerry, who lives just a few houses away from the house linked to Mayes in Guntown, told HLN's Vinnie Politan. ""It's got everybody around here worried that he's still in the area, back in the woods or something like that,"" she said. Authorities established contact with and tried to interview Mayes soon after the mother and her three daughters were reported missing on April 27 by Jo Ann's husband in Whiteville, a western Tennessee town of 4,600 people, but Mayes fled, Siskovic told CNN affiliate WPTY. He was last seen May 1 in Guntown, the same northern Mississippi town where the bodies were found. Details haven't been released as to how or exactly when they died. The TBI late last week issued an Amber Alert asking for the public's help in finding the Bain sisters and for information leading to Mayes' arrest. Local, state and federal law enforcement's focus is now in Union County, Mississippi, where Guntown is located, but authorities have also pointed out that Mayes has connections to Texas, North Carolina, South Carolina and Florida and could be en route to Arizona. Mayes may be using the alias of Christopher Zachery Wylde or Paco Rodrigass, his Facebook profile name, the FBI said Monday. Rick Foster, whose wife was a lifelong friend of Jo Ann Bain and whose daughter was a classmate of Adrienne Bain, recently told CNN that Mayes had been a friend of the Bain family for years. Mayes lived about 90 miles away in Mississippi, Foster said, but would stay with the Bains when he was in the Whiteville area. He described Mayes as ""a big kid in a grown man's body."" Mary Patterson, Mayes' landlord in Alpine, Mississippi, told WPTY that she thought he was a ""kind"" and ""fun guy."" ""If somebody told me this, I would have never believed it,"" she said. Authorities describe Mayes as a white man who has blue eyes and brown hair, weighs about 175 pounds and stands 6-foot-3. He recently cut his own hair and may have done the same to the missing children, according to the Amber Alert. As for the Bains, Foster described the marriage between Jo Ann and her husband, Gary, as ""perfect"" and said the family had planned to move to Arizona once the school year ended. The FBI and U.S. Marshals Service are offering a $50,000 reward for information leading to Mayes' arrest and to the missing girls. CNN's Vivian Kuo, Stephanie Gallman and Joe Sutton contributed to this report.","NEW: Former sister-in-law describes the suspect as aggressive, ""weird and unusual""

"(CNN) -- Samsung's flagship smartphone could be getting twice as fast. The South Korean electronics company plans to release a quicker version of the Galaxy S4, says CEO J.K. Shin. He told Reuters it will be for sale in South Korea later this month. The phones, which will be powered by a new Qualcomm processor, use what's being called LTE-advanced technology, which will reportedly deliver data at speeds up to twice those of current 4G LTE connections. Some downloads could be even quicker. A movie that takes three minutes to download on the current Galaxy S4 would take one minute on the new phone, Samsung told Reuters . Shin said Samsung is in talks with carriers in other countries about the phone. He did not specify which countries, or carriers. The Galaxy S4 has been Samsung's most popular smartphone yet. It passed 10 million sales in its first month -- a clip that outpaced its predecessor, the S3, which emerged as the Android system's most successful rival to the iPhone. Recently, though, both Apple and Samsung have seen a slowdown in sales of top-end smartphones, as that market has shown signs of becoming saturated. An even faster S4, obviously, would be an effort to appeal to that upper-tier buyer who's willing to fork over cash for the fanciest and fastest new models. Shin told Reuters the new model would be ""slightly more expensive"" than the current S4, which sells for $199 and up, depending on the carrier and which service plan the customer signs up for. Last month, Samsung announced that it will be making a smaller version of the S4. That phone will be unveiled at an event Thursday. There also have been unconfirmed reports that Apple will release a cheaper version of its iPhone. As the high-end market tightens up, Apple, Samsung and other phone makers are eyeing developing countries, where interest in smartphones is still growing.","Report: Samsung CEO says phone to be released first in South Korea .

"New York (CNN) -- A former studio assistant to American artist Jasper Johns is accused of stealing and selling pieces of Johns' art in a multimillion-dollar scheme. James Meyer, 51 of Salisbury, Connecticut, allegedly stole 22 pieces of unfinished art from a studio file drawer he was responsible for maintaining in a Sharon, Connecticut, art studio. He then provided them to a Manhattan art gallery for sale, according to a news release from the U.S. district attorney for the Southern District of New York. Between 2006 and 2012, Meyer also provided sworn, notarized certifications to the gallery that the pieces were authentic Johns works and said that he had been given each of them as a gift from Johns, according to the news release. The 22 pieces were sold by the Manhattan gallery for $6.5 million, of which $3.4 million went to Meyer, who was arrested Wednesday and is charged with one count of interstate transportation of stolen property and one count of wire fraud. Meyer was a studio assistant for Johns for more than 25 years and was responsible for maintaining a drawer of unfinished works. These pieces of art were not authorized to be sold by Johns, according to the U.S. attorney's office. ""As alleged, James Meyer exploited his position of trust to steal repeatedly from his long-time employer. That his employer is a renowned American artist only made the crime more lucrative"" George Venizelos, FBI assistant director-in-charge of the New York field office, said Thursday. Interstate transportation of stolen property carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison, while wire fraud carries a maximum sentence of 20. Johns rose to prominence as an American contemporary artist in the middle of the 20th century. His works can be seen in many museums, including the National Gallery of Art. Among his best-known paintings are ""Flag,"" a depiction of the American flag, and ""False Start,"" a mix of various colors along with stenciled names of colors. In 2011 Johns was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, which honors the ""especially meritorious contributions to the security or national interests of the United States, to world peace, or to cultural or other significant public or private endeavors.""

"(CNN) -- Last season's finale of ""How I Met Your Mother"" finally answered the lingering question of who exactly is the mother of the TV series' title. The show's main character, Ted Mosby, played by Josh Radnor and voiced in narration by Bob Saget, has spent eight seasons telling his kids the story of how he met their mom, endlessly dragging out the eventual interaction. Finally, creators Carter Bays and Craig Thomas revealed the mother's identity; she is played by Cristin Milioti. The CBS show will enter its ninth and final season on September 23, with an hourlong episode, giving one last chance to play out the stories of Ted and his friends before -- we hope -- seeing him happily settle down. The creators, episode director and producer Pam Fryman and cast members Radnor, Neil Patrick Harris (Barney Stinson), Cobie Smulders (Robin Scherbatsky), Alyson Hannigan (Lily Aldrin) and Jason Segel (Marshall Eriksen) teased the upcoming 24-episode season recently at the San Diego Comic-Con. During a panel on the show, the creators unveiled a clip that explains why Ted's children have been sitting on a couch listening to him tell this never-ending saga. It ties in with something to come later in the season involving the kids, which Bays said they shot during the second season for whenever the ending arrived. ""We thought we'd be done after eight seasons,"" Bays told CNN.com after the panel, ""so season nine is a bonus year and it's the Wild West. Anything could happen. We're changing a lot of the rules about how we thought we'd tell the story."" Thomas added, ""I don't think the story has changed, but how we tell it has changed now that we have 24 extra episodes to see more of it. Knowing what we have left to tell, this little story we've been meaning to tell for eight years now, it would have felt really abrupt to end it after eight seasons."" ""How I Met Your Mother"" has traditionally used multi-episode narrative arcs and flashbacks to keep the story moving, often jumping in time or extending a season over the course of a year. The final season, however, will take place entirely over one weekend in the fictional town of Farhampton. ""There's a mass migration to Farhampton, to the Farhampton Inn, for Barney and Robin's wedding,"" Radnor told CNN. ""We last left our gang when Lily and Ted were driving out together, Barney and Robin were driving out together and Marshall was planning to come back from Minnesota for the wedding. It's a road trip. Everyone has various problems along the way, because that's what happens on television. We pick up literally where we left off."" Last season left the door open for the resolution of several storylines. Robin, preparing for her wedding to Barney, enlisted Ted's help finding a locket she'd buried in Central Park and found herself in a romantic moment with him. Lily and Marshall (and their infant son) were about to move to Italy for Lily's job when Marshall was offered a judgeship in New York but didn't know how to tell Lily. ""It seems like it's something Marshall wants to tell her in person,"" Segel said. ""Which I think is smart. I don't know how they've planned time-wise for the season; they could wrap it up in the finale for all we know. We find out the day before the table read. It's neat for us to see things unfold."" Hannigan added, ""I don't like to know too much because I don't want to have to lie. I'm a terrible liar, so I really don't know, but he obviously doesn't want her to find out, and it's going to be one of those 'Is she going to find out?' stressors for Marshall."" The real draw for the last season is getting to watch the beginning of Ted's relationship with the mother unfold. Fryman confirmed fans will see Ted meet the character very quickly into the ninth season and said viewers are ""going to get to know her."" As the characters gather for the wedding, the on-again, off-again nature of Ted and Robin's relationship will also be addressed, something at which the season premiere's title, ""The Locket,"" may hint. As for the revelation of Milioti in the role of the mother last season, the creators said keeping that secret was the hardest thing they've done on the show. ""We shot it on this other stage,"" Bays said. ""We built this big train station set you saw in the season finale. We didn't have any extras. Everyone else you saw walking around there is the 'How I Met Your Mother' writers (and crew). It was a family affair. No strangers or outsiders were a part of it. We locked it down. We made everybody (who) was there -- not that we don't trust our cast and crew -- sign confidentiality agreements. We were terrified for a month and a half. Every day we were terrified that it would get out, but it didn't and that was great."" The cast members seemed emotional about ""How I Met Your Mother"" coming to an end, but Harris said they are just trying to enjoy filming this season. ""I compartmentalize things, and I'm not a fan of goodbyes so I haven't really contemplated it,"" Harris said. ""I don't want to spend the time we have on the show lamenting its demise because we're not there yet. We're still in the beginning of the show. So even though it's run eight seasons, we still have 20-some odd weeks to do it, and I want to make sure we're enjoying it as opposed to being wistful about it."" Smulders, who also appears in the season premiere of the new ABC show ""Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D,"" said, ""It hasn't started to sink in yet. But we have six more episodes after the holidays, and I feel like that's going to be a really intense time for everyone."" Smulders also shared a piece of trivia about the series that surprised even her co-stars. ""Robin was not a Canadian when I signed on for the show,"" Smulders said. ""She became one because, according to Carter and Craig, we're exotic. Literally the words they used to me in season one: 'Well, I just feel like it's really exotic.' I never in my life have been called exotic."" For Radnor, ""How I Met Your Mother"" has meant being involved in something groundbreaking in terms of storytelling. The extended arcs and serialized narrative structure was not widespread when the show premiered, but it has since become part of the TV landscape. ""We introduced some stuff that is now commonplace in some ways,"" Radnor said. ""I was actually talking with Carter and Craig last night about how there's this new fashion of dumping 12 episodes out. Like Netflix is now giving all these episodes, and they can do really serialized arcs. That's what Carter and Craig excel at. That's what they always wanted to do. Follow the locket or follow these different threads. ""I feel like in some ways we just did what we did really well, and the public mood caught up to us.

"(CNN) -- The tale of Brenda Heist, the Pennsylvania mother who abandoned her two children only to turn up in Florida 11 years later, has taken another unlikely turn. On Saturday, she remained jailed on a Santa Rosa County warrant for alleged violation of probation, forgery and giving a false name to law enforcement, said Art Forgey, a spokesman for the Alachua County Sheriff's Office. Heist, who used the assumed name Kelsie Lyanne Smith, is awaiting extradition, Forgey told CNN affiliate WJXT. She turned herself in Friday. Heist, meanwhile, may not have spent most of those 11 years homeless, as she told police last week when she turned herself in, saying she'd abandoned her family because of stress. Sondra Forrester says she knew Heist in 2010. At that time, Heist cleaned her Florida home and went by the name Lovey Smith. ""She actually moved in with me, moved in with me about six months after she started cleaning the house,"" Forrester told CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360"" on Friday. Heist first came into her life through a neighbor, who recommended her when Forrester was looking for a housekeeper. The neighbor had used her as a babysitter and spoke highly of her, she said. At first, the two women shared small talk, but little more on Heist's weekly visit to clean. But over time their conversations took on a different, more personal tone. ""She told me that she had a bad relationship with her boyfriend and I started to kind of feel bad for her,"" Forrester said. ""She described it as sort of an abusive situation, saying that he was maybe an alcoholic and I just let her know that my door was always open for her. I felt bad for her."" Forrester asked more questions about Heist's past when she moved into the house, ""but not a whole lot. But when I did ask, she made it clear that she never had kids and she didn't want any."" Heist also claimed to be a widow. ""She said she had been married for, like, 20 years to a man named Lee and he had worked for the Marriott and they had traveled around and visited amazing places and he had died,"" Forrester said. 'Absolutely shocked' After she moved in, bringing some belongings with her, Heist lived with her for 10 or 11 months. She used the computer and cell phone, had a Facebook page and was on an internet dating site, Forrester said. ""She had friends outside of me."" Heist's appearance then was nothing like the worn-down face shown in pictures taken after she turned herself in last week to authorities in Key Largo, Florida. ""I was absolutely shocked when I saw that photo,"" Forrester said. ""She has deteriorated significantly since the last time she was seen around here, which was, you know, the middle of 2012, the end of 2012. That's not been very long, you know, seven months or so."" Another twist in the tale is that Heist had revealed her true last name to Forrester's son, with whom she became close while living in the family home. He was around the same age as Heist's own son was when she abandoned her Pennsylvania family nearly a decade earlier. Forrester had taken her son aside to tell him the truth about the woman he knew as ""Miss Lovey,"" so that he wouldn't learn about it on the news. But he told her he already knew her last name was Heist. ""I was stunned that he knew that. But for a little boy, that's kind of a cool last name. I said, honey, how did you know that? 'Miss Lovey told me.' "" No family reunion . But while Heist was making friends and living an apparently normal life in Florida, the husband, son and daughter she'd left behind in 2002 continued to wonder whether something terrible had happened to her. Police searched for her for years, at one point creating a cold case task force. Her family remain angry over the pain her disappearance caused. ""I don't think she deserves to see me,"" her 20-year-old daughter Morgan Heist told CNN's ""Piers Morgan Live"" on Thursday night. ""I don't really have any plans on going to see her."" The fact that her mother -- who she last saw when she was 8 -- never even called has left her seething, Morgan Heist said. The anger is captured in a post on the daughter's Twitter page that reads she hopes her mother ""rots in hell."" ""That makes me really mad,"" Morgan Heist said. ""I can't believe she would do that because she was a good mom. She was great. But, I mean, I guess something happened. Something snapped in her. "" Her father, Lee Heist, said he is not planning on visiting his ex-wife anytime soon. They were going through a divorce at the time she disappeared, and he was treated for a time as a suspect in her disappearance, though he was eventually cleared. In 2010, he filed a petition with the county court to have Brenda declared legally deceased, according to a Lititz police news release. He was seeking closure, he said. ""I don't see where it would do any good for either of us to see her again,"" Lee Heist said. He later remarried and said he will learn to forgive his former wife. But for Morgan Heist, forgiving her mom may not be easy. ""I hope to eventually forgive her one day for myself, not for her,"" she said. Left on a whim . Brenda Heist vanished in February 2002 after last being seen dropping off her children at school. She was applying for housing assistance so that she could get an apartment after the breakdown of her marriage. She worked as a bookkeeper for a car dealer and hoped to receive some financial aid. However, her request was denied, police said. ""She was very upset, she was sitting in a park crying, thinking about how she would raise her children, feeling sorry for herself,"" said Sgt. John Schofield, a Lititz Borough, Pennsylvania, police detective. He was one of the many officers who searched for Heist. By her account, it wasn't long before she was approached by two men and a woman who asked her what was wrong. After she told them what had happened, they invited her to hitchhike with them down to Florida. ""At a whim, she decided at that very moment, she would go along with them,"" Schofield said. Schofield spoke to Heist at length after she turned herself in. ""She was very emotional; she hung her head; she's ashamed. She was crying when I met with her. She knows what she did was completely wrong, but all that while, she'd never made one effort to call or contact her family at all,"" Schofield said. Heist told police she spent the first two years homeless, living under bridges, eating food thrown out by restaurants after they closed. For the next seven years, she lived in a camper with a man she had met. They made money as day laborers, cleaning boats and doing other odd jobs for which they didn't have to show ID and were paid in cash. After that relationship soured, Schofield said, she said she lived on the street again for another two years. But the revelations made by Forrester raise new questions over the truth of Heist's account. ""I don't think we know the full story yet,"" Schofield told CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360"" on Friday. ""The facts are she left, she turned her back on her family. She started a new life down in Florida ... Whether she lived homeless or whether she lived a wonderful life as a live-in housekeeper, I don't think that was for the 11 years, that was just for the last few years here."" Schofield said Heist is still looking at charges for false IDs, thefts and possession of drugs and drugs paraphernalia in Florida. There also may be false ID and theft charges to face in Pennsylvania, he said. She never suspected Heist of using drugs, Forrester said -- or she would not have allowed her near her family.

"(CNN) -- A major winter storm whipped the Upper Midwest early Monday, just after a historic snowfall buried much of the Northeast. The latest blizzard dumped 8 to 15 inches of snow across parts of seven states but saved most of its fury for the Dakotas and Minnesota, the National Weather Service said. Snow showers and blowing snow were expected to linger Monday across the area. More than 1,000 miles away, residents of the Northeast spent the weekend digging out from a storm that dumped several feet of snow across the region. In the Southeast, at least 15 tornadoes formed across southern Mississippi and Alabama on Sunday afternoon as a cold front moved in. Major damage was caused by a tornado that struck Hattiesburg, Mississippi. The Mobile, Alabama, National Weather Service Office was to begin conducting damage surveys Monday. According to Storm Prediction Center reports, nearly 70 people were injured in Sunday's storms, with at least 61 of those in Hattiesburg. North begins recovery . In the Northeast, the heavy snow that fell over the weekend was still causing problems Monday. Scott Devico, a spokesman for the Connecticut Department of Emergency Management, said Monday the roofs of 16 homes and buildings had collapsed because of the weight of the snow piled atop them. The storm's toll rose to 11 when a man and woman were found dead in a car in Meriden, apparently due to carbon monoxide poisoning, Devico said. Five of the nine other fatalities were in Connecticut, along with one in New York, one in Massachusetts and two in the Canadian province of Ontario. In Bridgeport, Connecticut, Mayor Bill Finch said the city had gotten some 30 inches of snow. As of Monday morning, 10% to 20% of it had been plowed, with the city's main roads expected to be cleared by Tuesday morning, secondary roads by Thursday and Friday, and residential streets by Sunday, he said. Bridgeport is no special case. ""I've talked to other mayors; we're all buried,"" he said. National Guard soldiers were helping pick up emergency-center workers and retrieve operators for pay loaders, he said. Abandoned cars were making the task difficult. ""The plows can't get through; pay loaders have to work surgically to try and remove these cars and get the streets cleared,"" Finch said. On Sunday night, he said, only two tow trucks were available to the city; the rest were snowed in. By Monday, six tow trucks were operating, he said. Alternative forms of transportation weren't much better. ""It took me 40 minutes to walk four blocks from my house to the Emergency Operations Center,"" he said. About 200 people were in shelters Sunday in southeastern Connecticut, Gov. Dannel Malloy said. More than that number found refuge in schools on the South Shore of Massachusetts, where dozens of National Guard soldiers were helping local authorities and residents deal with flooding and storm damage. The Boston Globe reported that recovery efforts were in motion, and the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency dispatched eight rapid assessment teams to look at conditions in coastal communities. The paper reported that thousands of National Guard soldiers were assisting. ""The devastation we have seen here would lead one to believe that it'll be days before we get power back,"" said Jim Cantwell, a state representative for the Massachusetts towns of Marshfield and Scituate, where about 90% of customers were without power late Sunday. In Massachusetts, about 113,000 customers were still without power Monday afternoon, with the greatest concentration of outages in the southeastern and Cape regions, said Gov. Deval Patrick. ""I think the utility companies have made great progress, but they need to keep making great progress,"" he told reporters. He pleaded with residents using generators to ensure they are properly vented. Officials have received reports of people being overcome with carbon monoxide, ""a deadly and silent killer,"" he said. Amtrak announced that it would resume normal operations between New York and Boston beginning Tuesday. ""Amtrak crews have been working around the clock to clear affected track of large amounts of snow, in excess of several fee in some cases,"" the rail line said in a statement. South takes hit . Storms were only one aspect of the extreme weather across the Southeast as heavy rain soaked much of the region. Rain around the slow-moving cold front prompted flood watches and warnings from southeastern Louisiana to central Georgia through Tuesday afternoon. Those states could get 3 to 5 inches of rain, CNN meteorologists said. The Southeast and Gulf Coast may see severe storms Monday, with heavy rainfall and gusty winds, the Storm Prediction Center said. Warmer weather . Daytime temperatures were expected to climb Monday into the 40s in much of southern Connecticut, Rhode Island and Massachusetts, where rain may fall as well. That would help melt snow, though it could make what's there heavier and increase the risk of roof collapses. There were reports Sunday of a barn, a sports facility, commercial buildings and other buildings suffering cave-ins, Malloy said. Freezing rain will change to rain as temperatures warm in the Northeast on Monday. But overnight lows will dip below freezing, causing melted snow to refreeze on roads. A weak system will move through the area on Wednesday and will drop dustings of snow across the area, but the system should clear out by Thursday morning. The mix made for a messy Monday morning commute into cities such as Boston, though schools remained closed there and in many other locales as the snow clean-up effort continued. Flights resumed Sunday at Boston's Logan Airport and Amtrak restored limited service. ""We're working as hard as we can,"" Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chaffee said of efforts in his state. ""We're seeing efforts every hour."" Lots and lots of snow . The blizzard that began burying the Northeast on Friday was historic by many measures -- most of all, by the amount of snow that fell. In Hamden, Connecticut, for instance, 40 inches of snow made it difficult for plows to get on the roads. CNN iReporter Mia Orsatti said streets there had transformed into ""white, wide, soft blanket(s) of snow."" Tornado strikes in the Deep South . Lesser depths still led to major headaches, especially when combined with hurricane-force wind gusts, storm surges and snow drifts. ""There's a ton of snow, and there's nowhere to put it,"" said Lena Berc of Boston, where 24.9 inches fell. ""So it's really frustrating to find nooks and crannies."" Many still without power . About 270,000 utility customers were in the dark late Sunday, down from 635,000 a day earlier. The outages were the result of a combination of whipping winds and power lines sagging, and sometimes snapping, under the weight of wet snow and ice. The storm by the numbers . ""There was a phenomenal amount of trees that went down,"" Cantwell said, noting that no Scituate residents had power Sunday morning and estimating it may be Thursday before all the lights are back on. For all the headaches in New England, however, many people were enjoying the wintry conditions. iReporter Filipe Pereira said students at Wentworth Institute of Technology in Boston, who were set to return to class Monday, had enjoyed the weekend storm, engaging in massive snowball fights and building snowmen everywhere. People were even skiing down one street, he said. Students earlier took a series of photographs tracking the storm over 26 hours. The streets around the small school were still a mess, but they were no longer closed. ""People have been going all over the roads with no problem,"" Pereira said. Map, time line of the storm .

"(CNN) -- Philadelphia's 218 public schools will open on time in September after Mayor Michael Nutter assured the school district on Thursday it will receive $50 million that Superintendent William Hite demanded last week. Hite gave the city an ultimatum, saying the school district would not open on time if it did not receive a funding guarantee by Friday. This came after the layoff of close to 3,800 employees this summer due to a ""drastic financial shortfall."" The massive layoffs included aides, assistant principals, social workers and arts teachers. ""I'm here to say I will not risk a catastrophe,"" Nutter said Thursday, ""We will avoid this disaster."" Nutter directed the city finance director, the city treasurer, and the budget director on Thursday to begin immediately taking all steps necessary for the city to borrow $50 million on behalf of the school district, Nutter said in a written statement. Hite said he plans to open the schools on time based on Nutter's assurance, even though Nutter has not yet cut a deal with City Council over how it will be funded. The superintendent expressed his appreciation to the mayor in a statement released Thursday, saying that the funding promise will allow the district to immediately start recalling the necessary staff to open the schools on time. Hite had previously said that without the money to restore crucial staff members, the district would not be able to open ""functional schools, run them responsibly, or provide a quality education to students."" Nutter had called Hite's ultimatum one of ""the most chilling"" statements he had ever heard a school superintendent make, but promised he would stand ""shoulder to shoulder"" with Hite and would not allow schools to open with no more staff than he could afford without the extra money. Hite and Nutter had previously urged the City Council to extend a 1% sales tax to make up the difference but -- despite approval from the General Assembly and Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett -- City Council President Darrell L. Clarke said he would rather focus that money on the city's critical pension problem. If the city does not solve the retirement fund issues, Clarke said, Philadelphia could quickly follow in the footsteps of other major cities with significant financial problems. As an alternative, Clarke proposed the city purchase the school district's surplus vacant real estate for $50 million and sell the property to developers who could turn it into potential job producers. A final decision on this proposal has not yet been made. Hite and Nutter are also negotiating a contract with the local teachers' union, hoping to save money by asking teachers to make concessions on certain benefits. Because there has been no agreement with the union, $45 million in aid from the state previously allocated to the school district is being withheld. Once the negotiations are complete the funding will be released, state Budget Secretary Charles Zogby said Tuesday. Nutter said that ""as mayor, it's my duty to keep Philadelphia on track and moving forward and that's what I'm doing today."" Philadelphia's 218 public schools will now open their doors on September 9, the originally scheduled date.","Philadelphia's schools will receive $50 million the superintendent said is needed .

"Washington (CNN) -- The prospect of Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell resigning as he copes with a federal investigation into the nearly $150,000 worth of lavish gifts the Republican and his family received from a wealthy executive is unlikely, people close to the governor insist. Yet the topic remains a tantalizing conversation piece around Richmond these days, mainly because it would be an act without modern precedent. While Virginia has had its fair share of tumultuous politics over the years, not since Reconstruction has the commonwealth been forced to grapple with a question of succession. No Virginia governor has resigned, or been impeached, in the last century. Virginia governor scandal: 'That's not the guy we know' But there's another reason some Virginia political watchers are buzzing about the hypothetical: McDonnell's resignation, however unlikely, would elevate his lieutenant governor, Republican Bill Bolling, to the state's highest office. And Bolling has made it abundantly clear he has little tolerance for the Republican running to succeed McDonnell -- Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli. ""I have serious reservations about his ability to effectively and responsibly govern our state,"" Bolling said of Cuccinelli in a recent interview with CNN. Candidates say McDonnell should consider resigning . Here's the backstory: Bolling has served as lieutenant governor since 2006, and had long eyed this election year as his moment to make the leap to governor. Bolling had McDonnell's endorsement, and campaign backing from other establishment leaders and members of Virginia's influential business community. Then Cuccinelli stepped in. The ambitious Fairfax native, an uncompromising social conservative and tea party darling, also had designs on the governorship -- and he had no time for the succession plan orchestrated by Bolling, McDonnell and other GOP leaders. So last year, Cuccinelli's allies in the Republican Party re-wired the GOP's nominating process so that the 2013 gubernatorial nominee would be selected by convention instead of a primary. Since conventions tend to attract only a small slice of the electorate -- the most committed and vocal conservatives who revel in spending their spring weekends at political conventions -- that left Bolling, who views the tea party movement with a mixture of scorn and exotic bewilderment, with little option but to drop out of the race. McDonnell's poll numbers fall as scandal unfolds . An exasperated Bolling left the race, and Cuccinelli easily captured the GOP gubernatorial nomination in May with the support of roughly 8,000 delegates who showed up at the Richmond Coliseum to support him (and two other conservatives, attorney general candidate Mark Obenshain and a bombastic pastor named E.W. Jackson, the party's nominee for lieutenant governor). Clearly incensed at Cuccinelli for dashing his gubernatorial hopes, Bolling soon embarked on a media tour lamenting the rightward drift of the Republican Party. He used his remaining campaign funds to launch an initiative called ""The Virginia Mainstream Project"" to recruit pragmatic Republican candidates and advance ""responsible conservative policy solutions."" Bolling's message was clear: hard-liners like Cuccinelli are eating away at the Republican Party from the inside, and hindering legislative compromise in Richmond. Cuccinelli's allies think Bolling is a sore loser, bordering on irrelevance. Bolling, freed from the pressures of campaign politics for the first time in nearly two decades, says he's just speaking his mind. McDonnell points to 'irresponsible' rumors . ""Frankly, I don't care what they think of me,"" Bolling said last month over lunch at a Greek restaurant in the Richmond suburbs, several weeks before The Washington Post revealed some of the more explosive details of the unfolding McDonnell controversy. Picking at a salad, the lieutenant governor characterized himself as a conservative, explaining that his first taste of politics came as a teenager in the coalfields of West Virginia, when he toiled on the 1972 re-election campaign of Gov. Arch Moore, a Republican in what was then a heavily Democratic state. ""The definition of what a conservative is has changed so much that now all of a sudden I look like a moderate,"" he said. ""The truth is that Bill Bolling is a conservative guy, always has been, always will be. But I am not an anti-government guy. I believe there is a role for government to play."" The conversation pivoted to Bolling's central criticism of Cuccinelli -- that he is an ideologue uninterested in the sort of compromises needed to govern. ""This is not just the most conservative ticket, but it is the most ideologically driven ticket that we have seen in the history of our state,"" Bolling said of the Cuccinelli-Jackson-Obenshain tea party troika. Bolling says he has ""tried to be measured"" in his public comments about Cuccinelli. But that's not really true. ""The difference between us is the kinds of issues we focus on, the leadership style and demeanor that we demonstrate,"" Bolling said. ""Our willingness to compromise, to get things done. Mr. Cuccinelli will have to run his campaign, and to win this election, he is going to have to convince people that he has the ability to govern Virginia in a mainstream way. Whether he can do that or not remains to be seen."" All of this, mind you, is coming from the man who would become chief executive if McDonnell were to leave office prematurely. New allegations against McDonnell emerge . To the delight of Democrats, it's conceivable that the governor's mansion could be occupied by a Republican who happens to be openly contemptuous of the Republican running to succeed him. Democrats might enjoy that scenario almost as much as the one they have now, with Cuccinelli having to answer questions about his own ties to Star Scientific CEO Jonnie Williams, the embattled executive who provided McDonnell and his family with undisclosed gifts like a Rolex watch, a $15,000 Bergdorf Goodman shopping spree and pricey catering for the wedding of the governor's daughter. Cuccinelli also accepted gifts from Williams and owned stock in his company, though an investigation last week found he did not violate the state's conflict of interest laws. ""This is a no-win situation for Cuccinelli,"" said Democratic strategist Mo Elleithee, a veteran of Virginia campaigns. ""If Bob McDonnell somehow is able to remain in office, he'll be a daily reminder of Cuccinelli's own ethical challenges with Star Scientific. If Bolling assumes the governorship, not only will Cuccinelli still be under an ethical cloud, but the new governor will be a daily reminder of how even mainstream Republicans view him as too extreme."" Bolling's comments over the last few months to a spate of news organizations seem tailor-made for negative television ads and mail pieces: ""Don't believe us? Here's what Virginia's own Republican governor had to say about Ken Cuccinelli ..."" Bolling has even left the door open to voting for Cuccinelli's Democratic opponent, Terry McAuliffe, who, he kindly pointed out, ""takes a more pragmatic approach to politics and to governing."" At the moment, it doesn't seem the Bolling-as-governor scenario will come to pass. Bolling is close with McDonnell and certainly isn't angling for the job. Though he's had designs on the governorship for years, taking over for McDonnell in the wake of scandal, with regular legislative business wrapped for the year, isn't much of a prize. Nor could Bolling suddenly decide to run for a full term -- the filing deadline to run in November passed in June. Barring another devastating disclosure about the investigation, the only real pressure point for McDonnell as he braces for a tough final six months in office would be a chorus of resignation calls from legislators in his own party. But so far, not a single prominent Republican has called for McDonnell to leave office. Meanwhile, McDonnell has hired a Washington-based crisis communications consultant and former U.S. attorney to fight back against federal investigators, and some of his supporters launched a legal defense fund last week. Those aren't the actions of a man preparing to step aside. But if he does, Cuccinelli and Virginia Republicans might only be trading in one headache for another.","Lieutenant governor says he has reservations about fellow Republican running for governor .

"(CNN) -- Facebook co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg burst into the public's consciousness as the awkward, hoodie-wearing Harvard kid who cooked up a website in his dorm room and went on to earn billions from it. But in the past year, he's begun to leverage his deep pockets -- he's worth about $16 billion -- and high profile as an advocate for issues beyond the company's Menlo Park, California, offices. Whether it's pledging to spread Internet access to the world's poorest corners, as he announced Wednesday, or plunking down millions to encourage kids to become scientists, Zuckerberg has evolved into a big-time player, willing to put himself forward for issues he believes in. Here are five examples. The Web evangelist . Zuckerberg on Wednesday announced Internet.org, a new nonprofit devoted to spreading Web access to the nearly 5 billion people around the world who don't have it. Calling access to the Internet a human right, Zuckerberg told CNN the organization will focus on the mobile Web, which is the way many people in poor and developing nations get online. It's also, perhaps not coincidentally, an area where Facebook has focused heavily on expanding its reach and revenue. But Zuckerberg says the effort isn't designed to be self-serving. ""If we really just wanted to focus on making money, the first billion people who are already on Facebook have way more money than the next 5 or 6 billion people combined,"" Zuckerberg said. ""It's not fair, but it's the way that it is. And, we just believe that everyone deserves to be connected, and on the Internet, so we're putting a lot of energy towards this."" The immigration reformer . At first glance, immigration reform doesn't seem like a natural cause for an Internet billionaire. But Zuckeberg took the lead this month in bringing together tech luminaries to form FWD.us -- a group advocating for Congress to reform the nation's immigration system. Tech companies mostly benefit from the federal government's H1B program, which makes it easier for highly skilled workers in fields like computer programming to emigrate to the U.S. But the group advocates equally for issues like helping undocumented immigrants who were brought into the country as children. The group has pumped millions of dollars into things like a TV ad urging Congress to ""fix our broken immigration system."" The bipartisan backer . Silicon Valley has an uneasy relationship, at best, with Washington. But in recent months, Zuckerberg has begun spreading the wealth around. Does the Facebook founder ""like"" Democrats or Republicans? It's complicated. Early this year, Zuckerberg hosted a fundraiser for Republican New Jersey governor -- and potential presidential candidate -- Chris Christie, with whom he has partnered on education issues (see below). But he would later do the same favor for a Jersey Democrat -- Newark Mayor Corey Booker (see same). Zuckerberg hosted a town hall meeting at Facebook for President Barack Obama in 2011. But his FWD.us group has helped fund campaign ads for conservative Republican senators like Florida's Marco Rubio and South Carolina's Lindsay Graham, considered swing votes for the immigration bill in their chamber. It may be unclear which lever Zuckerberg tends to pull at the voting booth. But when he picks up the phone, politicians answer. The health-science patron . Zuckerberg spearheaded an effort early this year designed to spur innovation that has nothing do with social media or mobile apps. Instead, it's for saving lives, or making them better. He helped create the Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences, an annual award given to researchers whose work is ""aimed at curing intractable diseases and extending human life."" The award pays recipients $3 million each -- twice as much as a Nobel Prize -- and is also funded by tech leaders like Google's Sergey Brin and Apple board Chairman Art Levinson. ""Society has a lot of heroes for a lot of different things, but we don't have enough heroes who are scientists and researchers and engineers,"" Zuckerberg told CNN in February. ""We're just trying to set up this ... to reward and recognize the amazing stuff these folks are doing."" The philanthropist . Zuckerberg hasn't shied away from giving back. In fact, last year he was the second-most generous giver in the United States, according to the Chronicle of Philanthropy. He doesn't have any direct personal ties to Newark, New Jersey. But in 2010, he pledged a whopping $100 million of his fortune to helping out troubled schools there. The money was the first gift from Startup: Education, a foundation created by Zuckerberg to help schools. Joined by Booker and Christie, Zuckerberg took to ""The Oprah Winfrey Show"" to announce the donation and foundation. Cynics noted that the gift came shortly before the release of ""The Social Network,"" the fictionalized film on Facebook's birth that many believed cast Zuckerberg in a negative light. But his philanthropy didn't stop there. Zuckerberg later pledged an even bigger sum, nearly $500 million, to the Silicon Valley Community Foundation, which issues grants for a host of causes in the San Francisco area. In 2012, its charitable causes ranged from programs that teach immigrants English to groups providing food and shelter to the needy to funds for victims of the California wildfires.

"(Mashable) -- Say goodbye to the Share button because the Like button is taking over. After months of updates to its Like button, Facebook has released an update that fundamentally changes the button's functionality to that of a Share button. Now after hitting the Like button, a full story with a headline, blurb and thumbnail will be posted to your profile wall. You'll also be given an option to comment on the story link. Previously, only a link to the story would appear in the recent activity, often going unnoticed by users. Though users may now think twice about hitting the button, given how prominently it will appear on their walls and in their networks' newsfeeds, it should ultimately increase traffic to publishers' websites. Facebook has slowly been rolling out updates to its Like button and has stopped developing the Share Button. Facebook Spokeswoman Malorie Lucich told us that while the company will continue to support the Share button, Like is the ""recommended solution moving forward."" However, Lucich today called it a test, saying ""We're always testing new products that incorporate developer feedback as we work to improve the Platform experience, and have no details to share at this time."" It's unlikely that the change is just a test, however. Typically such tests from Facebook only affect a small number of users, whereas this change affects all Like buttons. Perhaps the change was necessary. Because it was never made clear to users that the Like button would function differently than the Share button, many never understood what it meant to click Like on a piece of content. Making the result the same as the Share button could build stronger user expectations, ultimately fashioning a better user experience. © 2013 MASHABLE.com.

"(CNN) -- A student-led group that has been occupying the Florida governor's office to protest the state's stand your ground law and the George Zimmerman verdict decided to give up the fight Thursday and is leaving the state Capitol. The Dream Defenders began their occupation of the office of Florida Gov. Rick Scott in mid-July, just days after Zimmerman was acquitted of second-degree murder in the death of Trayvon Martin. They demanded that Scott call a special legislative session to overturn the state's stand your ground law. Scott met with them a few days later to hear their demands but told them he would not call the special session. ""We feel we've done all we could, said Erika Maye, a spokeswoman for the group. ""We asked for the special session. We're not getting it and now we're going to the individual districts to lobby lawmakers and to register voters. We're going to take it to the streets,"" she said. The deadly encounter between Zimmerman, 29, and Martin took place on February 26, 2012, as Martin, 17, walked back to his father's fiancee's house through the rain from a Sanford convenience store. Martin was carrying Skittles and a drink. Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, spotted him and called police. A 911 dispatcher told Zimmerman that officers were on the way and not to follow the allegedly suspicious person. Nonetheless, Zimmerman got out of his car, later telling police he just wanted to get a definitive address to relay to authorities. Sometime after that, Zimmerman and Martin got into a physical altercation. Zimmerman shot Martin dead. Zimmerman claimed at his trial that he shot Martin in self-defense. Some accused Zimmerman -- who identifies himself as Hispanic -- of racially profiling the African-American teenager, a claim Zimmerman's defense flatly denied. The case brought issues of race and the use of stand your ground laws to the forefront. On Thursday night, the group planned to march the governor's mansion to deliver what it is calling an eviction notice to Scott. ""We're coming for his job ... the young people of Florida are coming for his job,"" Maye said. HLN's Grace Wong, Graham Winch, Amanda Sloane, Jonathan Anker and Anna Lanfreschi and CNN's Mariano Castillo, Michael Pearson, Faith Karimi, Chelsea J.

"(CNN) -- Lawyers for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals will face off against those with SeaWorld in a Southern California federal court Monday after the animal rights group filed a lawsuit to declare that five killer whales are being held in slavery or involuntary servitude in violation of the 13th Amendment. SeaWorld has called the lawsuit a baseless publicity stunt by PETA, which is known for provocative advertisements and public demonstrations on behalf of animal rights. PETA filed the 20-page compalint in October on behalf of the whales -- Tilikum, Katina, Corky, Kasatka and Ulises. A PETA statement at the time contended that constitutional protections against slavery are not limited to humans. ""Plaintiffs were forcibly taken from their families and natural habitats, are held captive at SeaWorld San Diego and SeaWorld Orlando, denied everything that is natural to them, subjected to artificial insemination or sperm collection to breed performers for defendants' shows, and forced to perform, all for defendants' profit,"" the lawsuit states, arguing that those conditions amount to enslavement and/or forced servitude. At the heart of the lawsuit is the question of whether a non-human entity can sue for a violation of constitutional rights. The 13th Amendment outlaws slavery and ""involuntary servitude"" in the United States without any specific mention that it applies only to people. ""Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction,"" the amendment's first section states. In its statement, PETA called the lawsuit ""the first ever seeking to apply the Thirteenth Amendment to non-human animals."" The lawsuit seeks an order for the release of the whales ""from bondage"" and a permanent order against holding them in slavery, as well as appointment of a legal guardian to carry out the transfer of the whales to a suitable habitat. It also seeks attorneys' fees and costs. In a statement responding to the lawsuit, SeaWorld Parks and Entertainment said in October that the court case challenges ""the public's right to enjoy and learn more about marine mammals."" ""This effort to extend the Thirteenth Amendment's solemn protections beyond human beings is baseless and in many ways offensive,"" the statement said. SeaWorld is ""among the world's most respected zoological institutions,"" it continues, adding that SeaWorld parks ""are fully accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums and the Alliance of Marine Mammal Parks and Aquariums"" with legal permission to display marine mammals. ""PETA has once again showed that it prefers publicity stunts to the hard work of caring for, rescuing and helping animals,"" the SeaWorld statement said. State and federal courts have traditionally understood laws dealing with animal ownership and cruelty as applying only to human actions, meaning the animals themselves could neither be prosecuted nor act as plaintiffs or defendants. That would include litigation and legislation involving hunting and breeding of animals and plants, as well as zoo and circus displays. CNN's Bill Mears and Tom Cohen contributed to this report.","SeaWorld calls the lawsuit a baseless publicity stunt .

"Cairo (CNN) -- Just two weeks after the Egyptian military ousted President Mohamed Morsy, the country's interim leader Tuesday swore in a new cabinet that excluded members of powerful Islamist parties that came to political power in the country's first democratic elections. The news followed state-run media reports that at least seven people died and more than 260 were wounded in overnight clashes in Cairo, where near-daily battles between Morsy's supporters and those opposed to his rule have broken out since he was deposed on July 3. Outside of the capital, soldiers seized 35 rockets and a machine gun that authorities say were bound for Cairo, according to a military spokesman. The weapons were discovered in a truck that was stopped while trying to make its way through the Cairo-Suez checkpoint, the spokesman said. The new government of interim President Mansour Adly is part of a military-backed plan that dismantled Morsy's government and suspended the constitution until a new one can be drawn up and new elections can be held in six months. The appointment of Adly's new cabinet members, which include Hazem El-Beblawi as interim prime minister and Nobel laureate Mohamed ElBaradei as interim vice president, is likely to do little to cap the growing anger among Morsy's supporters, who have refused to accept the new government. Cabinet posts were offered to the Muslim Brotherhood, of which Morsy is a member, and the Salafist Nour Party, presidential spokesman Ahmed El-Moslemani told Al-Masriya TV on Tuesday, adding that everyone should be included in the political process. ""We are not alienating anyone, and we expect most Islamist movements to take part in reconciliation, including the Muslim Brotherhood,"" he said. The Muslim Brotherhood, however, refused to participate. Ahmed Ali, spokesman for the Muslim Brotherhood, recently responded to Mansour's invitation to include the group in the transitional government. ""More than 700 of our members arrested, broadcasters shot down and people killed in front of the Republican Guard. It is impossible to speak under the current circumstances,"" he said. ""There is no way to have negotiations."" Even as the Egyptian military promises a transition to a civilian government, there were indications that it planned to have an active role in the formation of the new government. Gen. Abdel-Fatah El-Sisi, the nation's military leader, also adopted the title first deputy of the interim prime minister, according to state media. Among the other appointments to the 34-member cabinet, according to the state-run Middle East News Agency (MENA): . Ahmed Galal, a liberal economist educated in the United States and a World Bank veteran, has been appointed as finance minister, and Hisham Zaazou who will retain his post as tourism minister . The news of the appointments came as Egypt's top prosecutor, Hesham Barakat, opened an investigation into whether Morsy and 18 senior Muslim Brotherhood leaders made a jailbreak during the early days of the 2011 popular uprising that toppled Hosni Mubarak. Among the allegations, according to state-run EGYNews: Morsy and the others were helped in their escape by elements of the Palestinian militant group Hamas and Lebanon's Hezbollah along with other Salafist and Muslim Brotherhood supporters. The Muslim Brotherhood was outlawed during Mubarak's iron rule, and its members were routinely jailed. Additionally, authorities are investigating Morsy and several leaders and supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood over accusations of spying and inciting the killing protesters following his overthrow. Authorities have have frozen the assets of more than a dozen people in an investigation of violence in Cairo. The investigations are widely viewed by Morsy's supporters as an attempt to discredit him as the legitimately elected leader of Egypt. Morsy, sworn in in June 2012 as Egypt's first democratically elected president, has been detained since his ouster. El-Moslemani said Morsy is ""in a safe place, and he is being treated with the utmost dignity that suits a former head of state, and when it comes to the legal charges, I will leave this to the official spokesman of the public prosecutor."" The United States and other Western nations have called for Morsy's release. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jennifer Psaki has labeled the detentions of Morsy and members of the Muslim Brotherhood were ""politically motivated"" and urged the military to let them go. On Monday, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State William J. Burns emphasized the need for stability and tolerance as he became the first U.S. official to meet with Egypt's interim leaders. Burns urged leaders to end the violence, according to senior State Department officials, adding that ""only Egyptians can determine their future."" Egypt has long been a close ally of the United States. The country gets $1.3 billion in annual U.S. military aid.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- In scenes that would not have been out of place in a Hollywood science fiction thriller, at dawn on March 31, 2003, armed police and Hong Kong health authorities dressed in biological suits, theater masks and surgical gloves descended on Amoy Gardens housing estate. Working swiftly on an order from the Department of Health to isolate Block E, the residents were sealed in. Under 24-hour medical surveillance, they could neither leave the block nor receive visitors, according to a report from the Hong Kong Department of Health. Later moved to confinement camps under quarantine laws that had not been invoked since an outbreak of bubonic plague in 1894, the residents of Amoy Gardens were locked out for 10 days as doctors, clinicians, sewerage experts and engineers scoured the block for clues. But even before Block E could be quarantined, police were on a manhunt for 147 residents who had already fled the infected apartment block -- to hotels or to stay with family or friends -- possibly spreading the virus into the community. If SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) -- then a new and barely understood type of pneumonia -- demonstrated anything, it was that rumor and panic spread almost as fast as the virus. ""Good, proactive communication that provides accurate information in a timely fashion is certainly one of the lessons of SARS and to some extent this was implemented during the (swine flu) pandemic of 2009,"" said Professor Malik Peiris of the Centre of Influenza Research at Hong Kong University. ""But there were even lessons to learn from 2009 because communicating like this in a crisis is difficult and challenging precisely because you are in a situation of grossly imperfect knowledge,"" he said. In the case of Amoy Gardens, epidemiologists and health authorities were faced with a serious dilemma -- find out how the deadly virus was spreading, but contain panic that could send more infected people into the wider community. Almost immediately, worried residents filled the information vacuum themselves, launching the website sosick.org. Collecting information from residents on infected buildings, the website was able to record the spread of SARS from Amoy Gardens to nearby Lower Ngau Tau Kok Estate a week ahead of the authorities, according to reports at the time. But if government information on the Amoy Estate outbreak was perceived to be lacking, the investigation (conducted at speed) to establish how the disease was spreading was a masterpiece of medical detective work. While people in Hong Kong had been coming down with the virus at the rate of 50 a day, the infection could be traced to contact with a person showing symptoms of the disease. Now, at E-block Amoy Gardens, more than 200 people had contracted the virus almost overnight and their only connection was that they lived vertically above or below each other in the same apartment block. Ultimately, a total of 329 residents at Amoy Gardens came down with SARS and 42 were to die, 22 of them at Block E, . Within 24 hours a team of experts found evidence the building's sewerage was involved in the vertical spread of the virus. Intense diarrhea from one of the patients -- a 33-year-old Shenzhen resident in Hong Kong for kidney treatment and identified only as patient YY -- was believed to have spread the disease through defective piping in the building. According to the Department of Health, a break in E block's flush-water system earlier that month had meant the water-sealed S-bend in some of the apartments' toilets had been dry for an extended period, allowing virus-laden droplets to collect from the system's soil pipe. Bucket flushing by residents may have disturbed and released contaminated droplets, government agencies said. Similarly, exhaust fans may have sucked droplets into bathrooms where the virus was deposited on floor mats, towels, toiletries and toothbrushes. Even then, the government had to work quickly to quash panic sparked by medical conjecture that exhaust fans had drawn contaminated droplets into the building's light well, a disturbing development, if it had been true, that would have meant the virus was airborne. For Hong Kong's government, Amoy Gardens was a turning point. ""The general public expects things to be cut and dried with clear answers -- obviously that may not be possible all the time. The lesson is that one really needs to be upfront in communicating uncertainty,"" Peiris said. Margaret Chan, Director General of the World Health Organization, but then head of the Hong Kong Department of Health, said the fight against SARS was a triumph of dogged medical work. ""SARS taught the importance of meeting an emergency with whatever tools are at hand,"" she told the South China Morning Post. ""SARS was a 21st century disease in its mode and speed of spread. But it was eventually defeated using the 19th century tools of case detection, contact tracing, isolation and infection control."" In terms of epidemiology, the study of the spread of diseases, the lessons from SARS were that the categories of epidemic diseases and their modes of transmission may never end. SARS was believed to have originated in civet cats at the exotic food markets of southern China, leaping the species barrier through human contact, possibly even through the food chain. According to Professor Gabriel Leung, the head of the Department of Community Medicine at Hong Kong University, the spread of disease does not just work in one direction. Virologists, he said, are now looking at how viruses pass, not just from animals to humans, but from humans to animals and then back to humans again. ""SARS was a wake up call, not just to Hong Kong but to the rest of the world and what it showed us is that the world of infectious diseases is ever present. Microbes will always be with us and we can never proclaim -- as we did in the 60s and 70s -- that the book on infectious diseases is closed,"" Leung said. ""It reminds us that human health and veterinary health are one and the same thing and we need to be constantly vigilant,"" he added. ""We are linked to animals not just by contact but also by the food chain and the latest horse meat scandal is a good illustration of that.""","Hong Kong housing estate Amoy Gardens was center of 2003 SARS outbreak .
