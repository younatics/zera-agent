"Paul Pogba scored a sensational volley as Juventus beat Napoli 3-1 at the Stadio San Paolo and earned revenge for their Super Cup defeat. Pogba's goal gave Juventus a first half lead before Miguel Britos equalised shortly after the hour mark. But Napoli's delight didn't last long as Martin Caceres reestablished the visitors' lead just five minutes later and Arturo Vidal added a third late on to seal the victory. The result takes Juventus three points clear of Roma at the top of the Serie A table while Napoli remain fourth, a point outside of the Champions League places.

Rafa Benitez's side should have taken the lead early in the first half but former Swansea midfielder Jonathan de Guzman somehow managed to miss the target despite being one-on-one with Gianluigi Buffon. Juventus struggled to create anything meaningful but in the 29th minute when a moment of brilliance from Pogba swung the tie in their favour. Carlos Tevez and strike partner Fernando Llorente combined well on the edge of the box and when the Argentine's shot ricocheted high into the air Pogba was waiting underneath to volley the ball past Rafael Cabral. Caceres could have doubled the Old Lady's lead late in the first half after a clever pass from Tevez found him in the box but he squandered the chance, hitting it straight at the Brazilian keeper. Napoli emerged after the break with a sense of energy and urgency previously absent in the encounter, and dominated play while the champions sat back. The equaliser came shortly after the hour mark when Britos volleyed in substitute Dries Mertens' corner. But it took less than five minutes for Juventus to re-take the lead. An Adrea Pirlo free-kick was met by defender Caceres who guided the ball past Cabral from eight yards out. Duvan Zapata and Gonzalo Higuain both had chances to equalise late on but it was the visitors who eventually found the net once more. Arturo Vidal found himself on the end of a ruthless counter attack and the Chilean rifled in a shot from outside the box to seal the victory.

"Aston Villa fans are proposing a large-scale protest in the Holte End for the visit of Liverpool to mark their frustration at the club’s direction. Three supporter websites are calling on match-goers with tickets in Villa Park’s famous stand to leave their seat vacant until eight minutes has elapsed. That timing reflects the number of full seasons Randy Lerner has owned the club, while leaving 82 minutes on the clock for supporters to back their team. Villa won the European Cup in 1982. Aston Villa supporters are set to stage a protest during their side's Premier League clash against Liverpool . Paul Lambert (centre) is coming under growing pressure from the club's fans following their poor run of form . An open letter has been posted on the www.thevillablog.co.uk, www.myoldmansaid.com, and www.avillafan.com and requests fans vote with their feet to make a statement. Villa have only scored 12 times in 23 games this season in all competitions – the lowest total of any in English football’s top four tiers. Paul Lambert’s side are 13th, three points above the relegation zone following a run of two wins in 17 league games. Now, read the open letter in full... Aston Villa and Leicester City players clash during their Premier League match at the King Power Stadium . This letter hasn’t been easy to write and it’s also taken time to decide if we should, but as Aston Villa supporters can we really go on any longer like this? Our three sites have come together to write this letter because there has been a lot of talk the last few days of protests. Add to that, unsavory scenes between Villa supporters in the stands at recent games, both at home and away, it’s now time to do something. As Villa supporters, we all want the same thing - We Want Our Villa Back. We believe there is no better way of showing the board how we feel than having an empty Holte End for the first eight minutes of the Liverpool match this weekend, one for the past eight seasons under the current regime. After the eight minutes then take your seat and support the team fully for the remaining 82 minutes, a number synonymous with Villa’s finest hour. Under the previous Chairman, when the Holte End wanted to be heard, Doug Ellis would hear and more often than not, he would act. In truth, he often acted before it got this bad. Our current owner can’t hear the Holte End as he’s sat thousands of miles away, so let him see it. We Want Our Villa Back . Why have we gone this far? For reasons only a few people know, Paul Lambert was awarded a new contract this season after two seasons of under achievement. But as it’s the decision of the Club to stick with the manager and in our role as supporters, knowing the owner isn’t going to change his mind while trying to sell the club, we have to play our part. However, things are not right at Aston Villa and it’s not just under Paul Lambert. There have been too many seasons of under achievement and this great Club and its supporters deserve better. It’s clear to the footballing world that things are not as they should be at Aston Villa and unless things change soon, the decline will continue. This is a peaceful demonstration followed up by good old fashioned Aston Villa support. This is a message that if absolutely everything is not done to drive Aston Villa forward, it’s possible that more supporters are going to leave the Holte End, but this time not come back. And if you’re reading this, you have a big part to play, even if you don’t sit in the Holte End. Download this letter, print as many copies as you can and hand it out to fellow Villans at Villa Park this weekend. And don’t forget to sign your name to it. Saturday is fundamentally a warning sign and we truly hope that by acting together as supporters, we’re demonstrating that our role is still one that should be considered very important by the Club. #WeWantOurVillaBack.","Supporters' groups urging fans to leave their seats empty for eight minutes .

"The original Jules Rimet trophy is pictured . A piece of the original World Cup trophy, which was stolen in Brazil in 1983 and never recovered, has been found in a basement at FIFA's headquarters. The base of the Jules Rimet trophy carries the names of the first four World Cup winners between 1930 and 1950. The trophy, which was handed to Brazil permanently after they won the world Cup for the third time in 1970, was also stolen three months before the 1966 World Cup was staged in England. That time, it was recovered a week later after being found in a south London hedge by a dog named Pickles. David Ausseil, the creative director of FIFA's museum which is due to open in March next year, said the trophy had been given a new base in 1954. 'We think no FIFA president has seen it since Jules Rimet himself,' he was quoted as saying by the BBC. The 10 centimetre high octagonal relic will be displayed in the museum. Rimet, the 'father' of the world Cup, was FIFA's president from 1921 to 1954. In the early 1970s, FIFA commissioned a new trophy for the 10th World Cup in West Germany in 1974. Fifty-three designs were submitted to FIFA by experts from seven countries, with the final choice being the work of Italian artist Silvio Gazzaniga. Unlike the previous trophy which was awarded to a country winning three world Cups, the current trophy remains in FIFA's possession but a replica is awarded to the three-time winners instead. The current base, made of two layers of semi-precious malachite, bears the engraved year and name of each World Cup winner since 1974.

"The TorrX pump will inflate footballs and other sports equipment to precisely the right pressure . From goal line monitoring technology to high-tech boots and cooling shirts, football has got smarter. Now there’s a pump called TorrX that automatically inflates footballs and other sports equipment to precisely the right pressure, in a bid to boost athletes’ performance and the quality of the game. The idea is that balls that are correctly inflated travel further and faster in a straighter line than balls that are under or over inflated. The TorrX electric pump will work on the same principle as a pump used to inflate car tyres so users can set the desired PSI (pounds per square inch), in order to keep balls at a specific hardness. The Seattle-based inventors of the pump are raising money to put it into production on crowd funding website Kickstarter. Users begin by pushing in the electric pump’s end cap in order to switch it on, which will reveal the needle, like a conventional pump. The needle can then be inserted into the ball’s air valve. The pump will read the ball's air pressure, displaying it on the device’s screen, in either BAR - which is equal to the atmospheric pressure on Earth - or PSI. Users who select manual mode, can then raise or lower the pressure of the air inside a ball by pressing the plus and minus buttons on the pump and feeling how well the ball is inflated. The TorrX electric pump will work on the same principle as a pump used to inflate car tyres so users can set the desired PSI (pounds per square inch), in order to keep balls at a specific hardness. The device shows the pressure of a ball and buttons can be used to manually increase or decrease the PSI (pictured) What: Smart ball pump that inflates or deflates balls to a precise pressure. Function: Three buttons allow balls to be inflated or deflated manually, or an automatic mode means equipment can be inflated to a set pressure. Display: The pump’s display shows a ball’s current and target pressure in either PSI or BAR. Battery: The pump contains a lithium-ion battery that can be fully recharged in 90 minutes using a Micro USB connection. Capacity: A full charge is enough to inflate 50 balls. Or, they could type in the desired pressure and press the 'A' button for the ball to inflate, or deflate to the desired hardness automatically, without the need for manual labour. The company said: ‘The TorrX smart ball pump makes every ball perfect so you can focus on your game.’ The electric pump contains a lithium-ion battery that can be recharged via a Micro USB cable. It can top up or inflate 50 balls, with one full charge, its inventors claim. They say it takes approximately 90 minutes to charge up fully. The pump is available to pre-order on Kickstarter from £32 ($49), while the planned RRP will be £52 ($80). The affordable pump is set to be of interest to many amateur players and coaches, because balls that are correctly inflated, travel further and faster in a straighter line than balls that are under or over inflated, improving the game . The 2014 World Cup in Brazil was the most scientific and technologically advanced football tournament ever seen. From smart clothing that keeps players cool, to advanced boots that enhance speed and skill, no stone was left unturned in providing the best experience for audiences and players alike. World Cup referees used a foam, water-based vanishing spray to mark out lines for a free kick, which disappeared shortly afterwards. The 2014 World Cup in Brazil was the most scientific and technologically advanced football tournament ever seen, and included products from smart clothing that kept players cool to advanced boots that enhanced speed and skill (as illustrated in this graphic) Goal line technology was supplied by German company Goal Control, who used seven high-speed cameras at each goal mouth to monitor the action. Used in every stadium, the system was able to tell the referee if a goal was scored within a second to an accuracy of 0.2 inches (0.5 centimetres), with the word 'GOAL' transmitted to a watch on the referee's wrist if the ball had crossed the line. Smart boots also played a role in creating some memorable goals. Nike created the Mercurial Superfly boot, for example, which was sported by Portugal star Cristiano Ronaldo and used a three-knit eave to put less material between the foot and the ball, enhancing the player's touch. Similarly, shirts were engineered to keep players cool in the stifling temperatures and a smart training ball by Adidas helped players in training to provide analysis on their techniques via an app.","TorrX pump is designed to inflate footballs to exactly the right pressure .

"South Korea overcame the loss of star winger Lee Chung-yong to move to the brink of reaching the Asian Cup quarter-finals with a 1-0 win over Kuwait on Tuesday. The South Koreans made seven changes from the line-up that opened with a 1-0 win over Oman, with injuries and illness forcing a reshuffle. Nam Tae-hee’s first-half header was enough to give two-time champions a second win and six points in Group A.

The replacements made heavy work of Kuwait, defeated 4-1 by Australia four days previously. The only goal of the game came eight minutes before half-time when Nam headed home a perfect Cha Du-ri cross. The second half was a tough one for the Koreans, who were on the back foot for the majority of it. A shot from Ali Al Maqseed hit the post early in the period and was a signal for an extended period of Kuwaiti pressure. Despite plenty of possession, pressure and chances, Kuwait couldn’t find a way past South Korea goalkeeper Kim Seung-gyu.

"The bone-crunching, bloody world of rugby might seem an unusual place to find a shining example of ‘new man’. But according to England star Ben Foden, his years on the pitch have given him the confidence to be hands-on with raising his children – especially when it comes to changing nappies. Now he is fronting a campaign urging parents to take advantage of a new law that lets them share time off work after having a child. Scroll down for video . Family man: Ben Foden on the pitch with his wife Una and their daughter Aoife last year. Now he is fronting a campaign urging parents to take advantage of a new law that lets them share their parental leave . Something which should be no problem for the £200,000-a-year Northampton Saints player and his pop star wife Una, whose girl band The Saturdays are said to be worth more than £2.5million. The Government drive sees the fullback call on other fathers to take more time off to ensure their wives’ earning potential isn’t hit by having a child. A law allowing parents to split time off after having a baby comes into force on April 5. It will mean that after an initial fortnight, they will be able to share the allowance of 50 weeks of leave and 37 weeks of pay. At the moment, men can take only two weeks off. Ben and Una - pictured when she was pregnant with Aoife in 2011 - are currently expecting their second child, they have one two year old daughter Aoife already . Foden, 29, and his 33-year-old wife have a two-year-old daughter, Aoife, and are expecting a son next month. The player expects some mocking for his role in the Government drive but believes rugby’s rough and tumble world has made him a better father. He said: ‘There will be some changing room banter. It’s part and parcel of being a rugby player. ‘But to be honest, this campaign is making me look a lot cooler than some other stuff. There are six or seven young dads in the team and we take it seriously. Being rugby players we are used to sweat, spit, blood and rolling around in the mud, so no one has a problem about getting their hands dirty changing nappies. ‘I do everything, all the nappy changing and feeding. I was there for Aoife’s first words and her first steps.’ Foden said the ‘new man’ approach is becoming increasingly common, even in the traditionally macho world of rugby. He added: ‘In this day and age, women can just as easily be the main breadwinner as men. Why should they have to give up their careers when they have children?’ Foden is already in a situation where his wife earns more than he does. Ben has been a hands on dad with his daughter Aoife and is encouraging other men to follow his example . Ben is a rugby player for the Northampton Saints and says he wishes  he could spend more time with Aoife . The five members of The Saturdays have had 13 top ten singles and were reported in 2012 to be collectively worth £2.6million. Exact figures for her earnings and wealth are not known but her schedule will vary on whether she is recording and touring with The Saturdays or working on a separate project or campaign. Besides the £200,000 a year that Foden is thought to earn from his club, for which he will train for five to six hours a day, he was reported in 2013 to earn £15,000 for each Six Nations match with England. Nick Clegg will this week encourage fathers to take advantage of the option to split leave. But a survey of 2,000 men and women by employment website Glassdoor found three-quarters of men opposed the change, fearing loss of status and earning power.","Northampton Saints player Ben, 29, says males need to be 'new men'

Researchers from Stanford University School of Medicine discovered that giving old mice blood from younger specimens resulted in a three-fold increase in the number of brain cells. They isolated the chemical eotaxin and discovered that injecting it into younger mice had the opposite effect, causing fewer brain cells to be produced. The research involved giving blood from younger mice to older specimens and vice versa . The team are now testing eotaxin's role in memory loss associated with Alzheimer's disease and hope their research might also prove useful in treating dementia. Tony Wyss-Coray, associate professor of neurology and neurological sciences at Stanford and the study's senior author, believes the findings raise the question of whether it might be possible to shield the human brain from aging. The experiment involved connecting the circulatory systems of pairs of young and old mice together. This produced changes in both brains, with the older mice producing more new nerve cells than would usually be expected. Dr Saul Villeda, one of the researchers involved in the study, said: 'With this technique, we could examine the effects of old mice's blood on young mice's brains, and vice versa.' His colleague Professor Tony Wyss-Coray explained: 'We saw a threefold increase in the number of new nerve cells being generated in old mice exposed to this 'younger' environment.' In contrast, the younger members of the pairs showed fewer new nerve cells in the brain that normal, reports journal Nature. Hopes: The team believe the research could provide a better understanding of memory loss in humans associated with Alzheimer's disease . To establish what was behind the changes, the scientists first looked an exchange of cells between the paired mice by highlighting cells and tracking their progress. But they were not found to effect the brains. With cell exchange ruled out, they looked at immune signaling proteins in the mice's blood, and found six which were present in both young mice paired with old mice and old mice on their own. At the top of the list was eotaxin, a small protein that attracts certain types of immune cells to areas where it has been secreted by other types of cells, and which, in humans, is associated with allergic responses and asthma. Tests the team carried out on blood and cerebrospinal fluid samples drawn from healthy people between the ages of 20 and 90 showed a parallel age-related increase in eotaxin. When normal young adult mice were given eotaxin injections into their brain, memory was imparied and fewer nerve cells were produced. Countering the effects if eotaxin could slow or reverse the ageing of the brain, say the researchers. A spokesman said: 'The group is now testing eotaxin's potential role in memory loss associated with Alzheimer's disease, and is developing expanded blood-protein assays in a hunt for 'rejuvenating' factors in blood that may prove useful in treating dementia and, perhaps, slowing the aging process in older brains.'",Groundbreaking research could provide a key to the treatment or prevention of Alzheimer's disease .
"Premier League soccer footballer James Ward-Prowse has been hailed a hero for helping his teenage sister battle alopecia. Emma Turner, 19, from Portsmouth, Hants, became one of the youngest people in Britain to be diagnosed with the hair-loss disease when she was just 16. Southampton midfielder James, 20, has a close relationship with Emma and would often spend hours searching for treatments that would help her come to terms with her illness. Scroll down for video . Emma Turner, 19, was diagnosed with alopecia at the age of 16 but doctors can't help her with a cure . She was one of the youngest people in Britain to be diagnosed with the hair-loss disease at the age of 16 . Southampton midfielder James Ward-Prowse spent hours helping his little sister research treatments . The teenager struggled to cope with the loss of her thick blond locks but when she spoke to her doctors, they failed to recommend any successful treatment or social groups for people with alopecia. Emma said: 'James is a very protective older brother and he is very sensitive about things. 'He is someone that I can always go to. I was feeling really down one day and he told me to come over and he sat with me for hours going through different treatments that I could try.' Emma would often go into panic after finding clumps of hair about the size of a pound coin in the shower and doctors diagnosed it as alopecia areata - sporadic hair loss from the head caused by stress. Emma said: 'When I was diagnosed I didn't really know what it was and I had to do some research to fully understand my condition. 'I was given steroids to try over the first couple of months and then I was given the option to go on oral treatment but these had side effects such as weight gain and hormone change. She wears a wig most of the time to remain in touch with her 'inner girl' but feels relieved to remove it . Emma's mother Jackie Ward-Prowse has set up  a support group for alopecia sufferers after their experience . 'It was at that point that I realised that I was going to have to get over it as it was likely that I might never be cured.' Emma would experience the excitement of seeing her hair grow back again, only for it to be followed by the crashing disappointment when her hair fell out just days later. She now wears a wig so to cover her bald patches and reclaim her 'inner girl'. Animal care student Emma said: 'I had to pin my hair down to the bold patches and some days this was really difficult. All I wanted to do was style my hair like any teenage girl would want to. 'When I first started wearing a wig I had embarrassing moment with my boyfriend. I was driving down the motorway in my soft top car and the wind made my wig slip and it started to come off it was so funny. Emma took steroids after her diagnosis but side effects like weight gain and hormone change made her stop . 'Now I forget that I even wear a wig. I still won't go out much without it on but when I am in college my friends always encourage me to take it off when it starts to irritate me. 'I have a close group of friends which makes it easier when I want to take my wig off. Sometimes you do get people who stare but it doesn't bother me.' Emma and James's mum Jackie Ward-Prowse admits she found it difficult to come to terms with her daughter's condition but has now set up a support group to help fellow sufferers. Jackie said: 'I felt racked with guilt as I thought I might have given it to her and it took me a while to get over this feeling. 'After a while I realised Emma was a healthy and happy girl and that was all that mattered. Premier league footballer Jamie is a 'typical protective older brother' says his loving younger sister . 'Emma and I found it difficult to find information on this condition and I felt the doctors didn't provide much support and advice. 'We found lots of information on the Alopecia UK website and it was such a relief to finally understand the condition. 'It was then that I set up an alopecia group which allows people to come along and talk about their symptoms and issues that they've had. 'Since having this group I've seen Emma fully come to terms with her condition and it feels great that we can help other people in a similar situation.'

"Nasa's vast SLS rocket, which will launch payloads of upto 130 tonnes into orbit and could make its first flight in 2017. It is set to become the largest rocket ever built, dwarfing the rockets that took man to the moon and paving the way for manned missions to Mars. Nasa today reveal stunning new pictures of its SLS (Space Launch System), which will eventually be capable of lifting 130 tonnes into orbit. The rocket will be used to ferry astronauts to the International Space Station, and to help us explore the outer reaches of the solar system. It is even hoped the craft could play a role in manned missions to Mars, being able to launch 'stepping stone' bases into orbit. 'The potential use of SLS for science will further enhance the synergy between scientific exploration and human exploration,' said John Grunsfeld, astronaut and associate administrator for science at NASA Headquarters in Washington. 'SLS has the promise of enabling transformational science in our exploration of the solar system and cosmos.' Currently under construction, NASA’s Space Launch System will be the world’s most powerful launch vehicle. Designed to enable human exploration missions to deep space destinations, including an asteroid and Mars, SLS is working toward a first launch in 2017. For that first flight test, the rocket will be able to launch 70 metric tons (77 tons) of payload into low-Earth orbit, almost three times what the space shuttle could carry. From there, SLS will be evolved to a configuration that will be able to carry 130 metric tons (143 tons), more weight than any rocket ever has been able to carry. 'While many people think of the Space Launch System in terms of human exploration, SLS could have a wide application in a lot of other areas, including space science,” said Steve Creech, assistant program manager for strategy and partnerships for SLS. How it compares: The SLS is larger than the Saturn rockets than launched man to the Moon. It will also be more powerful than any rocket in operation today. Russia's super-rocket design has yet to be unveiled. However construction of the first stage of Russia's super-rocket - capable of lifting 80 tonnes - is already underway . Nasa's previous rockets, the Saturn, Shuttle and right, the smaller configuration of the new SLS . There will be two versions of the rocket. The smaller, 70-metric-ton SLS will stand 321 feet tall, provide 8.4 million pounds of thrust at liftoff, weigh 5.5 million pounds and carry 154,000 pounds of payload. The massive 130-metric-ton-configuration will be the most capable, powerful launch vehicle in history. Towering a staggering 384 feet tall, it will provide 9.2 million pounds of thrust at liftoff and weigh 6.5 million pounds. It will be able to carry payloads weighing 286,000 pounds to orbit. 'For missions to the outer planets, for example, SLS could make it possible to do things that are currently impossible, such as sending larger scientific spacecraft with more instruments to far off destinations with reduced transit times.' Agency scientific and engineering teams have been evaluating whether there would be potential benefits from launching deep space robotic spacecraft, such as the Europa Clipper, a proposed mission to one of Jupiter's icy moons, on the SLS rocket, and determined the rocket would enable the spacecraft to fly direct trajectories to our solar system’s outer planets, rather than using planetary gravities to gain speed, reducing transit time compared to current launch vehicles. In the case of the Europa Clipper, for example, the transit time would be reduced to less than half of what it would be using other launch vehicles. 'For as long as people have been launching rockets into space, mission designers have had to work within certain limitations – a spacecraft can only be so heavy and it has to fit within a certain width,” Creech said. 'Depending on how large you make it, it can only go so fast, which in some cases limits where you can go. 'Today, if you want to send a mission to the outer planets, you have to be able to make it fit within that box. With SLS, we’re about to make that box much larger. An artist's impression of the giant rocket taking off . An artist's impression of the vast hanger needed to set the rocket up for flight . 'With the space shuttle, for example, we were able to launch missions like NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope that were about the size of a school bus. 'With SLS, you can design a spacecraft even larger than the space shuttle that carried Hubble. 'It’s going to open up an entirely new way of thinking about how we plan and design planetary science missions.' 'The Space Launch System could be really game-changing for space science,” said ACO manager Reggie Alexander. 'For some missions, it makes it much easier and quicker to carry them out. 'A Mars sample return mission, for example, could be flown using only one rocket instead of three. 'But for other destinations, SLS lets you do things we could only dream of before – like collecting samples from the geysers of Saturn’s moon Enceladus.' The top section of the rocket .

"Because they're dying: Dave Agema (R-MI) claimed that gays only wants free health care because they are dying of AIDS . A prominent Michigan Republican told a packed room last week that gays and lesbians want free health care because they are dying from AIDS. Dave Agema, a former state representative and currently one of the state’s reps to the Republican National Committee, made the remarks at the Berrien County Republican Party’s annual holiday reception. This is not the first time the gay bashing politician has found himself in hot water for homophobic comments, according to the Washington Post. ‘Folks, they (gay people) want free medical because they're dying (when they're) between 30 and 44 years old,’ he said, according to the Herald-Palladium. ‘To me, it's a moral issue, it's a Biblical issue,’ he continued. ‘Traditional marriage is where it should be and it's in our platform. Those in our party who oppose traditional marriage are wrong.’ The controversial stance, he explained, comes from his observations of gay co-workers at American Airlines claiming AIDS-infected people were their spouses so they could receive health insurance. ‘I stand for traditional marriage, no homosexual ones,’ he proclaimed. Mr Agema’s remarks came during a speech urging the different factions of the Republican Party to come together. In April, the conservative politician shared an article to his Facebook page accusing gays of living a ‘filthy lifestyle,’ as well as prodding Christians to help them ‘get out of it,’ the Post noted. ‘We ought to be saying to these people, ‘Hey, we don’t agree with your lifestyle and we’ll help you get out of it,’ he also told a conservative radio show the same month, according to the Post. He continued, saying that children are being brainwashed in school to think homosexuality is okay, according to the Post. ‘The next thing that will occur is your kids will come home and say, ‘I think this is a good thing and I think I want to be one.’","Dave Agema, a former state representative, made the remarks during a speech at a holiday gathering .

"It may be a la mode to create lighter versions of our favourite snacks but one company has taken the trend rather literally. The world's first glow in the dark ice cream was handed out to a cinema audience who were surprised to find their snacks glowed a fluorescent yellow when the lights went out. The film fanatics were treated to the inventive ice cream at the Vue Cinema in Leicester Square ahead of a screening of Simon Pegg's film The World's End. Scroll down for video . Customers at the Vue Cinema in Leicester Square were surprised when their Cornettos lit up once the lights went out . The futuristic frozen treat has been developed for Wall's Ice Cream by food designers Bompas and Parr. The sci-fi style snack appears to be nothing more than a normal mint Cornetto however once under UV lighting the sweet treat lights up in luminous colours. According to Wall's this is a world first and means that cinema goers can avoid a sticky spillages as they are able to see what they're eating even in the dark. Out of this world: The ice cream was developed by Bompas and Parr for Wall's Ice Cream . Wall's wanted to develop a frozen treat that customers would be able to see even in the dark . In order to create the gleaming gelato the ice cream is mixed with riboflavin which gives out a glow when under certain UV lights. Despite the fact that mobile phones are banned in cinema theatres as the light they give out provides a distraction, Bompas and Parr insist that the ice creams won't create the same problem. 'The team at Cornetto wanted to make a cinema-based snack that you can eat and still see in the cinema without disrupting the film so we worked on it, and have come up with this ice cream, which is something we have been experimenting with for a long time.' The ice cream is created by mixing it with riboflavin which immits a glow when under certain UV lights . Bompas and Parr say that despite their bright glow the ice creams shouldn't distract from the film . The team at Bompas have since been developing further glow in the dark desserts using luciferin enzymes from genetically modified bacteria. 'This is something quite special,' Bompas told Dezeen magazine 'Using the same enzyme that fireflies and jellyfish use to fluoresce - that we use to make a fancy sauce for the dessert.' Although a fluorescent pudd may seem anything other than natural the team insist that it is a completely wholesome process...sort of, saying: 'It's totally organic and natural, if you're okay with genetically modified organisms.'","Wall's Ice Cream have developed a luminous frozen treat .

"On a bright, spring morning in 1991, a young doctor made an emergency visit to a new patient on New York’s monied Upper East Side. He rode up to the eighth floor in a mahogany-panelled elevator with a uniformed doorman who admitted him to a murky 40ft hallway. A single candle lit paintings by Renoir, Degas, Manet and Monet. In the gloom, Dr Singman came face-to-face with a frail and frightened woman in a soiled bathrobe. Untreated cancers had eaten away the left part of her lower lip and right cheek. Deep ulcers beneath her right eye exposed her orbital bone. Cut off from the world: Huguette Clark chose to spend the last twenty years of her life in a hospital room . At 85, Huguette Clark had outlived her favourite doctors and hadn’t dared trust anybody new until she felt close to death. Dr Singman sent her straight to Manhattan’s Doctors Hospital. And though she made an excellent recovery, she never returned to her regal quarters — or to her lavish mansions in Connecticut and California — preferring to spend the next 20 years and two months in a cell-like room overlooking the hospital’s industrial air-conditioning unit. This fascinating biography by journalist Bill Dedman and Huguette’s nephew Paul Clark Newell Jr never really gets to the bottom of this exceptionally healthy and wealthy woman’s strange decision to spend her last two decades in minimalist medical seclusion. But it tells a gripping rags-to-riches tale of the heady accumulation and weird dispersal of one of America’s greatest fortunes — allowing readers a good gawp through the gilded keyhole, before reassuring them that too much gold can turn life pretty cold. Huguette Clark was the daughter of W. A. Clark: a red-whiskered entrepreneur who was born in a Pennsylvanian log-cabin. He turned his first significant profit in the 1860s, selling supplies to gold-rush prospectors, but made his big bucks in mining just as copper was becoming the essential conductor of modern life — used in the new telegraph cables, light bulbs and full metal jacket bullets. By the early 1900s, he may well have been the wealthiest man in America, for while oilman John D. Rockefeller had more cash in the bank, the ‘Copper King’ had more assets under the ground. The question this book poses is: did his vast wealth leave his family a poisonous legacy? While his contemporary Andrew Carnegie believed life should be divided into three stages, namely education, making money and giving it away, Clark never reached that third stage. When he died in 1925, he left an estate estimated at $100-$250 million ($3.4 billion, or £2 billion today) and only $600,000 to charity. The rest went to family, with one fifth going to his youngest child, 18-year-old Huguette. The second daughter of Clark’s second marriage — to a 28-year-old French Canadian when he was 67 — Huguette (pronounced Ooo-get) was born in Paris but raised in the largest house in New York: 121 rooms for the family of four. The Copper King: Huguette and her father, W.¿A. Clark - one of the wealthiest men in America in the 1900s - pictured in 1912 . The little girls raced up and down the white marble staircase, played hide-and-seek among the marbled columns leading to the sculpture hall, sat beneath its 36ft octagonal dome and hurtled past the Borgias’ pottery collection (painted with brushes made of mouse whiskers) to the music of a cathedral-scale organ. They were only forbidden to run in the Grand Salon, decorated with oak from Sherwood forest and a clock from Marie Antoinette’s boudoir. Huguette’s older sister Andrée was the more outgoing of the two but died suddenly of meningitis just before her 17th birthday, leaving a diary that revealed she’d been unhappy in her gilded cage until she’d been allowed to join the Girl Scouts at 16. She wrote: ‘Scouting has been a hand in the dark to me. It has changed me from a moody, thoughtless girl, and has shown me what life may be.’ A fairy castle doll's house built by Colleen Moore costs £4.1million . Bereft of her beloved sister, Huguette’s introversion increased. She never joined the Scouts, and flummoxed classmates — who couldn’t work out if she was arrogant or embarrassed by her father’s political scandals and social climbing. After his death, she stayed at home with her kind but reserved mother, talking in French so that friends and servants wouldn’t understand them. Then, even her mother was shut out as Huguette’s passion for painting and dollhouses grew. Although attractive, Huguette showed little interest in men. There might have been a crush on an art teacher — and she was married, at 22, to the son of her father’s accountant. But the union, possibly arranged by her mother, lasted only nine months. Her family suspected she was unwilling to consummate her vows, while others speculated she was just too caught up in her art. As paintings sold at Christie’s last month reveal, Huguette was a talented artist, excelling with oils at a time when women were expected to stick to pastels. Recluse: Huguette spent her final decades in a tiny hospital room, watching The Smurfs on TV . Whatever the truth of it, she continued to write to her ex-husband using the same polite-but-distant tone she used with almost everybody. From Andrée’s death until her own, Huguette’s closest and most enduring attachments appear to have been with her dolls. She lavished all her time and money on them — commissioning $80,000 dollhouses and Dior doll dresses while ignoring pleas for funds from an orphanage founded by her father. As she grew older, she treated her real houses like toys, insisting the table remained set for her at the Californian estate she did not visit in more than 50 years, and turning her New York bedroom into an exact replica of her mother’s. Although this book makes a compassionate and psychologically subtle effort to rescue the heiress from the reductive clichés of reclusive eccentricity, her life still reads as sad and stunted. Despite an incredible property portfolio and remarkable good health, a woman worth $300 million spent her final decades in a tiny hospital room, leafing through snapshots of her Barbie dolls and watching The Smurfs on TV. She also doled out more than $31 million in gifts to a dedicated but arguably unethical nurse, while the family’s lawyers circled. It is telling that Huguette’s favourite fairy tale was Rapunzel. She commissioned many dollhouses to act out the story. But with a lifelong suspicion that people were only after her money, the Copper King’s daughter spent her life building her own prison towers, and never dared let down her hair.","Huguette Clark was the daughter of W. A.

Passions threatened to spill over in extra time when Mark Noble started finger-pointing at his own team-mate James Tomkins and the pair had to be separated by Kevin Nolan. 'It was handbags,' Allardyce reasoned. 'They're such big buddies you'd find it difficult for them but they must've been passionate about something. Obviously one opinion was disagreed by the other one. 'I don't know what it was but there's no doubt it will not hang over us after we've won.' West Ham pair Mark Noble (centre) and James Tomkins argue with each other during extra time . Noble (second right) and Tomkins (right) square up to each other as tensions rise on Tuesday night . Centre-back James Collins was commanding at the back and would've been man-of-the match had it not been for Kevin Mirallas coming from the bench to change the game, scoring the late free kick to level the game, after Enner Valencia put West Ham ahead, and setting up Romelu Lukaku in extra time for a tap-in. That was still not enough when Carlton Cole came on and forced in an equaliser. 'Collins nearly didn't play,' Allardyce revealed. 'He was feeling his calf a little bit and Winston Reid was not available with injury.' In a recent interview with Sportsmail, Adrian explained why his cool finish to the tie was perhaps not such a surprise to him. 'I was an outfield player before I was a goalkeeper,' he said. 'I played up front until I was 10 and I loved to score goals but when my Under 11 team CD Altair lost their goalkeeper and the coach asked: 'Who wants to go in goal?' I said I didn't mind while we looked for a new keeper — 18 years on I'm still in goal!' Adrian scores the penalty that seals victory for West Ham in the third round replay . Everton goalkeeper Joel Robles (right) can do nothing to stop Adrian's penalty hitting the back of the net . A clearly devastated Roberto Martinez was left frustrated with referee Neil Swarbrick for only awarding a free kick when Mirallas appeared to be fouled in the box by Tomkins with his side 2-1 ahead. 'It's just disappointing that Mirallas was given a free kick outside box and clearly it's in the box,' the Everton manager said. 'There is no justification how the referee has not seen it. The linesman should've seen the action in the box.'","West Ham beat Everton 9-8 on penalties in the FA Cup third round replay .

"The specs for Samsung's new Galaxy S5 have leaked online - and it's claimed the handset will come in both metal and plastic versions. The handset, which is is expected to have a 5.25inch screen and iris scanning to recognise users without a password, will also have a new superfast Snapdragon processor. There will also be a mini version of the S5, and a camera version called the Zoom, according to the Sammobile web site. Scroll Down for Video . Seeing double: Two version of the S5 are expected to go on sale in April, a metal and a plastic version . The handset is expected to be announced in February, and go on sale worldwide in April . Source: Sammmobile . First, let’s get the most mysterious thing about the Galaxy S5 out of the way: Yes, it will come in both metal and plastic versions as has been rumored, with the metal version costing around 800 Euros ($1080) and the plastic model coming in at around 650 Euros ($880),' the site says. The move is identical to Apple's decision to launch a plastic iPhone 5C alongside its flagship 5S model last year. The site also claims to have an almost complete set of specs for the handset. 'As expected, the Galaxy S5 will sport an AMOLED display of 2,560×1,440 resolution; we were unable to confirm the size, though it should be around 5.25-inches as has been rumored often.' It is also expected to be the first mass market mobile to use a new super-fast Exynos 6 Snapdragon 805 processor, which could give the handset a major speed boost. It could also allow the handset to run in 64bit mode - although the site believes that, again like Apple, only the metal version will do this. Recent reports also claimed the handset could feature an iris scanning system designed to recognise users without the need for a password. It will also boost a 16MP rear camera, and run KitKat, the latest version of Google's Android software. Speaking at the Consumer Electronics Show in Vegas last week, Lee Young Hee announced that the firm is looking to release its next flagship phone between March and April - and admitted it will be called the Galaxy S5. Lee also discussed the possibility a future model of the phone could feature iris recognition technology, yet did not confirm if it would be added to S5 or not. Rumours have suggested Samsung is working on a follow-up to its Galaxy Gear smartwatch since last year, too, and this could be unveiled at the same time as the S5. Lee told Bloomberg: We’ve been announcing our first flagship model in the first half of each year, around March and April, and we are still targeting for release around that time. ‘When we release our S5 device, you can also expect a Gear successor with more advanced functions, and the bulky design will also be improved.’ Lee is referring to the criticism the watch received when it went on sale in September last year. Biometric experts at New York-based firm EyeLock have created a dongle fitted with an iris scanner. The Myris device can register up to five different users. Each user begins by scanning their eyes to take an image of their respective irises. These unique images are then translated into an encrypted code. The scan takes between 10 and 20 seconds and the authentication code is created immediately. Once registered, each user can add various online passwords to their Myris profile. Next time the user visits one of these accounts, instead of entering a password, they can scan their eyes for immediate and secure access. According to EyeLock, the False Acceptance Rate of the average fingerprint sensor, in which the system is hacked by an unknown print, is one in every 10,000 scans.  For iris scans, this increases to one 1 in 2.25 trillion scans. Myris is set to go on sale before the summer and will cost around $250 (£150) although an exact date and price is yet to be announced. Some analysts claimed the Korean firm had rushed the production of the gadget in order to beat Apple to releasing a smartwatch, and the design suffered. However, Apple has still not announced its rumoured iWatch. Regarding the iris recognition technology, Lee said during Samsung’s press event at the Consumer Electronics Show: ‘Many people are fanatical about iris recognition technology and we are studying the possibility but can’t really say whether we will have it or not on the S5.’ Samsung is said to be working on adding biometric technology to a future model to rival the popular fingerprint scanner on Apple’s iPhone 5S. Samsung is said to be working on adding biometric technology to a future model in its Galaxy range of smartphones and tablets to rival the popular fingerprint scanner on Apple's iPhone 5S, pictured . Samsung is also set to unveil a second-generation Galaxy Gear, original model is pictured, along with the S5 at Mobile World Congress in February . Iris scanning is more secure than fingerprint scanning, and the technology involved is cheaper, making it a more obvious choice to add to future models. Iris scanning involves a simple charge-coupled device digital camera that uses visible and near-infrared light to take a clear, high-contrast image of a person’s iris. When the camera takes the image, a scanner plots the centre of the pupil, edge of the pupil, edge of the iris, eyelids and eyelashes. It then analyses the unique patterns in the iris and translates this pattern into a code. Next time the eye is scanned, this code is compared to the pattern to authenticate a match. The iris scanner would not be the first time Samsung has introduced eye-tracking technology. Its Galaxy S4 includes a feature that locks onto the movement and position of a user’s eyes. The phone can analyse where the user is looking and will automatically scroll a web page when the eyes reach the bottom of the screen, for example, or lock the screen when the user looks away. Both of Samsung's new devices are expected to be unveiled during Mobile World Congress in Barcelona in February. They will likely then go on sale in Korea in March, before being rolled out worldwide in April. Samsung is set to release its next flagship phone - the Galaxy S5 - between March and April. The Korean firm also hinted that either the S5, or a future model, could be fitted with an iris scanner, stock photo of an iris is pictured, that would be used to unlock the device .","S5 is expected to be unveiled during Mobile World Congress in February .

"A girl who'd been playing football since she was in kindergarten arduously fought with a Catholic league to continue playing after they tried to ban her from the 'boys sport' on moral grounds. Now she and her mother are pushing back again along with thousands of supporters to force the league to allow girls to participate indefinitely. When then fifth grader Caroline Pla of Philadelphia was told she could no longer play on the team in 2013 she made headlines with a change.org petition that convinced the archbishop to overturn the no girls rule-with an exception. Pla, now 13, was able to play her last season but the archbishop banned all girls from playing in the future citing safety and 'Catholic morality’ as concerns. Making waves:  Caroline Pla had been playing co-ed football since joining a flag football team in kindergarten and continued to fight the catholic league to let her play against boys . On the field: Caroline Pla (10), center, played in a Catholic Youth Organization league football game all throughout middle school . Caroline Pla and her mother Seal Pla created another change.org petition just last week demanding that all girls be able to play football if a sports coach sees fit. So far they have 15,000 signatures in just one week. 'Preparation for Christian adulthood likewise involves the development and encouragement of appropriate, dignified and respectful forms of contact between male and female students. The [Arch]Diocese therefore believes that it is incompatible with its religious mission and with its effort to teach Gospel values to condone competitions between young men and women in sports that involve substantial and potentially immodest physical contact.' Consequently, the [Arch]Diocese has adopted this policy prohibiting co-ed participation in the following sports: wrestling, tackle football and tackle rugby,' said the Catholic organization. Seal said that while her daughter was playing football, a traditionally male sport, she was bigger than some of the other boys on her team. This petition comes at a time when 1,600 girls already play high school football across the country, according to the National Federation of State High School Associations. 'As they got older I noticed that they’re not going to put someone out there who isn’t capable of doing the job or getting hurt,' Seal Pla told Yahoo Sports. In action: Caroline Pla,  carries the ball during a Catholic Youth Organization league football game . 'Moving forward the boys are just going to get bigger. It’s like any sport, you get weeded out after a while. But for CYO, from 5th-8th grade, she was bigger than a lot of the boys.' Pla is not just bigger than the boys she's a big inspiration for other girl who hope to follow in her footsteps. Another girls who dared to fight for their right to play is Shelby Osborne who the first female defensive back to sign a letter of intent to play college football. Ashley Brown hired a lawyer to fight the CYO league's rule in 2004, but she was unsuccessful. Now 11 years later the Pla family wants to make sure no girl will ever be turned down from playing football again. 'I'm just fighting for others. I feel like I have to be the voice that fights for the people,' she told ABC.","Caroline Pla and her mother Seal Pla have 15,000 signatures in just one week on a petition against a Catholic league that bans girl players .

"Alexis Sanchez's dynamic performances are inspiring the other Arsenal players to raise their own game, according to midfielder Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. Chile forward Sanchez was again the Gunners' talisman against Stoke on Sunday, scoring twice and setting up the opener in the 3-0 victory which moved Arsene Wenger's side to within a point of fourth-placed Manchester United. The work-rate of the South American has been impressive since completing a £32million summer move from Barcelona, and England international Oxlade-Chamberlain revealed the rest of the squad are determined not to let their own high standards slip. Alexis Sanchez celebrates after scoring his second goal in Arsenal's 3-0 defeat of Stoke . The Chilean has been in sensational form since arriving from Barcelona - scoring 12 goals in 19 league games . 'When you see someone working hard from the front and maybe if they close three players down and don't win the ball back, then you are not there to back him up, you do have to look at yourself and think 'why was I not there to help my team-mate out?' It does set the tone for the rest of the team,' said Oxlade-Chamberlain. 'If the boys up front react quickly when we lose the ball, it brings the midfield with them, full-backs and the defenders to switch from attack to defence. It is something that we work hard on. 'Alexis does it better than anyone I have seen. He has come from Barcelona, and it is a strong philosophy that they play by, so maybe he has picked that up there and brought that to us in every game he has played. 'There are definitely a lot of boys learning from him.' Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain (left) says the forward's workrate has made players raise their game at Arsenal . Victory at the Emirates saw the Gunners move to within a point of the top four . As well as producing a devastating offensive display, which saw goalkeeper Asmir Begovic make a number of top-class saves, the Gunners also retained a solid formation, something which had been distinctly lacking when they went down 3-2 away at Stoke in early December. Oxlade-Chamberlain said: 'That is a quality which every side that finishes up the table needs to have, because you can't always play the way you want to play, sometimes you have to roll your sleeves up, be physical and win the duels. On Sunday, we did that. 'I definitely think in the game away at Stoke we lacked that and that is why we came out with a loss. 'That is always at the back of your mind, so we need to take that approach every game because once we match teams physically and defending-wise, it gives us a good chance. 'We know in our team we have got the quality going forward to cause teams damage, so it is always important to make sure we match teams physically and do the dirty stuff as well.' Goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny has accepted being dropped with 'great professionalism' Szczesny's replacement David Ospina kept a clean sheet but had very few saves to make . Goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny was left on the bench against Stoke, with Colombia international David Ospina given a Premier League debut. It remains to be seen whether manager Wenger will recall Szczesny for the trip to Manchester City next week, although it was maintained Sunday's decision was not based on any disciplinary action in the wake of negative headlines over the Poland international smoking in the showers following the defeat at Southampton. Oxlade-Chamberlain felt the 24-year-old had handled the situation with great professionalism. He said: 'I haven't seen any difference in Wojciech. He is always a big part of our squad. He is always a character around the dressing room and he has been no different this week.'","Alexis Sanchez scored twice in Arsenal's defeat of Stoke on Sunday .

"Arsenal midfielder Santi Cazorla wants to keep his place at the heart of the Gunners midfield after his recent purple patch of form, despite the return of club record signing Mesut Ozil to the squad. The 30-year-old has scored four goals and assisted twice since being deployed in a central role from the beginning of December. His fine festive form earned the Spaniard the Premier League Player of the Month award in December, as he believes he can make more of an impact in the middle of the park and is optimistic he can keep up his recent form.

'I always can help the team and I love when I play in the middle.' Cazorla has made 30 appearances for the Gunners this season and hopes his current form can hold down a central spot in midfield having created 47 chances for his team-mates, a stat only bettered by Alexis Sanchez, but will have increased competition with the return of Ozil from a knee injury. 'I want to continue to play at this level for the rest of the season. I always want to help the team with goals,' added Cazorla. 'I hope to score more until the end of the season.

"Liverpool will have all their attacking talent for the second half of the season after Mario Balotelli and Fabio Borini's agents confirmed they would not leave the club and photographic evidence emerged signalling Daniel Sturridge's imminent return. Sturridge has not played for the club since the 3-0 defeat of Tottenham in August but looks finally ready to return to a forward line that has wilted in his absence. Team-mate Jordan Henderson posted a photo of the former Chelsea striker online, and said: 'Good to see this man back!' Jordan Henderson posted a photo online with Daniel Sturridge, who is returning from a spell on the sidelines . Sturridge's last game for Liverpool came in their 3-0 defeat of Tottenham in August 2014 . Without Raheem Sterling, who was given a short break by manager Brendan Rodgers, Borini was preferred to his fellow countryman Balotelli in Saturday's victory at Sunderland but neither are likely to feature prominently in the remainder of the season. However, despite both being linked with moves back to Italy the agents of Balotelli and Borini insist that will not happen. '[Balotelli] has a contract with Liverpool and can't really be offered to other clubs,' agent Mino Raiola told Mediaset Premium. 'He chose to leave Italy and was aware of what he was leaving; he hasn't had the success he was hoping for, but he still needs time. 'Juventus have denied their interest in him, and I have had absolutely no contact with Inter (Milan), so that's the current situation now.' The England forward poses for a photo with Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard . Brendan Rodgers started Fabio Borini up front against Sunderland after sending Raheem Sterling on holiday . Borini's representative Marco de Marchi has also denied his player will be leaving Anfield. 'Borini will not return to Italy in January,' he told SportItalia. 'He is happy with Liverpool, the club he is playing for.' Rodgers expects there to be little or no business done in this transfer window with any departures likely to be loans for players who have not had much pitch time. His injury list is easing with defender Jon Flanagan set to return soon having not featured since the end of last season because of a knee injury. The 22-year-old, who has been used on both the left and right side of defence by Rodgers, is out of contract in the summer and increased competition in those areas - Javier Manquillo and Alberto Moreno both arrived last summer - presents a challenge for him in the next couple of months. Mario Balotelli came on as a second half substitute against Sunderland at the Stadium of Light . Balotelli will not return to Italy in January, according to the forward's agent . 'When I saw that we signed two full-backs, I immediately thought 'I need to up my game now',' he told the Official Liverpool Magazine. 'I know I need to consistently do well if I'm to get in the team and then stay there. 'I want to keep developing as a footballer, that's why not being available has been so frustrating, but competition for places doesn't bother me. I'm always up for the fight. 'I've been out for what has felt like a really long time. I've got in the team before and kept my place. Now I need to do that again.' There has been no update on the fitness of captain Steven Gerrard, who was withdrawn as a precaution at half-time at Sunderland due to tightness in his hamstring.","Daniel Sturridge has not played for Liverpool since August .

"Months after the death of the Mars rover Spirit, its surviving twin has reached the rim of a vast crater to begin its final and most important exploration. Opportunity will now examine rocks older than any it has seen in its seven years on the surface of the red planet, Nasa scientists said last night. The solar-powered, six-wheel rover arrived at the 14mile-wide Endeavour crater after driving 13miles from a smaller crater named Victoria. Final destination: After trundling across Mars for three years, Opportunity images a portion of the west rim of Endeavour crater where it arrived late on Tuesday, scientists said last night . The rover will now examine rocks older than any it has seen in its seven years on the surface of the red planet . Opportunity and its twin Spirit landed on opposite sides of Mars in 2004 and used their instruments to discover geologic evidence that the cold, dusty planet was once wet . The journey, which took nearly three . years culminated on Tuesday when Opportunity signalled it had arrived at . the location dubbed Spirit Point in honour of the rover's twin, which . fell silent last year. 'We're there,' said project manager John Callas of Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Opportunity and Spirit landed on . opposite sides of Mars in 2004 and used their instruments to discover . geologic evidence that the cold and dusty planet was once wet. Craters can provide windows into the planet's past because layers of material from long-ago eras are exposed. The journey, which took nearly three years culminated on Tuesday when Opportunity signalled it had arrived at the location dubbed Spirit Point in honour of the rover's twin, which fell silent last year . Explorer: An artist's impression of what Opportunity looks like as it trundles across the Martian surface (left) and this image on the right was taken as it made its way to the Red Planet's vast Endeavour crater  last month . Mr Callas said the plan is to drive a bit closer to the rim to take pictures of the oldest rocks seen by Opportunity. He said: 'This is a brand new mission.' Since landing, Opportunity has studied sulphate sediments that pointed to an environment that was once wetter and warmer. 'Now we have rocks that pre-date that,' Mr Callas said. The rover's work is part of Nasa's . Mars Exploration Program strategy known as 'follow the water', which . looks for evidence that liquid water once existed or perhaps still . exists on the planet. Liquid water is considered essential for the potential for some form of life to have developed. Almost there: Opportunity used its panoramic camera to capture this view of a portion of Endeavour crater's rim last week after a drive during the rover's 2,676th day of working on Mars . Last week, research based on . observations by Nasa's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter theorised that dark, . finger-like features that appear in spring and summer on some Martian . slopes then fade in winter could be flows of briny water. Saltiness . would be necessary to lower the freezing temperature of water. A big, new Nasa rover named Curiosity . is awaiting launch from Cape Canaveral, Florida, on a $2.5billion . mission to explore a towering mountain inside a 96mile-wide crater to . determine if there were once conditions capable of supporting microbial . life.

"News travels quickly in football these days, and rumours travel even quicker. So it was that Twitter declared on Sunday evening that Radamel Falcao had not stayed at Old Trafford to watch Manchester United lose to Southampton after being excluded from Louis van Gaal’s squad. As it happened, that was quite wrong. Falcao watched with United defender Marcos Rojo from a private box and then mingled in the players’ tunnel at full-time. Another social media whirlwind becalmed by some rather less exciting truths. Nevertheless, the issue of where Falcao will be next season, rather than where he was on Sunday, remains increasingly pertinent. Certainly, you wouldn’t put any decent amount of money on the £280,000-a-week loanee being retained as things stand. Radamel Falcao has struggled at Man United and there are doubts the striker will remain at Old Trafford . The Manchester United loanee has scored just three goals in eight starts having joined the club from Monaco . The bald statistics of the Colombian’s stay at United so far read: Played (started) 8; Scored: 3. With half the season gone already, both of those numbers are going to have to shoot skywards if United’s executives are going to press the button on a permanent deal with Monaco that stands to cost them in excess of £40million in transfer fee alone this summer. Certainly United manager Van Gaal has his own doubts about the 28-year-old, doubts that he harboured long before he chose to remove him from his squad of 18 after his players’ final training session at Carrington on Saturday. Sportsmail revealed back at the start of winter that Van Gaal was already wondering about the South Americans’ physical durability and, despite a recent return to action after some muscle issues, those reservations remain. Falcao trained on Friday but did not feature during the Red Devils' 1-0 defeat at home to Southampton . Louis van Gaal, pictured with Falcao in September, has had doubts about the striker's physcial durability . 604 - Minutes played for United so far . 3 - Goals scored and three assists in all competitions . 201.3 - Minutes per goal. Papiss Cisse leads the league on 70.33 . £40,000 - Falcao’s daily wages . £1.77m - Cost of each of his United goals in wages, not including bonuses (Each of Alexis Sanchez’s 18 goals has cost Arsenal £210,000 in wages) The Premier League is increasingly a young man’s playground, especially for those who want to play No 9. Falcao, sadly, suffered an anterior cruciate ligament injury last season — the one players fear above all others - and that was always going to plant seeds of doubt in the mind of a coach who, despite his love of attractive, passing football, is pretty much obsessed with the issue of players’ fitness. For his part, Falcao feels a little hard done by. It is not in his nature to complain publicly. He knows he has been given a golden opportunity by one of the world’s biggest clubs when others were put off by the numbers and hasn’t given up on life here by any stretch. It is understood, though, that the former Atletico Madrid forward feels that he has to do twice as much to impress Van Gaal than some others in the United set-up. Falcao, pictured against Yeovil in the FA Cup, was left bemused by Van Gaal’s continued assertions that he wouldn’t pick him ‘until he is fit' Only recently Falcao was left bemused by Van Gaal’s continued assertions that he wouldn’t pick him ‘until he is fit….first he needs to be fit’. As far as he was concerned, he had recovered from the calf injury that side lined him just as he seemed to be getting his United career off the ground and just couldn’t understand why his manager was making such noises. On a daily basis, Falcao has done what he needs to do, and then some. Those who know him told of a player desperate to impress his manager, desperate to learn to English football quickly and who has stayed behind for solitary training sessions on a number of occasions in a bid to prepare and acclimatise his body. Falcao has understood quickly that centre forwards in England must do more than score goals. He has seen the way Wayne Rooney plays his football - the areas of the field that he occupies - and has endeavoured to move his own game in that direction. Falcao is desperate to impress his new manager and has stayed behind for solitary training sessions . It is difficult, though, if you are not allowed to ease yourself in to the ebb and flow of regular football. ‘The manager talks rhythm and confidence but it’s hard to establish either if you are in and out of the team,’ said an associate of Falcao on Monday. ‘This is part of the problem for Falcao. ‘He desperately feels he needs games in order for people to see the best of him. ‘That is why he was so stunned to be left out of the squad for Sunday.’ Van Gaal’s history as a coach tells that he can be merciless when it comes to his treatment of his players. It is accepted as a quality. At Barcelona first time round, for example, he shunted the great Brazilian Rivaldo - the darling of the Nou Camp - out on to the wing and when he complained he dropped him. Known as an obsessive keeper of figures, one key component of Van Gaal’s famous dossiers is, for centre forwards, not just goals but shots on target and assists. If those numbers don’t keep heading north at the required rate then you are in trouble, whoever you are. Certainly at Old Trafford, Falcao is part of a wider problem. Van Gaal’s squad needs a regular goal scorer if it is to go anywhere at all next season. Rooney no longer counts as he plays a withdrawn role while Robin van Persie will be 32 in August and looks short these days when compared to Diego Costa at Chelsea, Sergio Aguero at Manchester City and Arsenal’s Alexis Sanchez. Van Gaal and his club need the next Ruud van Nistelrooy and if it’s not going to be Falcao then he increasingly looks like being the obvious one to make way.","Radamel Falcao has scored three goals in eight starts for Man United .

"Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal believes goalkeeper David de Gea will sign a new contract at the club. De Gea is in talks with United over extending a deal that only has 18 months left to run. With Real Madrid interested in taking the 24-year-old back to Spain and United this week signing the experienced Victor Valdes as back-up, some fans are worried De Gea may leave. Victor Valdes (left) and David de Gea (right) warm up during Manchester United's training session on Friday . Valdes (right) and De Gea (2nd right) take instruction from goalkeeping coach Frans Hoek on Friday . Louis van Gaal believes having the 'best players' like the two goalkeepers can help United be the best . The United No 1 has been attracting interest from Spanish giants Real Madrid . But asked if he thought his goalkeeper would stay, Van Gaal said on Friday: ‘I think so, yes. I think there is no problem for him to sign. It’s the same as other players. You can ask other players and I can answer the same. ‘It’s always like that; when you are a fixed line-up player, then probably you are the best and then the manager is very happy that a player that is fixed in the line-up will stay. It’s always like that.’ Valdes will be on the bench as United host Southampton in the Barclays Premier League tomorrow at Old Trafford and Van Gaal believes the competition between the two Spaniards can help elevate his team to new levels. ‘Nobody is happy to be No 2,’ said Van Gaal. ‘He has to have the ambition to beat De Gea. That will be very hard for him but my ambition is to have the best players who can co-operate and make us the best team in the world. De Gea has been in fine form this season and has kept United in many games . Victor Valdes signed for Manchester United on Thursday, penning an 18-month deal at Old Trafford . (Left to right) Antonio Valencia, De Gea, Rafael, Angel di Maria, Chris Smalling and Maroc Rojo train on Friday . ‘I can only say that David de Gea has developed himself in the six months that I’ve been here very much. I’m very pleased with his development.’ Van Gaal would not be drawn on whether United will sign any other players in January but revealed that Ashley Young is now the only injured player in the squad. Young’s hamstring trouble will keep him out for four weeks but other long-term injury sufferers such as Daley Blind and Marcos Rojo are in the squad along with Luke Shaw and Rafael, who have had minor problems. ‘We only have one injury,’ smiled Van Gaal. ‘Can you believe it? I have a full selection of players within three weeks. ‘Normally, we should then play better because a lot of players who were also fixed in my line-up — Daley Blind and Angel di Maria — are coming back. Rojo is also fixed in my line-up. I didn’t have the chance to build up with the same players. I hope that I can do that now, but you never know.’ Daley Blind (left) returned to training after a length injury spell alongside Andreas Pereira .

I’m sorry.’ Meanwhile, Ronald Koeman has heaped pressure on Van Gaal by insisting United must challenge for the title given the money they spent in the summer. Van Gaal was backed to the tune of £150million yet has twice played down his side’s chances of winning the league. But Koeman, who has shared a fractious relationship with his counterpart since they fell out at Barcelona, claims Van Gaal has no excuses.

They have a very successful coach, they have great players, they have money, they have great fans, a great stadium. It’s normal that you win titles. We had problems in the past. We shake hands and I hope he will do well with United. It would be special to beat him, but I lost last time and we try to put it right.’ Southampton were unfortunate to lose 2-1 to United at St Mary’s last month, when two clinical goals from Robin van Persie decided the game. Koeman added: ‘I believe we belong in the top four. I hope the players show that as well. Our recent victory against Arsenal was important and the draw with Chelsea. ‘We didn’t have that kind of result before the United game last time. We lost because of our mistakes and the individual qualities of their players. That’s the difference. We can beat them.’","David de Gea has been Manchester United's star man so far this season .

"Tottenham have announced that Jermain Defoe will link up with the club to train and maintain his fitness as a return to the Premier League remains a possibility. Defoe left White Hart Lane last January to move to Major League Soccer having penned a deal with Toronto FC , but has been heavily linked with a comeback with the likes of QPR and Leicester believed to be keen on a move for the 32-year-old striker. Spurs confirmed the news via their official Twitter account, writing: 'We can confirm that @IAmJermainDefoe will train with our Development Squad for the next week to maintain fitness during MLS close season.' Jermain Defoe is training at his former club Tottenham Hotspur ahead of a possible Premier League return . The former Tottenham striker has been plying his trade in the MLS for Toronto FC . The former West Ham and Portsmouth forward enjoyed a blistering start to his career in MLS, scoring 11 goals in his opening 16 league games for Toronto before his relationship with the club soured. Having missed out on a place in England's World Cup squad last summer, Defoe could return to the Premier League and will want to use his time with Tottenham's youth set-up to keep in peak condition should he find himself signing terms in the coming month.

"Jermain Defoe is closing in on a return to English football as part of a swap deal involving Sunderland misfit Jozy Altidore. Gus Poyet has been working on a deal to end Altidore’s nightmare at the Stadium of Light by allowing him to leave the club and move to Major League Soccer side Toronto as part of a swoop for Defoe. Poyet is desperate to add firepower to Sunderland’s strike force and Defoe has pedigree in the Premier League after spells at West Ham United, Tottenham Hotspur and Portsmouth. Lazar Markovic nonchalantly trots away after giving Liverpool during their 1-0 victory at Sunderland . Jermain Defoe is closing in on a return to English football with a move to Sunderland . Defoe (right) has been training with former club Tottenham Hotspur and wants to return from the MLS . Black Cats misfit Jozy Altidore (right), pictured against Chelsea in November, could move the opposite way . 1 - Sunderland have won just once at the Stadium of Light all season and have the worst home record (nine points) in the Premier League. The biggest stumbling block to Defoe’s return remains his £70,000-a-week wages but the potential to trade Altidore has softened the financial burden for the Black Cats. Toronto had been holding out for a £6million transfer fee for the former England striker but are tempted by a straight swap provided Sunderland take on his massive wages. Defoe, 32, has been training with Tottenham’s Under 21 development squad to keep fit recently and, although there is no prospect of a deal at Spurs, he has no intention of heading back to Canada for the start of the MLS season in March. Markovic poked beyond Costel Pantilimon to score his first goal since moving to the Premier League . Emre Can grabs hold of Markovic as the Liverpool players rush to congratulate the goalscorer . How Poyet could have done with the former England striker in his ranks on Saturday as Liverpool coasted to victory without their own talisman. Brendan Rodgers did not want to expose Raheem Sterling to the coarse climes of the North East, where temperatures barely touched three degrees Celsius and wild winds whipped litter around the stadium. Instead, the player he believes will fire Liverpool to the top four was in Jamaica, relaxing and posting selfies amid the 30-dgree Celsius surrounds of his ‘winter break’. Liam Bridcutt was given his marching orders four minutes after half-time for two bookings . Bridcutt tripped Can as he marauded down the right into space to pick up his second yellow card . Rodgers said: ‘He will come back now and mentally it will freshen him up. It is not just the physical fitness but the mental fitness that he needs.’ The only surprise at the Stadium of Light was that Liverpool did not add to Lazar Markovic’s ninth-minute opener, a close-range poke after a forceful run into the penalty area. Sunderland, in comparison, lacked energy and invention, although they were arguably better after Liam Bridcutt was sent off early in the second half following a soft second booking for a trip on Emre Can, but they never truly threatened parity. Former Manchester City winger Adam Johnson smashed the bar in the second half for Sunderland . Markovic later struck the crossbar with this volley as Liverpool took control of the game in the North East .","Jermain Defoe could join Sunderland with Jozy Altidore moving to Toronto .

"England’s quest for the dynamism that just might take them far in the World Cup began in the best possible way when they amassed the kind of batting riches they will desperately need when the serious business begins in Australia. Five players hit 50s and Chris Woakes contributed an unbeaten 45 as England smashed 364 for six in their tour opener before wrapping up an emphatic 216-run victory against an Australian Capital Territories XI. It was a satisfying start to a tough assignment for England but it should be pointed out they could not have begun against more accommodating opposition. Ian Bell hits out on his way to a score of 51 as England emphatically beat an Australian Capital Territories XI . Fellow England opener Moeen Ali struck 50 - one of five England batsmen to hit a half-century . Ali was out stumped by Andrew Harriott of the ACT XI after hitting his 50 off just 38 balls . The hosts boasted just one full-time professional supplemented by a motley collection of part-timers that included four students, a teacher, a Sydney financier and a bricklayer of Macedonian origin in Vele Dukoski. Still, England will be encouraged that so many of their probable World Cup top six hit the ground running in this first of two warm-up games at the Manuka Oval before their tri-series against Australia and India begins on Friday. The bad news is that new captain Eoin Morgan again looked out of touch while Ian Bell was unconvincing on his return to the opener’s role in place of the jettisoned Alastair Cook - even though he was one of the half-centurions. England will prefer to reflect on how Moeen Ali, at the beginning, and Ravi Bopara, at the end, gave their innings a big-hitting flourish while James Taylor impressed again and Joe Root emphasised once more his increasing importance. James Taylor joined in the run fest, hitting 55 as England posted a massive total of 364 . Taylor plays another nice shot as England posted an insurmountable total in Canberra . Joe Root smashes the ball away during his innings of 56 off 47 balls at the Manuka Oval in Canberra . Moeen, in particular, provides hope for an England side that could not be going into the premier one-day tournament with expectations any lower. The man who proved an all-round success in his first summer of Test cricket has taken to his new role as one-day opener like a duck to water and here he hit two sixes and seven fours in a 38-ball 50 in a partnership of 75 with Bell. It is Bell who looks almost certain to line-up alongside Moeen in next month’s World Cup ahead of the more expansive Alex Hales but he will need to do more, starting against the Prime Minister’s XI on Wednesday, to justify England’s faith. Here he was dropped in the first over immediately after hitting his first boundary and Bell then took another 14 overs before adding his second and final four in an innings ended, sadly predictably, when he holed out to mid-on. Captain Eoin Morgan is bowled by Shane Devoy after posting a score of 32 off 37 balls . Ravi Bopara hits a six during his innings of 56 from just 27 balls as England finished with a flourish . Stuart Broad took two wickets for 25 runs as the ACT were bowled out for 148 - 216 runs short . Morgan is more of a worry because he is such a key figure for an England side who hope his elevation to the captaincy will have the same galvanising effect evident in his previous leadership excursions. He did hit four fours here but could only manage 32 from 37 balls while all around him cashed in on below par bowling that had only the impressive left-arm spin of teacher Shane Devoy to commend it. At least Morgan’s departure cleared the way for the best hitting of the game, Bopara and Woakes adding 105 off 50 balls as England at last managed to add three figures from the last 10 overs of a 50-over innings. Bopara smashed five sixes in his unbeaten 56 from 27 balls while Woakes added three of his own in the 27 balls he faced. England celebrate after James Tredwell (third left) dismissed Vele Dukoski . James Anderson celebrates with Jos Buttler after taking the wicket of Lewis Malady . It was always likely to be far too many for ACT and their thankless task was made virtually impossible when James Tredwell took three wickets in his first two overs without conceding a run. There was also an encouraging return after injury for Stuart Broad while Jimmy Anderson looked short of fitness on his own return to the side and may need to do more against a strong looking Prime Minister’s side if he is play against Australia in Sydney on Friday. Not that England needed to exert themselves to dismiss the hosts for 148 within 33 overs to complete a good day’s work. They know, though, that it is going to get a lot harder than this.","England beat Australian Capital Territories XI by 216 runs in Canberra .

"Prosecutors filed murder charges Tuesday against two Utah residents in the slayings of two California sheriff's deputies during a shooting rampage that also left a motorist and third deputy wounded. Luis Enrique Monroy-Bracamonte, who was booked into jail under the pseudonym Marcelo Marquez, and his wife, 38-year-old Janelle Marquez Monroy, appeared separately in court for an arraignment, but did not enter pleas. They were both shackled and in a courtroom cell surrounded by sheriff's deputies during their appearances. Monroy-Bracamonte, his left forearm heavily bandaged from an injury he suffered before his arrest, asked Sacramento Superior Court Judge Helena Gweon to slow down as she read the charges against him. Charged: Public Defender Jeff Barbour, right, holds the complaint, which includes two murder charges, against Luis Enrique Monroy-Bracamonte,  in Sacramento Superior Court, Tuesday. A court order banned the suspects' faces form being photographed in the courtroom . Rampage: Monroy-Bracamonte is charged with murdering two police officers in a shooting rampage along with his wife Friday . Federal immigration authorities say Monroy-Bracamonte has been living in the U.S. illegally after being convicted in Arizona for selling drugs in 1997 and deported to Mexico twice, most recently in 2001. The 14-count complaint charges both with the murder of one deputy, though authorities say Monroy-Bracamonte fired the fatal shots. He alone is charged with the other slaying. Monroy-Bracamonte is facing special circumstances that could qualify him for the death penalty. At an afternoon news conference, Sacramento County District Attorney Jan Scully said she and Placer County District Attorney Ronald 'Scott' Owens, who are jointly prosecuting the pair, have not yet decided whether to seek his execution. 'The facts speak for themselves,' she said, but added that prosecutors follow a legal protocol in making such decisions. 'We're not going to treat this case any differently.' The prosecutors, joined by sheriffs from both counties, also declined to say if they have determined a motive for the shootings or why the pair had journeyed to California, where they apparently had no ties. The couple appeared to be living quietly in the Salt Lake City area until their arrest in California. Attorneys for Monroy-Bracamonte and Monroy declined to comment on the charges after the hearing. Jeff Barbour, the public defender who is representing Monroy-Bracamonte, said he had just been appointed and hadn't seen the police reports. Peter Kmeto, who is representing Monroy, said he would reserve his comments for court. Accomplice?

He is a figure of some mystery, with several aliases and a history of deportation and drug crime, authorities said on Monday. Monroy-Bracamonte was deported to Mexico twice, in 1997 for a narcotics charge in Arizona, and in 2001 for an unspecified charge, Immigration and Customs Enforcement said. He was arrested several times in Arizona on drug charges, according to Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio.

June 1997 Bracamonte is deported to Mexico . January 1998 Arrested again in Maricopa County for drug possession and selling marijuana before being released into Arizona . May 2001 Bracamonte was deported once again, but ICE has not released details on this instance . July 2001 Arrested a third time in Maricopa County for failure to appear before he made bond and was released . June 2011 Given a driving privilege card in Utah under the name Marcelo Marquez .

Monroy-Bracamonte, 34, sports Mexican gang-related tattoos, though he seemed eager to leave his home country over the years . Authorities say Monroy-Bracamonte, 34, fired all the fatal shots during Friday's rampage, first killing Sacramento County Deputy Daniel Oliver, then wounding a motorist while attempting to carjack his vehicle. The charges say he used a .9mm handgun in both initial shootings. Both are charged with the attempted murder and attempted carjacking of motorist Anthony Davis, Monroy as an accomplice. Davis is recovering from multiple gunshot wounds. The couple is also charged with two more attempted carjackings and one successful carjacking. They fled to neighboring Placer County, where Monroy-Bracamonte is charged with killing a second deputy and wounding a third using an AR-15 assault rifle.

Sad inheritance: Detective Michael David Davis Jr., 42, died, 26 years to the day after his father was killed while on duty as a sheriff's deputy in Southern California, officials said . The complaint alleges that Monroy-Bracamonte stole a Placer County sheriff's department vehicle along with a sheriff's department shotgun. It also accuses the pair of attempting to murder two other Placer County sheriff's deputies, Charles Bardo and Joseph Roseli, along with attempting to murder and wounding Placer County deputy Jeffrey Davis, who was treated for a gunshot wound to the arm. The charges say Monroy-Bracamonte fired the assault rifle at all three deputies, with Monroy as an accomplice. Other charges say the pair possessed an assault rifle that is illegal in California, and that Monroy-Bracamonte was a felon in possession of the rifle, stolen shotgun, .9mm handgun and a .380 caliber handgun. Investigators were trying to determine how Monroy-Bracamonte avoided scrutiny despite being fingerprinted by police in West Valley City, Utah, during a misdemeanor hit-and-run arrest in 2003. Utah authorities never connected him to his real name or his previous criminal record. The rampage stretched from Sacramento to Auburn about 35 miles (56 km) away, prompting a massive, multi-agency police response and forcing the lockdown of schools and businesses. The incident began in the parking lot of a Motel 6 at about 10 a.m. on Friday, when veteran Sacramento Deputy Danny Oliver approached a vehicle considered to be suspicious. Someone inside the car, believed to be Monroy-Bracamonte, fired multiple rounds at Oliver, 47, who later died in a hospital. The couple then carjacked a vehicle, shooting the motorist in the head when he resisted, authorities said. The pair carjacked a total of three vehicles and attempted to take another, prosecutors said in their criminal complaint, and crossed into Placer County, where they killed Deputy Michael Davis Jr. and wounded Deputy Charles Bardo. Monroy-Bracamonte then stole a sheriff's patrol car before he was found holed up in a house hours later, authorities said. Authorities have not determined a motive. The couple are expected to enter a plea at a hearing on Dec. 9. Officers down: Law enforcement officers respond to the shooting spree at the intersection of Fair Oaks Blvd. And Van Alstine Ave. in response to an officer involved shooting on Friday in Sacramento, California . A SWAT team arrives to the scene Friday. An assailant shot and killed a Sacramento County sheriff's deputy and wounded two other deputies along with a bystander Friday during a series of shootings that spanned more than 30 miles through two California counties . Terror unfolds: The complaint alleges that Monroy-Bracamonte stole a Placer County sheriff's department vehicle along with a sheriff's department shotgun .","Luis Enrique Monroy-Bracamonte, 34, AKA Marcelo Marquez and his wife Janelle Marquez Monroy, 38, entered no plea Tuesday .

"A former chief pilot of Concorde is selling £100,000 worth of his aviation memorabilia so he can fund his 20-year-old daughter through flying school. Mike Bannister is selling a host of memorabilia including cockpit instruments, a damaged blade, a prototype tyre and the sought-after Pitot Probe, which sat on the front of the nosecone and defined the Concorde’s shape. The 65-year-old said he didn’t want his daughter Amy to be burdened with debt at the start of her career and will use his profit to help repay her six-figure loan which she took out to fund training as a commercial airline pilot at a flight training school in Spain. Former chief pilot Mike Bannister, 65, is selling a host of memorabilia including cockpit instruments and the Concorde Large Engine Shut Down Blade (above) to help fund his daughter Amy, 20, through flying school . Another item up for sale is the Concorde oil pressure gauge which was located on the flight engineer's panel . Mike Bannister, 65, from Staines, Middlesex, first flew Concorde as a co-pilot in 1977 before becoming chief pilot in 1995. He went on to fly the last ever Concorde flight in 2003 when the aircraft was officially retired . One item being sold is Mr Bannister’s retirement present - the long Pitot Probe on the front of the nose cone that defined the aircraft’s shape. The device, that actually measured Concorde’s speed, is valued at 10,000 pounds. Also being sold is Concorde’s crucial Centre of Gravity Controller which helped move fuel around the jet to balance it so that aircraft drag could be minimised, thus giving it the ability to fly at speeds of 1,500mph. It is worth £8,500. A £4,000 damaged blade removed from one of Concorde’s engines that had to be shut down when it ingested a foreign body is also being sold. However, one of the most significant items up for sale is a piece of the prototype tyre that Mr Bannister took to meetings with safety authorities in the wake of the 2000 Air France Concorde crash. He said: ‘When I retired from British Airways in 2004 I was very grateful to be given a number of items of Concorde equipment as a thank you. ‘I have also acquired other items from various sales over the years. A damaged Concorde blade, prototype tyre and a signed Golden Jubilee flypast formation guide are also going under the hammer at the online auction on July 25, as well as several signed photos and documents (above) This Concorde Stator Blade is also going under the hammer with auctioneers Chaucer Collectables on July 25 . Another item being put up for auction by Mike Bannister is a prototype tyre (above), which was introduced after the fatal Air France crash in Paris in July 2000 which killed a total of 113 people . ‘I was very lucky when I trained to be . a pilot as it was sponsored by the airline. But times have changed and . if you want to be a commercial pilot now somebody has to pay £100,000 . and at the end of the day the student is left with the debt at the start . of their career. ‘I was sat in my study one day and it struck me that I have been very fortunate to have had a fabulous career and I was looking at these items around me and thought about selling them to take that debt burden off of Amy. ‘It is a natural circle of life that the money raised will go back in to flying in the form of helping my daughter to be a commercial pilot. ‘When she last came home from Spain I told her what I was going to do and she was very pleased. ‘It has been over 10 years since Concorde last flew and you would have thought interest in it would have waned but it hasn’t. ‘If anything the interest is going back up because there is now a new generation of people who were too young to remember it fly but who are now really fascinated by it.’ Mr Bannister will use his profit to help repay his daughter's six-figure loan which she took out to fund training as a commercial airline pilot at a flight training school in Spain. Pictured: A Concorde engine blade to be sold . The 'Hydraulic Servo Selector' (left), which was a key component of the 'Protection Following System Failure' feature of the Concorde's hydraulic system is also up for auction, as well as a signed flypast programme (right) which outlined the formation over Buckingham Palace for the Queen's Golden Jubilee celebrations in 2002 . Mr Bannister, from Staines, Middlesex, first flew Concorde as a co-pilot in 1977 and then became chief pilot in 1995. He flew the last ever Concorde flight in 2003 when the aircraft was retired due to the general downturn in the aviation industry and following the Air France crash of July 2000 in which 113 people died. In the wake of the tragedy in Paris, Mike played a vital role in making safety improvements to Concorde so it could fly again. He said: ‘On the day of the crash my wife Christine and Amy, who was aged six, were about to board the QEII to go on a cruise to New York. ‘My pager went off and I had to go to Heathrow and take up a role in the emergency centre. I went home again 48 hours later to Amy.’ Mr Bannister flew the last ever Concorde flight in 2003 when the aircraft was retired due to the general downturn in the aviation industry and following the Air France crash of July 2000 in which 113 people died .

Other items being sold at the auction include a signed copy of the formation flypast technical programme for the flypast over Buckingham Palace of Concorde and the Red Arrows to mark the Queen’s Golden Jubilee in 2002. Mark Jennings, of auctioneers Chaucer Collectables of Folkestone, Kent, said: ‘The iconic status of Concorde has always ensured memorabilia has remained popular but you can’t get much better than sourcing it from the chief pilot himself. ‘We are expecting considerable interest in the sale. ‘This is the first time we have been able to offer such an impressive range of artifacts. Not only are they scarce but they were essential pieces of Concorde operation.’ The items will go on display at Cobham Services on the M25 on July 24 before the auction takes place online on July 25.","Mike Bannister is selling host of memorabilia including cockpit instruments .

"Newsagent Jarrett Rivers  made headlines when he scored Blyth Spartans' FA Cup winner against Hartlepool United, and it has earned the 21-year-old the offer of his first professional contract. Oldham Athletic missed out on convicted rapist Ched Evans last week but turned their attention to Rivers by allowing the winger that works in his mother's newsagents to have a week's trial. And Blyth manager Tom Wade confirmed a different League One club made a bid for Rivers on Monday night after his 90th-minute winner during a televised 2-1 win over Hartlepool in December.

He's not a big-time Charlie,' Wade told Sportsmail on Tuesday. 'He scored his winner against Hartlepool in the last couple of minutes and it never got to his head.

"Pele's son Edinho (above) pictured in 2003 . Pele's 44-year-old son was arrested in Brazil on Tuesday after losing an appeal in a money laundering case involving a drug gang. Edson Cholbi do Nascimento, known as Edinho, had been convicted earlier this year and sentenced to 33 years in prison for laundering money for the gang. The former goalkeeper had been allowed to remain free during the process, but a local judge said his appeal was rejected. Edinho can appeal again to a higher court, but judge Suzana Pereira said in her ruling that this time he must remain in jail. Edinho's lawyers told Brazilian media that they were surprised with the ruling and will request Edinho's immediate release. Pele's press office said the former player will not immediately comment on his son's arrest. The 74-year-old, a World Cup winner with Brazil in 1958, 62 and 70, successfully underwent surgery to remove kidney stones last week. He was discharged from hospital on Saturday. Edinho was taken into custody during a mandatory monthly visit to a court in Santos. He had spent about a week in prison in July before being allowed to appeal in freedom. He also spent six months in a maximum-security prison in 2005 after being arrested with 50 others in a sweep aimed at a gang in Santos. Prosecutors said he was associated with the criminal group. Edinho had been working as an assistant coach at Brazilian side Santos, pictured here in 2010 . Brazilian legend Pele recently had an operation in Sao Paulo to remove kidney stones . Edinho previously denied the charges against him, although he publicly said he had used drugs out of curiosity after he quit professional football. In the early 1990s, Edinho was charged with taking part in a high-speed race in which the other car hit and killed a motorcyclist. He was sentenced for manslaughter years later before being acquitted in 2005. Edinho played in the early 1990s with Santos, the same team where Pele played during most of his career. He had been working as an assistant coach with the eight-time Brazilian champion. Pele won three World Cups with Brazil, the last of which came in 1970 in Mexico (above) Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Edson Cholbi do Nascimento (Edinho) was convicted earlier this year .

"Two drug dealers were convicted of masterminding a £6million money laundering and drug ring after police found a number saved in their driver's phone for 'Mr Boss Man'. Rodney Stacey, 37, and Patrick Goodman, 64, were said to be the brains behind an extensive trans-European drugs network smuggling cocaine and amphetamines into the UK from the continent. Police were first alerted in February 2011 when a lorry entering the UK at the Port of Dover, Kent, was stopped and searched by UK Borders Agency officers. Rodney Stacey (left) and Patrick Goodman (right) were the brains behind a massive operation to smuggle drugs into Britain from Europe . Officers found a holdall with a GPS tracking device containing 16 kilos of cocaine concealed behind the cab of the vehicle - with an estimated street value of £2.3million. The driver was then arrested and interviewed and denied all knowledge of the drugs. But when police checked his mobile phone they discovered a number for 'Mr Boss Man' which led them straight to Stacey, from Folkestone, Kent. A month later another drug-runner was stopped by French authorities attempting to smuggle around 80 kilos of amphetamine between France and Belgium. A holdall stuffed with £1.5 million of cocaine was found in a BMW and the drug barons' schemes were discovered by police . Here is the holdall containing £1.5m on cocaine on a grassy bank, which led police to the drug duo . This is the stash of money found on Stacey . Canterbury Crown Court heard on . yesterday that Goodman, from Paddock Wood, Kent was also spotted over . several months meeting Stacey when cash or drugs were exchanged. On . December 12 2011, one member of the group was arrested after officers . found £152,000 worth of ecstasy tablets disguised as coffee in a van . following a meeting with Goodman. Stacey was arrested after trying to flee from cops but was arrested when drugs were found in his BMW. A further stash was later found stored in a freezer at his home. Goodman was arrested on July 24 at his home and later charged with offences of conspiracy to supply controlled drugs and money laundering. Stacey was charged with conspiracy to supply controlled drugs and money laundering. Speaking after Goodman and Stacey's conviction, DC David Friend from the Kent and Essex Serious Organised Crime Unit said: 'Stacey and Goodman were the masterminds behind this extensive drugs and money laundering operation. 'Both of them worked hard at organising how they would smuggle their drugs into the country and how they would be distributed across Kent. 'These convictions have put two major players in the illegal drugs industry out of the game and serve as a warning to others that crime does not pay.' Both were found guilty at Canterbury Crown Court and will be sentenced later this week.","Rodney Stacey, 37, and Patrick Goodman, 64, masterminded drugs network .

"Southampton have been hit by the news that defender will miss up to four weeks with a hamstring strain. The 25-year-old has been one of Saints' star performers since arriving on a season-long loan from Atletico Madrid, seamlessly replacing Dejan Lovren after he joined Liverpool. Alderweireld has helped Southampton keep the tightest defence in the Barclays Premier League, with Sunday's 1-0 win at Manchester United a 10th clean sheet of the campaign. Southampton defender Toby Alderweireld strained his hamstring during the win at Old Trafford . Alderweireld (right) was visibly upset at picking up an injury as he limped off the pitch in Manchester . The Belgium international was replaced by Florin Gardos just 21 minutes into that Old Trafford encounter with a hamstring complaint that  will now rule him out for three to four weeks. Alderweireld's injury is not as serious as first feared but leaves Southampton light in central defence, given Maya Yoshida is currently away with Japan at the Asian Cup. Saints captain Jose Fonte and Gardos are the only senior centre-backs at Ronald Koeman's disposal, meaning the Dutchman may look to make a move this month. 'I don't know (if we need to sign another centre half), we have to speak about that,' said Koeman, who can also call upon the inexperienced Jason McCarthy. 'We know that Maya will be away for some weeks, we know that. 'We knew already if we get some injuries then maybe it can be a problem but I think in our squad we can do some changes in positions to keep going.'

"An illegal immigrant has been arrested after allegedly using a forged passport to get a job at the House of Commons. The woman, believed to be from Sierra Leone, had been working in the Palace of Westminster for two months as a casual member of the catering team when the discovery was made. The employee, who had been supplied by an external recruitment agency, was arrested on Friday over the alleged security breach. An illegal immigrant, believed to be from Sierra Leone, had been working for two months in the House of Commons (file picture) According to The Times, the woman was required to be escorted around Parliament at all times, due to the fact she was a casual employee. But there were reports that she was allowed to roam free by allegedly using a pass owned by another member of staff. The woman's role in catering would have given her access to senior ministers and MPs. It is believed the agency was responsible for carrying out the background checks on the employee. A spokesman for the Commons confirmed the arrest, saying: 'A worker for an agency contracted by the House of Commons was arrested by the Metropolitan Police on Friday, January 2. 'We cannot comment on ongoing police investigations.' The woman was arrested on Friday after it was discovered that her passport was forged (file picture) The incident will raise serious questions about Parliament's security system. Keith Vaz, chairman of the home affairs select committee, said there needed to be a proper inquiry about how it happened, while Mark Field, a Tory member of the intelligence and security committee, said it was a 'pretty depressing' discovery. The case has echoes of another security blunder in 2008, when a Brazilian woman Elaine Chaves Aparecida, who had been hired as a cleaner, was arrested after trying to enter parliament using another person's security pass. In a separate incident in 2010, a Nigerian woman was found to have worked for six months in the House of Lords catering team while living illegally in Britain. Last February, one of Theresa May's ministers Mark Harper resigned after discovering his Colombian cleaner did not have permission to work in the UK.","Woman, believed to be from Sierra Leone, was employed by an agency .

"Manchester City defender Matija Nastasic claims he has no issues with manager Manuel Pellegrini as he prepares to join Schalke on loan. The German club have announced the signing of the Serbia centre-back - subject to a medical - on a temporary deal that could lead to a permanent move. Nastasic, 21, has fallen out of favour at City under Pellegrini and has not featured since the Community Shield clash against Arsenal on August 10. Matija Nastasic's (right) last appearance for Manchester City came in the Community Shield in August . He was a regular under Roberto Mancini two years ago, but has not been in Manuel Pellegrini's sights this term . That represents a considerable slump in fortunes for Nastasic, having been one of City's players of the season under Roberto Mancini two years ago, but he insists his relationship with Pellegrini was fine. 'No, everything was all right,' said Nastasic, when asked on Sky Sports News HQ about whether there were problems with Pellegrini. 'I think that is the best option for me and I hope everything will be all right. 'It was hard for me. In six months I didn't play one game. I wanted to go because for my career it is best at the moment to play a lot of games.' Nastasic joined City from Fiorentina in 2012 and became a regular in his first season at the Etihad Stadium. Manuel Pellegrini (left) has let Nastasic join Schalke on loan, with a view to a permanent deal . Nastasic (right, pictured battling with Chelsea's Eden Hazard) has struggled with injuries at times at City . Calf and knee injuries robbed him of game time last season and he then fell behind Martin Demichelis in the pecking order. The summer signing of Eliaquim Mangala then limited his opportunities further and Pellegrini has since appeared to view Dedryck Boyata as a better prospect. He is now set to join Schalke until the end of the season with the Bundesliga club - who, like City, are still in this season's Champions League - revealing they also have a 'purchase option' on the player. In 2012, Nastasic lined up against Real Madrid for City... he is pictured (right) alongside Cristiano Ronaldo . Before joining City, now 21-year-old Nastasic played in Serie A for Fiorentina in Italy between 2011 and 2012 . Nastasic said: 'I had a couple of options but, with my agent also, I decided with the club, and Man City, that it was the best option, Schalke. 'At the moment it is a loan and at the end of the season we will see what will happen.' The move will see Nastasic link up with Schalke's former Chelsea manager Roberto di Matteo. Nastasic said: 'I already spoke with him and he told me about the club, about the team and I hope we have a good relationship there.'","Manchester City defender Matija Nastasic has joined Schalke on loan .

"Shop closures are turning high streets into ‘ghost towns’ with clothes shops, building societies and mobile phone stores most likely to put up their shutters. Stores closed at the rate of 16 a day, a total of 3,003, across 500 main shopping centres during the first six months of this year, a study found. At the same time there has been a fall in new tenants filling the gaps, so many outlets remain empty – and a magnet for vandals. The changes are being driven by a switch to buying on the internet, with British families spending more online per person than in any other nation. High street stores are closing at an alarming rate as shoppers spurn them for retail parks and the internet . A survey by business services and accountancy firm PricewaterhouseCoopers found a net fall of 406 shops across 500 town centres in the first six months of this year – compared with 209 in the same period in 2013. Net closures – the number of stores shut, minus the number of new shops opened – rise to 964 when data for July to September is added, following the collapse of Phones4u and La Senza. That is 260 per cent higher than the net closure figure for the whole of last year. The findings suggest many traditional shops, such as fashion outlets, travel agents and building societies are disappearing, while the big chains are moving from town centres to retail parks. They also make clear that government efforts to revive the high street, including a review by the ‘Queen of Shops’ Mary Portas, have failed to end the rise of ‘ghost towns’. PwC said the biggest decline was in fashion shops, with a net closure of 146. Some 20 per cent of clothes and shoe purchases are now made online. There was a net fall of 96 building society branches, largely due to people using the internet and phone services to manage their finances. Mobile phone shops saw a net fall of 47 even before the collapse of Phones4u, and the number of pawnbrokers dropped by 48. But some retail outlets are growing in number, including betting shops, coffee shops, pound stores, charity shops and supermarket convenience branches. PwC’s Mark Hudson said: ‘This data shows that we are now really starting to see the full effects of the digital revolution… Although the rate of growth of online sales is slowing, it still far outstrips store sales growth for most retailers… . This, combined with the advances in mobile technologies and smartphones, is only going to accelerate the channel shift.’ The figures point to a regional divide, with closures most likely in the East Midlands and North West. By contrast, high streets in London and the East of England were still relatively buoyant. A separate survey by analysts Experian revealed a move away from traditional shops towards leisure and food. It found tattoo parlours have surged by 173 per cent over the past decade, while the number of takeaway outlets is up 54 per cent. Experian’s Richard Jenkings said the high street has ‘clearly become a more social environment’. He added: ‘We have seen a clear expansion in the number of retailers where the customer actually needs to be there in person to enjoy the experience, such as cafes, health clubs and even tattooists.’","More than 3,000 closed in UK's 500 main shopping centres in six months .

"Britain’s most expensive council house has been taken over by squatters – who have vowed to fight any attempts to evict them. The Grade II-listed building in south London sold at auction for almost £3million on Monday, but its new owner now faces the prospect of getting rid of around 20 unauthorised tenants. Within hours of going under the hammer, the new occupants could be seen hanging protest banners from the windows of the five-storey property in Southwark. Anger: One of the demonstrators who are occupying a multi-million-pound home in Southwark . Occupation: Squatters have moved in to this house in south London, Britain's most expensive council house . Protest: The squatters hung banners out of the windows of the building near Borough Market . The squatters, mostly in their 20s and 30s, include students, a roofer, a part-time chef and a worker for a quango. Spokesmen . for the squatters said they all lived elsewhere in the capital but . considered themselves ‘protesters’ and would take it in ‘shifts’ to . occupy the building, which has a water supply but no electricity or . heating. Some belong to a campaign group that is highlighting what they say is a housing shortage in the Labour-run borough. The . building was sold by council bosses to raise funds to pay for 20 modern . local authority homes but the squatters say they are doubtful it will . happen. Sale: A council worker was seen at the property yesterday after it was sold for £2.96million . Removal: Signs from Southwark Council have been taken off the property after its sale to a private buyer . Protester Kate . Sheldon, 27, a bike mechanic, said: ‘The occupation is going to last as . long as possible. We’ll wait until Southwark gets a court order and then . have a discussion about how to proceed.’ Another . squatter, Wayne Davies, 26, arrived to do his shift at the house in . between lectures in international development at the University of . London’s School of Oriental and African studies, and an evening shift . working as a chef. Mr . Davies, who lives in Brixton, said: ‘I’m sure the buyer can rest in . confidence that he will get his property. We all know how these things . end; we will be forcefully evicted.’ The 5,500 sq ft property – two dilapidated semi-detached homes sold as one lot – fetched £2.96million at auction. Pricy: The building, which has stood empty for years, is due to be used as a family home or flats . Taking a stand: The squatters seem to have timed their protest to coincide with the auction . Boasting . views of major London landmarks like The Shard, it was built by the . Anchor Brewery in 1820 to house its managers and directors, and was . later bought by the Courage brewery. A ‘Take Courage’ advertising slogan . is still visible on its side wall. Southwark councillor Richard Livingstone said the new owner would be able to bring the property up to a ‘good standard’. But . one neighbour said of the squatters: ‘They’re not paying rent or . council tax or any of the other things that we have to do so why should . they live there for free?’ Metropolitan Police officers visited the property with council officials on Monday and are now seeking legal advice.","House near Borough Market, south London, was sold to anonymous buyer .

"Celtic have an injury concern over skipper Scott Brown ahead of Saturday's return to Premiership action against Hamilton. The Parkhead captain will sit out Tuesday's friendly against Sparta Prague in Maspalomas before the champions fly home from their winter break on Wednesday. Brown sustained a gash to his head in the early minutes of Saturday's opening-game loss to PSV Eindhoven. Celtic captain Scott Brown receives treatment after suffering a cut head against PSV Eindhoven . He was always scheduled to miss the Sparta clash in any case, with Ronny Deila opting to field his younger fringe players. Seeking to reel in Aberdeen's four-point lead at the top of the league, Deila wants the midfielder back for the away clash with Accies. Hedging his bets on the issue, the Norwegian said: 'Scott was feeling it a little bit in his head today and his body. But I don't think it's a big thing. 'He wasn't going to play tomorrow [Tuesday] anyway, so he will just have a couple of days resting. 'I don't have it in my mind that he could be a doubt for Saturday. But you never know. 'Again, that's why I'm wary about him maybe having had a concussion after Saturday's game. That takes time. 'He didn't have that. However, he feels a little bit vulnerable today, so we'll see what's happening. I think he'll be ready for Saturday.' Defender Mikael Lustig admits the loss of Brown, even for one game, has a negative impact on the team. 'Scott Brown is our captain and a really important player for us,' he said. 'You know when he is playing, he brings something else that maybe we don't have without him. 'But when you are playing for Celtic, everyone has the ability to step up and play an important role.' Lustig, meanwhile, is close to ending his two-month injury lay-off ahead of a critical period for the Parkhead side. Brown, pictured trying to stop the bleeding, should be fit to face Hamilton this weekend . Returning from a hamstring ailment which led to groin problems, the Swedish international is close to his comeback. With a League Cup semi-final clash against Rangers and the last-32 Europa League ties with Inter Milan around the corner, timing is everything. The right-back last played in November after sustaining his injury on international duty and said: 'I don't really have a timescale for when I will be ready but, hopefully, it will be soon. 'It has been really frustrating because it is much better to know exactly whether you will be out for three weeks or whatever. 'I picked up the injury with Sweden but there was another problem and it has taken longer than I expected. 'But I am back in full training now and I am getting closer. 'January and February are two big months and there are some huge games that you want to be playing in. The league is exciting and we are in both cups as well as the Europa League. 'It has been hard just sitting watching. You just want to be out on the pitch but I had four months out last season and again this year. It's not enjoyable.' Adam Matthews, Darnell Fisher and Efe Ambrose can all play his position and Lustig admitted: 'There is a lot of competition for places. There have been three right-backs here for a while, so I am used to it. It's not a big problem but I know it is going to be tough.' He will play no part in today's second — and final — Gran Canaria friendly against Sparta. The patchy, dry pitch of the Maspalomas Stadium has done Celtic's players few favours. Taking no chances, Deila will field his fringe kids. Mikael Lustig believes Tuesday's game against Sparta Prague will be a good opportunity to impress . 'It's a chance for some of the guys who maybe haven't been playing as much to show what they can do,' said Lustig. 'Sparta are a good side, so it will be good experience for our young players.' The Swede has his eyes on bigger games ahead. As well as Rangers and Inter, Celtic face a Scottish Cup tie at Dundee and must find a way to win their games in hand and leapfrog Aberdeen at the top of the Premiership. 'Aberdeen haven't lost in a long time and they have been looking really good,' added Lustig. 'We have to stay focused on our games because we know if we keep winning, then we will win the title. 'There have always been good teams in the league, so we have always been focused. 'And the challenge means we have to stay that way because Aberdeen have done brilliantly. 'They are up there but we can't play Aberdeen every week. We have to take care of our own games. I think we are making progress in the right direction.' Lustig admits the experience of going head to head with Aberdeen, after reaching three titles in a row with a minimum of resistance, is a new one. 'It is exciting being involved in a title race,' he said. 'The last couple of seasons, we knew in February we were going to win the title. 'It's a bit different this time round but it does keep you focused. There is no way we can rest four or five players at times like we did towards the end of last season. 'We are not going to win the league by 20 points this year. I think it is going to be quite tight. 'Hopefully, our strength will show in the end. We have experienced players but we still need to treat every game like a cup final.'","Scott Brown suffered a gash to his head against PSV Eindhoven .

"The Three Bears’ plan to save Rangers will only come to fruition if the existing board agrees to a two-in, two-out compromise. Talks between representatives of the Douglas Park, George Taylor and George Letham consortium and the Ibrox board are ongoing as the club seeks a short-term solution to an increasingly drastic financial situation. With American financier Robert Sarver — who revealed that he had not wanted Lewis Macleod or any other Rangers player sold as a condition of his offer — now apparently out of the running after the board’s rejection of his improved £20million bid, the Three Bears appear to be the only show in town. The future of Glasgow Rangers remains uncertain due to the club's drastic financial situation . Rangers ace Nicky Law celebrates after putting his side ahead against Alloa in their last league game . They are prepared to offer £6.5m in emergency funding, which would keep the club solvent until the end of the season, with that loan being converted into equity at the forthcoming share issue. Aware of the fact Newcastle owner Mike Ashley has two men on the board after lending the club £3m, the Park-led consortium are adamant they should have no less than that number for an investment of more than twice that amount. Sportsmail understands it is the board’s insistence in allowing only one of the group to join them that is holding up the deal — and increasing the chances the club will not be able to meet its payroll obligations a week on Thursday. Given the sway Ashley has at the club with just 8.92 per cent of the shares, it is likely the Park group are seeking the removal of chief executive Derek Llambias and finance director Barry Leach. Embattled chairman David Somers seems a likely sacrificial lamb but whether his head along with one of Ashley’s crew would satisfy the would-be saviours remains to be seen. Newcastle owner Mike Ashley has two members on the Rangers board following a loan £3million . Negotiations between both parties are ongoing but the lingering possibility that Dave King could yet call an Extraordinary General Meeting seeking boardroom change is a threat to the talks. King’s scheme to have season-ticket money paid into a trust fund last summer put him on a war footing with the board. Their reluctance to deal with him means he is being pushed towards calling for an EGM in order to get the personnel changes he desires. Not only could this take up to 42 days, it would potentially pull the rug from under the group seeking to achieve such goals by more conventional methods. Although the impasse means the club are fast running out of money, they yesterday closed the door on the possibility of being financed and taken over by Arizona Suns owner Sarver. Sarver had upped an original £18m bid to £20m last week on the proviso that fresh share capital would be issued to him. But on Monday the board again rejected his proposal on the basis it was unlikely to secure the 75-per-cent shareholder support for such equity to be offered to a non-shareholder. The Ibrox club have turned down a £20million bid by US financier Robert Sarver . In rejecting Sarver’s latest offer, a Rangers statement to the Stock Exchange emphasised the same problems it raised with the first offer. ‘The revised proposal by Mr Sarver was similar to his first proposal in the respect that it sought a placing of 100 million shares (to be priced at 20p in this proposal) which would require the approval of shareholders (at least a 75-per-cent majority) at a general meeting,’ it said. ‘The board of Rangers rejected the first proposal from Mr Sarver on January 6 on the basis that the board felt it unlikely that the approval of shareholders holding sufficient shares would be forthcoming.’ A survey of the views of ‘a number of major shareholders’ on the revised proposal had suggested it, too, was unlikely to receive the backing required, the club added. As part of Sarver’s £20m offer, he was willing to hand the club an emergency £6.5m loan to help alleviate their cash-flow problems. Responding to the latest rejection, Sarver first released a statement to the Stock Exchange before commenting on the situation. Only agreeing to a compromise on board members will allow the Three Bears plan to take flight . A statement on his behalf read: ‘It was announced by Rangers this morning that the board of the Company had rejected the revised proposal on the basis that they felt it unlikely that the approval of shareholders holding sufficient shares would be forthcoming, and that therefore the board did not intend to hold the general meeting that would be necessary to implement the proposal. The board did not make any counter proposal. ‘Robert Sarver today announces that as a result of the board’s failure to provide a counter proposal or to engage in any meaningful negotiations with him, he does not now intend to make an offer for Rangers.’ Sarver added: ‘I’m disappointed the Rangers board has rejected my revised offer, which addressed the club’s immediate and long-term needs. ‘Clearly the directors have a different path they want to go down.’","Douglas Park, George Taylor and George Letham have set up a consotium to try and save Glasgow Rangers .

"Ronny Deila dismissed claims that Celtic’s fragility has cleared the way for an Aberdeen title challenge on Sunday night. And he insisted his team are ‘so good’ that they should be winning every game they play in Scotland. With 19 matches played, the Parkhead side are four points adrift of their Pittodrie rivals - and nine points worse off than at the same stage last year. Celtic's John Guidetti (centre) speaks to team-mate Beram Kayal during a training session in Gran Canaria . Ronny Deila believes his side are 'so good' they should win every single match they play in Scotland . In contrast, Aberdeen - who have played two matches more - are five points better off than they were after the same number of games last season. Adamant nonetheless that his team are going in the right direction, Deila claimed the Dons’ form under Derek McInnes was a more significant factor than any perceived vulnerability or weakness in Celtic’s results. And while he applauded the Dons for embarking on an eight-match winning run, Deila believes that his own team should have won every one of their last 11 games, including their two slip-ups in December when they lost 2-1 to Dundee United at Tannadice and drew 0-0 with Ross County at Celtic Park. ‘Aberdeen have done very well,’ said the Norwegian. ‘It’s not that we have been bad - they have been very good. ‘They have won eight games in a row - but in 11 (league) games we have only had one draw and one defeat. Aberdeen currently sit top of the SPL, four points clear of Celtic having played two matches more . ‘If you split things into two halves in the first eight games we had four victories, two draws and two losses. ‘Now, in the last 11, we have nine victories, one draw and one defeat. ‘And we should have won every one of those games. ‘So it’s going in the right direction. We are in both cups and we have an important period coming up now. ‘I know there are high emotions taking over people, but we have to stay calm and believe in what we are doing. ‘We know we are performing well and have had good results in the last two months. We are going to keep that going.’ Having played two games less than Aberdeen, the destiny of the title remains in the champions’ own hands. Deila sits in the dugout during his side's friendly with PSV Eindhoven in Gran Canaria on Saturday . Of the view that Celtic, with superior financial and playing resources, should already have a comfortable lead, Deila added: ‘We are so good we should win every game we play here in Scotland, so when we lose I understand that people get irritated. ‘But if you win and keep on winning as we do now then Aberdeen will have to be very good to beat us. ‘Against Dundee United we did well in the first half. ‘I was not satisfied with the game against Ross County, that was a poor game. I agree with the fans that was poor. We should have performed better, but even so we should have won the game. ‘We had enough chances to win it and that was a disappointing result. ‘Otherwise I think we have played a lot of good games now.’ Guidetti (centre) puts his hand across his mouth as he goes another 45 minutes without scoring a goal . The Parkhead boss regards the fitness of James Forrest as key to his side’s success in the future, but fears that the winger’s continuing injury problems mean the club may not see the best of him until next season. Deila says a fully-functioning Forrest can be like having a new player in the ranks and the Scotland international has embarked on a six-month project to cure his long-standing problems. ‘When we get him fully fit he will save us a lot of money,’ said the Norwegian. ‘I have a six-month project with him. If he can get consistency in his training we know he can be a top player. ‘He hasn’t been that for a long time because of the injuries but we will see the best of him next season. He needs time. I am not writing off this year, not at all, because he can be an important player for us. ‘He has the ability to beat a man and has great pace. We are looking for players who can be creative and we have a lot of options, but he can do that job for us. ‘He can open up defences. He will be like a new player next year.’","Celtic are second in the SPL, four points behind leaders Aberdeen .

"Juan Mata wants Manchester United to bounce back from their defeat to Southampton by embarking upon another long unbeaten run. United slipped to fourth in the Barclays Premier League on Sunday thanks to a 1-0 home defeat to Southampton. The loss brought the team's two-month long undefeated sequence to an end and cast fresh doubt on United's Champions League qualification hopes. Juan Mata has challenged Manchester United to bounce back following their defeat by Southampton . The Spain international was guilty of missing two glorious opportunities to score . Angel di Maria was the only Premier League player to be named in the FIFPro World XI . Despite fielding an attacking quartet worth over £150million, United failed to register a single shot on target against Southampton, who moved up to third. Mata missed three good chances to rescue United after Dusan Tadic's 69th-minute strike and he admitted in his weekly blog that the defeat was tough to take. 'It's not easy for me to write here today, right after this Sunday's defeat,' the United midfielder wrote after the 1-0 defeat. 'It was not the best game to watch. They were well positioned and defended very well, so creating chances was difficult. And yet we were in control of the game. 'The first half was not very good; the game was quite slow, too tactical. But we kept the ball most of the time, trying to find spaces towards the goal. 'They scored after the break in one of the few chances they had, after a ball that rebounded on the post, and then we tried everything to tie the game. I think we deserved that goal. I don't think we deserved to lose.' Southampton winger Dusan Tadic stripped off and pulled a Hulk pose to celebrate his winning goal . The defeat brought an end to United's two month run without losing . United fans became accustomed to seeing Mata write about bouncing back from defeat towards the end of last season when David Moyes' reign began to crumble. There was a sense of deja vu therefore when he published his latest entry on Monday morning. 'We are disappointed because of the defeat, but you can rest assured that the team will keep fighting in every game until the end to achieve our goals,' the former Chelsea man said. 'What matters now is to win our next game, regardless of who scores. 'We visit QPR and it's going to be a tough one. They are in need of points and we know we must go back to a good streak of wins.' United manager Louis van Gaal was angry when it was pointed out to him on Sunday that after 21 matches he had accumulated the same number of points as Moyes, who was sacked after 10 months. Unlike Moyes, the Dutchman has spent vastly on new players this season, parting with over £150million to bring in seven new faces. Manager Louis van Gaal has racked up the same amount of points as David Moyes after 21 games . Van Gaal's most expensive signing Angel di Maria was named in the FIFPro World XI on Monday . Daley Blind (right) urged Mata's calls for recovery, beginning with QPR on Saturday . One of them, Daley Blind, echoed Mata's calls for an instant response when United head to QPR on Saturday. 'We have to bounce back, we have to stand up as a team with each other and do the best we can in training, every day, and have a good week because we need a win next weekend,' said the £14million signing from Ajax. United, meanwhile, have confirmed backup goalkeeper Sam Johnstone will spend the rest of the season on loan at hometown club Preston. Johnstone was on loan at Doncaster, but the 21-year-old cut short his spell at the Yorkshire club to move to Deepdale, where his father Glenn played during the 1990s.","Manchester United were defeated 1-0 by Southampton on Sunday .

"When Liverpool fans bemoaned last season’s title collapse, they did so with the heavy burden of recent history on their shoulders. They will have seen their captain, Steven Gerrard, fight for the championship in those closing weeks as if it were his last shot at the only domestic glory which has eluded him. And when it slipped from his grasp in those final few games, they will have feared a repeat of what followed on the last two occasions Liverpool finished second in the league. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Liverpool v Middlesbrough pictorial highlights Capital One Cup . Steven Gerrard, Rickie Lambert and Mario Balotelli trudge off after Liverpool were beaten 3-1 by West Ham . Simon Mignolet retrieves the ball out of his net as Liverpool lose their third out of five Premier League games . Brendan Rodgers will want to avoid a Liverpool Premier League slump after last season's second-placed finish . In 2001-02, the Merseysiders finished runners up to Arsenal and three points clear of fiercest rivals Manchester United in third. Despite losing manager Gerard Houllier’s services for several months due to the Frenchman’s heart surgery, it had all looked so promising. The Reds rallied in the last three months of the campaign, minus striker Robbie Fowler, who had been sold to Leeds United in the November. Optimism was in abundance. But during that summer, Houllier turned down the opportunity to sign enigmatic compatriot Nicolas Anelka, instead buying the wholly ineffective Senegalese El Hadji Diouf. What followed was abject misery. Instead of pushing on and challenging for the number one spot, form deserted the Anfield side and their disappointing fifth-place finish even killed off the consolation of Champions League qualification. To make matters worse, Liverpool crawled home a massive 19 points behind Man United - a 22-point swing in fortunes between the rivals from either end of the East Lancs Road. Gerard Houllier oversaw a drop from second in 2001-02 to fifth in 2002-03 when he was Liverpool boss . It would be another six years before Liverpool again stove for the dizzy heights of the Premier League summit. The 2008-09 campaign was widely considered the best under Spanish manager Rafa Benitez, even though he had clinched Champions League glory with that famous fightback in Istanbul in 2005. Liverpool finished with a club-record Premier League haul of 86 points. They may have trailed Sir Alex Ferguson and United by four points in the final reckoning, but Liverpool had been top in April and Anfield was again filled with promise for the season ahead. The implosion, however, was spectacular. Just 12 months later, a team which had threatened so much under Benitez was languishing seventh in the table. Rafael Benitez saw an even greater slump after his Liverpool team came in seventh after a runners-up finish . Liverpool finished second in 2008-09 but languished in seventh in 2010 . It was their lowest finish in 11 years and Liverpool could not crawl beyond the fourth round of either domestic competition. And after working so hard the season before to qualify to be among Europe’s elite, they did not even progress to the knock-out stage of the Champions League. At the end of that season, the club announced they had terminated Benitez’s contract and so began the farce that was Roy Hodgson’s doomed reign. In the decade before Hodgson strolled through the door at Anfield, there had been moments of majesty. The Champions League victory in 2005, in particular, brought back memories of Liverpool’s glorious past. But, something was missing; there was no league title. And for a club built on their dominance of the domestic scene, it was a bitter pill to swallow. The pain looks likely to continue. Liverpool have struggled for creativity since the departure of last season's 31-goal top scorer Luis Suarez . Liverpool finished second last season but have started poorly this time round, stuck in 11th . Many predicted trouble for Liverpool after Luis Suarez, last season’s 31-goal top scorer, wiped away his tears, packed his bags and strode off into the sunset for a new life at Barcelona. Perhaps, though, nobody expected it to be quite this bad. After finishing just two points away from winning the league last season, Liverpool have won just two of their opening five matches. And the drama of Tuesday night’s record-breaking penalty shootout success over Middlesbrough will fool nobody. Brendan Rodgers’ side were pushed to exhaustion by a Championship outfit. In the modern age, whenever a club fails to secure success expected of them, then finance - or lack of it - is usually thrown up as the excuse. Liverpool detest comparisons with United, but the Old Trafford outfit are often the perfect example. Big summer signings Adam Lallana (left), Lazar Markovic (centre) and Dejan Lovren are yet to shine . While Liverpool’s title challenges only ever seemed to last one season, United have come close one year only to then to march to the title the following season. United finished second in 1995, 1998, 2006, 2010 and 2012 but lifted the Premier League trophy each following May. The key to United’s resurgence has been their willingness to invest and reinvent each time they have looked like losing their way. Failure has been the breeding ground for subsequent success. Nobody can accuse Rodgers of refusing to spend in the wake of Suarez’s departure to Barca for £75m. Aston Villa's Gabriel Agbonlahor celebrates scoring the winning goal against Liverpool at Anfield in September . He splashed out more than £100m on nine players in the summer, but there has been a glaring absence of pay-back for that investment. Mario Balotelli, Adam Lallana and Dejan Lovren have all failed to shine while Liverpool have again struggled in defence and shown a glaring lack of creativity in front of goal. Perhaps as well as the burden of history, Liverpool’s players feel the weight of expectation. After 25 years without the title by the time this season ends, the clamour for success grows ever greater with each passing season. It was a millstone which similarly hung around United’s throats until Ferguson smashed it to pieces in 1992. It was the arrival of Eric Cantona in the December of that season which eventually inspired United to run away with the title with an astonishing 10-point margin. Maybe when the transfer window reopens, Rodgers will have located the marquee signing to replace Suarez and finally banish those Anfield demons.","Liverpool have fallen away badly the two seasons after they finished runners-up in the Premier League .

"Former captain Chris Gayle has risked the wrath of the West Indies Cricket Board by describing Dwayne Bravo and Kieron Pollard's World Cup omission as 'ridiculous' and 'victimisation'. West Indies announced a 15-man squad on Saturday for the global tournament, set to start in Australia and New Zealand next month, but left out all-rounders Bravo and Pollard. Gayle, no stranger to stand-offs with the board in an often vexed relationship over recent years, believes the absence of the two Trinidadians leaves the Windies without their 'strongest team'. Chris Gayle (front) hits a six for the West Indies against South Africa in Johannesburg on Sunday . The big-hitting opener was speaking after his match-winning 90 as the tourists completed a Twenty20 series success over South Africa. He asked: 'How can those two guys not be in the team? 'To me it (has) got to be like victimisation when you look at it towards those two guys. 'Come on ... it is just ridiculous ... (it has) really hurt ... just sad. 'We don't have our strongest team without Pollard or Bravo. 'It is a really big blow for us to actually lose two key players.

'I don't know what's the history behind it, but it is a ridiculous selection from my point of view ... with two of our biggest players in ODI cricket not involved in the 50-over format and the World Cup.' Pollard and Bravo have also been left out of the squad for a one-day international series against South Africa. Bravo was among the 12 players also named on Saturday as recipients of central contracts. Gayle, in the West Indies' World Cup squad, declined his annual deal.

"Chris Gayle produced another spellbinding innings as the West Indies completed a record chase in a Twenty20 international to seal their three-match series against South Africa. Gayle followed up his 77 from 31 balls in the first game of the series by smashing 90 from 41 balls - an innings containing nine fours and seven sixes - as South Africa's 231 for seven was chased down in spectacular style with four balls and four wickets to spare.

Du Plessis came to the wicket when Morne van Wyk fell to Sulieman Benn in the first over and proceeded to take the West Indies attack apart. The 30-year-old hit the second-fastest T20 century from 46 balls and ended up with 119 from 56 deliveries, smashing 11 fours and five sixes before finally picking out Bravo in the deep off Jason Holder.

But the West Indies made a savage reply to their daunting run chase, losing Dwayne Smith (17) leg before to Marchant de Lange but reaching an incredible 86 for one in their six-over powerplay with Kyle Abbott, in particular, in the firing line as he conceded 68 runs from his four overs.

"India hung on to draw the fourth and final Test against Australia in Sydney as Ajinkya Rahane and Bhuvneshwar Kumar frustrated the home bowlers. Australia appeared on course for victory as India slipped from 178 for two to 217 for seven but, on a pitch that had offered little throughout, the decision to take the new ball soon after the seventh wicket had fallen backfired for captain Steven Smith with his bowlers unable to find any further movement. That allowed Rahane and Kumar to steer the tourists through to the close, with Rahane finishing on 38 not out and Kumar an unbeaten 20, with India 97 short of their victory target as they made 252 for seven.

Taking the new ball was a rare mis-step from Smith, who was named man of the match and man of the series after taking over from Michael Clarke, who was injured in the first Test. Smith has steered Australia to an emotional 2-0 series win after the death of Philip Hughes prior to the series opener. 'I thought we were going to get there, but unfortunately we didn't,' Smith said on Sky Sports 2. 'There was a little bit of spin and a few opportunities that didn't go our way. It was one of those days. The wicket was still playing pretty well, for the fast bowlers it was still up and down, and I thought the boys toiled well today. 'It's been a good series for me, batting out there and captaining these boys. I've had a great time. We couldn't quite get home today but I've really enjoyed being able to captain the boys throughout this series.' After Australia declared on 251 for six at the close of play on Friday, India were set a target of 349. Murali Vijay's 80 helped them set a solid platform and raised hopes of a push for victory as he guided them to 177 for two before edging Josh Hazlewood behind. But Australia were starting to find some reverse swing and they would soon converting their chances. Smith - pictured holding the Border-Gavaskar trophy - is could be bringing in a new dawn of Australian cricket . It had looked as if the hosts would win comfortably after Mitchel Starc (left) took the wicket of Virat Kohli . When Virat Kohli followed for 46, pushing Mitchell Starc into the slips, the wickets began to fall quickly, with Suresh Raina and Wriddhamin Saha out for ducks and Ravichandran Ashwin making just one. At the end of the next over, with India on 218 for seven, Smith took the new ball, and Australia's chances swiftly dried up as they went back to bowling short deliveries. Rahane and Kumar saw off 12 overs before handshakes signalled the end of the match. 'It has been a hard fought series,' India captain Kohli said in the presentations. 'We wanted to play hard cricket, give a fight, and that is what the boys have done. In Adelaide, and even today we thought we had a chance, but Australia kept coming back. 'The way they have composed themselves after the (Phillip Hughes) incident and come out is commendable. At tea time, I was not 100% sure if we wanted to go for the target. After Vijay got out, I thought why not take a chance, we are not coming back here for a while, if it does not happen it does not. 'The intent and character the side is showing is important. These guys have stepped up and shown they have the character and game at the international level, Rahul especially after the kind of debut he had. It is tough in Australia, I have experienced that before.' Both teams will now turn their attentions to the coming World Cup, but for Australia this was a series win made all the more significant for the poignant tributes to Hughes throughout. 'It certainly has been very sad to lose one of our good mates,' Smith added. 'Throughout the whole series we've tried to do our best to win this series for Philip and we've done that. It was an outstanding job to win 2-0.'","India lose the series in Australia 2-1 after draw at the SCG .

"England have not been blessed with many batsmen who thrive under pressure in one-day internationals but they may have found one in James Taylor. For all the talk of the potential power hitters such as Alex Hales, Jos Buttler and newly-installed captain Eoin Morgan, England will need someone like Taylor at No 3 to hold together an innings if they are to regularly post the 300-plus totals that will be necessary at next month’s World Cup in Australia and New Zealand.

He said in a statement on his official website: 'I am really disappointed to announce that I had to withdraw from the Australian Open. Right shoulder injury, that hampers me for some time now and forced me to withdraw from the ATP event in Brisbane, is improving day by day, but I still don't feel fit enough to be able to compete at the highest level. 'I am really sad that I won't be able to participate in Melbourne, especially after winning the last grand slam in New York, but I was advised by doctors to be careful as much as possible to avoid even more serious problems. 'I have received lots of support letters from my fans worldwide lately and I am grateful for your support and best wishes. I was really looking forward to be back on court in Australia and now I hope we will meet very soon in Zagreb.' Ward is the first British male singles player other than Andy Murray to earn direct entry into a Grand Slam since Tim Henman at the 2007 US Open. James Ward has gained a place in the main draw as a consequence of Cilic's absence . The 27-year-old is on the cusp of entering the top 100 for the first time, currently sitting at a ranking of No 101 with few points to defend until March. British men who will have to go through qualifying at Melbourne Park next week are Kyle Edmund, Liam Broady and Brydan Klein. Heather Watson is the only British female in the main women's singles draw, while Johanna Konta and Naomi Broady bid to qualify. Laura Robson will be absent in Melbourne as she continues her rehabilitation from wrist surgery, with the 20-year-old expected to return on the second-tier ITF circuit next month.","US Open champion Marin Cilic out of the Australian Open .

"A Chris Gayle masterclass led the West Indies to a four-wicket win in the first of three Twenty20 internationals against South Africa. Rilee Rossouw’s half-century helped South Africa to 165 for four in Cape Town but it proved insufficient as Gayle hammered 77 off 31 balls, with eight sixes and five fours. Marlon Samuels added 41 and though South Africa took it to the last over, the tourists’ victory with four balls to spare was comfortable. Chris Gayle hit 77 off 31 balls, including eight sixes and five fours, in the West Indies' clash with South Africa . The remarkable Gayle salutes the crowd after reaching his 50 in Cape Town . Morne van Wyk pulled the third ball of the match, Sheldon Cottrell’s leg-side half-tracker, for six but South Africa took only nine from the first two overs. Reeza Hendricks was trapped plumb lbw by Cottrell’s yorker for 12 and Van Wyk (17) edged Jason Holder to Chris Gayle at slip to leave South Africa 33 for two. Faf du Plessis hit three fours off Holder in the eighth over and a four and a six off Ashley Nurse in the ninth. He then hit Andre Russell for six and four to move to 38 from 19 balls - only to sky the next straight to mid-off where Darren Sammy took the catch. The hundred came up in 13 overs and Cottrell dropped Rossouw at short fine leg before having David Miller (24) caught at deep cover by Dwayne Bravo. Rossouw exacted full punishment by reaching 51 from 40 balls and Farhaan Behardien added 18 from 12. Cottrell (two for 33) and the economical Holder (one for 20) were the pick of the bowlers. Gayle sparked the Windies’ response with sixes from successive Kagiso Rabada deliveries, the second a monstrous blast over wide long-on. South Africa bowler Imran Tahir celebrates taking the wicket of Dwayne Smith on Friday . Francois du Plessis plays a shot off Jason Holder during the Twenty20 match . South Africa's Rilee Roussow plays a shot off of a Dwayne Bravo delivery . He added another off Kyle Abbott and hit the unfortunate Rabada for 14 in three balls to move to 33 from 12 balls, having run just a single. Dwayne Smith got in on the act with back-to-back fours, the first bringing up the 50 partnership in 27 balls. Four, six, four and four from successive Wayne Parnell deliveries took Gayle to 53 from 17 balls - the joint-second fastest half-century in T20 internationals, beaten only by Yuvraj Singh’s 12-ball assault on England in 2007 which included six sixes from one Stuart Broad over. Smith (20) was dismissed lbw by Imran Tahir’s first ball, though replays suggested a touch of glove. Rabada was warmly applauded after returning with a dot ball against Gayle, who then hit back-to-back sixes off Tahir before being caught behind off an ill-advised reverse sweep. Marlon Samuels and Bravo kept the run rate ticking until the latter was deceived by Parnell’s slower ball and chipped to midwicket, with Samuels then bizarrely giving a pad-bat catch to backward point off Tahir. Russell and Ramdin holed out to long leg but Kieron Pollard finished the job with a boundary.","South Africa hosted the West Indies in the first of three T20 matches .

"Ivo Karlovic stunned top-seed Novak Djokovic in the Qatar Open quarter-finals on Thursday. The big-serving Croatian beat Djokovic when they last met in 2008 and played through a sandstorm to repeat the feat in Doha. 'He served very well,' Djokovic said after going down 6-7 (2), 7-6 (6), 6-4. 'But you could expect that. I was coming into the match knowing that I will have very, very few chances. Novak Djokovic struggled to contain his frustration as he lost to Ivo Karlovic in Doha . The Serbian suffered defeat in the doubles as well to complete his misery in Doha on Thursday . Karlovic made it back-to-back wins over Djokovic to set up a semi-final with David Ferrer . 'But I was hoping that these conditions and the wind will kind of give me some second-serve opportunities.' Karlovic managed an impressive 73 first-serve percentage, despite the swirling wind. In the third set, in which he served two aces and two service winners in the final game, he fared even better. 'I looked at him when he threw the racket and when he smashed the ball, so I knew that he was a little bit frustrated,' said the lanky Croat. 'I was just trying to stay calm.' He never offered Djokovic a break-point opportunity in the match, and took advantage of a second break point of his own in the seventh game of the third set with a perfect forehand pass. 'In these particular matches, one ball can decide a winner, and that was the case,' Djokovic said. 'I played a little bit too defensive in that game. Instead of kind of going through the ball, I just sent the ball back.' The lanky Croat edged a close encounter 6-4 in the final set to seal his spot in the last four . Karlovic served up another 21 aces as he chases down Andy Roddick . Karlovic added 21 aces to his resume for a career total of 9,062. This week, he joined Goran Ivanisevic (10,183) and Andy Roddick (9,074) as the only players since 1991 to serve more than 9,000 aces .

"On the day it was revealed Ben Morgan will almost certainly play no part in the Six Nations, veteran No8 Nick Easter provided yet another reminder of his timeless quality as Harlequins tamed Leicester Tigers with consummate ease. Easter may have won the last of his 47 international caps in England’s World Cup quarter-final defeat to France in Auckland almost four years ago, but at 36 he retains all the qualities which made him Martin Johnson’s first-choice No8 during his reign. On Saturday, playing his 250th match for the club, he was simply outstanding. Veteran No 8 Nick Easter put in a man of the match display as Harlequins kept their play-off hopes alive . Easter, who won the last of his 47 England caps four years ago, was outstanding for Quins against Leicester . His first-half off-load to put Danny Care in for a try was as good as anything seen in the Aviva Premiership this season and he deservedly won the man-of-the-match award in a high-class Quins back row which also included returning England captain Chris Robshaw and the hugely promising Jack Clifford. ‘Nick Easter’s off-load was not just world class, it was out of this world,’ said delighted Quins director of rugby Conor O’Shea. ‘We’ve been very, very fortunate to have Nick Easter at the club while I’ve been here. He’s a warrior. He may be old school in some ways, he challenges, but he plays at a level that very few people can. ‘The harder the going becomes, the better he plays.’ Danny Care impressed for Harlequins in front of watching England forwards coach Graham Rowntree . Danny Care breaks through a tackle to score his side's first try against Leicester on Saturday . Stuart Lancaster has steadfastly resisted calls to pick Easter since taking over from Johnson following the 2011 World Cup debacle, preferring to blood youngsters Morgan and Billy Vunipola. But with the clock ticking until the next World Cup, and Easter in the form of his life, it will be hard for him to ignore him much longer. ‘I’ve stopped speaking to Stuart about him because I’m banging my head,’ O’Shea added. ‘I don’t know what Ben Morgan’s injury is but Nick Easter wants to play for England. Stuart and I had a good long chat about him last year and his worry was always whether he would get to the World Cup with the ability to play with that sort of intensity and that pace and if he comes to the end of the season playing like that he will have a look at him. ‘I’ve no doubt in a few months’ time he’ll be more than ready but it’s not my choice.’ It remains to be seen if Lancaster will select Easter for his side’s opening Six Nations clash with Wales in Cardiff on February 6 but with two big European fixtures against Wasps and then Castres, Easter has two more huge stages to showcase his skills over the next fortnight. England captain Chris Robshaw (centre) made a winning return as he helped Quins to a bonus-point victory . Robshaw had been absent for the last five weeks as he recovered from a shoulder injury . Former England captain Lawrence Dallaglio in the commentary box was certainly in no about Easter’s qualities as he described him as ‘the best No8 in the Premiership’. Robshaw was hardly less impressive in his first game in four weeks following the shoulder injury which threatened his Six Nations participation and could yet require surgery. The England skipper carried superbly and, alongside the intelligent Clifford at No6, Quins’ back row completely outplayed the vaunted Tigers trio of Jordan Crane, Julian Salvi and Tom Croft. This was right up there with Quins’ best display of the season and, following an impressive run in Europe, they are hitting the second half of the season with real impetus. The deserved bonus-point win, sealed by substitute Tim Swiel’s 80th-minute try, moves O’Shea’s men up to seventh place in the Premiership table, just two points off the top four. Fly-half Ben Botica contributed 10 points for Harlequins with two penalties and two conversions . Every side above them will be looking anxiously over their shoulders. ‘We needed a win like this to get us buzzing,’ added O’Shea. ‘We needed that win more than Leicester.’ Care’s try was the pick of the game for Quins, simply for the brilliance of Easter’s pass out of Tom Youngs’ tackle, but Clifford also crossed for a well-worked first-half score and Marland Yarde capitalised on a wayward Owen Williams clearance to cross for the home side’s third try in the 46th minute. Ben Botica kicked 12 points for Quins with Williams kicking four penalties for a desperately under par Leicester side in front of 14,800 at the Stoop. ‘We got what we deserved,’ said Tigers boss Richard Cockerill. ‘You have to take your opportunities in games and we didn’t take ours. We weren’t accurate and it’s disappointing.’","England captain Chris Robshaw returned after five weeks out with injury .

"So much for the clash of the No 10s. The widely anticipated duel between Danny Cipriani and Stephen Myler was turned into a no-contest, as Sale’s pack pounded the champions into submission in Salford on Saturday. England head coach Stuart Lancaster was at the AJ Bell Stadium and he was given plenty of food for thought - but not the main dish that he would have been expecting. In the tussle for fly-half places in the national squad, Cipriani played with precision and authority, while Myler was undermined by Northampton’s troubles up front. Dany Cipriani (right) starred for Sale Sharks in their Aviva Premiership match with Northampton . Ross Harrison (centre) is embraced by team-mates after the Sharks beat the Saints 20-7 . This match came down to collective power and the Saints were emphatically out-gunned; bringing their seven-game winning run to a shuddering halt. The Sale forwards were dominant in the scrum and caused havoc with their driving mauls, as the visitors were undermined by an absence of specialist locks. The show of force from the hosts did not begin and end up front. Outstanding winger Will Addison turned the tide back in his side’s favour in the second half with a monster tackle on George Pisi, while Sam Tuitupou repeatedly left wreckage in his wake. Calum Clark and his fellow emergency second row Sam Dickinson both served stints in the sin bin as Jim Mallinder’s side strove in vain to repel the onslaught. The Saints could not get into the game until Teimana Harrison’s consolation try. Johnny Leota of Sale Sharks is tackled by Saints Lee Dickson (right) Calum Clark of Northampton Saints is sent to the sin bin by the  referee as Cipriani looks on . As the home pack took a firm grip on proceedings, Cipriani was able to unleash his outside runners with clever variety while showcasing his passing and kicking repertoire. As Myler waited in vain for opportunities to make his mark, Sale’s No 10 ran the show expertly —landing two penalties and two conversions despite a strong wind, before going off nine minutes from time with his job done. Asked about the fly-half sub-plot, ahead of the announcement of a revised England squad next Wednesday, Sale director of rugby Steve Diamond said: ‘Stephen Myler is a top player and Danny Cipriani is a top player. 'It’s unfair, certainly for Danny, that his selection for England comes down to the performance of the team all the time. They [Northampton] have a better team than us generally but today we got the upper hand and Danny played well. ‘Danny has been playing well all year and if he doesn’t get an opportunity, that is up to the selectors. Based on his performances in the last few months he deserves a shot.’ Cipriani deserves England recognition, according to Sale director of rugby Steve Diamond . Saints are struggling without several star players including Samu Manoa (2nd right) If he does not earn that shot, Sale are less likely to keep hold of Cipriani, who is out of contract at the end of the season, but Diamond added: ‘If he doesn’t get picked and he goes, we’ll find someone else. That’s the way it happens at Sale.’ The Cheshire club rose to seventh as the pack rumbled over from lineouts to produce tries for Eifion Lewis-Roberts and Dan Braid. Josh Beaumont demonstrated his ball-carrying at No 8, scrum half Chris Cusiter was a constant threat and Addison and Mike Haley troubled the champions with their pace and astute running lines. Northampton stay top but on this evidence, Dylan Hartley, Courtney Lawes, Christian Day and Samu Manoa cannot come back soon enough. ‘We look at our game and it wasn’t good enough,’ said Mallinder. ‘In the first half, we were pretty poor. There are parts of our game we need to work on. It’s a blip and we’re not happy with it but we’ll live to fight another day.’","Sale Sharks defeated Northampton Saints 20-7 in Aviva Premiership clash .

"Rory McIlroy, the world's No 1 golfer, experienced an awkward moment when he went to watch Ulster take on Connacht in a rugby match on Friday. The Ulster supporter was in the middle of a television interview with the BBC when the Neil Diamond song 'Sweet Caroline' was played over the public address system at half-time. McIlroy responded by smiling sheepishly, looking down at the ground and exclaiming 'Oh dear'. VIDEO Scroll down to see Wozniacki smash a 200 yard drive at her first attempt .

McIlroy endured an awkward moment 'Sweet Caroline' was played during his half-time TV interview at Ulster . The Ulster fans sang the song in a light-hearted reminder towards McIlroy's former fiancee Caroline Wozniacki . The Northern Irishman broke off his engagement to former world number one tennis player Caroline Wozniacki in May, the same week as he won the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth. McIlroy went on to score a rare title hat-trick later in the season, reeling off three straight victories in the British Open at Royal Liverpool, the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational in Ohio and the U.S. PGA Championship in Kentucky. The 25-year-old is having some time off before returning to competitive golf in the new year. 'I'm in my off-season so I can enjoy myself, enjoy my Christmas dinner and have a few drinks,' said McIlroy with a big grin. McIlroy (right) ended his relationship to the tennis star in May before winning the BMW PGA Championship . In May, McIlroy looks crestfallen as he faces the media for the first time since splitting up from Wozniacki . Wozniacki had announced their engagement earlier in the year via her Twitter account . As for the match itself, the hosts got back to winning ways in the Guinness PRO12 and moved up one place to fourth but they were made to scrap every inch of the way against Connacht. Pat Lam's visitors could have even snatched their first win in Belfast since 1960, but a tight and fairly dire affair ended 13-10 in the hosts' favour. The entire game on a wet and cold night saw just two tries, with Ulster winger Craig Gilroy getting over in the first half and then Connacht second row Aly Muldowney crashing over in the second 40 minutes. Ulster had led 10-3 at the break, but the westerners came back and, although they made off with a losing bonus point, will be rightly disappointed at not getting more from this one in a game which saw both sides missing front-line Ireland players who had been rested. The result halted Ulster's losing run of having been beaten in three of their previous four games, and got Neil Doak's men back on track towards their aim of making the play-offs - even though the performance was well short of where it should have been.

"Richard Meade was an unparalleled British Olympian, much admired by everyone from the Royal Family to welly-wearing enthusiasts at Burghley and Badminton. The three-time Olympic gold medallist, who died on Friday aged 76 after battling cancer since October, was the cornerstone of the British eventing team for 21 years and the country’s most successful rider at the Games. He will forever be identified with a glorious era for equestrian events in this country when, around the Seventies, huge television audiences would follow the exploits of the nation’s leading performers. Apart from himself — swooned over by some for his rugged good looks — there were diverse characters such as David Broome, Harvey Smith and Princess Anne. Richard Meade died on Friday aged 76 after losing his battle with cancer . Richard Meade watches on as Princess Anne stands beside him in 1971 . Meade (centre) chats to The Queen Mother at Badminton, as she pats his horse The Poacher in 1970 . The latter and her former husband Mark Phillips became close friends with Meade. Tributes on Friday also recognised him as a true gentleman, well respected by all echelons of the equestrian community. Meade not only became a nationally known figure, he also made household names of the horses he rode in triumph at the Mexico City Olympics of 1968 and in Munich four years later. In Mexico he rode Cornishman to win the team gold and in 1972 was upon Laurieston as he took both team and individual gold in Munich, where he also carried the British flag at the closing ceremony. British Eventing chairman Hugh Thomas said on Friday: ‘Richard, at the height of his powers, towered over the eventing world. His results far exceeded the innate ability of many of the horses he rode, and he was at his very best when riding at the major events and championships. Meade won three Olympic gold medals, one at Mexico City in 1968 and two at Munich four years later . British Eventing chairman Hugh Thomas said Meade 'towered over the eventing world' ‘Then he gave countless time and effort to supporting the sport he loved. His passing really does feel like the end of an era.’ The family name does, however, live on in the sport as his son Harry is an international eventer who won a World Championships team silver medal last year. Meade was born into a riding family in Monmouth — his parents were joint masters of the local hunt — and was mentored by his fellow Welshman Harry Llewellyn, who won team gold at the 1950 Games in Helsinki. After graduating from Cambridge and a spell in the army he made his Olympics debut at the Tokyo Games of 1964. It was in Mexico that he heroically clinched gold for the team, with his final clear round achieved despite a torrential downpour. Meade went on to become a respected administrator for the sport . Meade won Badminton in 1970 and 1982 and won gold at two World Championships . Meade nearly added to his Olympic medal tally by coming fourth in Montreal in 1976, but there were many other achievements in his career. He won the Burghley Horse Trials in 1964, and twice won Badminton, in 1970 and 1982. He also claimed gold twice at the World Championships. In 1972 he came third in the BBC’s Sports Personality of the Year. After his retirement as a competitor he became a respected administrator. There was also controversy, however, when the RSPCA expelled him in 2001 for trying to encourage hunting enthusiasts to join the organisation and reverse its opposition to an activity he supported. Meade enjoyed royal connections until the end of his life, partly though his sons, who are friends with Princes William and Harry.","Eventer Richard Meade died aged 76 on Friday after battle with cancer .

"I knew moving to rugby union would take me out of my comfort zone and that is definitely what has happened in the past couple of months, but I’m still more determined than ever to make it work. Even though I’m a player from league trying to learn a new sport, there has been a lot of hype around me and I’m expected to do something special every time I play, which is quite hard when I’m still working out the basics. I was under massive scrutiny when I was in the NRL in Australia, but that was different because I was established and knew the game. Since I’ve joined Bath, I know everything I do is being watched and dissected, which is no surprise to me given the build-up to my arrival and the way my season finished in Australia. Sam Burgess has relished his time with Bath thus far but knows he has plenty of learning ahead of him . Burgess played outside centre in his side's recent 17-8 loss to Leicester at Welford Road . Burgess admits the transition from playing rugby league in Australia (above) to union has been tough . When I’m on the field, those thoughts never enter my mind, but sometimes it’s hard to miss what people are saying post-match on social media and even just when I’m grabbing a brew at a cafe in Bath. The key is to not let all the chat affect my confidence in learning a new game which, quite frankly at the moment, I’m a novice at! I’ve been totally honest about my transition by admitting I’m finding it even harder than I expected. There’s no point me saying that it’s easy because it definitely isn’t. I understand now even more than I did before just how much work it’s going to take to be successful. I just need more time out on the field, in matches. It’s been useful to see the game as a back and as a forward. I’ve been playing at centre for the first team but I’ve also had a couple of run-outs for the ‘A’ team as a flanker and that has been helpful. It’s been like a very intense practice session really — out of the spotlight, with not as many people watching those games, so I can make mistakes and get away with them a bit more! Burgess is still learning his trade, especially in defence, after crossing codes from rugby league . There were a few thousand people at our home game, including a few boys from the squad who sat up in a box eating curry! At Exeter there was a crowd of 5-6,000, which was a great turn-out. But of course it was a bit of a change in occasion, after being in an unbelievable competition in the NRL and finishing with a Grand Final win in Sydney. I had to see the games in a different way; as a learning process to help me develop my skills. In my first ‘A’ game, there was a guy from London Irish who gave me a bit of stick. We were in a ruck and he was giving it to me, saying, “You don’t know what you’re doing”. He was probably right, so I just said, “Maybe not, but I know how to tackle, so run at me and we’ll see how it goes!” It was good banter. Burgess admits to struggling with certain technical aspects with the lineout (above) proving a big challenge . Meditation became a valuable tool for me when I was playing rugby league in Australia and it’s a technique I’ll carry on using for the rest of my career. I was quite sceptical when we first started meditating at South Sydney, but I began to connect with the people who were doing the sessions so I bought into it. It was all about opening up our minds and talking to each other a bit more, and also about clearing your own mind in terms of being calm and ready to perform. We used techniques to bring ourselves back down to a calm level if we found ourselves getting frustrated or lost confidence during a game. Since joining Bath, I’ve been having sessions with Don Macpherson, who works with F1 drivers and other sportsmen, and lives two minutes away from me. I find it really helpful. It helps me stay calm, keeps my blood pressure down and keeps my mind focused. It’s even helped me to go easier on refs when decisions go against me! I truly believe that meditation was a big part of our success at Souths. Just before the biggest games of the year, the guys would be laughing and joking, but then everyone would switch on and be in the right mental state to play. As I see it, the brain is a muscle and I’ve got to train it like I train other muscles. At Bath, it’s been helping me to visualise the game and accelerate my learning. You train your brain with little triggers so when you get into certain match situations, your mind subconsciously knows how to react. It is really useful for me during this transition phase. I had mentally prepared myself for the fact that there would be a change in the number of plays I would be involved in during games, but it’s still been tough to get used to. The amount of distance covered is similar to what I was doing in league, but in union there is lot more kick-chasing, running off the ball and getting back into position. Last weekend at Leicester, I think I touched the ball once in the first 40 minutes, so I had to keep my hands warm! People who follow and play league don’t quite understand it. My mates have been taking the p*** out of me about it. They were having a laugh because it showed on TV that I’d made 15 metres, or something like that. If you did that in league, it would be embarrassing. It’s just different; I’m finding there are less opportunities in union and you don’t have as much space to play with between the lines of defence. Union is more of a mental, tactical game and I’m enjoying the strategic side of it. I like to describe it as a game of chess (to all my mates in league reading this!). I’ve found the rucks hard to get used to, but I’m starting to learn all the sneaky little tactics. I remember my first ruck against Quins; I carried the ball, ended up on the floor on my side and the next thing I knew I was being kneed in the forehead by my own team-mate cleaning the ruck. I felt like road-kill! It’s such a different experience to being tackled in league, but a fun one. I’ve found the scrums hard too. I couldn’t be a prop — there’s so much pressure on their bodies in there. When you get a seven or eight-second scrum, you really know about it afterwards. My respect for those guys (and their ears) is through the roof. The best pair of ears I’ve seen are Hoops’ (Bath captain Stuart Hooper’s) so far — they’re a cracking set of cauliflowers! Burgess has plenty of new-found respect for the Bath forwards including skipper Stuart Hooper (above) People have been very interested in what position I’m playing, but to me there isn’t a big difference. At 12, I stand a bit wider in defence and at No.6 I have to push in the scrums and sometimes I have to go in the lineout. That’s about it in my mind right now. Another thing people are focusing on a lot is when — or if — England might pick me. I’ve not heard anything from Stuart Lancaster with regards to selection. Andy Farrell, who was a great idol of mine growing up, has given me a call to see how I’m getting on. I’m sure the coaches will have their eyes on a lot of players at the moment, so I’m just going to do as much as I can to be in contention. I came here to chase a challenge, and it’s delivering.

"Alan Pardew was celebrating the perfect Selhurst Park homecoming last night - and then revealed that the first person to congratulate him after Crystal Palace’s 2-1 win over Spurs was Mike Ashley. Pardew walked out on Newcastle just days before returning to Palace so was delighted to pick up Ashley’s message minutes after the final whistle. ‘When I checked my phone after the game the first person who texted me was Mike Ashley and I appreciated that,’ he added. ‘He knew that probably it was the right time for everybody concerned. Alan Pardew clenches his fist in celebration after Crystal Palace's 2-1 win over Tottenham . Pardew celebrates with his backroom staff during Crystal Palace's victory over Tottenham . Mike Ashley was the first person to congratulate him after the win, according to Pardew . ‘He just said it was a great result and I appreciated that.’ Pardew soaked up the applause from a thrilled home crowd who had seen Palace bounce back from a Harry Kane opener to win courtsy of a Dwight Gayle penalty and Jason Puncheon. But Pardew reckoned the masterstroke was the half-time introduction of Adlene Guedioura to stifle the life out of Tottenham’s midfield and late arrival of Wilfried Zaha off the bench to run the visitors ragged. ‘I just felt we needed more maverick behaviour in the team and that was the reason for the sub at half time and then Wilf came on and gave us the exact reaction I was looking for,” Pardew said after the 2-1 win. 'I left him out to see what his reaction would be. This is a boy whose confidence I think really has to be rekindled and today will do him no harm, those 20 minutes were electrifying. ‘I don't know muich about Guedioura but he was the difference. Dembele was getting too much time on the ball and he stopped him playing. 'In the end it was our discipline that saw us home. We had all the attributes of a great victory and an eventful 90 minutes that has worked out really well for us. I am glad it ended how it did with us having a few more chances.'

Pardew has swapped relentless derision and criticism from Newcastle fans at St James’ Park for the unwavering support of the Selhurst Park crowd and he harnessed their voices by rousing their cheers in the final minutes as Palace worked hard to complete the triumph. But the former Palace player knows how quickly things in football can change and how fickle football fans can be so he’s refusing to get carried away with a tough trip to fellow relegation fighters Burnley next weekend. 'Football has highs and lows,' he said. 'Spurs put one of the performances of the season in against Chelsea last week and then come here and get beaten by Crystal Palace. 'It will be the same for us if we lose to Burnley, it changes quickly and keep your feet on the floor. It is not straight lines in this game and turning up on time and eating the right food. It is about having a bit of maverick about you somewhere and this team needs a bit of that and today we found it just in time. 'We have a few but it can be withdrawn and I think you can get a bit negative with bad results and your maverick players start playing a bit sensible. You have to get the balance right and second half we did.'","Alan Pardew said Mike Ashley was first to congratulate him after win .

For most of the unpredictable evening, his self-control had been impeccable, but now his inhibitions were cast aside, and it was impossible to blame him. In Pardew’s first Premier League match as their manager, Crystal Palace had achieved the victory which had escaped them since November. And they had done it against a Spurs side which so recently buried Chelsea beneath five goals. As one who played for the club, Pardew knew precisely what it meant and how significant it might prove. Hence his Hollywood parade from dugout to tunnel.

But after his consistent rejection by Geordie fans, the acclaim which erupted around Selhurst Park will be ringing in his ears for some time yet. He took some pleasure in pointing out that Newcastle owner Mike Ashley had been the first person to text his congratulations after the match. But then, after Jason Puncheon scored the late and priceless goal which lifted Palace beyond the bottom three, Pardew took pleasure in everything. For everything which could go right had gone just perfectly. By contrast, Mauricio Pochettino was suitably subdued. Spurs had fallen short of their standards and paid a heavy price. Moreover, they had conceded a genuine penalty, then been denied an equally genuine award. He correctly identified the penalty debate as the turning point, but had the class to remark: ‘Referees have a very difficult job.’ Never a man to sell himself short, Pardew set the tone with his programme notes: ‘I’d like to thank Steve Parish and the Palace board for working so hard to get me here.’ His reception was a great deal warmer than anything he heard at St James’ Park. Tottenham passed the ball with greater confidence and moved with purpose in those opening stages, as befits a side coming off a momentous victory. But their chances were few, the football unconvincing. To their credit, Palace also passed it neatly, revealing little of the anxiety which must have attended their efforts. Yet they conceded a gaping chance in 26 minutes, when Kyle Walker drove a low cross and, in the ensuing confusion, Christian Eriksen managed improbably to hook the shot wide from four yards out. But an even more acceptable chance fell to Palace in 37 minutes, when the Spurs back four left Glenn Murray absurdly alone, 15 yards out. Hugo Lloris advanced, more in hope than expectation, and the flustered Murray drove the shot against the keeper’s right knee. Pardew looked fleetingly homicidal, and with some reason.

Kane scored yet again for Tottenham as the striker gave his side the lead at Selhurst Park in the Premier League match . Tottenham play from firm principles, building thoughtfully and refusing to resort to the witless launch. In Benjamin Stambouli, they offer a midfielder of persistent strength and bewilderingly brilliant feet. But they could not devise a position from which Harry Kane could reveal his form. That deficiency was remedied in 49 minutes, when Spurs demonstrated the finishing which separates the best sides from the toilers. Nacer Chadli rolled a ball to Kane 20 yards out, and form asserted itself as the striker’s low, impeccable drive brought the customary result. ‘He’s one of our own,’ sang the Tottenham contingent, and while the lead was gratefully accepted, it was barely deserved. By now, Spurs were starting to exercise authority. Chadli was producing genuine havoc with his surging runs, yet this was not a game to take for granted, for the 69th minute yielded another improbable turn. Joe Ledley hurried on to a short flick in the Spurs area, and the hitherto excellent Stambouli stretched to the tackle and appeared to win the ball. The referee Anthony Taylor gave the appeal an eternity of consideration, then jabbed a finger at the spot. There was pandemonium at the Palace as Dwight Gayle simply battered the penalty. By now, we were prepared for anything. And so was Pardew., . The crucial goal was withheld until the 80th minute. Palace substitute Wilfried Zaha attacked from the left with a mazily tenacious run. His pass enjoyed a fortunate break to Puncheon on the fringe of the area, and the drive was strong and precise. Had justice prevailed, Ledley’s trip on Kane would have produced a second penalty and probable equality — both managers agreed that the claim was justified. But we sensed that Palace would escape, that the rare and precious victory would be their reward. And when Pardew set off down the touchline, emoting like a leading lady, we knew we were right.

"Mario Balotelli failed to impress during his second-half cameo – but the Italian wasn’t too impressed with Sunderland either.

"Morgan Schneiderlin was so enraged after being told Southampton would not let him leave in the summer that he considered boycotting training and matches. The midfielder felt hurt and cheated that he was promised an exit if the club sold their stars then when the mass exodus of their top players began he was forced to stay. When Schneiderlin left a meeting with Southampton's board on July 29, flanked by his two agents Pascal and Sebastien Boisseau, he was furious and exploded on social media, tweeting: 'Six years of an amazing journey DESTROYED in one hour!' Morgan Schneiderlin (centre) is challenged by Manchester United's Juan Mata at Old Trafford on Sunday . Southampton midfielder Schneiderlin (right) battles for the ball with Mata during the Premier League clash . It was either that or hurling a tear gas grenade back into the room, he joked afterwards when calm had restored. But keeping hold of the Frenchman has been the shrewdest piece of business – amongst many – that Southampton manager Ronald Koeman, chairman Ralph Krueger and the rest of the club's board made in the summer. And even the player himself. Speaking on Sky Sports after their historic win against Manchester United at Old Trafford on Sunday, Gary Neville said: 'I think he could play at any of the top clubs in the league, Chelsea, Manchester City, Manchester United or Arsenal – he's showed his quality this season. ‘You look at Schneiderlin and Jose Fonte today, there was no sweat on them. They're composed and organised.' Schneiderlin jumps above Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney (front) to head the ball . Schneiderlin (right) plays for Southampton in a Carling Cup match against Northampton Town in August 2009 . At the time of that July meeting, Tottenham were in pole position to sign him. Schneiderlin's agents had tried to ease the transition away from the club by informing them in February last year that he was interested in moving on, after almost six years of service since his £1.2million move from Strasbourg in June 2008. Then in the summer, in the space of two months, Rickie Lambert left for Liverpool, Luke Shaw went to Manchester United, then Adam Lallana and Dejan Lovren followed to Merseyside. Calum Chambers moved to Arsenal the day before the meeting. Tottenham were pursuing Schneiderlin; he desperately wanted to move there and assumed the deal would be finalised. But that door was slammed in his face. Adam Lallana (right) celebrates scoring for Liverpool against Leicester last month as Rickie Lambert looks on . Calum Chambers (left) in action for Arsenal at St Mary's earlier this month, while Manchester United's Luke Shaw (right) advances with the ball against Southampton on Sunday . In truth, the 25-year-old was often overshadowed by those others in Southampton's rise from League One, then the Championship – when he signed – and up the Premier League table. But Koeman has built a team around him; adding Dusan Tadic's dangerous creativity, Graziano Pelle's physical presence and finishing, a solid foundation behind of Toby Alderweireld alongside Jose Fonte, who has excelled this campaign, and Fraser Forster in goal.

He has come a long way from the 18-year-old who initially struggled to settle in England, with few French speakers in the team at the time, and even further from the teenager who would watch the Premier League on television with his team-mates – particularly Liverpool and Steven Gerrard his favoured team and player – at Strasbourg's academy. Now he considers England his second home.

"Kyle Walker has backed Tottenham to finally finish above north London rivals Arsenal and bring Champions League football back to White Hart Lane. Spurs were beaten 2-1 by Crystal Palace on Saturday, but it was a defeat that ended a run of form that had seen Mauricio Pochettino's side go unbeaten for seven Premier League matches. Included in that run was a 5-3 win against table-topping Chelsea - only their second defeat of the season - and a draw against top-four rivals Manchester United. Kyle Walker believes Tottenham have enough quality to finish above Arsenal this season . Walker challenges Wilfried Zaha during Saturday's 2-1 defeat by Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park . Tottenham have not finished above Arsenal in the league for 19 years, but Walker insists the squad has more than enough quality to match the Gunners this season. 'Arsenal are always going to be up there as they have fantastic players but so have we,' Walker was quoted as saying on standard.co.uk. 'We've got a dressing room full of internationals and good-quality players, who have shown this season what they can do.' Spurs have only ever competed in Europe's top club competition once - under Harry Redknapp in the 2010-11 season, when they beat Inter Milan and AC Milan on their way to a quarter-final exit at the hands of Real Madrid - and the England full back believes they can break the top four again.

'Champions League is where every player wants to be but the way we're going now, I think we can get there.

Tottenham have been notoriously poor against the big teams in recent seasons, but the club's form against them this campaign has given Walker cause for optimism. 'In recent seasons, we'd struggle to pick up points against the top teams and that's where we were struggling to bridge the gap but this season we've beaten Chelsea, drawn with Manchester United and Arsenal.'","Kyle Walker believes Tottenham have as much quality as Arsenal .

"Albert McPherson has passed away aged 87 . West Brom have paid tribute to their former first team and youth coach Albert McPherson, who died at the weekend. The Baggies announced on Monday that Salford-born McPherson had passed away the previous day aged 87. As a player he was a centre-half who made over 350 appearances for Walsall and skippered them through back-to-back promotions from the fourth to second tiers in 1959/60 and 1960/61. After leaving the Saddlers in 1964, he became trainer-coach at West Brom under Jimmy Hagan. McPherson worked with the first team for a couple of seasons, seeing the Baggies win the League Cup in 1966 and reach the final in the following campaign, and then switched to the club's youth and reserve system, remaining with them until the 1980s. West Brom's tribute on their website to an 'unsung hero' and 'Albion legend' ended with the words 'rest easy Albert', while Walsall's piece on the news concluded with: 'The thoughts of everyone here at Walsall FC are with his family and friends at this sad time. May he rest in peace.' Albert McPherson (right) trains for Walsall as a player before starting a coaching career with the Baggies .","Former Baggies coach Albert McPherson has died at the age of 87 .

"Ronny Deila has admitted he wants to reduce the size of his Celtic first-team squad. Currently scouring the market for reinforcements in the January transfer window, the Parkhead boss also intends to remove some dead wood if suitable offers come in. Beram Kayal and Derk Boerrigter have seen little game time this season, while Teemu Pukki and Amido Balde have been shipped out on loan. Keen to minimise the numbers of brooding, unhappy players around the dressing room, Deila said: ‘We have a big squad and I want, from a long-term perspective, to have a smaller squad. Ronny Deila is hoping to trim his Celtic squad during the January transfer window . ‘We have too many players and, in my mind, it’s much better to have 20-22 players of a good level and then fill it with youngsters, instead of having 28 or 29 players. ‘You can have experienced players about who are always disappointed. But it also costs a lot of money having big squads. ‘We have contracts with players but, if opportunities come, and it’s right for them and right for us, then things can happen. ‘I don’t have in my mind that something has to happen. But I think some of the players are looking and we are also thinking about things.’ Celtic fringe players Derk Boerrigter and Beram Kayal could leave Parkhead later this month . Israeli international Kayal’s contract is up in the summer and he is likely to leave this month to ensure Celtic receive a fee. ‘Right now, Beram is not playing and he has ambition,’ said Deila of the midfielder. ‘He has to get his fitness up and show performances. Then we’ll see what is happening. I have spoken with him and we both know the situation.’ Dutch misfit Boerrigter, a £1.5 million signing from Ajax, returns from yet another injury this week, but has failed to set the heather alight. ‘Derk has been out now for two or three months but I think he’s starting training again on Thursday,’ said Deila. 'He has a lot to prove to me. He has been out a long time. Kayal (left) has made 13 appearances for Celtic so far this season . ‘When he played at the start of the season, he had a pain in his knee. Hopefully, now everything is good, we can see the best from him. ‘If he shows in training that he is good enough then we’ll see. But, again, we have to put out the team we feel is best. It’s for him to prove himself.’ Portuguese striker Balde is also surplus to requirements after leaving Belgian club Beveren to go on loan at Hapoel Tel Aviv in Israel. There is also little prospect of Pukki being brought back from Brondby in Denmark. ‘Something has to happen for them. Both are out on loan just now,’ added Deila. ‘If they perform very well, then we have to consider what is happening. But there’s a reason why they have been loaned out.’ Kris Commons won't be joining Celtic for the final couple of days in Gran Canaria . Kris Commons, meanwhile, has abandoned plans to fly to Celtic’s Gran Canaria training camp following a family bereavement. Talks on the midfielder’s contract are anticipated this week, but he will play no part in Friday afternoon’s final friendly of the trip against Sparta Prague. ‘Kris will not be coming because the funeral was yesterday,’ said Deila. ‘There are only two days left of our trip and I don’t think it’s best for him to come out. ‘He will train at Lennoxtown, then he will be ready to rejoin us on Thursday. ‘Against Sparta, it will be a young team featuring a lot of the players who didn’t play last time.’","Parkhead chief wants to trim first-team squad to as few as 20 players .

"Second try: The Justice Department decided to again seek the death penalty for convicted cop killer Ronell Wilson with a new jury rather than let the defendant serve an automatic life term . Convicted cop killer Ronell Wilson, who fathered a baby with a former prison guard, is facing the prospect of capital punishment once again, but sentencing him to death will cost New York taxpayers millions of dollars. The Justice Department, after learning that an appeals court threw out a death sentence for Wilson in 2011, decided to again seek the ultimate punishment with a new jury rather than let the defendant serve an automatic life term. Court officials say since then, at least $1.6million in taxpayer money has gone to his defense - and the meter is still running. Wilson has been convicted in the brutal slaying of two undercover police officers James Nemorin and Rodney Andrews on the night of March 10, 2003. He was initially sentenced to death, making Wilson the city's first federal defendant to receive a death sentence since 1954, when it was imposed on a bank robber who killed an FBI agent. But the appeals court reversed the decision, saying that prosecutors violated Wilson's constitutional rights by telling the jury his decision to go to trial demonstrated his lack of remorse and refusal to accept responsibility. After Wilson won his appeal, Judge Nicholas Garaufis cautioned lawyers he had just presided over a capital case for a mobster where the defense bill was $5million. It ended with the jury choosing to impose a life sentence. ‘If I'm going to spend four months of my career and millions of dollars of taxpayers' money trying another one of these death penalty cases, I need to know the attorney general wants to try it,’ he said. New lease on life: An appeals court threw out a death sentence for Wilson in 2011, saying that prosecutors violated his constitutional rights . Questioning whether it was worth . pursuing the Wilson case made sense, given the city's track record in . federal death penalty case, said Richard Dieter, executive director of . the nonprofit Death Penalty Information Center. ‘It's . hard in New York City to have a jury return a death sentence,’ Dieter . said. ‘Judges there often look at that and ask, `Why would you spend all . this money?'‘ . It's a boy: Former prison guard Nancy Gonzalez, who became pregnant with Wilson's  baby, gave birth to a son in March . Under . similar circumstances, the Justice Department has decided not to retry . the penalty phase of capital cases at least four times since the federal . death penalty was established in 1988, according to the nonprofit. But, without explanation, Attorney General Eric Holder authorized the U.S. attorney's office in Brooklyn to move ahead. How . much that decision will ultimately cost is unknown. A 2008 study found . that the average cost of defending a federal death case is more than . $620,000. By the time the appeals process plays out, that total . typically tops $1million, Dieter said. So far in the new proceedings, . Wilson's lawyers - who, by law, can be paid up to $178 an hour - have . had him examined by several experts in a failed bid to have him declared . ineligible for the death penalty because he's mentally disabled. Jury selection lasted five weeks. And the penalty phase is projected to take at least a month.But . under the circumstances, the expense of the proceeding is worth it, . said Michael Palladino, president of the Detectives Endowment . Association. ‘This . particular cop killing is one of the most egregious I've ever seen,’ the . union official said. ‘There were two victims, and (Wilson) knew exactly . what he was doing. ... I understand the concern about cost, but . sometimes you must move forward with what is right.’ Reckoning: Gonzalez is expected to plead guilty to having sex with an inmate as part of a deal with the prosecution . Wilson’s legal odyssey picked up again . in Brooklyn last week with the start of the repeat of penalty phase of . his case, which so far is playing out in a mostly empty courtroom with . grim-faced jurors listening to witnesses recounting the circumstances of . the case by rote. ‘I . asked, “Why did you do that?”’ a cooperating accomplice, Jesse Jacobus, . recalled about a conversation with Wilson after the shootings. ‘He told . me he didn't give a (expletive) about nobody.’Wilson - once a . scrawny street gang member nicknamed Rated R - appears in court these . days wearing glasses and dress shirts appropriate for a college . classroom. But the . 31-year-old often looks distant and disengaged, and away from court he's . demonstrated a cynical streak that defies his life-or-death . predicament. In . February, officials revealed that after being transferred from federal . death row in Indiana to a Brooklyn lockup to await the proceedings, . Wilson fathered a child with jail guard Nancy Gonzalez, who gave birth . to a baby boy in March. Slain: Detectives James Nemorin, left, and Rodney Andrews, right, were gunned down by Wilson during a drug bust gone awry in Staten Island in 2003 . Disturbing: Wilson scribbled rap lyrics on a piece of paper around the time he killed two undercover cops, writing in part that he would put '45 slogs in da back of ya head¿ and ¿I ain't goin stop to Im dead' She is expected to plead guilty to having sex with an inmate on Monday at a federal court in Brooklyn. There's also evidence that while he and Jacobus were behind bars together, Wilson instructed him to try to win sympathy from the jury by saying they had a ‘rough upbringing.’ Jacobus, who pleaded guilty, is serving a 15-year to life term that he is hoping to get reduced by cooperating. The . new set of jurors, though not deciding Wilson's guilt, have once again . heard about the fate of two New York Police Department officers who were . posing as illegal gun buyers. The . pair met with Wilson for what they thought was a deal to buy a Tec-9 . submachine gun. But Wilson decided to rob them instead and ended up . shooting both in the head as one pleaded for his life.Once again in . evidence is a scrap of paper Wilson was carrying when he was arrested. It had the rap lyrics saying that if he was ever crossed, he would put . ‘45 slogs in da back of ya head’ and ‘I ain't goin stop to Im dead.’ Costly battle: Court officials say at least $1.6million in taxpayer money has gone to Wilson's lawyers and to cover other expenses associated with the government's push to have hm sentenced to death . Wilson, ‘to impress members of his gang, to raise his status, blasted hollow-point bullets into their brains,’ prosecutor James McGovern said this week in opening statements. ‘They deserved a life. Now if justice is to be done, the defendant does not.’ The defense will counter with anecdotal evidence of Wilson's troubled background as the son of a crack-addicted mother living with a dozen relatives crammed into an apartment at a crime-infested housing project. In his opening statement, defense attorney Richard Jasper recounted how during childhood, Wilson also endured time in a psychiatric hospital, where he told a worker that he wanted to die. Deciding his client's fate would be ‘the most important decision of your entire life,’ the lawyer told jurors, saying that letting him die ‘on God's time and not man's time’ was the best option.'","Ronell Wilson, 31, had appeals court throw out his death sentence in 2011 .

"Three Bears investor George Taylor threw his weight behind plans for Rangers supporters to purchase a say in the running of the club on Sunday night. Hong Kong-based Taylor has lined up with Douglas Park and George Letham in an alliance of businessman battling for control of the troubled Ibrox outfit. American banker Robert Sarver has also launched a £20million takeover bid, with proposals for £6.5m of emergency funding included. Rangers beat Dumbarton earlier this month with Dean Shiels (right) wrapping up a 3-1 victory at Ibrox . Sharing the interests of former director Dave King, who has also purchased 14.5 per cent of the club, Taylor is now the second biggest individual shareholder with 9.3 per cent and echoes the view of fellow investor Letham - a member of the Rangers Supporters Trust - that fans should run the club. The Morgan Stanley managing director has now signed up a lifetime membership with fan ownership group Rangers First. ‘As I’ve said, my hope is that direct fan ownership would become the biggest individual owner of Rangers,’ said Taylor in a statement released on Sunday. Taylor is the latest high-profile figure to encourage fan ownership after wealthy supporter Jim McColl gifted his 10,000 shares to Rangers First last week. Felix Magath purchased a one per cent stake in finacially troubled Rangers last week . The group have witnessed a surge in membership, with 700 new members signing up since the Three Bears and King made their recent power push, acquiring an effective hold of around 34 per cent in the club. Rangers First now own around 0.8 per cent, with another fan ownership scheme run by Rangers Supporters Trust holding just over one per cent. A four-week radio recruitment campaign will be launched by Rangers First on Monday as they seek to raise cash to buy up more shares and hold talks with key stakeholders. Their support could help the Three Bears and King edge closer to the 51 per cent they need to effectively seize control of the Rangers boardroom and push through change via an anticipated EGM. Phoenix Suns owner and financier Robert Sarver increased his Rangers takeover bid to £20million . Rangers First director Ricki Neill said: ‘With our monthly contributors donating amounts from £5 upwards, Rangers First have the income to buy an increasing number of shares every month. ‘The more members we get the faster we grow and the bigger our shareholding becomes. ‘We also have the Club 1872 membership which George Taylor has recently joined. This costs £500 and was designed originally to help us reach our target in as short a period as possible. ‘George Taylor is one of many true Rangers Fans that have joined Club 1872. We look forward to meeting up with George in the near future.’ Dave King bought a 14.5 per cent share in the club this month and is keen to protect the club for the fans .","Rangers fans want to hold a say in the club by owning shares .

"John Guidetti has set his sights on becoming the first Celtic striker to score a hat-trick against Rangers in 41 years. Celtic’s top scorer has gone six domestic games without a goal - and limped out of Saturday’s 1-0 defeat to PSV Eindhoven in Gran Canaria with a dead leg. Rubbishing talk of a scoring crisis or a loss of form, however, Guidetti insisted his confidence in front of goal remains sky high. And looking ahead to next month’s League Cup semi-final, the Swede said he wants to become the first Celtic striker to score a hat-trick against their fierce city rivals since Harry Hood at the same stage of the same competition in 1973. Celtic striker John Guidetti is determined to net a hat-trick against Rangers at Hampden Park next month . Asked if he fancied himself for a goal at Hampden, the on-loan Manchester City star said: ‘I fancy three. That is what I did against Ajax when I was with Feyenoord and that is the aim this time. ‘The dream would be to score - but the most important thing is we win against Rangers. Big games are what I love the most. That is why I wake up in the morning.’ Guidetti’s form has shaded since a prolific start to life in Glasgow, claiming 11 goals in his first 12 games. His Manchester City contract is up next summer and Celtic have first call on his services in a permanent deal. Denying that negotiations over his future are affecting his on-field focus, however, the striker added: ‘I am not part of that. My agent is speaking with the club. Guidetti has failed to score for the Scottish champions in six matches but his confidence remains high . ‘I want to play football and I am really happy here. Everyone knows I love it at the club. ‘It’s between my agent and the club so I leave them to it. I let my agent do his job. ‘It’s not affecting me at all. It’s not like I am thinking I don’t want to score because of my contract. No, that would be stupid. ‘My agent will do what he does best - being an agent. He doesn’t tell me to take the ball with the inside of my foot on the pitch, so I don’t tell him how to do his job. ‘You don’t bring an electrician into your house and tell him how to fit the plugs. ‘It’s his job and I trust him to do what is best. ‘I am not worried. I am just so happy to wear the Celtic shirt. The rest will work itself out, it always does. ‘I’ll just try to stay fit and strong and the goals will come back. Everyone can be calm.’ The Manchester City loanee is aiming to become Celtic's first hat-trick hero against Rangers in 41 years .","John Guidetti has failed to score in six matches for Celtic .

"He is the multi-millionaire who couldn’t get anyone at Rangers to answer his calls. The ambitious bidder who tried, in vain, to block the cut-price sale of Lewis Macleod to mighty Brentford. A man with a track record in running an elite sports team within budget, Robert Sarver found two attempts to gain control at financially-ruined and forever-endangered Rangers thwarted by those clinging to power — and by rival-shareholder blocks who would rather do things their own way. Will he be back with a third offer? Well, for a man apparently ruling out a return to the fray, Sarver sounded just a little too upbeat and positive as he took to the airwaves on Monday night. Even as he was delivering some pretty damning criticism of the current Ibrox regime. US businessman Robert Sarver made two offers for Rangers but his calls to the club's board were ignored . The managing partner of the Phoenix Suns National Basketball Association franchise had clearly invested some degree of thought in how his financial might and major-league expertise could benefit an ailing SPFL club with a huge potential fan base. That all his optimism and obvious ability to fund a Rangers renaissance should apparently be ignored by the current regime is almost beyond belief. Yet Sarver insisted: ‘I really never could get them to engage meaningfully in any discussion. ‘At the end of the day, I guess that’s why I formally withdrew my bid — because I couldn’t get them to the table. I never received a counter-offer or any discussion of substance. ‘I knew their issues were short-term funding and that they didn’t want to dilute the current shareholders. ‘But those two things are really hard to do at the same time because the club, as most people know, needs funding. ‘Listen, there are no guarantees of success in sport. All you can do is put your best foot forward, make sure your club is capitalised properly and put the best coaching staff in place to make the best decisions — give it your best shot. ‘That’s what I was prepared to do. Sarver attempted to block the cut-price sale of Lewis Macleod to Championship side Brentford . ‘My plan was to kind of permanently capitalise the club over the next two to three years — so it had the best chances of being successful and getting back to being one of the top two teams in the Scottish league.’ When any businessman talks about being willing to ‘capitalise’ a company, what he means is invest money in pursuit of growth. That was clearly on the agenda of a man who firmly believed the relative stability of his basketball team could be emulated at Ibrox. ‘Definitely,’ he said, adding: ‘The thing about these sports clubs is you may own them — but they really belong to the community. So you are really more of a custodian. ‘And it’s all about winning. That’s the only reason you get involved in professional sport. ‘I’m a professional guy, my stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange. The banking company and the Phoenix Suns records are in the paper every day. ‘So it’s full transparency — and all about winning, creating sustained success.’ The current Rangers board remain in negotiations with the Three Bears consortium, while former director Dave King’s recent acquisition of a large stake in the club further complicates matters. Rangers went into administration in February 2012 and were later relegated to the Scottish Third Division . Meanwhile, the club do not have the cash to pay off a manager serving his notice, never mind start recruiting for a head coach capable of steering them to promotion. And few would be shocked if more talent was sold off before the month is out. Sarver insisted that both of his offers would have allowed many of those putting together their own bids to remain part of the project. He also revealed that his initial £18million package had one very interesting condition attached. ‘As part of the condition of that first offer, I had it in there that they couldn’t sell any players,’ he said. ‘The day after I submitted the offer, they sold one of the more promising young players (Macleod). So that deal was kind of crushed. ‘My second offer was intended to provide more flexibility. So what I intended to do was loan £6.5m for the short-term cash flow issues, then give the board the discretion to sell me between £16m and £20m of equity as they saw fit. ‘So they could minimise the dilution if they wanted or they could sell me more shares and put more money in the club. ‘The £6.5m was a loan. That would have been repaid through the share issue. The new capital going into the club would have been between £16m and £20m — and then the additional money that I would offer to pay to buy out any shareholders. ‘But my hope was that most of them would stay in. Under the law of the London Stock Exchange, you have to make that offer to all the shareholders.’ Asked outright if he would be back with a third bid, the 52-year-old said: ‘I have to be careful with all these securities rules you guys have other there. ‘It’s hard to do somewhat of a hostile deal from 5,000 miles away. It’s really not my style. ‘I was just really trying to be helpful to the club and the fans, and say: “Hey, I’ll bring in a bunch of capital. And we do have some pretty good expertise here at the Suns”. ‘There are a lot of areas I thought we could help in. Our strength and conditioning, our experience with fan engagement and interaction, our analytics group and things like that. And let’s combine that with a world-class coach, manager, and executive, and let’s give the team the best possible chance. ‘That was really, simply, my goal.’ As part of his £20m offer, Sarver was willing to hand Rangers an emergency £6.5m loan . Sarver again insisted he hadn’t been acting as a front for other investors unwilling to show their faces, admitting: ‘To be honest, I understand the concerns of the fans because of all the trials and tribulations the club has been through. So they have every right to be sceptical. ‘But everyone kind of over-read my interest. It was really, really simple. It was just my family looking to make an investment in soccer. ‘We had hired a firm and we were going down the path of looking for an investment in either England or Spain. At the time, while some of that information was sitting on our coffee table, my kids’ soccer coach, Davie Robertson, was looking at it and said: “Hey, you’ve got to look at this team I played for. The timing is great: they really need the money, they really need some help. You ought to look at it”. ‘The more I looked at it, the more I liked it. It is as simple as that. There was no other story. ‘I had never met anybody, who had ever had anything to do with the club. ‘I’m a believer in the idea that basketball and soccer are two great long-term investments. ‘Because they’re the only two major sports played internationally, wherever you go, and they’re both played by men and women. ‘So soccer has been of interest for some while. It’s the sport of choice for my three sons. That’s why my interest was piqued.’ He sounds like a man still interested in the game. Still able to put some struggling club back on a sound footing. If only someone would take his call.","Robert Sarver has made two offers for Rangers .

Charlie Austin, QPR (PPI score: 33.1) Austin was again on target for Harry Redknapp's men on Saturday - coolly dispatching a first-half penalty against his former side Burnley - although it was all in vain as they fell to a 2-1 defeat against their relegation rivals. The 25-year-old put in another tireless display, completing 18 out of the 21 passes he made (85.7% completion rate), while also making two clearances and one interception for his side. 8. Paul Konchesky, Leicester (PPI score: 33.5) The experienced defender was sent off in the corresponding fixture against Aston Villa earlier in the season, but the 33-year-old was the difference this time around curling in a wonderful effort - his first for the club - to secure the Foxes a hard-earned win against Paul Lambert's side. Charlie Austin celebrates converting his first-half penalty against his former side Burnley on Saturday . Paul Konchesky (left) drilled his shot home with aplomb from the edge of the box to earn Leicester victory . 7. Oscar, Chelsea (PPI score: 34.7) The Brazilian playmaker was on target for the first time since November for Jose Mourinho's men on Saturday, scoring the opener as they edged past a battling Newcastle side. The 23-year-old successfully completed 30 out of 39 passes in the opposition's half, again impressing as Chelsea went two points clear at the top of the Premier League. 6. Harry Kane, Tottenham (PPI score: 36.9) Tottenham's talisman notched his 18th goal of the season at Selhurst Park on Saturday evening, as he yet again displayed his predatory instincts in front of goal. Despite giving the visitors the lead the north Londoners eventually fell to a disappointing 2-1 defeat, although through no fault of Kane, who again impressed in a lone role upfront.

Harry Kane was again on target for Tottenham giving the north London side the lead at Selhurst Park . 5. Saido Berahino, West Bromwich Albion (PPI score: 37.1) The England Under 21 international continues to produce the goods for Tony Pulis' side - most recently scoring the all-important winner against fellow strugglers Hull City on Saturday. Berahino played the full 90 minutes, proving to be a real livewire throughout, completing 21 out of the 24 passes he attempted in Hull's half. The 21-year-old has 14 goals in 25 appearances for the Baggies so far this season. 4. Jason Puncheon, Crystal Palace (PPI score: 39.9) After being out-of-sorts earlier in the season, the Palace winger now seems to have picked up some form. The 28-year-old scored just his second goal of the season against Mauricio Pochettino's side - earning his side a precious three points in the process. Puncheon impressed throughout the match, completing 31 out of the 34 passes he attempted on the night (91.2% average), proving to be a real menance to the Spurs defence. 3. Dwight Gayle, Crystal Palace (PPI score: 41.8) Ever since he was recalled to the Palace starting line-up, Gayle has proved to be a real attacking threat for the south London outfit - scoring twice in as many games. The 24-year-old kept his composure when it mattered most, converting a crucial second-half spot-kick for the hosts to level proceedings, scoring his fourth Premier League goal of the season as a result. As well as being a threat to the opposition, he also carried out his defensive duties efficiently, making two clearance and one interception.

Diego Costa, Chelsea (PPI score: 46.1) The 26-year-old yet again showed his class on Saturday, with his swivel and shot putting the game out of Newcastle's reach at Stamford Bridge. The former Atletico Madrid striker now has 16 goals in all competitions for club and country so far this season - including four in his last seven games for Jose Mourinho's side. 1. Alexis Sanchez, Arsenal (PPI score: 66.2) By some clear distance the former Barcelona forward is EA Sports' No 1 player this week. The Chile striker was unsurprisingly the Gunners' stand-out performer in Sunday's win against Stoke with yet another scintillating display. The 26-year-old continued his brilliant run of form against the Potters with a goal and assist during the opening half at the Emirates.

"Nice have called on FIFA to use 'sporting logic' and allow Hatem Ben Arfa to play for the club this season. The former Newcastle United forward – released from his contract earlier this month – was prevented from making his debut for the Ligue 1 side after it emerged he has already played for two clubs this season. Nice, however, argue that Ben Arfa's appearance for Newcastle was only in an Under-21s match and the English FA have supported their claims by stating that the game was not recognised as an official fixture. Ben Arfa was released from his contract at Newcastle earlier this month after falling out with coaching staff . The French forward signed for Ligue 1 side Nice soon after, but has had his debut delayed by FIFA rulings . Ben Arfa also played for Hull City this season, but failed to make an impact and had his loan deal terminated . Ben Arfa also turned out for Hull City during an unsuccessful loan period and FIFA rules state that a player can only represent two clubs during one season. But Nice have released a statement, saying: 'The return to this country of the French international has not yet been sorted out from an administrative point of view due to the fact brought to light by our own federation with FIFA, despite an initial positive and unequivocal response from the English federation. 'OGC Nice wishes to quickly resolve this issue and that the sporting logic prevails so that we can bring our new recruit into the squad for this Friday's trip to Bordeaux. 'In a period where the general feeling is one of disappointment at seeing a talent-drain, the club hopes to be able to count on the support of the national bodies to facilitate the return of an international to France.' Having been one of French football's brightest prospects, Ben Arfa cut a forlorn figure on the Hull bench .

"Everton boss Roberto Martinez admits it was a relief that his side managed to scrape an FA Cup third round replay against West Ham after last week's clash at Goodison Park ended 1-1. The two sides meet again on Tuesday night at Upton Park as they go head-to-head for a place in the fourth round, where a tie against League One opposition Doncaster or Bristol City await. A week ago Romelu Lukaku scored a 92nd-minute equaliser as Everton looked to be heading for an early exit and Martinez said it felt like a victory after the match.

'It's still only a draw but when you are the team that gets the equaliser late in the game, it can feel like a victory. In the same way, when you concede late on, it can feel like a defeat.'

"They may have to wait until July for the arrival of Frank Lampard, but New York City fans were treated to a new signing on Tuesday; Rosenborg midfielder Mix Diskerud. The 24-year-old Norwegian-born American joins on a free transfer ahead of the start of the MLS season in March, and will travel with the squad to England next month for two friendlies at Manchester City's academy. Speaking to the club's website following the announcement, New York City's Sporting Director Claudio Reyna said: .

"Hatem Ben Arfa could have to wait until next season before making his Nice debut. The 27-year-old was released from his contract with Newcastle United earlier this month before signing for the Ligue 1 club. But the France Football Federation (FFF) have not yet given Ben Arfa clearance to play. This is because FIFA rules state that a player can only represent two clubs in any one season. Hatem Ben Arfa signed for Nice after having his contract terminated by Newcastle United earlier this month . Ben Arfa, in action last season, had impressed at Newcastle, but his form dipped and he fell out with staff . Ben Arfa struggled to make an impact while on loan at Hull City and was criticised for his lack of discipline . Ben Arfa turned out for Newcastle's Under 21 side in August before a loan move to Hull City. His stint at the KC Stadium was short-lived, however, and the former French Footballer of the Year turned out just nine times for the Tigers before manager Steve Bruce decided to let him go. The FFF have now passed Ben Arfa's case to FIFA. Despite his reputation as a flair player, Ben Arfa did not manage a single goal or assist for Hull .

"Toulon will attempt to lure Danny Cipriani to France next season if the fly-half is left out of England’s Six Nations squad in the new year. According to reports in Midi Olympique — the French publication often used as a mouthpiece by Toulon owner Mourad Boudjellal — the Top 14 side want to bring in the Sale No 10 after missing out on All Blacks icon Dan Carter. Cipriani is out of contract in the summer and Sportsmail understands that he could be tempted by a move to the south of France if he is overlooked at England’s squad announcement next month. Negotiations are ongoing with Sale, and the 27-year-old has been in fine form for the high-flying Manchester club, prompting calls for the playmaker to be given an international recall after missing out on the autumn Test series. French Top 14 side Toulon are planning a raid to sign English fly-half Danny Cipriani . The player’s agent, Oliver Ward, told Sportsmail that no discussions have yet been held with Toulon, contrary to reports that a visit to the club’s facilities has already been agreed for early next year. ‘The rugby agents in France are more akin to football agents here, so I’m sure there are a few touting his name around,’ said Ward. ‘As far as we’re concerned, there has been no official contact with Toulon and talks are advancing really well with Sale.’ Cipriani  is Sale’s top earner on £250,000 per year, but French clubs have considerably more spending power. Last week, Racing Metro outbid Toulon to sign Carter on an annual salary of more than £1million. Cipriani is out of contract in the summer and could fancy a move to the south of France if omitted by England . The prospect of working under Jonny Wilkinson would no doubt appeal to Cipriani, who would be viewed as a direct replacement for the out-of-contract Nicolas Sanchez and James O’Connor. Cipriani’s high-profile personality would be a perfect fit for Boudjellal’s galactico vision. The tycoon has already signed All Black midfielder Ma’a Nonu, saying that ‘he’s a great centre and he’s got great looks. At Toulon, we love this’. Harlequins, too, have been linked with a move for Cipriani, but the London club have already signed Australian James Horwill as a marquee player and Kiwi No 10 Nick Evans still has one year remaining on his £320,000 contract. Racing Metro outbid Toulon in the race to sign New Zealand icon Dan Carter . No formal negotiation can be made until January 1 under Premiership Rugby regulations, but overseas-based players can be approached, with Bath yesterday completing a deal for Fiji scrum-half Nikola Matawalu. But Leicester were dealt a double blow as Welsh targets Liam Williams and Justin Tipuric both extended their deals with the Scarlets and the Ospreys. Williams revealed on Twitter: ‘Pleased to announce I have signed for @scarlets_rugby for another two years! #WestIsBest #KeepingTheDreamAlive’.","Toulon are planning to bring in Danny Cipriani from Sale Sharks .

"Ronny Deila has opened the door to a third spell at Celtic for Scotland star Shaun Maloney. Out of contract at Wigan this summer, Maloney was the subject of a failed £750,000 bid by Leicester City last week. Manager Malky Mackay revealed, however, that ‘four or five’ clubs were interested in the former Parkhead attacker. Celtic are interested in signing Scotland and Wigan forward Shaun Maloney (left) The Wigan attacker has spent two previous spells at Parkhead . Speaking from Celtic’s winter training camp in Gran Canaria, Deila admitted the Scottish champions could be one of them. Keen to infuse his side with a hardcore of experienced, older Scottish players, the Norwegian said of the Maloney situation: ‘I am aware of all the Scottish players. He is a good player and is one we know about. He is at Wigan at the moment but we will wait and see. ‘I have seen him many times. He is a quick, creative player and is a very good person with a great mentality. He looks like a Celtic player.’ Wigan are holding out for £1million in the current window. Deila has seen Maloney excel in the 4-2-3-1 formation he likes with Scotland, however, and could make a move even if current playmaker Kris Commons signs a new contract. Celtic manager Rony Deila is understood to be one of 'four or five clubs' tracking Maloney . The Hoops manager wants to introduce more homegrown players, like Scott Brown (centre), into his side . ‘I have always had six or seven older players in my team,’ he continued. ‘You can have a lot of (young) talent but it is insecure without leaders and they won’t develop. That’s why guys like Broony (Scott Brown) are so important.’ Commons’ agent Martin Reilly has been invited to Parkhead for fresh talks aimed at breaking the stalemate surrounding his contract situation. Celtic are blanking calls from Neil Lennon’s Bolton in the hope of working out a deal to keep Commons – who is expected to fly to Gran Canaria after a family funeral. Asked if the player will stay, Deila said: ‘It’s hard to say, only he can answer that. We are going to meet his agent next week when we get back. He is an important player and we want to keep him.’ Also reluctant to lose £8m-rated defender Virgil van Dijk, the Celtic boss remained confident of ending the transfer window with a stronger squad. Kris Commons is yet to sign a new deal at Celtic amid interest from former boss Neil Lennon at Bolton . Dutch defender Virgil van Dijk (right) is on the radar of several clubs south of the border . ‘I am confident we will be stronger by February,’ he said. ‘I speak regularly with Peter (Lawwell) and he has one goal - to keep every player we want to keep. It’s vital the squad is stronger. This is not the time to lose players, we want to bring them in.’ Having been linked with Dundee United trio Stuart Armstrong, Nadir Ciftci and Gary Mackay-Steven, Deila joked: ‘I will buy the Dundee United team, and Aberdeen as well. That’s one way to do it, we could buy all of their strikers. But things are happening all the time. We are in a much better situation than we were in the summer.’ Deila has also been linked with a raft of his former players in Norway, but is wary of importing any more of his countrymen after the failed loan capture of Jo Inge Berget. ‘I would choose to bring in Scottish and English players, especially in this window as they need to be able to make a difference straight away,’ he admitted. ‘British players know what the Scottish game is all about. ‘If I was to bring in a Norwegian player they would have to be very strong. It’s difficult to say if they are good enough so I would be anxious about bringing one in. Celtic are wary of signing more Norwegian players after failed bid to land Jo Ing Begret (2nd right) ‘It’s something we saw with Jo Inge. Other managers have brought in Norwegian players who have been successful but it’s safer to bring in home players. ‘I have been impressed with the technique of the Scottish players, but also the attitude. They have a good mentality. It’s difficult for teams made up of different nationalities. It’s more individualistic in Scotland whereas in Norway it’s more systematic. If we can get a mixture of both then we can do very well. ‘We are not going to have the best players in Europe - but we can have the best team. That’s what we are working on every day.’","Shaun Maloney would be welcomed back for a third spell at Celtic .

"When the occasion demands, Scott Brown is still eminently capable of getting in an opponent’s face or delivering a sharp rebuke to a team-mate. Yet, as the Celtic captain approaches his 30th birthday, there is a growing contemplative side to his character. This maturity has manifested itself not only in a more considered playing style for club and country but also his prodigious bid to become a coach. Brown recently penned a new contract with Celtic and has no intention of hanging up his boots any time soon. But, just as he has had to reform his game from the high-energy approach that brought him praise and notoriety as a kid at Hibs, he realises he needs to look for a vocation to sustain his attention when he is no longer capable of performing at the top level. Scott Brown has shown a growing maturity as the Celtic captain approaches his 30th birthday . Brown is currently with his Celtic team-mates on a training break in Gran Canaria . The prospect of Brown the manager may be a long way off but he has been taking a hands-on role with Stevie Frail’s Under-20 squad at Lennoxtown and has even been spotted in the dugout during a handful of SPFL Development League fixtures. He is enjoying the responsibility, even if it doesn’t seem so long ago that he first bounced into Bobby Williamson’s Hibs team and started ruffling feathers. ‘I look at how I was then and how I am now,’ reflects Brown during a break at Celtic’s training camp in Gran Canaria. ‘At 17, I would look at guys like Gary Smith who was 34 and say: “Jeez, he’s got two years left in him — I’ll never be like that!’. ‘Now, I’m coming to 30 and I’m starting to think more about what I’m going to do after I stop playing. ‘It’s not just about training then going home and chilling out. I look at the whole picture differently. I appreciate things a lot more now.’ As part of a talented group that included his friends Kevin Thomson and Steven Whittaker, Brown’s introduction to first-team football was aided by a gang mentality. First Williamson, then Tony Mowbray, tended to deploy him on the front foot to exploit his running power but, over the years, his role has changed and he is now effectively a screening midfielder. Where once Brown’s distribution could be erratic, he is now a crisp and careful passer of the ball and one whose job is to shape play rather than shake it up. ‘I started off as a striker, so I’m getting further back,’ he laughs. ‘I had a freedom at Hibs — I was young and I would run into anything, tackle anyone, but now I understand the game a lot better. ‘It’s about getting on the ball and playing rather than putting pressure on people. It’s a totally different style of play. ‘I’ve enjoyed playing centre- midfield for Celtic more than anything. I enjoy getting on the ball, taking it off defenders and starting things more than I ever did chasing down the goalie or chasing left-backs around the pitch.’ Brown is all smiles as he relaxes by the pool during some time downtime . Brown feeling the heat during a session at their training base in Gran Canaria . While Brown has been cutting his coaching teeth with Celtic’s development squad, those same players are having their education enhanced by the odd training session with the first team. Several, including Liam Henderson, Joe Thomson and Calum Waters flew out to Maspalomas with the first-team squad last Tuesday and their presence has raised the tempo on the practice field. ‘People always say that it’s hard for the younger ones coming into training but it’s actually harder for the older pros to keep up with them,’ admitted Brown. ‘They are keen, they are willing to go and they bring so much energy that it brings out the best in the older players. I still play to win and these kids do, too. ‘Hopefully, they will learn something from me and, if they do, that’s amazing. But I’m only 29 and there’s a new manager who has come to Celtic with new ideas. I’m learning myself.’ While team-mate Kris Commons’ dithering over a contract extension suggests a reluctance to commit to the Ronny Deila era, Brown’s new deal can be taken as a sign that he is on board with the Norwegian. Deila favours a game-plan which sees the team press the opposition high up the pitch and, while his younger self might have revelled in the chance to close down defences, Brown’s current role has taken some adjustment. ‘Everyone has different ideas,’ he adds. ‘The way we play with Celtic is totally different to what we do with Scotland, yet it’s the same formation. ‘So I have Gordon Strachan on one hand and Ronny on the other, and I have to adjust my game when I go to play for Scotland. It’s good to have that ability to adjust.’ It was Strachan who paid £4.4million to take Brown to Celtic but, asked to nominate the most important managerial influence on his career, Brown chooses neither he nor one of the other obvious candidates such as Mowbray or Neil Lennon. ‘Of them all, Bobby (Williamson) has got to be the one,’ he states. ‘He gave me my chance to go and play, to come through and show what I could do. ‘You will always remember your first manager more than any of the others. He is the one who put that trust in me at the start. ‘Next came Tony and we played brilliantly under him at Hibs. Gordon showed his faith in me by buying me for Celtic and later it was the exact same under Neil. I was his captain and I’m now playing under Ronny. You take bits and bobs from them all.’ Celtic captain Brown is closed down on the ball by team-mate Aidan Nesbitt (right) 29-year-old Brown forced off during a friendly against PSV Eindhoven in Gran Canaria . Deila has fully endorsed Brown’s foray into coaching and it is expected that, in time, he will assume some duties with the first team. For now, the arrangement is informal but Brown is enjoying the opportunity to offer advice to a new generation. ‘Stevie Frail has been great. He lets me come in when I like, even if it’s just to have a wee chat with the lads,’ he says. ‘He is very positive about what I’m doing and the kids have been brilliant, too. I’ve been with them for four games and they’ve won four times, so it has been going well. ‘The coaching has helped me understand the game more. I’ve always looked at the game from a midfielder’s point of view and I’ve tended to look forward. Working with Stevie, I’m learning to look back. ‘I’m understanding how to close the park down and show players onto a different side — all the things you hear every manager talking about. ‘Starting my B licence let me see that it’s not all about chucking cones out or wee, short games in training. It is about how you manage players — respecting the older pros and how you treat the younger ones.’","Scott Brown still eminently capable of getting in an opponent's face .

"John Collins has urged Celtic to grant Ronny Deila time to deliver his Parkhead blueprint. The Norwegian has endured a troubled start to life in Scottish football, with Aberdeen top of the Premiership by a single point. Speaking as the Scottish champions began a winter training break in Gran Canaria, assistant manager Collins called for patience and backed Deila to deliver an attractive, winning team. ‘We want to build an attacking team that scores goals and plays at a high tempo, creates chances, one-twos, phases of play,’ he said. Ronny Deila and his Celtic squad jetted off to Gran Canaria this week . Deila hopes Monday night's win at Kilmarnock can reignite their title charge . ‘But it’s not just a case of pushing a button and that’s what happens. It takes time. ‘There are obstacles and setbacks along the way. But, if we all stick to our principles, we will get there.’ Four points adrift before Monday night’s clash with Kilmarnock at Rugby Park, the champions reduced the deficit with a strong performance in a 2-0 victory. Some have questioned the timing of Celtic’s decision to exercise their option to take a one-game break and spend the week in the Canaries, but Collins is not concerned with the team’s league position. He insists that performance is as important to the management as points. ‘People analyse results — and the results haven’t been great,’ he admitted. John Collins gives out instructions during training at the Salobre Golf Resort in Gran Canaria . ‘There have been periods in games where we have created so many chances, but not taken them. ‘We analyse the performance. We need to win games to stay in the job and keep people happy. But we are both development coaches — not just results coaches. ‘If we play badly and win 3-0, we look at each other and say the same thing — we are not quite happy. ‘We are not fulfilled and that’s not going to change — it’s just the way we are. ‘We want to see performances, we want to see the players develop.’ Conceding that supporters will show little understanding or patience if the league title is in doubt going into the last two months of the season, Collins added: ‘We are not going to change the supporters. Collins says Deila deserves more time to make his mark at Parkhead . ‘But we want to win and we want to win in a certain way — we do not want to win ugly.’ The 46-year-old, meanwhile, has delivered a stinging putdown to Michael Stewart after the Sportscene analyst used an online podcast to criticise Collins — his boss at Hibernian between 2006 and 2007. Stewart, who was one of the alleged ringleaders in an Easter Road player rebellion against the coach, claimed last week: ‘Collins had a great career and was a great player — and within five minutes he’d lost the Hibs dressing room because of his demeanour and stature.’ Asked to comment, Collins deadpanned: ‘Michael who? Michael won’t be saying anything nice about me. I left him out of a Cup Final. That’s all I’ve got to say.’","Ronny Deila has come under fire after stuttering start to the season .

"Napoli head coach Rafael Benitez has pointed the finger at assistant referee Elenito Di Liberatore for his side's 3-1 defeat to Juventus on Sunday. Benitez was fuming regarding one pivotal decision made by the linesman in the game at the San Paolo stadium. With the contest tied at 1-1, Juve's Martin Caceres headed Andrea Pirlo's free-kick past Napoli goalkeeper Rafael to put the visitors ahead in the 69th minute. Rafael Benitez was left incensed after he saw his Napoli side drop points to rivals Juventus . However, TV replays show Caceres and team-mate Giorgio Chiellini were in an offside position and the goal should have been disallowed. 'Juventus are a very strong side, but it's not hard to see Chiellini's white shirt and especially that bandage on his head with Caceres behind him,' Benitez told the Italian press. 'Against Juve it is always like this. 'We were in the game but the offside goal changed everything and we had to chase again.' Juventus defender Martin Caceres celebrates scoring from Andrea Pirlo's free-kick to put his side 2-1 up . Replays showed that both Caceres and his team-mate Giorgio Chiellini were in an offside position . Napoli could not find an equaliser and it was Arturo Vidal that wrapped up the win for Juve deep in stoppage time. 'We give credit to Juve because they have quality and work hard, which is why they have been winning the scudetto for three years and will win again,' Benitez said. 'Our anger comes from the fact we could not compete on level terms due to these errors.' Chile midfielder Arturo Vidal seals the points for Juventus as The Old Lady sit top of Serie A . The loss, Napoli's first at home to Juve since 2000 and their fourth of the season, dropped Benitez' side to fourth place, one point adrift of third-place Lazio, who hold the last Champions League qualifying spot. Napoli travel to Rome on Sunday to face Lazio at the Stadio Olimpico.

"Fernando Torres is back home. He has returned to Atletico Madrid in a bid to rediscover his form and he certainly wasn't short of endeavour during his second debut for the club where it all started for the Spaniard. Having signed on loan from AC Milan until the end of the season, Torres was thrust straight into the Atleti starting line-up as he started the 2-0 victory over bitter rivals Real Madrid in the first leg of the last-16  Copa del Rey tie. The 30-year-old returned an impressive 91 goals from 244 appearances during his first spell at Atletico between 2001 and 2007 before moving to Liverpool. Here, Sportsmail runs through Torres' involvement during his first match back at the Vicente Calderon... Fernando Torres made his second Atletico Madrid debut during Wednesday's match with rivals Real Madrid . Torres shouts at the linesman after he is penalised for a foul on Real defender Marcelo . Raul Garcia (right) runs off to celebrate the opening goal as Torres clenches his first too . 5th minute: Torres is involved in the game for the first time and is flagged offside - rightly, as he was marginally ahead of Sergio Ramos - before trying to lob the on-rushing Keylor Navas in the Real goal. The chip, from the edge of the area, sails harmlessly wide but Torres' movement is impressive. 6th minute: The former Chelsea forward has put himself about in the early stages but, unfortunately for him, he has been just a little bit over-eager. He ends up giving away two fouls for mis-timed challenges. Torres (right) jumps to control the ball for Atleti as Real's Sergio Ramos looks on . The Spanish striker jumps highest in his own box to head clear during the Copa del Rey last-16 clash . 10th minute: This time Torres is miles offside but he slowly jogs towards the ball with the Real defence motionless as the linesman takes an age to lift up his flag. 12th minute: Torres gives away another foul as Ramos tries to run for the ball but the Atleti striker catches his Spain team-mate's heels and brings him down. 17th minute: After picking the ball up on the right-hand side of the box, Torres weaves in and out of a couple of Real defenders before having a shot blocked. That' his first sight of goal - well, when he's been onside anyway... Ramos (left) is fouled by Torres as both run and try to compete for the ball at the Vicente Calderon . 21st minute: The striker defends a Real corner well and blasts it clear. 23rd minute: As Antoine Griezmann advances with the ball, Torres makes a run in behind the Real defence but his French team-mate cannot find him. The Spaniard throws his arm down in frustration. He then runs deep into his own half, challenges well and advances into the Real half before being tackled by Marcelo. Torres is not happy about the challenge, but the referee waves away his protests. Torres waits for the ball to drop before attempting to control it during the Copa del Rey last-16 tie . 28th minute: Again Torres is caught offside. He is returning from an offside position but cannot get back onside before Raul Garcia's header reaches him. 30th minute: Torres is still putting himself about and he jumps to compete for the ball with Sami Khedira. A flailing arm sees him catch the German midfielder and he gives a foul away. Khedira responds in kind by pushing his arm intro Torres' face when the Spaniard tries to get round him 30 seconds later and the Real midfielder is cautioned as a result. The Spanish striker skips over a challenge from Ramos as he breaks clear of the Real defence . 41st minute: James Rodriguez sends in a corner for Real and Torres expertly heads clear to avert any danger. 42nd minute: Marcelo wins the ball off Torres who gives the Brazilian a small touch in the back. He falls to the floor and Torres is penalised. It's soft but it probably is a foul. Torres himself is then fouled by Alvaro Arbeloa, with the Spaniard also going down very easily. Torres tires to take on Real defender Marcelo during Wednesday night's match at the Vicente Calderon . 50th minute: Torres backs into Ramos on the right wing and a free-kick is given in the Spaniard's favour as he is brought to the ground. 51st minute: The striker leaps well in the middle of the pitch to get a little flick on to strike partner Griezmann, but the Frenchman's shot is high and wide. Torres looks round after being brought to ground by Real defender Raphael Varane on Wednesday night . 56th minute: Great use of his body and brilliant strength from Torres sees Atletico break down the right and it eventually creates a chance for Griezmann. 59th minute: Torres is clapped off the pitch and then given a congratulatory slap on the back by coach Diego Simeone as he is replaced by Koke. An industrious performance by Torres but he was caught offside far too regularly and was unable to muster a real chance of note all night. He will hope that a return to full fitness over the coming weeks will enable him to rediscover his best form. On the basis of this match though, that could be a long time coming... Scarves with Torres' named and number 19 were on display at stalls around the ground before the game . The result saw Torres finish on the winning side against Real as an Atletico player for the first time. Speaking after the game, he said: 'There was plenty to celebrate. The atmosphere was great and so was the performance but we know that taking a 2-0 to the Bernabeu is not enough to mean the tie is over. 'We will have to play just as well there to finish the job.' The scarves show Torres holding up the Atleti badge on his shirt and kissing it .","Atletico Madrid beat Real Madrid 2-0 in the Copa del Rey on Wednesday .

"Manchester United defender Marcos Rojo has caused fury after posting a picture of drug lord Pablo Escobar to hisInstagram account. On Saturday, the 24-year-old incensed many Colombians with the photo of the late cocaine king who was linked to hundreds of deaths in their country during the 1980s and '90s. Accompanied with the picture was a caption that read: 'Only those who went hungry with me and stood by me when I went through a bad time at some point in life will eat at my table.' Manchester United defender Marcos Rojo has sparked fury with an Instagram post of drug lord Pablo Escobar . Rojo uploaded the picture of Escobar - who was linked to hundreds of police deaths in Colombia . Rojo's post has been publicly slammed with fans writing online to show their disdain for the Argentina international's social media upload. Jamie Ortega wrote: 'Sh***y Argentines. They dignify Escobar because they didn't suffer the decades of pain our country experienced. I wish they'd had them in Argentina instead of here.' Andres Gonzalez concurred with Ortega's sentiments as he added: 'Simply seeing Escobar's picture is enough to generate disagreements of the deaths he caused.' Escobar was shot by police in Medellin, Colombia in 1993 after making an estimated £20billion. The 24-year-old Rojo has missed United's last six matches in all competitions due to a thigh injury . Rojo has missed United's last six games after sustaining a thigh injury during training ahead of their 3-0 win against Liverpool on December 14.

"Radamel Falcao arrived in England to much fanfare after completing a  loan move to Manchester United during the summer. However, with injury limiting him to just 12 Premier League appearances, Falcao has struggled for form and managed just three goals. United blogger Scott Saunders, who contributes to 90min.com, discusses why manager Louis van Gaal should steer clear of securing Falcao on a permanent deal. Radamel Falcao, pictured against Yeovil, is still fighting to prove himself in the Premier League with Man United . We’ve all learned by now that football’s transfer market can be an expensive, hit-or-miss business. With so much attention and pressure on today’s leading Premier League stars, many have and will continue to falter under the expectation. The latest man under the spotlight - who is still fighting to prove himself in the Premier League - is Manchester United striker Radamel Falcao. And it’s a battle he’s currently losing, much to the disappointment of Man United fans. Falcao, who is on loan from Monaco, has scored three league goals and largely struggled for the Red Devils . When news broke that the Colombian had signed last summer, supporters could have been excused spells of giddiness. The prospect of the former Monaco forward lining up alongside Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie was the stuff of dreams. With Angel di Maria making his way to Manchester just a week before, you’d have been forgiven for thinking Louis van Gaal was creating the Premier League’s version of Real Madrid’s ‘Galacticos’. The ‘Gaal-acticos’, they were christened. Doubt even crept in regarding how each player would fit in, with £37million man Juan Mata not even guaranteed a place in the starting XI despite only signing eight months before. Falcao and Angel di Maria (pictured) were christened the 'Gaal-acticos' at Old Trafford . Manchester United forward Juan Mata is not guaranteed a place in the Man United starting XI . The arrivals were an important statement, a message to the footballing world that the old Manchester United were back. The David Moyes debacle of the previous season was firmly put behind them. Inevitably with big-name acquisitions, it means big money. With Di Maria, Mata and Falcao, it was no different. The two midfielders have gone some way to justifying their astronomical fees - Mata’s goal and assist record is respectable, whilst Di Maria’s style of play is something United have missed since the days of Cristiano Ronaldo. The Argentine’s pace and directness will pay off. But in Falcao, heavy doubt remains. Since joining he’s looked a shell of the player that once destroyed Chelsea with a four-goal European Super Cup final haul. Of course, Falcao’s struggles with injury have had a huge bearing on the impact he’s made but three goals in over 650 minutes of football isn’t good enough for one of the world’s deadliest finishers, no matter which way you look at it. Doubt amongst Man United fans remains as to whether Falcao will be a success at Old Trafford . Falcao - especially recently - has been given first-team opportunities and shown little aptitude in terms of taking them. His first touch is often disastrous and while his ‘fox-in-the-box’ instincts don’t seem to have deserted him, United need a forward who will offer more in their build-up play. Given it will cost them around £40m to keep the player beyond this season - and throwing in to the mix the fact that Falcao turns 29 next month - it makes such an expensive transfer seem wildly unjustifiable. United deserve some credit in terms of the deal they initially agreed with Monaco, covering their own backs with a short-term commitment in spite of the mind-boggling £265,000 he is paid each week. But their foresight will be meaningless should they go on to complete a permanent transfer - the second most expensive in the club’s history - for a player who has done little to prove he is anywhere near as good as he used to be and with ongoing injury problems. It’s a risk not worth taking in my eyes. For more fan views or to join the conversation visit www.90min.com .","Radamel Falcao has struggled for form and fitness at Manchester United .

"After two triumphant trips to Wembley in 2014 and promotion to the Football League after a nine-year exile, Cambridge United chairman Dave Doggett had fixed his hopes for the New Year on something a little more mundane. He would settle for a solid season in League Two with perhaps a small sign of progress in the quest to build a new stadium. Then they were drawn at home to Manchester United and Doggett, like many fellow Cambridge fans, spent the day in a daze, snuggling into the warm embrace of the FA Cup, a competition which in its modern guise promises financial reassurances besides the traditional romance. Cambridge United players celebrate FA Trophy success at Wembley last season . Cambridge manager Richard Money (left) and Dave Doggett (right) celebrate the club's promotion at Wembley . 'Last year was incredible,' said Doggett. 'To be sat in the Royal Box at Wembley twice last year, felt good. It's only a couple of years since we were losing £25,000-£30,000 a month, and we've come through it all on a reasonably stable footing. 'We thought 2015 might be a time for consolidation, nothing too spectacular. Then, we're drawn against one of the top club teams in the world.' Doggett was in the BBC Radio Cambridgeshire studios, on Monday, along with manager Richard Money, previous chairman Paul Barry and director Colin Proctor for the fourth-round draw. They were the third team out of the hat. United were next. 'I don't think we saw the rest of it,' he admitted. Three television crews descended on the R Costings Abbey Stadium and the phones went wild with ticket enquiries. The tie is certain to be the BBC's first pick for live broadcast, which guarantees Cambridge a windfall from the FA of £234,000 in prize money and television payments. It is an incredible boost for a club with a wage bill of £1.25m per year - roughly what Wayne Rooney earns in five weeks - and which has teetered often on the brink of extinction during a decade of turmoil. The R Costings Abbey Stadium - the home of League Two side Cambridge United . Wayne Rooney looks on during Manchester United's third round FA Cup win at Yeovil on Sunday . United boss Louis van Gaal will be the latest of a number of high-profile visitors to the Abbey Stadium . AFC Wimbledon's live third-round tie against Liverpool on Monday drew a BBC audience of 6.5million, Manchester United, at Yeovil on Sunday, drew 1.3m on BT Sport. This tie will remind the world that Cambridge United is alive and kicking – and that is largely thanks to its fans. The club has always led an up-and-down existence. Elected to the Football League in 1970, they went up to the second tier with help from Ron Atkinson and back to the fourth before John Beck took them to the brink of the Premier League in its inaugural season. Cambridge reached the FA Cup quarter-finals twice, in 1990 and 1991, and finished fifth in Division Two in 1992. They were six points from automatic promotion and were beaten in the play-offs by Leicester. This proved to be the high watermark before a steady decline turned serious soon after the turn of the millennium. In 2005, Cambridge were relegated from the Football League and forced to sell the Abbey Stadium as they were plunged into administration. The view of the terrace at the R Costings Abbey Stadium which will be packed to the rafters . The tunnel where the Cambridge and Manchester United players will line up prior to the FA Cup fourth round . The sale of the ground for £1.92m to director John Howard and his business partner Stephen Clark saved the club in the short term but would haunt it for years. Rent bills had a crippling impact on finances and a bitter struggle erupted inside the club until Howard sold the ground to the current landlords Grosvenor Estates for £3.5m. Proctor was among those who made sacrifices to save the club. The 76-year-old, a fan for more than 70 years, sold his entire collection of memorabilia – programmes, shirts and autographs dating back to 1947 and valued at more than £35,000 - for £10,000 to raise instant cash, and gave every penny to the club's administrators. Luke Chadwick is set for a reunion with his former side Manchester United in the FA Cup fourth round . Money holds aloft the FA Trophy after Cambridge's win against Gosport Borough at Wembley last March . 'We were in a position where we needed £10,000, just to get through the weekend,' he said. 'We've been close to the edge many times. We've suffered and without the loyal supporters who have stood shoulder to shoulder, this fantastic club wouldn't be here. There would be houses here instead. 'Dave Doggett has put megabucks in. So did his predecessor Paul Barry. These people have put their hands in their pockets.' Fans pitched in with volunteer work: manning tea bars, answering phones, selling tickets and tending the pitch to keep it going and the Cambridge Fans United have grown to play an influential role during the recovery years. Money took over as manager in 2012, replacing Jez George, a former youth team coach, who had stepped up when the club couldn't afford to appoint anyone else. He was in charge for nearly two years and is now the director of football. Cambridge clinched promotion to League Two via the play-offs and also won the FA Trophy last year, but the visit of Manchester United will eclipse that, certainly in terms of exposure. 'I feel like a 30-year-old again,' said Proctor. 'I took a call at 3.30am from a friend in the USA who forgot the time difference but had heard about the draw. I couldn't get back to sleep and I've spent the whole day at the club. It's been full of people after tickets that don't go on sale until Monday.' First though, to Carlisle this Saturday, for something a little more mundane.","Cambridge host Manchester United in the fourth round of the FA Cup .

"Bebe, the former £7.4million Manchester United forward, has been sent on loan to Cordoba in Spain after failing to impress new club Benfica. Last season, playing for Pacos Ferreira on loan from United, Bebe scored 14 league goals in the Liga Sagres.

However, having barely featured for Benfica since his move, Bebe has now agreed a loan move to La Liga side Cordoba who are currently third bottom of La Liga.

"Stoke City assistant manager Mark Bowen has revealed that Bayern Munich attacker Xherdan Shaqiri is a surprise transfer target for the club. Inter Milan are the firm favourites for the 23-year-old who is due to hold discussions with Bayern officials on Wednesday morning. 'To get a good player like him on board would be fantastic,' Bowen told Radio Stoke on Tuesday. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Xherdan Shaqiri's ridiculous overhead kick during training . Several clubs are chasing the signature of Bayern Munich attacker Xherdan Shaqiri in January . 'There are other clubs interested, but it doesn't mean we rule ourselves out. He's definitely on the list, but there is competition for a player of his ability.' Bowen believes Bojan's move to the club from Barcelona helps. 'It's bound to help and it does help,' he said. 'There's many boxes to tick, not least the financial side of it, and with Shaqiri coming from one of the best clubs in the world, there's a lot of persuasion to get it done.' Shaqiri has also been linked with Liverpool with the midfielder said to be well liked by Brendan Rodgers. Stoke pulled off a major coup in the summer when they secured Bojan Krkic (right) from Barcelona . The Reds, however, are reluctant to spend now and would prefer to look at a deal in the summer instead. Inter have offered £2million for a loan deal, similar to the one proposed to Arsenal for Lukas Podolski, but Bayern want to sell outright and would like Liverpool to come to the table. Erdin, Xherdan's agent, wants to see if Bayern will accept a loan deal to Inter now with the prospect of joining Liverpool in the summer.

Southampton trio Rickie Lambert, Adam Lallana and Dejan Lovren, Benfica winger Lazar Markovic and controversial striker Mario Balotelli were all brought in, but early season displays were disappointing, losing at home to Aston Villa and also failing to score in stalemates with Hull and Sunderland.

"Brendan Rodgers says that Liverpool are unlikely to spend in the January transfer window despite the problems with his strikeforce this season. Liverpool have been hit hard by the departure of Luis Suarez in the summer and injuries to Daniel Sturridge which have kept the England international out since August, with winger Raheem Sterling being used in a central role in recent weeks. But Rodgers expects Sturridge to be back in action by mid-January after he returns from his rehabilitation in Boston later this week, and still believes £16million signing Mario Balotelli can make a contribution – albeit off the bench – therefore reducing the need for new signings. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch . Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers pictured during a training session at Melwood on Tuesday . Rodgers looks on during the cold training session at Melwood as he gets his Liverpool side ready . Rodgers talks to his backroom staff during the training session at Melwood in Liverpool on Tuesday . 'There won't be much activity from us in January,' said the Liverpool boss. 'We've brought in players we feel we can develop in the summer. My job is to coach the players who are here. 'I don't think it's a good time to spend. Last year we didn't bring in anyone in. The owners will always back what we want to do. If there was something we felt would benefit the group in the short or long-term then we'd do it, but I don't want to stockpile players. We've got some outstanding young talents. My focus will always be on what we've got from within.

Liverpool lost Luis Suarez (left) and have been without the injured Daniel Sturridge (right) recently . Balotelli has only scored twice since moving to Liverpool from AC Milan in the summer and has yet to find the net in the Premier League. Asked if the former Manchester City striker is going the same way as Andy Carroll, whose Anfield career never got off the ground before he was offloaded to West Ham, Rodgers replied: 'I don't see that. The team functions in a certain way and we need a certain profile of player to make it work as it has been over the past few weeks. 'He's a player who still has contribution to make for us. He's working hard in training and wants to be the best he can be. Whether he starts a game or comes off the bench we will look for a contribution from him.' Liverpool have had a difficult first half to the season after finishing runners-up in the Premier League in May, although seven points from three games over Christmas has lifted the mood around Anfield.

"There must have been times in the five months since Liverpool paid AC Milan £16million to bring Mario Balotelli back to English football that Brendan Rodgers has seriously questioned his sanity never mind his judgement. Such has been the negligible impact made by the volatile Italian since August that it was a surprise to even see him on the bench on Monday night. Balotelli’s three-game absence had coincided with an upturn in fortunes at Anfield that has lifted some of the pressure on the manager. It continued with a rampant Liverpool performance against Swansea that was rewarded with a fine win for Rodgers’s side, their biggest of the season. Liverpool scored four and could have had more. Raheem Sterling, Philippe Coutinho and Adam Lallana were excellent. Mario Balotelli has struggled at Liverpool since his £16million switch from AC Milan this summer . Balotelli (right) started their Premier League match at home to Swansea on Monday night on the bench . But it has not always been this way during a difficult season for Rodgers, of course. And, even in victory, the Northern Irishman could have been forgiven for watching Wilfried Bony and thinking of what might have been. In the last Premier League match of 2014, the Ivory Coast hit-man was guaranteed to finish the calendar year as the leading scorer in the top-flight. When Liverpool were weighing up their options to replace Luis Suarez last summer, Bony was very close to the top of their list. Not only did Swansea’s £12m record signing score 24 goals in his first season in England, it did not escape Rodgers and his staff that he held the ball up so well in both games against their team that it was almost impossible to get it off him. It was no surprise that Liverpool were prepared to activate the £20m buyout clause in Bony’s contract last summer but his £100,000-a-week wage demands proved to be too much of an obstacle. Swansea striker Wilfried Bony (right) was a summer target for the Reds after a great debut season in Wales . Anfield boss Brendan Rodgers was put off by Bony's £100,000-a-week wage demands . Bony ends the calendar year as the Premier League's deadliest marksman with 20 top-flight goals . Having declined an opportunity to sign the Ivorian when he was given a two-week trial at Melwood in 2007 by Rafael Benitez, Liverpool once again decided to look elsewhere. What subsequently made little sense, however, was that they agreed to similar terms to sign Balotelli – a problem player who had left Manchester City 18 months earlier more famous for the fireworks in his own bathroom than anything he was producing on the pitch. The results since have been largely predictable. Bony had scored eight goals in his last 12 games going into Monday night’s encounter. Balotelli had yet to score for Liverpool in the Premier League, his two goals for the club coming against Ludogorets in the Champions League and a dramatic Capital One Cup comeback against Swansea here back in October. No wonder he was sat on the bench last night alongside Rickie Lambert and Fabio Borini, making an ineffective appearance late on. It is a continuing indictment of Liverpool’s strikeforce in the absence of Daniel Sturridge, that Rodgers leaves them all out and ask Sterling to lead the line so effectively. Bony (right) looks to shield the ball away from Jordan Henderson - a quality that Brendan Rodgers admires . If Liverpool can finally offload Borini for as little as £6m next month, they may opt to bring in a loan signing and then wait for the summer to make a permanent acquisition. It would be no surprise at all if Bony once again appeared on their radar, regardless of the fact he signed a one-year contract extension at Swansea last month. There are few better strikers at holding up play and bringing teammates into the game. Bony will be sorely missed when he goes away next week on international duty at the Africa Cup of Nations. Monday night, for instance, was not an easy one for him. There was little service and few chances – save for a snatched 30-yard shot well over the bar – as Liverpool bossed the first half, leaving Bony an isolated figure. Even then, he was a constant presence, often requiring two markers. But when Swansea rallied after half-time, Bony suddenly burst into life. One powerful header brought a fine save from Simon Mignolet and when Wayne Routledge crossed towards him in the 52nd minute, there was instant panic in the Liverpool defence. Balotelli (left) came on as a late second half substitute for Raheem Sterling during Monday's clash . Balotelli (right) though failed to find the net against Swansea as his goalscoring woes continue for Liverpool . Mamadou Sakho won the header but didn’t really care where he was putting it, and only succeeded in teeing up a goal for Gylfi Sigurdsson. Almost straight from the restart Bony forced Mignolet into another smart save from 20 yards that almost produced an equaliser for Routledge. Liverpool pulled away again to clinch a well deserved victory, helped in no small measure by a fatal misjudgement from Swansea goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski. Bony went off just after the hour mark, saved for another day. But even on a quiet night, he had made his impact felt. He might be back at Anfield sooner than he thinks.

Speaking to the official Bundesliga website, Sammer said: 'No club in the world can plan to finish the campaign undefeated. We can be happy with a lot of things right now but we still have a long way to go. 'So far, the players have done a very good job in executing how Pep Guardiola and the club envisage playing football and we want to continue working on that. But don't believe for a second that every Bundesliga game isn't a new challenge. 'This isn't considered one of the strongest leagues in the world for nothing, and even the team that is top of the table at the halfway mark can't forget that.'

Sammer - who represented Dynamo Dresden, Stuttgart, Inter Milan and Borussia Dortmund during his playing career - also believes that Bayern's philosophy and style of play is arguably more important than their results. Bayern travel to closest-challengers Wolfsburg in their next Bundesliga outing, and Sammer expects to see Pep Guardiola's men passing the ball fluently. He added: 'The Bundesliga is massively important to us and obviously we want to be right up there at the top, but more important than the result is the way you play football. After a successful game, you have the result. 'But when you go into another game three or four days later and you start thinking about the previous game, you don't think about the result.

"Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers insists he will not entertain the thought of off-loading controversial forward Mario Balotelli in the January transfer window. Reports from Italy have linked Balotelli with Inter Milan and his former Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini. They have coincided with Rodgers admitting that Balotelli, who has started just eight league games since his £16 million summer signing, is struggling to come to terms with Liverpool's style of play.

The Italian (second right) has struggled to adapt to life at Liverpool since his move from AC Milan in August . Saturday's 'Gazzetta Dello Sport' leads with a story about Balotelli returning to Italy with Inter Milan . But with Liverpool still fighting on three cup fronts - the Europa League, League and FA Cups - Rodgers insists nobody will leave when the transfer window opens next week. Rodgers said: 'It is not something I have even thought about. We have had a lot of games this season in a lot of competitions. 'At this moment in time, it is key for me to keep the squad together.'

Balotelli runs across the pitch after the final whistle at Turf Moor, where Liverpool won 1-0 . The large number of fixtures looming in the new year - plus the on-going injury problems endured by Daniel Sturridge - appear certain to gift Balotelli a January reprieve at Anfield despite his much-publicised problems. On the morning of Rodgers' claims, Italian newspaper Gazzetta Dello Sport claimed Balotelli has 'tested the waters' over a potential move to Inter Milan, where he would reunite with his former manager Roberto Mancini. Mancini has also not ruled out the switch, with the Italian paper quoting the Inter manager as saying, 'It all depends on him (Balotelli).' Liverpool manager Rodgers gives instruction to midfielder Jordan Henderson on Boxing Day . Brad Jones was replaced by Simon Mignolet because of a thigh injury after just 15 minutes against Burnley . Rodgers has also challenged goalkeeper Simon Mignolet to make the first-team place his own again - after injury to Brad Jones forced him into substitute action in the Boxing Day win at Burnley. Mignolet was axed after some shaky performances but is now likely to regain his number one position for Monday's visit of Swansea to Anfield. He said: 'Brad has come into the team and worked very hard but now he's injured and he'll have a scan on his thigh to see the duration of that.

Like everyone, he has taken a wee bit of flak and stick but to operate at this level you have to deal with that.

Gerrard revealed he had turned down offers from clubs in the Barclays Premier League, Europe and the Middle East. Most significantly, though, he revealed he would have committed his future to Liverpool had they offered to extend his terms when he retired from England. When he ended his England career after the World Cup, it was with the intention of committing to Liverpool for the next ‘two or three years’ but an offer did not arrive until last November. ‘If a contract had been put in front of me in pre-season I would have signed it,’ Gerrard told the Liverpool Echo. ‘I’d just retired from England to concentrate on Liverpool. ‘I didn’t want my club games to be tailored.

Even if I went somewhere else in Europe I’d be running that risk in terms of the European competitions. ‘Also, I said to myself that if you want to play for a big team in Europe with a great coach then I may as well stay put as I had all that here already. ‘That wouldn’t have been the change I was looking for.

"As clubs begin their business in the January transfer window, managers around Europe would be wise to cast an eye towards the summer too. Players whose contracts expire at the end of this season can now talk to clubs outside the country they're playing in, giving bosses a chance to agree transfers without the need for a fee. With some huge bargains to be had, Sportsmail takes a look at a select XI who could be tempted to agree a deal elsewhere this month. Sergio Romero (Sampdoria) The man who saved two Holland penalties in the World Cup semi-final could well be leaving Serie A at the end of this season. Argentina's stopper - who was shortlisted for the Golden Glove award in Brazil - would be very handy for most sides. Everton are interested in the 27-year-old, although Roberto Martinez may opt for a cut-price deal in January rather than wait until the summer. Argentina goalkeeper Sergio Romero saves  a penalty from Holland's Wesley Sneijder at the World Cup . Dani Alves (Barcelona) Alves has already made it clear that he won’t be staying at the Nou Camp beyond his current contract and would represent an exciting prospect for almost every side in Europe. A veteran of the Champions League but still with the vibrancy a full back in England requires, the Brazilian will have many suitors. Barcelona defender Dani Alves (left) could be on the move at the end of the season as his deal runs down . John Terry (Chelsea) He's Mr Chelsea and will almost certainly be offered a new deal by Jose Mourinho but that might not stop clubs trying to speak to Terry this month. The 34-year-old has been in excellent form this season - despite his advancing years - and still looks to have a lot left to offer, be it at Stamford Bridge or elsewhere. John Terry is free to talk to clubs outside of England this month but he appears set to stay at Chelsea . Andrea Ranocchia (Inter Milan) He says he'll stay at Inter Milan but Premier League clubs with a space in central defence could do worse than have a chat with Italy international Ranocchia this month. The tenacious 26-year-old is a regular in Roberto Mancini's defence but might be interested in a fresh start if offered an exciting opportunity elsewhere in Europe. Inter Milan defender Andrea Ranocchia (right) tussles with Juventus striker Carlos Tevez in Turin . Glen Johnson (Liverpool) Johnson looks increasingly likely to leave Liverpool this summer as talks over a new deal at Anfield fail to progress. Although much maligned for his defensive qualities in recent seasons, the ex-Chelsea man - who can play down the right and left - is still one of the best attacking full backs in the Premier League. Glen Johnson (centre), pictured scoring against Stoke, is struggling to agree a new contract with Liverpool . James Milner (Manchester City) Versatile, hard-working and talented with the ball at his feet, Milner will have no shortage of suitors if he decides to head for the Etihad exit door at the end of the current campaign. Comfortable in central midfield or out wide, the England man has even had a stint up front recently. Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers is an admirer. James Milner, celebrating a goal against Sheffield Wednesday, will have no shortage of suitors . Andre Ayew (Marseille) Danny (Zenit St Petersburg) Mathieu Flamini (Arsenal) Sebastian Giovinco (Juventus) Fabian Schar (Basle) Ali Al-Habsi (Wigan Athletic) Anderson (Manchester United) Fabian Delph (Aston Villa) Winston Reid (West Ham) Rafael van der Vaart (Hamburg) Sami Khedira (Real Madrid) The real standout player available to clubs who want to get their business done swiftly. Arsenal and Chelsea have been interested in the central midfielder and, although his wages will undoubtedly be high, not many would pass up the opportunity to add the German. Real Madrid's Sami Khedira (right) has attracted interest from Premier League duo Arsenal and Chelsea . Michael Carrick (Manchester United) He has played a key role in United's revival under Louis van Gaal but Carrick is yet to sign a new deal to remain part of the Dutchman's plans next season. One of the Premier League's pass masters, the former Tottenham midfielder's style would be well suited to both Spain and Italy. Manchester United and England Michael Carrick has plenty of Premier League experience . Yevhen Konoplyanka (Dnipro) Liverpool failed to sign the winger last January because Dnipro dug their heels in but the Ukrainian side must be regretting that now. Interest is high for the jinking creator and he is certain to leave on a free. It’s a matter of who gets there first. Liverpool could make another move for Dnipro's Yevhen Konoplyanka after failing with a bid last January . Luiz Adriano (Shakhtar Donetsk) Simply put, the striker cannot stop scoring. He netted nine (yes, nine) goals in the Champions League group stage, including five away at BATE Borisov. He is a late developer and an unknown commodity but had a hand in two goals on his Brazil debut against Turkey in November. Brazilian striker Luiz Adriano has impressed in the Champions League this season, scoring nine times so far . Pierre-Andre Gignac (Marseille) The big Frenchman is enjoying a fine season having scored 12 Ligue 1 goals to help Marseille top the table at the halfway stage. Gignac has confirmed he wants to leave at the end of his contract and he quite fancies linking up with Roberto Mancini at Inter Milan. Other clubs would be wise to consider him as well.

Manuel Pellegrini has to fight for trophies on three fronts – Champions League, Premier League and FA Cup – but currently has only one available forward, Stevan Jovetic, with Sergio Aguero and Edin Dzeko injured, and six others including Alvaro Negredo out on loan. But getting the figures to stack up if Bony comes in on £200,000-a-week will be harder. City want success on the pitch of course but at the same time daren't upset the authorities again by spending beyond the means allowed by the governing body. Swansea striker Wilfried Bony is in talks with Manchester City ahead of a possible £30million move . Bony's potential arrival at City would have implications on their reduced Champions League squad . If Bony comes in, someone like Jesus Navas will have to be sacrificed from City's reduced Champions League squad. The club are only allowed to name 21 players for Europe as a UEFA sanction and Joe Hart, Dedryck Boyata, Gael Clichy, Frank Lampard and James Milner need to be included to meet the quota on association-trained players. Given that goalkeeper Willie Caballero is also required as back-up for Hart, Bony's inclusion in City's next European squad would mean one of their overseas big-hitters missing out. You would assume Vincent Kompany, David Silva, Yaya Toure and Sergio Aguero are automatic selections, so one of the following would miss out: Bacary Sagna, Martin Demichelis, Aleksandar Kolarov, Eliqauim Mangala, Stevan Jovetic, Jesus Navas, Samir Nasri, Edin Dzeko, Fernando or Fernandinho. In addition, someone else may have to be sold to help balance the books with the club keen to cash in on Matija Nastasic or Scott Sinclair if they can be persuaded. Jesus Navas (left) and Stevan Jovetic are two players who could make way in Europe for Bony . Someone may also have to accept a smaller pay packet in the next round of contract negotiations to help pay for Bony's wages. Milner, Demichelis, Micah Richards and John Guidetti all have deals that expire in the summer. A brief recap is needed. Financial fair play regulations were introduced by UEFA to stop the boom-and-bust mentality that threatened to destroy clubs across Europe, with Portsmouth and Leeds United the best examples in England of ownership gone wrong. The initial spending spree at City following the 2008 takeover from the Abu Dhabi ruling family saw the club run up annual losses, rising to £195m in 2011 alone. Of course Sheikh Mansour could personally afford it but UEFA said they wanted to avoid any situation where a club's future was put at risk by an owner over-spending and then withdrawing support. In May, City accepted their punishment for breaking FPP rules. They were hit with a conditional £49m fine, a limit of £49m net spending in the summer transfer window, a reduced Champions League squad from 25 to 21 and had to agree to cap spending on wages in 2015 and limit overall losses to £7.8m. City midfielder James Milner (right) may have to sign a new contract on reduced terms if Bony joins the club . It should be pointed out they weren't the only club who broke FPP rules. Qatari-owned Paris Saint-Germain were in the same boat and UEFA are also investigating a number of other clubs. The sanctions affected Pellegrini's plans for the season. He couldn't afford to be in the market for Angel di Maria or Falcao who both ended up at Manchester United and £16m Negredo was sent on loan to Valencia because there wasn't room for him in the Champions League squad. 'It all starts from the restrictions due to the money we spent,' said the City manager at the time, though Negredo was happy to return to Spain as well. The repercussions became clear when leading scorer Aguero suffered a knee injury at the start of December and joined Jovetic and Dzeko on the treatment table. Although City have continued to win games with Milner up front and Aguero is expected to return against Everton on Saturday, Pellegrini has realised his squad is too light with defining matches against Chelsea and Barcelona coming up – hence the interest in Bony, an Ivory Coast powerhouse who is already proven in English football. Alvaro Negredo (left) joined Valencia on loan as City couldn't include him in their Champions League squad . For their part, City are reluctant to explain at this stage how they are going to sign Bony and stay within FPP rules – understandable as the deal to sign the 26-year-old is still ongoing. If and when it is completed, they will be asked again. Even moving for Bony is a sign of their growing confidence that they have the spending-revenue ratio under control as demanded by UEFA. Their latest set of financial figures in December saw annual losses reduced to £7m after the fine to UEFA had been taken into account. The main reason is the increased revenue the Premier League champions are now bringing in. Their turnover is at an all-time high £346.5m, with plenty of sponsorship deals in place with companies from Gulf and elsewhere. Bony will be an eye-catching signing for City, both on and off the field.

"Steven Gerrard has admitted he would have stayed with Liverpool had he been offered a contract last summer. Gerrard’s decision to quit Anfield sent shockwaves through football and he revealed he had turned down offers from clubs in the Barclays Premier League, Europe and the Middle East. Most significantly, though, Gerrard revealed he would have committed his future to Liverpool had they offered to extend his terms when he retired from England. He intended to commit to Liverpool for the next ‘two or three years’ but an offer did not arrive until November. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Steven Gerrard break his silence on his Anfield exit . Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard has revealed he would have signed a new contract during the summer . Gerrard runs away in celebration after giving Premier League outfit Liverpool the lead against Wimbledon . Steven Gerrard hits the town for his team-mate Martin Skrtel's 30th birthday on Tuesday . ‘If a contract had been put in front of me in pre-season I’d have signed it,’ Gerrard told the Liverpool Echo. ‘I’d just retired from England to concentrate on Liverpool. I didn't want my club games to be tailored. 'My injury record had been fantastic for the past two-and-a-half years and I had a great season from a personal point of view last season. 'It's all ifs, buts and hindsight now. That period between the summer and the end of November gave me thinking time. 'There's no blame and I'm not angry about it. There are other people in the squad and the club had other things to worry about. 'There is no finger pointing from me towards the manager or anyone else at the club.'

Spanish full back Jose Enrique poses for a photo with his partner on Tuesday evening . Steven Gerrard (left) wheels away after heading in the opening goal of the game against AFC Wimbledon . Rodgers spoke to Gerrard, who is expected to sign a deal with MLS side LA Galaxy in the near future, in late November and it came as something of a surprise to the player, but once the writing was on the wall the former England captain knew his days at Anfield were numbered. 'I've got to be honest, that chat with Brendan came earlier than I was expecting,' he added. 'It was about a month before that he first mentioned to me about managing my game time. 'We had another chat on the subject recently - 10 days to two weeks ago. It was tough but I understood. It's been very amicable. Everyone knows how much I rate Brendan. Our relationship is very good. 'There hasn't been a cross word between us. Brendan has been fantastic for me. My only regret is that I didn't get to work with him at a younger age. Gerrard looks on as his fine free-kick goes over the wall on its way to securing Liverpool a 2-1 victory . Gerrard reiterated his respect for manager Brendan Rodgers and said nobody was to blame for his exit . Jamie Carragher believes the midfielder (centre) would be earning rave reviews if he was 10 years younger . 'Since I was 16, 17 years of age, the moment I come into work on a Monday morning my preparations begin to play 90 minutes the following weekend. 'That's the buzz. I've always worked hard all week to prepare and make sure my performance is right come the weekend. 'When it gets to the stage where you don't know if you're going to be starting or not it becomes different. 'I've never wanted to be a squad player. If I was missing games now, I'd be sitting out even more next season. I knew it would get worse and worse as time went on.'","Steven Gerrard will leave Liverpool for the MLS at the end of the season .

"Lucas Leiva heaped praise on Steven Gerrard after the Liverpool captain began his long goodbye with a match-winning display at AFC Wimbledon. Just days after confirming this would be his last season at Anfield, the 34-year-old led the Reds out at Kingsmeadow for what would prove a tough third-round clash. Few expected Liverpool to come a cropper against the League Two side but, had it not been for Gerrard, an upset akin to Wimbledon's 1988 FA Cup final triumph against the Reds could have been witnessed. Gerrard runs away in celebration after giving Premier League outfit Liverpool the lead against Wimbledon . Gerrard looks on as his fine free-kick goes over the wall on its way to securing Liverpool a 2-1 victory . Gerrard's early header was cancelled out by the Dons' giant striker Adebayo Akinfenwa, only for the Reds captain to brilliantly curl home a free-kick to secure a 2-1 victory. It was the kind of display Lucas says highlights why Gerrard is 'one of the biggest and best ever' - a tribute he paid to the Liverpool captain when after his exit was confirmed on Friday. 'As I said in my statement, my small tribute that I did for him, his qualities are evident to see week in, week out,' Leiva said. Brazilian Lucas Leiva, in action at Wimbledon on Monday, hopes Liverpool can continue their FA Cup run . 'On Monday that was the case again. He scored two fantastic goals and got us through. 'He deserves (a fantastic send-off) for what he has done through his career for the club. 'It would be a nice goodbye for him (to win the FA Cup on his 35th birthday), but it is a long way. We just have to keep going. 'It's always important to be winning things and we have the chance in the Capital One Cup, as we're in the semi-finals. Lucas, attempting to challenge Adebayo Akinfenwa, has hailed Gerrard's performance at Kingsmeadow . 'Now (we are through in) the FA Cup so hopefully we will put the same desire which we put in the Capital One and get to another final.' Liverpool certainly have the weapons in their armoury to go on to win the FA Cup, although they will need to put in vastly-improved displays. Few could argue that AFC Wimbledon did not deserve Akinfenwa's leveller, with the hosts close on several other occasions to causing an upset. Akinfenwa runs away in celebration after 'the Beast' gave Wimbledon hope against Liverpool . 'We knew it was going to be a hard game,' Lucas told his club's official website. 'Always this draw away from home is always hard. 'They played with a lot of intensity and commitment, which made it hard sometimes. We probably didn't keep the discipline of our shape. 'I think in the second half, we controlled it better and we could score the goal. But we won and that's what we wanted and now we can concentrate on the next game.'","Steven Gerrard scored twice to see Liverpool beat AFC Wimbledon 2-1 .

"Steven Gerrard isn't getting the credit he deserves for his displays in a Liverpool shirt this season, believes former team-mate Jamie Carragher. The Liverpool captain revealed that he would be leaving his boyhood club at the end of the season to play in the MLS on New Year's Day. Playing in his first game since that announcement, the 34-year-old scored both of the Reds' goals in their 2-1 FA Cup third round win at League Two side AFC Wimbledon on Monday night. Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard scored both  goals during the 2-1 FA Cup third round win at Wimbledon . Jamie Carragher believes the midfielder (centre) would be earning rave reviews if he was 10 years younger . Gerrard's display at Kingsmeadow was another example of his influence at the club during his 17-year professional association with the Anfield outfit. And after the match Sportsmail columnist Carragher took to Twitter to praise the midfielder's display - who is also the club's top goalscorer this season with nine goals. He tweeted: 'Liverpool struggled for goals this season (and) their top scorer is going to MLS next season!!!!!! 'If Gerrard was one of the new signings at 24 we'd be raving about him, but we judge him at 34 against himself at his peak.' The draw for the fourth round of the FA Cup sees Brendan Rodgers' team at home against Championship outfit Bolton Wanderers. And although Liverpool have been drawn against lower league opposition once more, Gerrard says he is taking nothing for granted as he bids to win the trophy he has previously clinched twice in 2001 and 2006. Carragher took to Twitter on Monday night to praise his former team-mate's performances . 'I always enjoy the FA Cup,' he told BBC One in his post-match interview. 'I grew up loving the competition and as it's going to be my last time, I want to make the most of it and try and go all the way. 'If I weren't here playing for this team, I'd probably be in the stands watching it so I know what (the FA Cup) means to every single supporter, that's why I always try to give my best. 'We've got to take each game as it comes. I'm told we've got Bolton at home in the next round and that'll be another difficult test. 'I know Neil Lennon quite well and I know he'll set up his team to be very difficult to beat. 'We take each game as it comes but of course, (winning the cup is) what dreams are made of and hopefully that'll be the case.'

"Manchester United are stepping up their attempts to sign a new goalkeeper in the January transfer window after telling Ben Amos that he is free to find another club. With Anders Lindegaard also set to leave Old Trafford, Louis van Gaal could have two vacancies to fill to provide better competition for No 1 David de Gea. Amos, 24, has been with the club since the age of 11 and made his debut in a League Cup win over Middlesbrough in 2008, but the last of his seven senior appearances came nearly three years ago. Goalkeeper Ben Amos during a Manchester United training session at Carrington last August . Amos (right) punches the ball during a friendly match against the Singha All Star XI in Bangkok in July 2013 . United have told the former England Under 21 international that they will not stand in his way if he receives other offers. Lindegaard, meanwhile, has been linked with Molde and a possible swap dealing involving Norway goalkeeper Orjan Nyland. The 30-year-old Dane almost left Old Trafford last summer when Van Gaal made an unsuccessful attempt to hijack Kenneth Vermeer’s move from Ajax to Feyenoord with a player-plus-cash bid. Lindegaard has since drifted out of contention as a serious rival to De Gea and has not played at all this season. It was thought he might have been called up for Sunday’s FA Cup tie at Yeovil but Van Gaal left him on the bench again. News that Amos could follow Lindegaard out of the club has only increased the possibility of Victor Valdes being offered a contract to come in as back-up for De Gea.

'It was very nice,' Williams said. 'I was welcomed when I came on the court and I felt like I left off right from last year. I felt comfortable right away.' The top-seeded Wozniacki had to work hard to subdue qualifier Julia Glushko of Israel 6-3, 6-2. Urzula Radwanska beat former French Open champion Francesca Schiavone 6-4, 7-5 and another qualifier, Lucie Hradecka of the Czech Republic, toppled fifth-seeded Svetlana Kuznetsova 3-6, 7-6 (6), 6-4.

"Sportsmail analyses what we learned from the third round of the FA Cup as the Premier League sides entered the famous old tournament. 1. Arsenal’s injury woes have handed Francis Coquelin a chance to prove his worth. Despite first signing for the Gunners in 2008, the FA Cup tie with Hull was the first time the French midfielder had ever started three games in a row. The 23-year-old did well enough in the holding role to suggest he’ll play some more while Arsene Wenger tries to get other midfielders fit. But Coquelin will be glad the January 1 disciplinary deadline for five bookings earning a suspension has come and gone. His yellow card in the 2-0 win was his fourth in as many appearances. Francis Coquelin (left) has started Arsenal's last three games in midfield due to their current injury crisis . 2. Petr Cech might be consigned to spending most games on the bench but he remains a top-class deputy for Chelsea’s rising star Thibaut Courtois. Cech made six saves against Watford to make sure Jose Mourinho’s side could keep their quest for four trophies rolling forward. The 32-year-old, now certain to stay at Stamford Bridge for the rest of the season following Mark Schwarzer’s move to Leicester, has let in just five goals in his nine appearances. Petr Cech showed his value to Chelsea once more as he kept a clean sheet in their 3-0 win over Watford . 3. Stoke’s Ryan Shawcross and Sunderland’s John O’Shea seem to be exempt from the rotation policies that affect every other Premier League footballer. While others were rested, both were on FA Cup duty for their clubs against Wrexham and Leeds respectively. They are now the only two outfield players in the top flight to have appeared in every minute of every game in every competition so far this season. Stoke captain Ryan Shawcross has played every minute in all competitions of Stoke's season so far . 4. One of the jobs on the in tray for Tony Pulis is to find a way of keeping Victor Anichebe fit. The former Everton striker proved he could be the sort of powerhouse front man that West Brom’s new manager likes when he muscled his way to score the second of Albion’s seven against Gateshead. The Nigeria international had a hernia operation at the start of the season and has had a series of niggling problems since recovering. Pulis had a record at Stoke of helping players who had struggled with long-term injuries to overcome their problems and 26-year-old Anichebe will be hoping he can work his magic again. Victor Anichebe (left) scored West Brom's second in their FA Cup third-round win against Gateshead . 5. Adam King is the latest Swansea player to benefit from the club’s policy of showing patience with young players. The 19-year-old finally got to make his debut in the Cup win at Tranmere some 12 months since his £200,000 transfer from Hearts. Boss Garry Monk believes the former Scotland youth international midfielder has benefited from time learning his side’s passing style of football and could break into the Premier League team before the season is over. Teenager Adam King (left) made his debut for Swansea in their FA Cup tie at Tranmere on Saturday . 6. QPR goalkeeper Rob Green can sleep easy after his understudy Alex McCarthy’s hapless display in the embarrassing 3-0 defeat at home to League One Sheffield United. Highly rated former England Under 21 star McCarthy had been bought from Reading for a fee believed to be around £2million because Harry Redknapp wanted to put pressure on his 34-year-old No 1. But McCarthy’s two games so far have been a disappointment – he also let in three when he made his Premier League debut at home to Liverpool. QPR goalkeeper Alex McCarthy conceded three as they lost to Sheffield United in the FA Cup . 7. Alan Pardew might have the answer to finding more goals for Crystal Palace already under his nose in the shape of former part-timer Dwight Gayle. The 25-year-old, who was signed by Ian Holloway from Peterborough for a £4.5m fee two summers ago, hasn’t had much in the way of game time under Neil Warnock’s management. But his goal in the 4-0 win at Dover was his seventh in a total of 698 minutes on the pitch – working out at a goal every 99 minutes. Dwight Gayle (right) scored in Crystal Palace's 4-0 FA Cup third-round win at Dover Athletic on Sunday . 8. Championship leaders Bournemouth have more depth in their squad than they are being given credit for by many experts who still don’t believe they will stay the promotion course. Manager Eddie Howe made eight changes to his regular team for the trip to Rotherham but still had enough quality to roll over another Championship side 5-1. French striker Yann Kermorgant scored two of the goals and made two more. Yann Kermorgant (right) scored twice as Bournemouth thrashed Rotherham 5-1 in the FA Cup on Saturday . 9. Chris O’Grady appeared to have no future at Brighton after getting farmed out on loan to Sheffield United last month with a view to a permanent move. But new boss Chris Hughton might be tempted to change those plans after recalling the much travelled 28-year-old striker early and then seeing him score one of the goals in a 2-0 win at Brentford. Hughton now plans to give the burly 6ft 1in forward a fresh chance to prove he can be a success at the Amex Stadium. 10. There were eyebrows raised at Tottenham last summer when promising young defender Kevin Stewart was released on a free and immediately snapped up by Liverpool on a two-year deal. The 21-year-old, who has been progressing steadily behind the scenes at Anfield, has now moved to Cheltenham on loan and scored one of the goals in a 2-1 win at Oxford. Stewart is one of three Anfield hopefuls who have signed temporary forms for the League Two club’s new boss Paul Buckle. Midfielder Jack Dunn, 20, also scored on his debut and defender Lloyd Jones gave a polished performance too.

"Leyton Orient, Crawley, Stevenage and Luton. Now there are just four of the FA Cup minnows who have surpassed Newcastle United by making it to the fifth round in recent seasons. Not since 2006 – in a pre-Mike Ashley era – have the Magpies progressed beyond the fourth round. You can add MK Dons, Oldham Athletic and Bristol Rovers to a list of lower-league teams who have outshone Ashley’s Newcastle in a competition they have won six times. Indeed, their tradition and history is best illustrated by the FA Cup and the team of the 1950s – led by Jackie Milburn – who lifted the famous trophy three times in five years. Newcastle United were knocked out of the FA Cup third round away at Leicester on Saturday . Leicester striker Leonardo Ulloa (centre) headed home the only goal of the match to dump out the Magpies . Newcastle caretaker boss John Carver has been heavily criticised for his team selection at Leicester . Newcastle lost 1-0 at Chelsea the last time they progressed beyond the fifth round of the FA Cup in 2006 . Today, however, they are the only football club in the land who have gone on record in deprioritising the 144-year-old competition. Such policy has certainly been played out on the pitch. In fact, no top-flight club better – or worse - demonstrates the demise of the FA Cup and its relevance in a climate where the Premier League cash cow is the only competition worth milking. Since gaining promotion back to the top division in 2010, Newcastle have won just one FA Cup match. They have been eliminated by Stevenage, Brighton (twice), Cardiff and Leicester. Twice they have made seven changes for a third-round defeat and twice they have made five. On Saturday, during the sorry 1-0 surrender at Leicester in which star players Daryl Janmaat, Fabricio Coloccini, Moussa Sissoko, Jack Colback and Ayoze Perez were rested by caretaker boss John Carver, supporters made their feelings known. ‘We’re s***t and we’re sick of it’ was the terrace put-down, followed by disgust when they waved their own players away as they attempted to applaud a 4,300-strong following. The Toon Army have had enough. Their team are tenth in the table, 10 points clear of the relegation zone, seemingly needing just 13 more to hit 40 and renew their Premier League status and, more importantly from a boardroom perspective, bolster the owner’s bank balance for one more season at least. Why, then, did they so brazenly disrespect this season’s FA Cup? Club legend Alan Shearer said he was ‘annoyed, angry and surprised’ when Alan Pardew named a weakened side in last year’s third round, while John Anderson, who played 337 times for Newcastle and was at Leicester on Saturday, is another former favourite who cannot understand the approach. Travelling Newcastle supporters chanted their disgust at their team's performance during the match . One Newcastle fan in particular was disgusted by the Magpies' dismissive treatment of the FA Cup . Downbeat Newcastle players were waved away by their fans as they tried to applaud them at full-time . ‘It’s baffling why they do not value the cups when they’re in the position they are in the league,’ he told Sportsmail. ‘I was at the game on Saturday and so were more than 4,000 Newcastle fans and I could not believe the team when I heard it - it’s taking a lend of fans when they’ve paid good money to be there. ‘They weren’t happy and they had every right not to be. It was like a practice match and, to be honest, neither team wanted to win it. ‘Leicester would have been just as happy to get beat you feel. But they’re fighting to stay in the league and you can understand their changes to a degree – their priority is survival. ‘But Newcastle only need another three or four wins and they’ll be fine. So now you’re left with a scenario where the season is pretty much over in January. ‘What are they playing for? To finish as high as possible in the league? Well you’d even doubt that because the Europa League is just as much as a distraction to them as the FA Cup.’ Newcastle legend Alan Shearer was annoyed about the club's approach to Saturday's game . Anderson himself only made it to the fifth round on three occasions during 10 years on Tyneside. But the former Republic of Ireland international says there was never a question of certain competitions taking precedence. ‘Listen, our record in the FA Cup wasn’t great, but it wasn’t for the want of trying, we just weren’t good enough,’ he said. ‘We named our strongest side in every match and I appreciate things have changed in that respect, but clubs like Newcastle and those around them in the Premier League should be having a right good go at the cups. ‘They aren’t going to get in the top four, they aren’t going down and they’ve got supporters who work hard all week and follow them all over the country in their thousands. ‘Newcastle aren’t the only ones guilty of this but it’s killing the cup and you end up with matches like Saturday which just feel like an inconvenience for both teams.’ There, in one word, Anderson captures the sad slide of the FA Cup – has it really become an inconvenience?

"Was that the fried onions mingling with the fumes from the water treatment plant, nearby? Was it the scent of fear from the Liverpool bench? Or was that the magic of the FA Cup drifting through the Kingston air? There were moments, at least, when Brendan Rodgers must have been worried. AFC Wimbledon had recovered from an early set-back, were making chances and threatening Simon Mignolet's goal. The stars from the Barclays Premier League were far from their comfort zone. 'You come to a stadium like this in that type of game and it's very difficult,' said Rodgers. 'I thought we started the game well and then we lost our shape and presented them with chances by giving the ball away cheaply in the final 15 minutes of the first half. Steven Gerrard performed for Liverpool on a night that could have seen a third-round slip-up in Surrey . Adebayo Akinfenwa - affectionately nicknamed 'The Beast' - provided a magical moment for AFC Wimbledon . 'We had to defend right through to the end. These are tricky cup ties. It was a very tough game, but we showed the character to pull through. My players deserve some credit for that.' There is always something special about the sight of elite footballers stepping from their pampered bubble, off the team bus and straight into the land of reality in the third round of the FA Cup, amid a phalanx of portable toilets and scaffolding. Local roofer Paul Strank, who sponsors one of the stands at Kingsmeadow, must have cancelled his Christmas holidays to rig up the temporary television studios, commentary booths and elevated camera stands required to beam this cup tie around the world. Kingsmeadow is a tidy ground – befitting of a club so closely associated with the Wombles of Wimbledon Common – but there were new bits were sticking up at all angles. Gerrard, though, scored a wonderful free-kick to put Liverpool 2-1 up, taking them through to the next round . When the Liverpool captain leaves for America, he will not experience anything like he did on Monday night . What did Mario Balotelli make of it all, as he huddled with the substitutes on the bench? Did he pick up a wi-fi signal for his iPad? Did he enjoy his brief encounter, even if he found scoring no easier against a League Two team? Will Steven Gerrard miss occasions like this when he packs up his boot bag and heads across the Atlantic Ocean? Will he miss the cramped dressing rooms and claustrophobic corridors at close quarters with someone wearing an old Womble costume? In the United States, Gerrard will encounter professional athletes built just like Adebayo Akinfenwa... but they will be playing in the NFL. It is hard to imagine he will ever encounter another footballer of quite the same size and power when he departs England in the summer. Akinfenwa tormented Liverpool at times, scored the goal which wiped out Gerrard's opener and typified Wimbledon's spirit. Brendan Rodgers, who himself started his coaching career down the leagues, speaks to Neal Ardley . Gerrard scores the opening goal for Liverpool against AFC Wimbledon in the FA Cup third round . He was booked for his muscular brand of domination and appeared utterly exhausted by the end, but he and strike partner Matt Tubbs, a former lifeguard, provided a gentle nod towards the club's Crazy Gang traditions. 'When we go forward, we're decent,' said Wimbledon manager Neal Ardley. 'It's not easy to mark Akinfenwa and Tubbsy is sharp around the box. It's stuff they're not really used to in the Premier League. We tried to give them a different challenge.' A blue-and-yellow flag bearing Akinfenwa's nickname 'The Beast' scrawled in blood-red, hung behind Mignolet's goal in the first-half, haunting the goalkeeper as he collided with the striker before the AFC Wimbledon man scored the goal which sparked such great excitement. At one point in the second half, they took to taunting Mignolet by simply singing: 'Simon, Simon, Simon…' Gerrard played for Liverpool for the first time since announcing he will leave at the end of the 2014/15 season . Gerrard will meet sportsmen built like Akinfenwa in the USA - but they will be American footballers . Strange, indeed. They accused the Liverpool fans, squeezed into one corner of the ground of not making enough noise, and being from the north. 'Premier League, you're having a laugh,' they sang. All of which made for terrific fun, as the Merseysiders huffed and puffed on the field, but they came through the test, largely thanks to a vintage 'superman' display from their skipper, which sent the locals home wondering what might have been. 'There's an element of disappointment for me,' said Ardley. 'A little more quality and nous and we might have got something from that. One rash moment and it proved to be decisive.' He was talking about the free-kick conceded, from which Gerrard curled in the winning goal and ruined the Wimbledon dream. Maybe, this year, the magic of the FA Cup will be reserved for a fairytale for the departing Liverpool hero.","Steven Gerrard scored twice as Liverpool beat AFC Wimbledon on Monday .

"Newcastle expect to complete the process of identifying potential replacements for Alan Pardew within the next 48 hours. Managing director Lee Charnley and chief scout Graham Carr are drawing up a list of around 10 potential candidates to provide the basis for discussions early next week. That list will then be whittled down to the men the pair believe can fulfil the role of head coach at St James’ Park - and, perhaps more importantly, whether or not they are available, either immediately or at some point in the near future, and would work within the ‘continental’ model the club has adopted. John Carver took charge of Newcastle as they were beaten 1-0 by Leicester in the FA Cup on Saturday . Sources on Tyneside insist that no-one has yet been approached and certainly no offers have been made. However, it is understood that among the names which will be considered at this early stage are St Etienne’s Christophe Galtier, former Mainz boss Thomas Tuchel, Derby’s Steve McClaren, Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe and ex-England chief Glenn Hoddle. Galtier has already indicated that he will not walk out on his current employers this season, while Tuchel is currently taking a sabbatical and McClaren, who signed a new three-year deal last summer, has distanced himself from the vacancy. Head coach of Saint-Etienne Christophe Galtier is reportedly under consideration for the Newcastle job . Steve McClaren has been linked with leaving Derby to take the vacant job at St James' Park . Former manager Alan Pardew left Newcastle to take over at Crystal Palace after four years at the club . Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe salutes the Cherries fans after the 5-1 win at Rotherham in the FA Cup . However, those details and possible resolutions will form part of the early discussions, and what is clear is that Charnley and Carr, who are being given free rein by owner Mike Ashley, will not appoint in haste. In the circumstances, Pardew’s assistant John Carver - he was criticised by some fans for fielding a weakened side for Saturday’s 1-0 FA Cup third-round defeat by Leicester, although later insisted it was as a result of injuries and fatigue - and first-team coach Steve Stone are likely to remain in charge for next weekend’s Barclays Premier League trip to Chelsea. The Magpies currently sit in 10th place in the table, with 27 points from their opening 20 fixtures, and the top-10 finish Ashley set as the minimum requirement for the season is now their only remaining objective.

"A ‘phenomenal’ competition, Roberto Martinez calls it. The FA Cup endeared him to life in England, he won it against all odds with Wigan and felt this year’s renewal could invigorate Everton. His view of that famous old pot will not be diminished on Tuesday morning. Just when it seemed Everton’s season was is in steep – possibly terminal – decline, Romelu Lukaku rode to his manager’s rescue, volleying in emphatically from close range in the first minute of injury time. How Martinez needed that goal. Everton should not be a side talked of in terms of crisis. They are captained by an England international, their midfield included one of the brightest young English stars in the game and quality, from back to front, infuses their squad. But they were staring down the barrel here, facing a fifth consecutive defeat. James Collins had risen imperiously in the 54th minute to power in a header that destined to set up a fourth round tie against Bristol City or Doncaster. It certainly deserved to. West Ham, who are due another extended FA Cup run, took their chance when it arrived then worked their socks off to frustrate Everton. Had they won 1-0, there could have been naco complaints but, in this tournament, you can never say never. Martinez, especially, knows that.

Goals – Collins (54) Bookings – Eto’o . Referee – A Taylor 6 . Man-of-the-Match – Mark Noble . ‘It would have been a horrendous setback,’ he admitted. ‘We are in a bad run but this showed the dressing room is ready to fight.’ This was rough on Sam Allardyce. The last time he visited Goodison Park, he left in a huff, disgruntled by Martinez’s overrunning press conference that was delaying his flight home and smarting after West Ham had been edged out of a tempestuous clash. Everton were at their most tenacious that November day, scrapping for every lost cause and chiselling out a victory that left Martinez celebrating more animatedly than normal. That was their seventh unbeaten game and suggested they were ready to motor. Since then, they have lost all momentum. Any hopes of challenging for a Champions League place again have evaporated on the back of their worst run of results in more than nine years, leading to an increase in tensions and anxieties. This was a game Everton or Martinez could not lose. For the opening 20 minutes, neither side looked capable of imposing themselves on the tie. West Ham hoisted a couple of high balls in to test the suspect Joel Robles; Everton passed sideways and backwards with little conviction. It was humdrum. Then, briefly, Everton began to look like the side we have become to expect. Muhamed Besic thundered into a couple of tackles, Ross Barkley began to get on the ball and Lukaku looked like he might unhinge West Ham’s defence. The best moment arrived in the 25th minute when Barkley, sashaying forward in that powerful yet elegant style of his; a clutch of Claret and Blue shirts scuttled backwards but could not stop him feeding Lukaku, whose shot skidded wide. It stirred some confidence and Lukaku, whose form has been heavily scrutinised, became a focal point; in the next attack, his ball ushered Steven Naismith forward but, again, the shot fizzed across the face of Adrian’s goal.

The thing about the Goodison crowd, however, is when the breakthrough does not arrive, they can become fractious and irritable and Everton’s failure to find a way through was not well received. With Mark Noble scurrying around midfield and Winston Reid and Collins standing firm, Everton lost their rhythm. The groans that accompanied every ball back became louder as the half petered out, so how they emerged for the second period was going to be key. Being ponderous and cautious would have led groans turning to growls but getting on the front foot had the potential to stir the crowd and, in fairness, Everton started brightly. Kevin Mirallas lobbed an effort just wide, Lukaku had a header chalked off for a foul on Aaron Cresswell. Yet West Ham were also stirring. Carl Jenkinson had gone close with a drive that Joel Robles did well to turn around and that invited them to press on. Stewart Downing had a shot deflected wide by Sylvain Distin but from the following corner, they made the breakthrough.

The Everton striker beats his chest after scoring the extra-time header that eases the pressure on manager Martinez . Everton teammates rush to congratulate a delighted Lukaku on the floor as the Toffees look to turn their season around . Distin, fatally, switched off and stopped tracking Collins, giving him space to inflict maximum damage. He did not waste his chance, powering his header past the stranded Robles. Deficiencies at the back have undermined Everton all year and this was another cheap concession. Had Enner Valenica took the chance that came his way moments later, Martinez would have felt the full fury of Goodison and it would have been difficult to envisage Everton mounting any kind of fight back. Even at 1-0, the salvage operation looked beyond them. To their credit, they kept going and just as the board had been held up to show that four minutes of injury time would be played, Bryan Oviedo fizzed a ball across the face of goal, West Ham failed to clear and Lukaku acrobatically grabbed his fourth goal in four games against Allardyce. ‘It was that man again,’ Allardyce said glumly. ‘Every time he plays against us, he scores. Up until then we had kept him quiet. We just can’t let this good performance go to waste. We want to stay in the Cup for as long as we can.’ So does Martinez. He just won’t want it to be such a close run thing again.","Everton rescued a 1-1 draw against West Ham in their  third round clash at Goodison Park .

"Defender Scott Dann admitted Alan Pardew's arrival at Crystal Palace was a huge boost as they claimed a 4-0 win over Dover in the FA Cup. Pardew - finally announced as Neil Warnock's replacement on Saturday - was in the dugout at the Crabble and was able to preside over the comfortable victory against the Conference side. Centre-half Dann tucked away two first-half goals to stave off any threat of a shock and Dwight Gayle added a third to put the result beyond doubt, before forgotten man Kevin Doyle added a late fourth.

Palace defender Scott Dann (left) scores his first goal of the afternoon against the non-league side . 'I'm delighted to get a couple of goals,' Dann told BT Sport 1. 'We knew it was a potential slip up here and we knew we had to be professional and we showed that today. 'The new manager coming in has given us a good boost and it was an opportunity for some of the lads to come in and show us what they've got.' Dann hopes Palace will be able to match this result back in the Premier League. He added: 'The manager has come from a top club and we're delighted to have him on board.

"Tougher tests await Alan Pardew, but he passed his first assignment as Crystal Palace manager with minimal fuss. Having only been confirmed as the club's new boss on Saturday morning, the safe option for Pardew would have been to sit out Sunday's FA Cup third-round tie at non-league Dover and leave caretaker Keith Millen to face the flak if Palace were to fall victim of a giant-killing. But having taken charge of one training session since arriving from Newcastle, Pardew fronted-up on Sunday, taking his place in the dugout to oversee a 4-0 victory — Palace's first win in nine matches.

He said: 'I had a couple of texts from friends saying 'why the hell have you put yourself up for that one? Couldn't you have waited a couple of days and let it ride by?'. 'I think it's important when you secure your contract, you start working from that minute. There was no hesitation on my part to make sure that we did some work on the team and prepare ourselves for Dover as we would if it were a Premier League team.' Pardew is keeping his counsel on the turbulent final months of his reign at St James' Park; his press conference ahead of the clash against Tottenham on Saturday could make for interesting viewing. But the dark days of abuse from Newcastle fans were a distant memory yesterday as his new supporters gave him the warmest of welcomes. 'It was lovely. I'm fortunate that they already have a special bond with me from my playing days,' said Pardew. 'I'm going to promise them two things. One, we're going to put the ball at risk. Two, we're going to have a go. I think that hopefully will keep the fans in that frame of mind until the end of the season because we won't stay up without them.' Off the pitch it didn't get off to the smoothest start — his side forced to walk the final yards of their journey yesterday because the driver couldn't manoeuvre the coach up the hill to the Crabble Stadium. Thankfully for Pardew, matters on the pitch weren't such an uphill struggle. Dover keeper Andrew Rafferty denied Glenn Murray three time inside the opening eight minutes before Scott Dann headed home Wilfried Zaha's cross. The central defender was at it again in the 33rd minute, thumping another header past Rafferty from Barry Bannan's corner.

"Wolves boss Kenny Jackett believes Sir Jack Hayward's life should be celebrated as the club plan further tributes. The club's former owner, who bankrolled them to a return to the top flight in 2003, passed away on Tuesday aged 91. He owned Wolves for 17 years before selling to Steve Morgan in 2007 for just £10, in return for a £30million investment into the club. Sir Jack Hayward poses outside Molineux before a home game for Wolves . Former owner and chairman of Wolves Sir Jack holds a sign renaming Molineux Way .

Hours after the news of his death was announced Wolves were knocked out of the FA Cup after a 5-3 third-round penalty defeat to Fulham following a 3-3 draw. The club are planning a full tribute before Saturday's Championship visit of Blackpool and Jackett knows Hayward deserves every honour. 'He is one of Wolves' favourite sons, not just at the club but the area. He was the owner for 17 years and when I met him he was a true gentleman. It is a life which should be celebrated,' he said. 'People within the industry spoke of him very well, Graham Taylor who was the manager here, and he was very well thought of by everyone in football. He had a first class reputation. 'When I met him over the last year and a half he was a true gentleman. 'Sir Jack put a lot of time and effort into the club, he started the development of the training ground and the fantastic ground we have here at moment.

He was in the side which won the play-off final 3-0 against Sheffield United to realise Hayward's dream of returning to the top flight in 2003. Murray said: 'I remember when myself and Robbie Keane were in Miami just chilling, and he heard we were there and sent his jet over to pick up Robbie and myself and our wives and put us up in a nice little hut on the beach. 'It was all off his own bat but he was so generous. He organised for us to swim with dolphins, took us to his restaurant and he was such a humble guy for someone who had done so well. 'He always made a fuss of the young kids at the training ground and he had time for everybody.' Chief executive Jez Moxey, who was appointed by Hayward, insisted his love for the club never waned. He said: 'He would tune in every single game wherever he was in the world, he was always doing a world cruise every year for four or five months. Day or night he would wake up and listen to the matches or try to watch them without fail.' Hayward looks delighted as he holds a scarf after becoming Wolves chairman in 1990 .

"Hurricane Fly once again got the better of old foe Jezki in a pulsating renewal of the Ryanair Hurdle at Leopardstown. With the score three-two in favour of Willie Mullins' brilliant hurdler heading into their latest battle, Hurricane Fly was the 5-6 favourite to get the job done again. Jezki was the first of the big two to commit for home in the hands of Tony McCoy, but Ruby Walsh tracked him through aboard Hurricane Fly and there was little to choose between the pair jumping the final flight. Hurricane Fly (left) and Jezki produced a storming finish to the Ryanair Hurdle at Leopardstown . 11211/131/1111/1131/11111/1114-211 . Both horses fought tooth and nail to the line, but it was Hurricane Fly who brought the house down with another determined success. Jezki was one of three runners in the field for leading owner JP McManus and his two other participants, Plinth and Alderwood, did their best to give the Jessica Harrington-trained Champion Hurdle hero a tow into the race. Jezki hit the front after the home turn, but Hurricane Fly, who beat his major rival in this race 12 months ago, was right in his slipstream. When it turned into a scrap after the last hurdle, Mullins' inmate once again dug deep into his reserves to seize the day. There was little between Hurricane Fly and Jezki as they jumped the last in the Ryanair Hurdle . The pair battled it out all the way to the line as the crowd roared them home from the last hurdle . It was Hurricane Fly's fourth victory in this race and his ninth from as many starts at his beloved Leopardstown. The winner's stable companion, Arctic Fire, was not far behind the big two in third. Walsh said: 'He's an incredible little horse, but it takes two horses to make a race and, in fairness to Jezki, he showed up today and it was an honest race. 'Plinth and Alderwood built the pace all the way down the back (straight) and it turned into a test of stamina more so than a sprint. 'He's a pleasure to ride. To have him at the peak of his powers for so many years is an incredible feat. 'You'll never take 21 Grade Ones away from him and counting.' Mullins said: 'I think he's the best anyone has ever trained over jumps. I'll never have another horse like him. He's unique.' Mullins was keen to praise Hurricane Fly's fighting qualities which yielded a half-length success. 'There is a fantastic atmosphere here and it was a fantastic race just to watch,' said the County Carlow handler. Ruby Walsh managed to get Hurricane Fly to the post just ahead of Tony McCoy on Jezki . 'It was a superbly run race. JP's horses had the advantage, tactically. I told Ruby to ride him as you find him and don't try and beat Jezki. 'Coming to the final flight, Fly always gets a good jump but Jezki got a fantastic one as well. 'When he got over the last he put his ears back and no horse I've ever seen can battle like him. 'When he got his head in front he kept it there and he's just a professional. 'Ruby said he jumped a shadow at the first and landed on it. He had a bit of gorse stuck in his girth coming back in which must have been uncomfortable for him. 'He didn't look happy going away on the bend from the stands and it took him until about the mile to warm up. Walsh was all smiles as he was led in after Hurricane Fly's thrilling triumph in the Ryanair Hurdle . The crowd lapped up the race and gave Hurricane Fly a warm welcome back . The Ryanair Hurdle success was the 21st Grade One victory for Hurricane Fly . 'We expected Jezki to be better but we knew we were better as well. There is not much between them. 'We're always trying to find the next one coming along but I don't think I have anything like him. 'Faugheen is seven from seven but he has a long way to go. Hopefully we find another one but he's unique. 'Last year people were asking me would he be retired but I said, 'No, why?'. 'He had two less-than-good runs but any horse is allowed that. I thought if the ability was still there there was no question and he was showing at home that the zest for racing was still there. 'We probably didn't do enough with him in the second half of last season. 'We were training him like he was when he was still keen but he's not like that now. We rectified that now. 'I'm enjoying his wins more now as there is not the pressure there used to be.' Although stablemate Faugheen is the ante-post Champion Hurdle favourite for the Cheltenham showpiece in March, Mullins said: 'To me, he's our top Champion Hurdle horse - he has the ratings. 'He (Faugheen) looks the one coming up, but he's (Hurricane Fly) doing it.' Mullins said Hurricane Fly is likely to next compete in the BHP Insurance Irish Champion Hurdle back at Leopardstown on January 25.","Hurricane Fly and Jezki produced a thrilling finish at Leopardstown .

"Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti has leapt to the defence of Gareth Bale following his side's 2-1 defeat by Valencia on Sunday. With the scores tied at 1-1, Bale broke forward and opted to shoot rather than pass to striker Karim Benzema who had taken up a dangerous position inside the box. That missed chance proved costly as Nicolas Otamendi then powered the ball in from a corner to secure victory for Valencia as Madrid's 22-match winning run came to an end.

"From sweltering in the summer to being crushed into a sweaty man’s armpit at rush hour, many of the world’s antiquated underground rail networks are in need of an overhaul. Now futuristic images of what London’s tube trains might look like have been revealed – and they include features that are set to make journeys more comfortable and reliable for passengers. The 250 sleek new trains will be driverless - similar to the current Docklands Light Railway trains - and will grace the Bakerloo, Central, Piccadilly and Waterloo and City lines as soon as 2025. Scroll down for videos . Futuristic images of what London’s tube trains might look like have been revealed – and they include features that are set to make journeys more comfortable and reliable for passengers . They will be high capacity, cooler – thanks to air conditioning – and have walk-through carriages. This will make them similar to the new batch of carriages recently introduced on the Circle, District and Hammersmith and City lines. But most importantly, they will be driverless and run with new signalling systems to cut delays. The 250 sleek new trains will be driverless and will grace the Bakerloo, Central, Piccadilly and Waterloo and City lines as soon as 2025. This image shows what the interior might look like . The trains will be driverless and run with new signalling systems to cut delays. At first, drivers will take control of the new trains but the plan is to make them fully autonomous . Carriages will feature air-cooling for the first time on deep sections of the Tube. They will be more accessible - with step-free access from the platform, walk-through carriages and wider doors. The trains are designed to be driverless, but when they first enter service they will have an operator on board. Along with modernised signal systems, they will enable faster, more frequent and reliable services with fewer delays. Their design is futuristic with echoes of the Underground's heritage. The next generation Underground trains will come in to service from the mid-2020s. They will run on the Piccadilly line, followed by the Bakerloo, Central and Waterloo & City lines. The trains are designed to last for at least 40 years. They will boost capacity by 25% on the Central and Bakerloo lines, 50% on the Waterloo & City line and 60% on the Piccadilly line. At first, drivers will take control of the new trains, which have been designed by London's Priestman Goode, but the plan is to make them fully autonomous. Transport for London (TFL) said: ‘We would only consider implementing full automation following extensive engagement with our customers, stakeholders, staff and trade unions.’ Capacity will grow by 25 per cent on the Central and Bakerloo lines, 50 per cent on the Waterloo Line and up to 60 per cent on the Piccadilly line. This is to cope with London’s growing population, which is expected to increase to 10 million in 2030 . `These innovative, eye-catching and sleek new trains will be vital for the continued modernisation of London Underground,’ said the Mayor of London, Boris Johnson. ‘They will ferry millions of people across our city, more comfortably, reliably and stylishly than ever before. 'The New Tube marks a significant step forward in giving Londoners and visitors the accessible and modern transport service that they expect and deserve. ‘These beautiful, air-cooled machines represent the best of British design and innovation. 'They will help to keep London and its economy moving in the right direction.' Capacity will grow by 25 per cent on the Central and Bakerloo lines, 50 per cent on the Waterloo Line and up to 60 per cent on the Piccadilly line. Walk-though carriages (pictured) will also ease congestion for passengers .

"Researchers have created a fabric circuit board that could be incorporated into clothing for a number of purposes. One of these is the ability to create ‘smart bulletproof vests’ that could tell people away from the front line that the person wearing it has been shot. And the team who made the fabric circuit board say it can be stretched a million times and washed 30 times with no detrimental effects. Scroll down for video . Researchers at the Institute of Textiles and Clothing in Hong Kong have created an advanced fabric circuit board (FCB), shown. Their material is made by knitting yarn and copper fibres together. It can be stretched a million times without breaking . The fabric circuit board (FCB) was created by scientists at the Institute of Textiles and Clothing in Hong Kong reports New Scientist. It is made of multiple filaments of pre-stretched elastic yarn and polyurethane-coated cobber fibres, which are combined with a knitting machine. Speaking to MailOnline, research Qiao Li explained the FCB could be stretched and pulled a million times without it being damaged. It could also be washed 30 times with no negative effects. ‘To the best of our knowledge, the performance of new FCBs has far exceeded those of previously reported metal-coated elastomeric films or other organic materials in terms of changes in electrical resistance, stretchability, fatigue life and washing capability as well as permeability,’ said Qiao Li. She said the features made it particularly useful for the FCBs to be used in clothing, or 'next-to-skin electronic devices.' One of the most interesting features, though, is the ability for the FCBs to be used in bulletproof vests. Qiao Li explains they made a ‘flexible and stretchable fabric sending network,’ to measure the strain and deformation of a smart bulletproof vest. They put some of the FCBs inside energy-absorbing fabrics such as Kevlar to create the smart vests. A bullet was then fired into the vest, and they found that the fabric circuits could register when they had been shot. This means that, on the battlefield for example, they could send a signal to a medic when a solider has been hurt. In addition they found that the strain of the shot did not destroy the circuits. The scientists used the fabric circuit boards with Kevlar to make a smart bulletproof vest (shown). This could relay a message to a medic when the wearer has been shot . Teenagers in hoodies are stereotypically portrayed as uncommunicative. But this could be about to change after a team of graduate students in June created a hooded sweatshirt that lets the wearer send subtle and covert messages. Different pre-programmed texts can be sent using a number of gestures, so wearers can tell a friend they're free to chat or they're missing them, merely by touching their sleeve. The smart sweatshirt was created by students at New York University’s Interactive Telecommunications Program (ITP). The prototype hoodie has a GSM radio and sensors sewn inside it, allowing the piece of clothing to respond to different gestures. ‘The knitted FCBs have shown excellent reliability during the ballistic impact tests as all the sensor network assembly samples performed well without mechanical and electrical failure and received reliable electrical signals,’ Qiao Li says. Aside from bulletproof vests, other potential applications for the technology include electric fabric skin for bionic search robots. Qiao Li also says it could be used in a ‘smart belt as an intelligent monitoring system for physiological and mechanical signals in sport of weightlifting.’ She adds: ‘Practically, knitted FCBs have great potentials in a wide range of applications, such as human/electronic interfaces, skin-mounted systems, as well as next-to-skin monitoring systems for health care.’ This is because the circuits can be deformed in three dimensions and can be bent and moved without breaking. Speaking to MailOnline, research Qiao Li explained the FCB (shown) could be stretched and pulled one million times without becoming damaged. It could also be washed 30 times with no negative effects .","Researchers at the Institute of Textiles and Clothing in Hong Kong have created an advanced fabric circuit board (FCB)

"A British student tipped for football stardom in Bulgaria had his signing with a top club delayed - after he mispronounced a word and they thought he had Ebola. Trainee doctor CJ Burke had been studying medicine in the  country when he was spotted playing by the country's top scout. But the 21-year-old was forced to delay signing with PFC Beroe Stara Zagora, who played in the Europa League last season, because of a language mix-up which landed him in quarantine. CJ Burke was placed in quarantine (pictured) for four days in Bulgaria because of a language mix-up . During a training session, he attempted to say he was feeling ill with the Bulgarian word 'Bolen'. Instead, he caused a panic when the club thought he was trying to say he had Ebola. 'They put me and my friend in quarantine for four days,' said Burke. 'It was a nightmare. 'The worse thing is, I was quarantined in the hospital I was training at and my teachers were my doctors. And the food was vile.' Burke, picture training, had been tipped for football stardom in Bulgaria but missed his signing because of his club believed he had Ebola . The confusion had come when the footballer (pictured with an unnamed teammate) attempted to say he felt ill while he was training . CJ had moved to Bulgaria and quitting East Sussex university when he realised his biomedical sciences degree would not allow him to later convert into medicine, and began looking up cheap medical courses online. The 21-year-old, originally from London, eventually settled on Trakia University, in the city of Stara Zagora, because of the bargain fees and moved there in September. 'I was scouted by my university PE teacher, who used to play football in the U.S,' he said. 'He told me to come along to a few training sessions - I did well and was negotiating a contract with them. 'But I have been left contractless though. I was meant to sign one but I was put in quarantine.' The midfielder trained Fulham F.C.'s youth academy between the ages of 14-16 and his life-long ambition to be a pro was shattered when they released him. But not he says he has been given another 'lifeline' to his dream. But when he tried to use the Bulgarian word for ill - 'Bolen'- Burke, who is pictured with girlfriend Lilly Smith, caused a panic as the club thought he was trying to say he had Ebola . The 21-year-old will have another opportunity to sign with PFC Beroe Stara Zagora later this month . The midfielder trained Fulham F.C.'s youth academy between the ages of 14-16 and his life-long ambition to be a pro was shattered when they released him so said this opportunity was a 'lifeline' 'I'm going to see how far I can get,' he added. 'I came back to England for Christmas but I will be negotiating a contract when I go back later this month.' Despite the Ebola knockback at the end of November, he remains a hero in the city. He said: 'Now I'm a bit of a cult figure and everyone asks if they can be my agent. 'I'm swarmed by girls.' Girlfriend Lily Smith, 24, of north London, does not get jealous of the women throwing themselves however. Burke said: 'She's over the moon about it. She thinks she's a right WAG now.' He is now due to sign for PFC Beroe Stara Zagora later this month is already being handed the celeb treatment. He said: 'When we arrived we were greeted by a fanfare - the mayor of the town personally showed us around and there were paparazzi documenting our every move for the first week - it was bizarre. 'People now know me as the 'Black Doctor-Footballer.' Despite the Ebola knockback at the end of November, Burke remains a hero in the city and admitted he was 'swarmed' by girls .

"Think you can keep a straight face while watching your favourite comedian? A comedy club in Barcelona is betting you can't, and it is even basing its ticket prices on how often it can make you laugh. Teatreneu has installed facial-recognition technology on the back of its chairs to track how much each person in their theatre has enjoyed the show. Scroll down for video . Stand-up idea: A comedy club in Barcelona is betting you can't, and it is even basing its ticket prices on how often comedians can make its audience laugh . One laugh will cost you €0.30 (24p or 38 cents), and customers could face a maximum charge of €24 (£18 or $30). The system was dreamt up by Barcelona-based advertising agency The Cyranos McCann, after Teatreneu asked them to think up a way to increase ticket sales. A number of people have tried, and reportedly failed, to sit through a comedy show without laughing in an attempt to get a free ticket. Using the novel system, the average ticket price per person has so far been €6 (£4.70 or $7.58). Funny money: One laugh will cost you €0.30 (24p or 38 cents), and customers have a maximum charge of €24 (£18 or $30). A number of people have tried, and reportedly failed, to sit through a comedy show without laughing in an attempt to get a free ticket . It seems the pricing system has caught on, with other theatres in Spain now copying the pay-per-laugh technology. It is unclear which facial recognition software is being used, but most use algorithms to track facial landmarks on a subject's face. For instance, an algorithm can analyse the position, size or shape of the mouth to determine whether a person is laughing, smiling or sad. The comedy club has also launched a mobile app as a method of payment and a pay-per-laugh season ticket. James Woroniecki, director of London's 99 Club, told the BBC: 'Sounds fun, just so long as all the facial recognition data doesn't get forwarded to the NSA [US National Security Agency]. 'It'd be a big technical challenge - as people laugh so often at the 99 we'd have to install a cash machine by every seat.' Next time your boss tells a bad joke and you feel compelled to laugh, beware - they can tell you're faking it. Researchers from London have discovered our brains carry out different process when we hear genuine laughter compared to fake chuckles. When laughter is forced, for example, it activates a part of the brain linked with deciphering emotions. This means we know it's not a genuine laugh, and we automatically try to work out why they're faking it, what the laugh means and what the they're thinking. While genuine laughter lights up areas of the brain linked with happiness and positive emotions. To test the theory, psychologist Dr Carolyn McGettigan from the Royal Holloway University of London measured brain responses of volunteers as they listened to genuine laughter on YouTube clips. Each participant was asked to pick clips they found funny.This ranged from comedy shows, such as Flight Of The Conchords, and even the Eurovision Song Contest. The results were then compared to how their brains responded to fake laughter. The findings revealed participants, none of which were told the study was about laughter perception, could unconsciously tell when the chuckles were insincere.

"Winner: Olympic gold medallist Mo Farah was celebrated in the London 2012 Olympic Parade. His fame hasn't swayed US customs officials who still insisted on going through checks even after seeing his medals . As one of the most famous athletes in the world, getting recognised can be a problem for Mo Farah. Everywhere except in American airports, that is. For more than a year after his double gold medal triumph at London 2012, the Olympic star is still 'always' pulled aside by suspicious US customs officials - because his full name is Mohamed, he said today. Even showing them his medals does not stop them suspecting he is a terrorist and questioning him. But the runner also told how it is impossible for him to train in Britain - because he is too well known and would get mobbed by fans. Farah, who moved to Portland, Oregon, two years ago to work with coach Alberto Salazar, said: 'I'm always stopped by US customs. I think it's something to do with my name, that's the only thing I can put together. 'I always get stopped and get questioned. It used to be really bad where you'd get stopped and go through to a room and they'd do an extra search - ""What are you doing here? How many countries you been to?"".' Asked if he'd ever been tempted to show them his 5,000m and 10,000m gold medals, he said: 'I did at one point when I was coming through and they were like ""No matter, I still need to do this search"".' Somali-born Farah, 30, who moved to the UK with his British-born father at eight, remains sanguine about the situation, however, and believes it is down to 'the system on the computer'. Interviewed on BBC Radio 4's Today Programme, he said: 'When I was coming here even, I was trying to check in and it won't let me check in so I go to the lady and ask her to check in and then she had to make a special call. 'Before you actually check in you have to make a call to make sure you're clear then you check in. I always have a fair problem.' Pride: Farah celebrated winning the men's 5000metre event, his second gold medal at London 2012, by draping himself in the Union flag . Do the Mobot: Farah was recognised for his 'Mobot' sign during the Olympic games . Previously it has been reported that Farah, who was awarded a CBE in the New Year's Honours list, was hauled aside at customs as he returned to his training base in Oregon just before last Christmas. Afterwards, he said: 'I even got my medals out to show who I am, but they wouldn't have it.' He was eventually allowed into the US. Farah, who trains in Kenya as well as the US, also told how despite his love of the fans who cheered him on to double Olympic glory, he could not train in the UK because his fame and the attention it brings would interrupt his strict regime. 'It's not possible for me to train in . Britain because of the amount of miles I do. I love the people, I love . the support and I want to be here, but if I want to win medals I need . the simple life - eat, sleep, train, not worry about anything else,' he . said. Training: The athlete, pictured here winning the 5000metres at the European Athletic Championships in Barcelona, moved to America two years ago to train . World champion: Mo Farah, pictured here winning the 3000metres at the European Athletics in Turin, is a household name and recognisable figure to many but still gets challenged at US airports . 'Unfortunately I can't do that right now. But I will be back at some point.' Farah is currently in the UK promoting his autobiography Twin Ambitions. While he was being brought up in the UK, his twin brother Hassan was 6000 miles away in Somalia. Although they were separated until he went to his brother's wedding in 2003, Farah says they have since been in touch every day and 'the way I see it we are not different people, we are part of the same person'. He added: 'I made him run with me in 2003. I was quite amused because he almost kept up with me for a little while.' Farah's 'new goal' is to prove himself as a marathon runner in next year's London Marathon, but he dismissed reports he'd said he could cover the 26.2 miles in under two hours. 'To say I'm going to break two hours when I've never run a marathon is crazy,' said Farah, who ran half the event this year as preparation for his full debut in 2014. 'My target is to get close to the British record which is 2 minutes 7 seconds.'","Double gold medal winner Mo Farah says US customs officials always pull him aside .

"Space enthusiasts keen to explore the skies but deterred by the hefty price tag will soon be able to board a rocket for a fraction of the cost. Passengers in the XCOR Lynx will be able to experience weightlessness and view the earth from over 300,000ft above the Earth - for a 'bargain' price of $95,000 (£57,000). This may sound expensive, but is almost two thirds cheaper than a ride on Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic. Plus, the Lynx spacecraft seats just two people - compared to Sir Branson's six-seater - and passengers are encouraged to help pilot the ship. XCOR Aerospace is based at the Mojave Air and Space Port in California. Its Lynx spacecraft, illustration pictured, seats two people - the passenger and a pilot - and tickets cost $95,000 (£57,000). This is almost two thirds the price of Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic SpaceShipTwo . More than 200 tickets for a trip already been sold for the spacecraft that takes off and lands vertically using its reusable rocket propulsion system. Jeff Greason, chief executive and co-founder of California-based XCOR Aerospace, is convinced making space travel financially viable is the key to exploring the skies. He said: ‘We have to go a couple of levels deeper than passion. When you look at the question of why it is so many years after we first went to space yet so little of it is being used, it's because it just costs too much. ‘We have to do something to fundamentally reduce the cost before space becomes an economic good. We looked at that problem and not having a billionaire writing your cheques, it had to be a money making proposition.’ This graphic explains what happens during the 30-minute flight. Around 50 seconds after the engines are lit, the craft goes supersonic. Around three minutes after lighting the engine, passengers reach 180,000ft. Craft travels at Mach 3 before the engines cut off and coasts to peak altitude of 350,000ft . The spacecraft, illustration pictured, seats two people and takes off and lands vertically using its reusable rocket propulsion system. It will fly four times a day and the passenger will be expected to get involved in piloting the ship. For example, they'll be asked to perform tasks and make sure dials are holding steady . Passengers will put on white space suits two hours before boarding the spacecraft and embarking on the 30- to 50-minute flight. Randy Baker, a vice president at XCOR, said things move very quickly: ‘There is just 15 seconds between lighting the engines and take off. Then 50 seconds after lighting the engines you go supersonic and very close to vertical and are pushed back in your seat. Then three minutes after lighting the engines you are at 180,000ft.’ Greason continued: ‘You are going more or less straight up at about Mach 3. 'Then the engines cut off and you have about a minute and a half of zero gravity as you coast up to our peak altitude of 350,000ft - then another minute and a half of coasting back down until there is enough atmosphere for the vehicle to feel it.' Aerospace company XCOR hopes to begin testing its Lynx rocket, which will carry one pilot and one passenger, later this year, but other organisations are vying to beat XCOR to the launch. Here is an overview of some of the other companies in the race to put civilians in space: . Virgin Galactic - Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Group and Aabar Investments PJS . The company's SpaceShipTwo holds two pilots and six passengers who are seated with two large windows, one to the side and one overhead, so they can enjoy the view if they do not want to float freely when they achieve weightlessness. The SS2 is 60ft long with a 90-inch diameter cabin. The spaceship is connected to Virgin Galactic's carrier aircraft White Knight Two and when it reaches the right altitude, SS2 is released and propelled forward and upward, accelerating into space at almost 2,500mph. Clients have paid $250,000 (£150,000) for a ticket, including celebrities such as Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie and Tom Hanks. The SS2 (pictured below) completed its third supersonic test flight in January. Space Adventures - Armadillo Aerospace . Space Adventures has arranged all eight of the flights to orbital space - when the spacecraft is travelling fast enough to go into orbit - completed by seven private citizens so far. British soprano Sarah Brightman is due to be the next passenger and is scheduled to travel to the International Space Station in October 2015. The company has partnered with Armadillo Aerospace to offer suborbital flights to space. The Armadillo suborbital rocket seats two passengers and is flown autonomously from the mission control centre. It lands and takes off vertically while the large windows offer panoramic views of the Earth and sky. The rocket reaches 100km above earth and uses ethanol and liquid oxygen fuelled engines, which have flown more than 200 test flights in the last decade. Blue Origin - Set up by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos . The vehicle includes a crew capsule carrying three or four astronauts on a separate rocket-powered propulsion module. Following lift-off, the combined vehicles accelerate for about two-and-a-half minutes before the propulsion module shuts off its rocket engines and separates from the crew capsule. The propulsion module finishes its flight, descends to Earth, and autonomously performs a rocket-powered vertical landing while the crew capsule coasts to the edge of space. After descent and re-entry into Earth's atmosphere, the crew capsule will land under parachutes near the launch site. SpaceX . SpaceX's Falcon 9 reusable development vehicle (pictured right) is already in test mode and it will eventually deliver the smaller Dragon capsule containing humans into space. The Dragon made history in 2012 when it became the first commercial spacecraft to deliver cargo to the International Space Station and safely return cargo to Earth, a feat previously achieved only by governments. Astrium . The business jet-sized spaceplane will take off and land conventionally from a standard airport runway using its jet engines. At an altitude of about 12km, the rocket engine will be ignited and in only 80 seconds the craft will climb to 60km altitude. The rocket propulsion system will then be shut down as the plane’s inertia carries it on to over 100km, enabling passengers to hover weightlessly. Operators using the spaceplane could offer safe space flight for a price per passenger of around €200,000 (£120,000). He said re-entry then takes about a minute and the craft glides to land in approximately 20 minutes. The spacecraft, which will be able to fly four times a day, seats just the pilot and the passenger will be expected to get involved during the adventure. They will be asked to perform tasks, such as reading instruments and making sure dials are holding steady. 'It's your flight so if there is some particular part of the earth that you want to look at we can steer the ship to look at the Grand Canyon or the area you find of most interest,’ Baker added. ‘Then you have time to look around and soak up being where so few have been before.’ The first model will take travellers . 200,000ft above the Earth, but the company hopes the second model will reach 300,000ft . and it will not be too long before they are ready to take to the skies . and reach maximum altitude of 350,000ft. The Lynx aircraft has four engines, pictured, as well as rocket pumps and a propulsion bay. Passengers sit in the pressure cabin. The first model will take travellers 200,000ft up but the company hopes the second model will reach 300,000ft and it will not be too long before they are ready to reach maximum altitude of 350,000ft . The Lynx aircraft and its jet propulsion system, pictured, is still undergoing tests. XCOR claims the first public flights should launch in between six and 18 months . ‘We expect to be in flight tests by the end of the year, after the first tests we won't know how long until we are ready to take the first passengers but my guess is six to 18 months. ‘I think we will be flying participants by the end of next year but we don't like to put a date on things,’ Baker said. There are also very few physical limitations, so even those in poor health may be able to travel. ‘Some people cannot handle the excitement, some people are claustrophobic, so we take them in a high performance aeroplane to test if they have a psychological problem but in the broad sense, if you can on a rollercoaster, you can do this because the time you are doing it is short. ‘It means people in ill health who want to do this while they still can are able to,’ added Baker.

'They’re feel-good, knee-jerk reactions that are unenforceable,' he said. The bill that passed on Friday requires a $10 criminal background check to take place before legally transferring a gun. Cooke says the proposed firearms transfer requirement would not keep guns out of the hands of criminals. The sheriff says that he and other . sheriffs 'won’t bother enforcing' the laws because it won't be possible . to keep track of how gun owners are complying with the new requirements. Republicans have opposed the bill, calling it an undue burden on law-abiding gun owners. Cooke is joined in his opposition by a number of other Sheriff's including the El Paso County Sheriff Terry Maketa. Maketa said his office keeps records . of every concealed carry permit holder in the county as required by law, . but he would never share it. He said he would destroy the database . if anyone tried to get their hands on it and would intervene if . government agents started arresting county residents for exercising . their constitutional rights. Proposals: Colorado State Representative Rhonda Fields who has proposed the legislation says the bills are about 'saving lives' Colorado is the first state outside . the East Coast to significantly ratchet back gun rights after the . theater and school shootings. The state's gun debate was being . watched closely because it's considered a swing state with both a . gun-loving frontier past and an unfortunate history of mass shootings, . including the 1999 Columbine High School attack. Expanded checks have been a top . priority for Hickenlooper, who called for the proposal during his State . of the State address in January. The sponsor of the Colorado magazine-limit bills, state House Representative Rhonda Fields, told fellow lawmakers in a floor debate last week he proposal was about 'saving lives.' Next step: The laws will now head to Governor John Hickenlooper who has indicated he will support most of the measures . 'These are weapons that should be used . in a theater of war and not in our local theaters,' said Fields, a . Democrat whose district includes the suburban Denver movie theater where . a gunman killed 12 people in a shooting rampage last July. Colorado was also the site of the 1999 massacre at Columbine High School, where two teenagers shot dead a teacher and 12 other students before committing suicide. Other bills included in the package of gun-control laws approved by Colorado lawmakers included a measure to make firearm buyers pay for their own background checks and a ban on online certification for concealed-carry permits, both of which Hickenlooper has said he supports. The proposals that won final approval had received little Republican support. Republican House minority leader Mark Waller issued a statement after the bills' passage, calling Democrats 'out of touch' with their constituents. 'More than 200,000 Coloradans are out of work but Democrats are more concerned with passing legislation that will send hundreds of jobs out of our state without any increase in public safety to show for it,' Waller said in a statement. Suspect: James Holmes, 25, is charged with the shooting of 12 people at the screening of a Batman movie at a theatre in Colorado . President Barack Obama has put forward a number of gun-control measures in the wake of the Newtown school massacre . Waller was referring to Magpul, a Colorado-based manufacturer of ammunition magazines that has vowed to leave the state and take away its hundreds of jobs if the magazine-limits bill becomes law. The Colorado legislature's action follows the passage in New York state in January of a sweeping gun-control law that bans assault weapons and magazines that hold more than seven rounds of ammunition, requires gun owners to register most guns with the states and requires universal background checks. Last week, a divided U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee advanced to the full Senate a measure endorsed by Obama that would require criminal background checks for all gun buyers.","Sheriff says the new laws are 'unenforceable' and says they're 'knee-jerk reactions'

"Steve McClaren praised his side's ""mature display"" after Derby leapfrogged Ipswich into second place in the Sky Bet Championship following a 1-0 win at Portman Road. Chris Martin's 18th of the season - and 100th career goal - proved the difference, although Ipswich will look at their own role in the decider after the striker latched onto a poor back header by Tommy Smith. Despite enduring a nervy ending after midfielder John Eustace was sent off late on, McClaren was delighted with his side. Derby rise to second in the Championship, level on points, temporarily at least, with leaders Bournemouth . Luke Hyam carries the ball forward for Ipswich, who succumb to their first defeat in 10 Championship games . Ipswich: Bialkowski, Chambers, Smith, Berra, Mings, Hyam, Anderson (Noel Hunt 68), Tabb (Stephen Hunt 56), Bishop (Bru 72), McGoldrick, Murphy. Subs Not Used: Gerken, Parr, Bajner, Ambrose. Booked: Smith, McGoldrick, Hyam. Derby: Grant, Christie, Keogh, Buxton, Forsyth, Hendrick (Bryson 80), Eustace, Hughes, Russell (Shotton 90), Martin, Ibe (Dawkins 86). Subs Not Used: Ward, Roos, Mascarell, Bent. Sent Off: Eustace (90) Booked: Eustace . Goals: Martin 57 . Att: 20,861 . Ref: Kevin Wright (Cambridgeshire) He said: ""That was as good an away performance as we have had for a long time. This is a tough place to come but we put in a really mature display. ""You need to have that maturity to win games and sometimes we have been a little naive and not got the results. But today we stood up to their challenge when we had to, defended well and played it around. ""The game wasn't pretty at times but this performance, and the belief and confidence it will give us, is something we can build on."" The hosts, largely out-of-sorts, actually started the brighter and almost took the lead after just three minutes when Jay Tabb took advantage of a fabulous crossfield pass by David McGoldrick. The midfielder's shot from the edge of the area was parried by Derby keeper Lee Grant with Daryl Murphy's rebound blocked by Cyrus Christie. The home side were shading the opening proceedings and McGoldrick fizzed a shot just over after a sharp exchange of passes with strike partner Murphy. Minutes later, Derby fashioned their first chance when Jeff Hendrick's low goalbound shot was blocked by Tyrone Mings and Christie fired the rebound just over. Chris Martin reacts quickest to slot past Ipswich keeper Barotsz Bialkowski and score his 100th career goal . On 19 minutes, the visitors went close again as Johnny Russell curled a free kick just wide. Chances were at a premium in a cagey first half although Murphy blasted wide after finding some rare space in the visitors' penalty area just before the interval. Five minutes after the restart, Ipswich had the home fans off their seats. A neat period of passing ended with Teddy Bishop unleashing a stinging drive from 25 yards that the diving Grant did well to push away. Minutes later, the hosts had a big shout for a penalty turned down after Tabb's cross appeared to strike the arm of Richard Keogh. After an initial bright start to the second half by Ipswich, it was against the run of play that Derby took the lead on 57 minutes. Martin has scored 15 goals in 25 Championship games for Derby County this season . Christie's long ball was hopeful and should have been dealt with but Smith's header back was woefully short and Martin nipped in to push the ball over the onrushing Bartosz Bialkowski. On the hour mark, Ipswich almost hit back when Bishop's cross was flicked on by McGoldrick but Murphy's header was too tame to beat Grant. At the other end, Bialkowski saved from Will Hughes after some great work by Russell before the same player found room to get his shot away but the Town keeper saved low down to his right. Ipswich offered little in the final 20 minutes, until the game came back to life in injury time. Jay Tabb strikes an effort on goal, but Ipswich fail to extend their unbeaten run . Eustace was sent off for a second yellow, after hauling down McGoldrick, before Grant saved Kevin Bru's fierce drive and Noel Hunt just failed to turn the ball in at the far post following a goalmouth scramble. It was the first time Ipswich had tasted defeat at Portman Road for almost five months but Derby just about deserved the three points as they stretched their own unbeaten run to five games.","Derby County run out 1-0 winners at Portman Road .

"The normally stoic coach of the Newcastle Knights revealed he lost interest in football in the weeks after one of his players Alex McKinnon suffered a devastating spinal injury that ended his career. Wayne Bennett sat down with the NRL Footy Show's Erin Molan on Thursday night and opened up about the emotional time. When asked if he ever contemplated ending his coaching career, Bennett takes a deep breath before answering: 'I wasn't interested in football for a couple of weeks.' Scroll down for videos . Erin Molan (right) spoke with Alex McKinnon (left) in his only one-on-one interview since his accident on the footy field in March . Fighting off tears during the interview, the seven-time premiership coach said he cared about his players but 'didn't really care whether we won or lost'. 'Football was still important to me, but it wasn't that important,' he said. The interview was part of a telethon special to raise money for Newcastle Knights player Alex McKinnon who ended up in a wheelchair after he was tackled during his team's March 24 clash against the Melbourne Storm. The 'Rise for Alex' campaign is aiming to raise funds for McKinnon's ongoing medical expenses and a league of stars threw their support behind McKinnon - including Australian surfer Mick Fanning, singer Jimmy Barnes, and Sydney Swans players Kieran Jack and Adam Goodes. Mc Kinnon, 22, was also interviewed by Molan and renewed his vow to walk his fiancee, Teigan Power. 'I love her so much and I always will,' he said. Four months after the accident, McKinnon described how he felt when he was left lying on the pitch. 'I just wanted to get off the field...and people to stop looking at me,' he said. And also joked about his time in hospital: 'I was waking up a bit three days after and the surgeon said ""you're a very lucky boy Alex"" and I said ""hmm I don't know about that"".' 'Someone always told me that God gives the toughest challenges to his best soldiers and that's the way I'm taking it and the only way you can take it,' he said. After initially being told he would never walk again, a full recovery is a realistic goal for McKinnon who says he has come to terms with his situation. McKinnon said he tried to maintain upbeat - focusing on his rehabilitation - but he did have his 'low points'. 'They're pretty bad...[but] it would only be 20 minutes or 30 minutes,' he said. 'Hopefully I can impact on the game another way.' Wayne Bennett (right) breaks down as he describes how he was 'living a lie' and not letting his emotions over Alex McKinnon's (left) accident out in the open . Former Newcastle Knights NRL player Alex McKinnon (right) and coach Wayne Bennett (behind) will speak about McKinnon's accident on the NRL Footy Show on Thursday night . The interview was particularly emotional for his coach Wayne Bennett who announced last week he would be leaving the side at the end of the season. He said right off the bat he knew McKinnon's injuries were bad. 'I knew it wasn't good. I didn't want to go back to the replay, I didn't want to look at it,' Bennett told Molan. 'I was very confused with myself, very confused. I didn't feel as emotional as I thought I should and then it dawned on me that I was living a lie and not letting my emotions come through because I couldn’t afford to. 'But I've shed a lot of tears since about him...and I suppose I'll shed some more. 'It's good to get it off my chest.' He later added during his first live appearance on the Footy Show: 'It's the toughest thing that's happened for me in rugby league.' Bennett said what he wanted for McKinnon now was for him to be happy. 'I saw a bit of myself [in him] when I was younger,' he said. 'I like his style and how he carried himself and I'm really proud of him.' Speaking to the media at the launch of the NRL's 'Rise For Alex' round 19 at ANZ Stadium on Monday, he said he was hoping one day soon to resume a normal life. 'As much as I would love to get home and get back to my family and get back to Newcastle and get on with my life, I want to walk again,' McKinnon said on Monday. 'You see a lot of stories about people who get on with their lives and don't walk again. My focus is to get as much back of my movement as I can and I am slowly improving. 'For example, when I first got diagnosed I was a C4 - all that is shoulder movement. Nothing else. No fingers, no movement in your legs, or anything like that. 'I am slowly progressing with the movement, I am a C7 now.' Newcastle Knights player Alex McKinnon was tackled by Melbourne Storm players, with his head hitting the ground first and causing severe spinal injuries . McKinnon suffered the devastating spinal injury in March but he promised he would walk his fiancée down the aisle . 'It's going to be a slow and long process but I am willing to do that. 'I'm 22 and I'm going to give it my best shot.' McKinnon says he doesn't remember the round three incident at Melbourne's AAMI Park, only the aftermath of 'the whole ground looking at me'. 'Obviously being thrown into a situation like this you don't know how to handle it but the people around me and their help has really motivated me to get back to the person that I am,' he said. 'There is no point of me being angry. You would think I would be filthy on the world and filthy on the game but I'm not. You may as well be content with the situation. 'What rugby league has done for myself and my life is ridiculous and I wouldn't be the person I am today without it. I wouldn't have met Wayne [Bennett]. I wouldn't have met some of my best mates. I wouldn't change it for anything.' Engaged: Alex McKinnon proposed to his girlfriend Teigan Power just a week after being told he may never walk again . McKinnon launched the round alongside Knights coach Bennett with teammates Willie Mason, Darius Boyd, Dane Gagai and Korbin Sims looking on. Bennett said the way McKinnon was dealing with the situation was an inspiration. 'He was very valuable before he was injured and he's more valued now because we all feel his pain,' Bennett said. 'He's a pretty outstanding young man and he's become even more outstanding in my eyes since the accident because he's made sure it has been easier for all of us. 'Despite all the pain and all the grief and all that is in front of him he is more concerned about us and how we feel and when we come to see him he's always putting on a brave face. 'It's remarkable the way he has carried himself.' A full house is expected at Hunter Stadium on Sunday when the Knights host the Gold Coast. The NRL will donate $1 to Alex's foundation for every fan in attendance at each game this weekend.Fans can also make donations online at www.riseforalex.org.au or by texting RiseForAlex to 0498 555 555.","The usually stoic coach held back tears during Thursday's interview .

"Ronald Koeman knows Southampton face a long road to Wembley, but that will not stop the Dutch coach dreaming of lifting the FA Cup there in the May sunshine. The Saints host Sky Bet Championship promotion chasers Ipswich on Sunday looking to build on their New Year's Day victory over Arsenal which kept them fourth in the Barclays Premier League. Along with thousands of other football fans in the Netherlands, Koeman grew up watching the famous old competition on television and, having taken over at St Mary's in the summer, the former Barcelona European Cup winner cannot wait for his first live taste of FA Cup action. Ronald Koeman says he dreamed of playing in an FA Cup final as he grew up in Holland . Southampton go into the game against Ipswich on Sunday having beaten Arsenal on New Year's Day . Sadio Mane celebrates putting Southampton into the lead... injuring himself in the process, against Arsenal . 'When I was a young kid watching the FA Cup finals in Holland, it was always a special day and maybe if I have one of the dreams, then maybe it is a dream to be playing in an FA Cup final,' said Koeman. 'I spoke once to Ruud Gullit (about it), and he had one FA Cup final as the manager with Chelsea, and it was very special (for him). 'But it is a long way to Wembley, we will have to beat a lot of teams, so it all starts on Sunday.' Koeman is not expecting to make any major changes for Sunday's tie, having fielded strong sides in their run to the quarter-finals of the Capital One Cup. Southampton went into the game in fourth place but managed to overcome the Gunners with relative ease . Dusan Tadic celebrates his strike, after which Arsenal never really looked like getting back into the game . Southampton will have done their homework on Ipswich as Koeman looks to build some momentum in 2015. 'We have to analyse the games of Ipswich to prepare the players,' he said. 'It will be tough against Ipswich, they are a good team, a strong opponent and one of the leaders in the Championship. 'Every game we take seriously, we did that in the League Cup, and we will do it in the FA Cup. 'I hate losing, the team is good, the freshness of the players is very positive.'

'I gave (defender) Matthew Targett the confidence and the time to play in the League Cup, but I believe in young players. 'I don't like to change the side a lot because I believe in the spirit of the team and what we are doing now.' Southampton, meanwhile, have yet to confirm the extent of the injury suffered by midfielder Sadio Mane against Arsenal.

Paul Lambert is interested in raiding fellow Midlands club West Brom for 20-year-old forward Adil Nabi . Sinclair, 25, has become a forgotten man at the Etihad Stadium having made just four substitute appearances this season and is hoping to leave the club this month.

"The view from the ninth tee at Boat of Garten Golf Club suggests we've stepped into a 19th Century Highland landscape painting. The Cairngorms loom majestically in the distance, a thin mist hovers above the trees and a steam train puffs through the silver birches. All that's missing is a stag. On cue, a young deer darts on to the fairway, in apparent appreciation of the shot that my brother has just plonked on the green. My own effort is considerably less impressive, but it's hard to get downhearted while spending an afternoon knocking a little white ball around this heavenly corner of Scotland. Beautifully refurbished: Craigellachie Hotel dominates the picture-book village 20 minutes south of Elgin . The Ryder Cup is coming to Gleneagles this month, but Scottish golf is about more than the rolling grandeur of Perthshire or the splendour of St Andrews. Situated between Inverness and Aberdeen, Speyside is barely an hour's drive north from the spot where Europe will do battle with America, and it offers Scotland in microcosm. There are mountains, sea and wide, dark rivers; there is whisky, woodland and wildlife, including dolphins and ospreys. With good roads and a clement climate, Speyside is ideal for a week-long family holiday or a boys' weekend away. Legendary Quaich Bar: The Craigellachie Hotel is famous for its selection of 700 whiskies . Whisky, woodland and wildlife: Speyside offers Scotland in microcosm and is ideal for a family holiday . We opted for the latter, with the emphasis on golf. From the abundance of superb courses on offer, we played Boat of Garten - a gem of a course in the Cairngorms National Park - and Elgin, but Nairn, Lossiemouth and Grantown-on-Spey are among several fine alternatives. After a swift pitstop in the clubhouse, we strike north for Forres over the stunningly isolated Dava Moor. Our reward is the Knockomie Hotel on the edge of this neat little Highland town, deep in the heart of the Whisky Trail. Every few miles reveals one famous distillery or another and next morning we make a beeline for one of them, Benromach - whose 10 Year Old Single Malt won gold at the 2014 World Whisky Awards. Perhaps it's the dram that does it, but our game picks up at Elgin Golf Club, a thoroughly satisfying parkland course. Home base that night is the beautifully refurbished Craigellachie Hotel, an imperious Victorian landmark that dominates the picture-book village 20 minutes south of Elgin. Famous distillery: Benromach's 10 Year Old Single Malt won gold at the 2014 World Whisky Awards . We head for the hotel's legendary Quaich Bar, 120 years old and boasting one of the world's largest selections of single malts - around 700. Speyside is a cosmopolitan haven. Alongside a healthy smattering of locals, the Craigellachie harbours a lively mix of well-heeled Europeans, South Africans, Americans and Chinese. Some are here to tackle the Speyside Way, the famous 70-mile route through the Grampians to the sea. Plenty more are taking a very personal interest in the whisky. But our quest concerns that little white ball. Next morning we have one final date at Elgin, and we rise to the occasion. In truth, neither of us is ever likely to trouble the Ryder Cup selectors, but if Speyside has tested our limited golfing prowess, it has also provided an unforgettable few days of relaxation, hospitality and wonderful food and drink in simply stunning surroundings.

Jimmy Gopperth (right) in action for Leinster during a European Rugby Champions Cup match last month . Before moving to Europe, Gopperth had Super Rugby stints in New Zealand with the Blues and Hurricanes. He will move to Wasps in time for next season. 'We are delighted to have signed Jimmy Gopperth for next season,' Wasps rugby director Dai Young said. 'Jimmy's consistency of performance at the highest level is really impressive. 'He is one of the most accurate kickers in northern hemisphere rugby, and we also expect him to develop a dangerous attacking partnership in our back-line over the next couple of seasons.'

"In the midst of political wrangling over budgets, deficits and debt ceilings, a new talking point has emerged on the right side of the aisle: The U.S., say some Republicans, can continue to service its debt load long past Oct. 17 – the date when Treasury Secretary Jack Lew warns the U.S. will default on its fiscal obligations – even if Congress refuses to raise the debt ceiling. The New York Times explored the issue Wednesday in an article under the headline: 'Many in G.O.P. Offer Theory: Default Wouldn’t Be That Bad.' No one has argued in favor of default, but some Republicans have suggested that refusing to raise the debt ceiling would instead force the Treasury to find new ways to avoid it. Rep. Scott Garrett, a New Jersey Republican on the House Budget Committee, told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Tuesday that 'the nation will not default on its debts' in the absence of a debt ceiling hike. Much ado about nothing? Rep. Scott Garrett (R) is among the Republicans who say the U.S. can keep paying its debts even if Congress doesn't raise the debt ceiling. But Rep. Nita Lowey (L) says he has 'a distorted view of reality' On Tuesday President Obama slammed Republicans whom he said don't believe a debt default is a 'big deal,' but he didn't parse the differences between default and a debt limit ceiling that might force fiscal discipline on the federal government . 'We support the idea of the administration doing what's within its authority to actually pay the debt,' Garrett said. 'You know, the debt payments are around $20 billion, up and down, per month. Income coming in, revenue coming in is around $230, $240 billion a month. We want to make sure the debt is always paid. There's not a single Republican who does not want the debt payments of this country paid.' Blitzer and Rep. Nita Lowey, the Democratic counterpoint guest opposing Garrett, were unconvinced. 'If they don't raise the debt ceiling,' Blitzer asked, 'you think the U.S. can still go ahead and pay all its responsibilities, including making sure Social Security checks go out on time, and all of the domestic and national security bills that come up?' 'Actually,' Garrett replied, 'the answer to your question: Uh, yeah. If you look at the revenue flow coming in, we've prioritized this before. This has been looked at for years now.' Lowey scoffed. 'It seems to me that you have a distorted view of reality when it comes to the debt,' she said. Good news? 'If you don¿t raise your debt ceiling,' said Sen. Rand Paul, 'all you're saying is, ""We""re going to be balancing our budget""' The Times quoted North Carolina Republican Sen. Richard Burr, who argued that government employee furloughs would free up nearly enough money to service the federal debt during the partial shutdown that began a week ago. 'We always have enough money to pay our debt service,' said Burr. 'You’ve had the federal government out of work for close to two weeks; that’s about $24 billion a month. Every month, you have enough saved in salaries alone that you’re covering three-fifths, four-fifths of the total debt service, about $35 billion a month. That’s manageable for some time.' House Republicans, however, have pushed for legislation that would give furloughed workers back pay when the shutdown is over. If Senate Democrats were to take up the measure and Obama were to sign it, those savings would vanish in the long term. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, the libertarian-hued Republican known for his controversial positions, agreed that declining to raise the debt ceiling might be a sign of fiscal responsibility. 'If you don’t raise your debt ceiling,' Paul told the Times, 'all you’re saying is, ""We’re going to be balancing our budget."" So if you put it in those terms, all these scary terms of, ""Oh my goodness, the world’s going to end"" – if we balance the budget, the world’s going to end? Why don’t we spend what comes in?""' 'If you propose it that way, the American public will say that sounds like a pretty reasonable idea.' No worries: Sen. Richard Burr told The New York Times that 'we always have enough money to pay our debt service' House Speaker John Boehner duels with Obama in successive press conferences on Tuesday, saying 'there's going to be a negotiation' on the debt ceiling. The White House is now hinting that a very short-term debt limit hike might be acceptable if it leads to broader budget negotiations . President Obama said during a press conference on Tuesday that defaulting on the national debt would be a catastrophic fiscal milestone in American history, but he didn't acknowledge that refusing to increase the debt ceiling might not have an immediate effect. 'When I hear people trying to downplay the consequences of that,' he said, 'I think that’s really irresponsible. ... And it’s particularly funny coming from Republicans who claim to be champions of business. There’s no business person out here who thinks this wouldn’t be a big deal, not one.' 'You go to anywhere from Wall Street to Main Street, and you ask a CEO of a company or ask a small-business person whether it’d be a big deal if the United States government isn’t paying its bills on time. They’ll tell you it’s a big deal. It would hurt.' The president will meet with members of the House Democratic Caucus on Wednesday in the East Room of the White House to discuss the political stalemate that has gripped Washington for weeks. The White House says Obama will have similar meetings with House Republicans soon. His bully-pulpit push also included an audience with a group of five conservative pundits and columnists on Tuesday.","GOP pols claim the U.S. can keep paying its debt obligations out of tax revenue, or use the money it saves by not paying furloughed workers .

"A new Scotland: the debate will exercise the hearts and minds of voters in that country until next month's referendum. It was also a question faced by a generation of Scots 250 years ago. But they had to sail across the Atlantic to find their Nova Scotia. Disappearing act: Sian Lloyd raises a glass to the joys and freedom of travel in Nova Scotia . As the independence arguments raged - and as my husband and I yearned for traffic-free roads, trees and foodie treats - we booked a last-minute Icelandair flight to Halifax, Nova Scotia's capital, and for a week toured parts of this isolated eastern peninsula of Canada. Over two-thirds of the province is covered by forest - conifers, of course, but maple, birch, oak and mountain ash too. Nova Scotia is also the world's largest exporter of blueberries and Christmas trees. Celtic music is very much alive here and is one of the highlights of a visit; another is the freshly cooked lobster; yet another the whalewatching. In short, there's a lot on offer. There's certainly a lot of genealogy to discover. Within five minutes of our arrival, the jolly doorman at The Lord Nelson Hotel in Halifax proudly told us that he was a quarter French and a quarter Scottish. He waxed lyrical about how thousands of Highlanders came over and mixed in with French, English and Germans to form the unique strain of folk known as Nova Scotians. A haven in the New World: Nova Scotia's capital Halifax boasts a lovely waterside setting . The major Scottish influx to Nova Scotia began in 1773, when the Hector sailed into Pictou - acknowledged as the birthplace of New Scotland. It's an easy drive there from Halifax. An impressive full-size replica of the Hector was built in the town and is now in the harbour. Many of the guides are descendants of families that came over on the Hector. But it's hard to believe such a small vessel made it across the Atlantic. A walkabout below deck gets you wondering at the bravery and tenacity of those 200 early settlers. You can almost hear the melancholic notes of the pipes as you emerge blinking into the sunlight. From Pictou we took a two-hour scenic drive to the luxurious golf-focused resort of Fox Harb'r on the Northumberland Strait, passing small marshy tidal inlets and gentle rolling farmland on the way. You don't have to be obsessed with golf to stay here, but the gorgeous coastal panorama and the manicured course are enough to make you really want to learn. We chose to cycle and swim in the impressive 25-metre pool. Splendid sights: Sian encountered the Uisge Ban waterfalls (left), and the Red Shoe Pub in Inverness (right) We also went on wonderful walks on the beachfront and in the forests of the Cobequid Mountains, discovered the lovely local Jost wines, and slept like babies on down pillows in gigantic beds. Unsurprisingly for a province called New Scotland, there are a fair few top golf courses. We drove for half a day to get to Inverness in western Cape Breton, in order to stay at the beautifully chic glass-fronted Cabot Links golf course, and to tap our feet to Celtic reels at the famous Red Shoe Pub. Cabot Links hugs the shore, and is recognised as one of the world's greatest golf courses. The splendour of the place is truly appreciated from the Panorama restaurant. We witnessed two sublime sunsets and enjoyed two lots of lobster-stuffed ravioli and blueberry cobblers. Scenic, serene and scrumptious. We were very keen to cycle part of the Celtic Shores Trail. This 60-mile well-kept coastal track stretches from Post Hastings to Inverness, and has been on my bucket list for some time. It is accessed just down the road from Cabot Links, and is a pure pleasure to cycle. We went as far as Mabou and back, breaking the journey with a late lunch at the Red Shoe, which is owned by the folk-singing Rankin sisters. Both food and musicianship are second to none. Doughty: The harbour at Pictou has a replica of the Hector, which brought Scottish immigrants to Nova Scotia . We tucked in to crab dips with flatbreads and mussels and sweet potato chips, enjoying the heady combination of food, fun and fiddling, and staying far longer than we expected. We enjoyed sunny gin-clear skies while on Cape Breton, so saved the indoor attractions till last, just in case the weather misbehaved. It didn't, so we rather rushed around must-visit attractions like the Alexander Graham Bell Museum and the Gaelic College, where we helped weave a kilt. Both places were entertaining and enjoyable and left us wondering whether we should have spent quite so much time at the splendid Uisge Ban Falls; or chatting with lobster fishers at Baddeck's lovely village market; or loitering over breakfast with owner Earlene Busch at the Chanterelle Inn. This place is a Cape Breton gem, intimate and tranquil, and serving local products, such as fiddlehead fern soup and local cranberries and blueberries. The menu changes nightly and names all the food sources. Our line-caught halibut was from Neil's Harbour, about 50 miles away. The bread at breakfast was fresh from the oven. Even the oatcakes were home-made. We left with a generous pile and munched away merrily on our journey to Sherbrooke on the Eastern Shore. As we know her best: Until recently, Sian had worked for ITV since 1990 . Sherbrooke village is a charming living museum. It's an actual village, though, superbly restored to its 19th century appearance and staffed by people in costume, portraying the experiences of the time. I rode a penny-farthing, got a recipe card from the printing press, watched wild rose hand-cream being made at the pharmacy, visited the telephone exchange, ate fresh-baked biscuits in the jailer's kitchen and spun some wool at the weaver's home. Disneyland, eat your heart out. This is the real deal, and that's the thing about Nova Scotia: it is warm, accessible and authentic. Scratch almost anyone and you'll find a Scot or two in the family tree, a kilt or a fiddle in the closet. It's as if a chunk of auld Scotland has been broken off by ancient giants and hurled on to Canada's north-east coast. The land and soil look the same, the weather's the same and you find the same hardy people. In some ways, it is more traditionally Scottish than Scotland. If Alex Salmond loses the referendum, to ease his sorrows I'd thoroughly recommend a trip to Cape Breton, a dance along the Ceilidh Trail… and plenty of the island's own single-malt whiskies.

"With thousands of padlocks left along its railings by hopeful lovers, the Pont des Arts, which crosses the River Seine in Paris, is widely considered one of the most romantic spots on Earth. But this famous ‘lover’s bridge’ has surprising competition from a huge metal structure on the other side of the world. As the largest steel-arch crossing on the planet, standing more than 130 metres tall, Sydney Harbour Bridge could not be more of a contrast to this pedestrian walkway built in the time of Napoleon. But since it opened itself up to intrepid climbers in 1998, Sydney Harbour Bridge has established itself as one of the most romance-inflected places in the Southern Hemisphere. More than 4000 proposals have taken place on its beams, and 25 weddings have been held at its summit. The most romantic crossing in the world? More than 4,000 people have proposed on Sydney Harbour Bridge and 25 weddings have taken place at its summit . Popular tour: More than 14 million people have completed the Sydney Harbour Bridge climb since the opportunity to scale the Australian landmark first became available in 1998 . Romance hotspot: Sydney Harbour Bridge has now become a popular landmark for people to propose, including Lucas Farrell (pictured) who popped the question at the summit to his girlfriend Natalie Rumble on Valentine's Day 2014 . Starting point: MailOnline tested out one of three potential climbs to the top of Sydney Harbour Bridge to see what makes it the perfect spot to propose . It has now become so popular with couples looking to cement their relationship that organisers have had to come up with a way for rings to be carried to the summit surreptitiously and safely – using a simple gadget elaborately known as an 'ERD' (Engagement Ring Device). Wanting to discover what has made the bridge such a hotspot for couples, MailOnline decides to test one of three potential trips up to the top – the two-and-a-half hour 'Express' climb. Every day, several groups of up to 14 people ascend to the bridge peak, where they enjoy unrivalled panoramic views of the city. All three climbs reach the top. The only difference is how you get there. The 'Express' climb takes participants through the belly of the bridge rather than directly over it - a process which offers a good insight into the hard labour that went into building it. Before we can start our climb, we have to change into overalls which make us look like extras from Ghostbusters. Safety first: All climbers must wear Ghostbuster-esque suits and are attached to the bridge by a cable . Best way to see the city: Groups of up to 14 people climb the bridge every day with a knowledgeable guide . Long walk: The bridge spans 1149 metres in total but climbers only travel across half of it . Stunning vista: Even from the lower arches underneath the floor deck, the views are magnificent . Our tour guide John Kirkland then fits us with safety belts, before attaching us to a secure cable that runs the course of our climb - so that we are always attached to the bridge. Once locked on, we are off and speeding along the lower arch - a long plank-like walkway – underneath the road deck which leads us out towards the water. On the journey, John points out the old foundations of the Harbour View Hotel and reveals how locals fought to keep their pub when hundreds of homes had to knocked down to make way for the bridge. They couldn’t save the pub, but it was rebuilt just around the corner where it still stands today. Asked why the bridge has become such a hotspot for romance, John (who met his wife through working on the bridge climb) is adamant that it isn't all down to the inspiring views. For Sydney-siders and the wider Australian public, the bridge is a reminder of a time of hope, when the country was desperately trying to fight its way out of the Great Depression of the 1930s. Building for the future: Sydney Harbour Bridge was constructed as Australians attempted to overcome the Great Depression of the 1930s . Sacrifice: Hundreds of homes had to be knocked down to make way for the bridge. The brick outline on the ground in this picture marks where the Harbour View Hotel once stood. It was rebuilt around the corner . Connecting people: Sydney Harbour Bridge brought the two communities situated on either side together . Before the bridge was built, it took Sydney residents three days to walk from one side of the harbour to the other . It also brought together the communities on either side of the harbour - two halves of the city which had been separated by the large expanse of water. Before the bridge was built, it took locals three days to walk from one side of the harbour to the other, and the waterway was overcrowded with boats. It took nine years to complete, and went nearly two million dollars over the estimated budget. But its completion represented the start of a new, more prosperous age for the city. As we walk further onto the bridge, the gangplank no longer runs over ground, but over the water. It is this part of the climb, rather than the lofty views at the top, which make climbers nervous – perhaps because it is so much easier to see the drop into the deep. As we twist and turn through the metal gates and locks, John tells us that the bridge steelwork weighs an incredible 52,800 tonnes and required more than six million rivets - which gives a good idea of its magnitude. Steep climb: There are more than 1,000 steps to reach the 134 metre tall summit of the bridge . Nearing the top: Climbers get unrivalled views of the Sydney Opera House, while other local landmarks such as Luna Park are visible in the distance . Huge task: It took nine years to complete the bridge, which is made up of 52,800 tonnes of steel . Cause for celebration: Parties were held around Sydney when the bridge finally opened in 1932 . As we approach the summit on the lower eastern arch, John points out the exact spot where the two sides of the bridge were joined. Work on the south side, by The Rocks, was started before the northern side - so as work progressed, residents of the city could see the two parts slowly rising to meet each other in the middle. ‘A bit like a relationship’, John remarks. After years of watching this stately progress over the harbour, the two sides were finally joined. The bridge was formally opened on Saturday March 19, 1932, prompting mass celebrations across the city. Officials organised parades, the locals threw street parties. After climbing the final steps up a steep staircase, and working up a bit of a sweat, we finally reach the summit, which is every bit as spectacular as the brochure promises. I feel fortunate to have picked a clear day with the sun shining and few clouds – we have unobstructed views up to 90km out in all directions over the city, including the iconic Opera House. This is where the majority of proposals and weddings take place – sometimes on the spur of the moment, but generally planned with the help of bridge staff. Final steps: After reaching the halfway point of the bridge, climbers take a last stairwell to reach the top . View from the top: When climbers make it to the summit, they are rewarded with incredible panoramic views . Expert: John Kirkland is one of several experienced Bridge Climb guides, and has witnessed numerous proposals at the summit . On bended knee: Climb guide John Kirkland demonstrates how the ERD - Engagement Ring Device - works . All prepared: The Engagement Ring Device is a simple wrist band with a ribbon attached that loops through the ring, preventing it from being lost . Hotspot: The majority of proposals take place at the bridge summit . John points out that after people have saved thousands of dollars for a ring, the last thing they want to do is accidentally drop an expensive diamond 134 metres – or five seconds – into the sea below while popping the question. To prevent this, the company came up with the ERD. John quickly demonstrates how it works by hooking a ring on a ribbon which is attached to a simple band that he then wraps around his wrist. The band can be safely transferred from hand to hand, so that after a perfectly-timed surprise proposal at the peak, the newly engaged recipient can safely take the ring and wear it on their own wrist during the descent back to the ground, without fearing it will be dropped into the ocean. John has helped orchestrate numerous proposals, but reveals some people choose to do it without notifying the bridge staff, suggesting there have been far more than the recorded 4,000. The descent is much quicker than the climb, and offers yet more stunning views of the Opera House, the Botanical Gardens and the Luna Park fairground. But what makes the climb truly magical is not just the breathtaking vista over a beautiful city, but the story of the how the bridge came into being. Sydney Harbour Bridge was a vital new connection that united two divided sections of the city. Almost a century on, it still has the power to bring people closer together. Perfect conditions: On a clear day, climbers can see across the whole of Sydney and beyond . What goes up: The walk back down is significantly quicker than the climb up the bridge . Perfect setting for romance: The bridge was designed to bring communities together . Climbs of Sydney Harbour Bridge cost from AUS$218 (£117) for adults, and $148 (£80) for children aged 10-15.

"As Dylan Hartley serves his latest ban for violent conduct, it will not have escaped the Northampton hooker’s notice that Tom Youngs is in the form of his life. Fully fit following the shoulder surgery that caused him to miss the autumn internationals, Hartley’s nearest rival for the England No 2 shirt has been outstanding since returning for Leicester in late November. Last Saturday Youngs produced a prodigious display as the Tigers gained revenge for their early- season mauling at the hands of Bath — the game in which he suffered a serious dislocation — and in doing so put another international rival, Rob Webber, firmly in the shade. England hooker Tom Youngs is in the form of his life at Leicester . With little over four weeks until England start their RBS 6 Nations campaign against Wales in Cardiff, the hooker’s jersey worn 61 times by Hartley is fast becoming Youngs’ to lose. ‘If there is a better hooker in England after the weekend I don’t know who he is,’ said Leicester director of rugby and former England No 2 Richard Cockerill on Wednesday. ‘Tommy has been outstanding for us. His attitude is first rate, he doesn’t worry about anything, he gets stuck in. If Webber has any pretensions of playing at Test level in front of Tom Youngs, you saw at the weekend the difference: the ball-carrying, the mentality, the mauling. ‘Tom is in a different league from Hartley and from Webber.’ Youngs put put international rival Rob Webber firmly in the shade with impressive display . One would expect Cockerill to back his man, but on the evidence of the past six weeks it is hard to argue against him. Stuart Lancaster’s promise to ‘pick on form’ will be put to the test if Youngs can maintain his upward trajectory until the end of the month. ‘I’m just glad to be back playing again,’ said Youngs, who will be hoping to add to his 17 caps. ‘If other people are playing well then fair enough, but as long as you’re making the coach scratch his head that’s all you can do.’ The 26-year-old, who converted from centre to hooker only five years ago, has been criticised in the past for his wayward line-out throwing but insists he has ‘kicked on again’ in one facet of his art where Hartley retains an edge. But in terms of carrying, breakdown work and link-play, Youngs is his equal, while a disciplinary record of just two yellow cards in the past two seasons gives him a colossal advantage over his combustible Northampton rival. Stuart Lancaster’s promise to ‘pick on form’ for England will be put to the test by Youngs . ‘Hartley has more poor days at the office than Tom Youngs,’ added Cockerill. ‘Tom’s discipline and attitude to physicality is right on the line. It is not over the line, it is not under the line, it is right on it every time he plays. I don’t know what Tommy’s disciplinary record is but I think it is a lot better than the other bloke (Hartley). Even mine is better than that!’ The pair’s last encounter saw Hartley last only 16 minutes before receiving a straight red card for elbowing Matt Smith in a brutal East Midlands derby at Franklin’s Gardens shortly before Christmas. It also landed him a three-week ban that has allowed his less experienced rival to steal a march ahead of next month’s Six Nations. In World Cup year, it could prove Hartley’s most costly indiscretion yet. Youngs said: ‘I went through a stage of getting stroppy on the pitch when I was on loan at Nottingham but I realised I wasn’t really helping anyone out. Salesi Ma'afu of Northampton was sent off for punching Youngs last year . Northampton hooker Dylan Hartley landed three-week ban for elbowing Matt Smith . ‘When I moved to hooker I had to earn the respect to play in the front row and felt that when someone punched me I had to punch them back. I was a centre moving to hooker and everyone wanted a bit of me. But I realised after a while I wasn’t doing myself or my team much good.’ It is a lesson Hartley still hasn’t absorbed, despite an ever- lengthening charge sheet, and Lancaster will have to consider if his most experienced forward is worth taking another chance on at the Millennium Stadium on February 6. The England coach is unlikely to be able to select Youngs’s clubmates Dan Cole (foot) or Manu Tuilagi (groin) for the tournament opener against Wales after Cockerill revealed yesterday that neither player is likely to feature before the last weekend in January. Meanwhile, Wasps yesterday confirmed former England wing Tom Varndell has signed for Championship side Bristol. Leinster fly-half Jimmy Gopperth will join Wasps next season, while stand-off Andy Goode has been offered a coaching role at the Ricoh Arena. On a busy day of transfer activity, Northampton announced the signing of 22-year-old Munster fly-half JJ Hanrahan and Samoa flanker TJ Ioane has joined Sale.","England start their RBS 6 Nations campaign against Wales in four weeks .

"I thought it would be a good chance for Roy Hodgson to play James Milner in the deep role in the midfield diamond. It didn’t work. Milner has been in good form for City and with his defensive quality and work-rate, he deserved a chance. England midfielder James Milner got stuck in the middle during Euro 2016 qualifier against San Marino . Milner's touch map throughout the 5-0 win . But he didn’t move the ball quickly enough through the middle. The diamond should free up Raheem Sterling so you need to get the ball to him fast. Milner tended to go sideways when he should have run further with the ball and then tried to find men through the centre. He looked more comfortable playing in a wider role in the second half. ....................................................................... Playing a team like San Marino poses a unique problem. Despite a good show from their goalkeeper, the win was a foregone conclusion. But that mentality can affect performances. The only way to combat that is to play at pace. At times England didn’t do that enough but it did improve in the second half. Milner was far more comfortable playing on the flanks . Substitute Adam Lallana helped England step up a gear after the break against San Marino . Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain thrived in central role after coming on as second-half substitute . Ox made a difference . When Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain came on, he gave the England midfield a new dimension. He wants to play centrally but rarely gets the chance for Arsenal. When he plays wide it’s as if he has to prove himself whereas through the middle things come naturally to him. On Thursday night he brought something extra and again showed Roy what he’s capable of. England fans were delighted Danny Welbeck got on the scoresheet against San Marino . Since his move to Arsenal, Danny Welbeck has enjoyed plenty of support and there was a similar reception at Wembley on Thursday night. The fans were willing him on and there was a real warmth when he scored. England will be relying on him in future, so it was good to see that.

"England captain Chris Robshaw has revealed that his decision not to undergo shoulder surgery was driven by next month's RBS 6 Nations Championship opener against Wales in Cardiff. Robshaw is set to return to action on Saturday when his club Harlequins tackle Aviva Premiership rivals Leicester. He has been sidelined since stretching shoulder ligaments during Quins' European Champions Cup clash against Leinster on December 7. Chris Robshaw put off surgery on a shoulder injury sustained for Harlequins in their win over Leinster . The England captain says he didn't want to miss out on the national team's Six Nations opener against Wales . Had Robshaw gone down the surgery route, he would have faced three months out, missing the entire Six Nations campaign. England's February 6 appointment with Wales comes two years after they suffered a record 30-3 defeat at the Millennium Stadium that painfully ended their Grand Slam hopes. 'You don't want to miss out on these occasions, especially going back to the Millennium, you simply don't,' Robshaw told the Daily Telegraph. Robshaw makes a tackle on Leinster's Luke Fitzgerald in the match he stretched his shoulder ligaments in . 'You don't want to be on the sofa watching on TV as everyone else is going into battle. We want to try and rectify what happened there two years ago. 'I wanted to be in Cardiff. That was in my mind when I hurt my shoulder. 'I saw a couple of specialists who went through the options. Once I knew that rest and rehab could do the job, then it was decided to go down that route. You want to be out there playing. Simple as that.' Robshaw aims to go one better than last year when England won the Triple Crown . Robshaw resumed contact training last week, and he is now poised for a busy run-up to the Six Nations with Quins facing Leicester, then Champions Cup games against Wasps and Castres. The Wales match then follows, which is a fixture given added importance with Warren Gatland's men also in the same World Cup pool as England later this year. 'Everything steps up in a World Cup year, and all the more so given that we are hosts,' Robshaw added. 'Every country will be looking to build confidence ahead of the World Cup. And the best way to do that is to finish top of the European pile.'","Chris Robshaw returned to contact training last week after shoulder injury .

"Prime Minister David Cameron believes any club thinking of signing convicted rapist Ched Evans must 'weigh the decision very carefully' due to 'the position of footballers as role models', his spokesman has said. Oldham Athletic, who are interesting in signing former Sheffield United forward Evans, are currently weighing up a move for him. The club have stalled in completing a deal, however, due to the threat of two sponsors withdrawing their backing if the move was to go through. VIDEO Scroll down to watch fans discuss the potential signing of Ched Evans by Oldham . Oldham Athletic were considering signing convicted rapist Ched Evans (pictured in Cheshire on Sunday) Newcastle  owner Mike Ashley has come under pressure to withdraw his £1million sponsorship at Oldham . And, speaking at a Westminster news briefing on Wednesday, an official spokesman for the Prime Minister said when asked about Evans: 'His view hasn't changed (from) ... the time when there were reports around Sheffield United. 'Ultimately, it is for employers to take decisions, but the Prime Minister does think that footballers are role models and he is sure that any potential would-be clubs and employers will weigh their decisions very carefully.' It appears that Mike Ashley, who owns Sports Direct, could hold the key to whether or not Evans signs for the club. The Newcastle United owner has come under pressure to withdraw his sponsorship of Oldham and, if he does so or at least threatens to, the potential deal will almost certainly be dead in the water. Oldham plan to hold more talks regarding the potential signing of Evans even though more than 30,000 people have signed a petition urging them not to do so. Oldham Athletic players train on Monday at their Chapel Road training ground but there was no sign of Evans . Oldham boss Lee Johnson later spoke to reporters outside Boundary Park on Monday . A petition urging Oldham to sign Evans is edging towards 2,000 signatures. After much speculation, the club confirmed on Monday that they are considering taking the highly controversial step of offering Evans a route back into professional football. After a conference call between board members, chief executive Neil Joy issued a statement under the heading 'Ched Evans' which said the club would 'continue to have conversations with representative bodies such as the PFA (Professional Footballers' Association) and will conduct due diligence with regard to any decision we make on this matter.' After reading out the statement outside Boundary Park, Joy refused to answer the questions of the 40-plus media who had gathered to hear the club's stance on the matter. Evans may have a proven record in League One - in his final season at Sheffield United he scored 35 goals in 42 appearances - but signing the player would prove to be a hugely contentious move for the Latics, who are 14th in the table. Evans was released from prison last October half way through a five-year sentence for raping a 19-year-old woman. Since then, he has been rejected by Hartlepool and Tranmere. Former club Sheffield United offered the striker a chance to train with them last November but they retracted the invitation after it caused uproar. Oldham, however, chose to begin a second round of negotiations with the Welshman despite insisting last month that they would not sign Evans. It did not take long for dissenting voices to start airing their objections once it emerged Oldham were considering signing Evans. By Monday night a petition calling on the club to not sign the forward was nearing 35,000 signatures. And leading politicians had their say on the matter too. Labour Party leader Ed Miliband said he would not employ the Wales international, who has asked the Criminal Cases Review Commission to examine his case in the hope that it could lead to an appeal. 'He hasn't shown remorse and I wouldn't take him on,' Miliband told BBC Radio Manchester. Debbie Abrahams, Labour MP for Oldham East and Saddleworth, said it would be 'wrong' for Evans to start playing again. A police officer stands outside Oldham Athletic's training ground on Monday morning . 'As he is claiming his innocence and in the process of appealing against his conviction, both he and football clubs should wait for the outcome of this process before even considering a return to the sport,' she said. Labour's Shadow Minister for Sport, Clive Efford, called for the Football Association to intervene and not accept Evans's registration as a player. 'There are many professions that people cannot return to after committing this sort of crime and football must be one of them,' Efford added. Greater Manchester's Police and Crime Commissioner Tony Lloyd implored Oldham to stay away from Evans. 'Ched Evans is a convicted rapist and, whilst I strongly believe in the principle of rehabilitation, it will send out entirely the wrong message if they offer him a contract,' he said. Oldham stand to lose sponsorship revenue if they sign Evans. Oldham chief executive Neil Joy reads out a club statement outside Boundary Park on Monday afternoon . Verlin Rainwater Solutions, which sponsors a stand at Boundary Park, says it would 'be out of the door' if Oldham went ahead with the signing. Another sponsor, Mecca Bingo, tweeted: 'We can confirm will be ending our association with @OfficialOAFC if they sign Ched Evans.' But Web Applications UK, said it would continue to support the club irrespective of its decision. The Football Supporters' Federation (FSF) said fans were split over the issue of whether Evans should be given the chance to play professional football again. An FSF spokesman said: 'There is no clear consensus from fans one way or the other - this is clearly a very divisive issue in society, not just among supporters. 'Some fans argue that footballers convicted of offences such as rape should never be allowed to play professionally again as it is such a serious crime. 'Other supporters say that once an individual is released from prison, they should be allowed to pursue their previous career so long as the law of the land allows it. 'Even if Evans has the right to play, some fans say they would still feel uncomfortable at the implications of a convicted rapist representing their club.' Oldham's secondary shirt sponsors CM Solicitors said the decision was solely down to the club. A statement said: 'As secondary shirt sponsors, we are obviously aware of on-going speculation concerning the possible engagement of Ched Evans by Oldham Athletic. 'Whilst there are many difficult considerations with regards to the matter, we believe that this is solely a matter for the club and we are confident that they will make the right decision in all of the circumstances. 'Whatever the outcome we are and will remain proud sponsors of the club going forward.'","Convicted rapist Ched Evans is without a club after his release from prison .

"Oldham's deal to sign convicted rapist Ched Evans is at an advanced stage and is set to be announced on Thursday. Barring any last-minute issues, the former Sheffield United striker will join the League One club on a two-and-a-half-year deal. The 26-year-old will earn a salary comparable with other Latics players - first-teamers at Boundary Park earn around £800 to £2,000 a week - as club officials want to make the deal 'as normal as possible'. It had previously been suggested that Evans would be paid £400 a week. Oldham Atheltic's deal to sign Ched Evans is at an advanced stage and is set to be announced on Thursday .

Oldham are pressing ahead to sign Evans, who has 13 caps for Wales, despite calls from major political figures and senior police officers as well as more than 60,000 people who signed an online petition. On Wednesday, Oldham sponsor Verlin Rainwater Solutions severed its ties with the club due to the 'imminent signing of Ched Evans' having previously threatened to terminate any involvement with the club should the League One side go through with the move. Craig Verling, a director of Verlin which sponsors a stand at Boundary Park, said in a statement: 'After receiving the news regarding the imminent signing of Ched Evans it is with great regret that Verlin Rainwater Solutions will no longer be associated with Oldham Athletic. 'We would like to take this opportunity to make clear that we feel that Mr Evans should be able to lead a life without further punishment after serving his sentence, although our feelings remain the same that this should not be within the public domain where his previous behaviour may influence the next generation. 'We sincerely wish the club a very successful future and have no regrets about being associated with Oldham Athletic over the past few seasons, but feel our continued support would be sending out the wrong message. Oldham manager Lee Johnson arrives at the training ground on Tuesday . Oldham players begin training on Tuesday, but there was no sign of Evans . Evans hasn't played for a club since Sheffield United in 2012 - for whom he scored 35 goals in his final season . Pressure on Oldham came from prime minister David Cameron on Tuesday, whose official Westminster spokesman outlined his position on an issue that has divided football. 'His view hasn't changed (from) ... the time when there were reports around Sheffield United,' said the spokesman. 'Ultimately, it is for employers to take decisions, but the prime minister does think that footballers are role models and he is sure that any potential would-be clubs and employers will weigh their decisions very carefully.' At one stage on Tuesday a joint statement was being prepared by the Professional Footballers' Association in tandem with Evans, and according to sources might even have contained some words of contrition from the disgraced Welsh international striker. That said, Evans will not want to jeopardise his appeal with the Criminal Cases Review Commission and PFA sources insisted a statement would not be issued after all.

Evans was released from prison last October half way through a five-year sentence for raping a 19-year-old woman. Since then, he has been rejected by Hartlepool and Tranmere. Former club Sheffield United - for whom Evans scored 35 goals in 42 appearances in his final season at Bramall Lane - offered the striker a chance to train with them last November but they retracted the invitation after it caused uproar.","Ched Evans set to sign a two-and-a-half-year deal with Oldham Atheltic .

"Oldham Athletic were occupying a space that proved uncomfortable even for a company that manufactures gutters. The club’s pursuit of Ched Evans, an option board members maintained they were continuing to discuss on Monday night, was too lowly a place for Verlin Rainwater Solutions. As it was for Mecca Bingo. Sign the convicted rapist, they both warned, and their sponsorship of the struggling League One outfit would be terminated. This, it seems, was not Oldham’s greatest concern given the nominal sums of money involved. Far more worrying was the possible loss of Sports Direct’s £1million backing, and the fact that the company’s owner — Newcastle United’s Mike Ashley no less — was being urged by a police commissioner to pull the plug on the Oldham deal should Evans be given a route back into football at Boundary Park. Oldham Athletic were considering signing convicted rapist Ched Evans, pictured in Cheshire on Sunday . Newcastle  owner Mike Ashley has come under pressure to withdraw his £1million sponsorship at Oldham . Oldham Athletic players train on Monday at their Chapel Road training ground but there was no sign of Evans . As Oldham discovered on Monday, this is what happens when you even entertain the idea of signing a footballer only recently released from prison for raping a young woman in a hotel room. There is the public outcry that manifests itself in the form of a petition. Never mind that Oldham currently attract gates of around 4,000. More than 28,000 people had put their names to stopping Evans resume his football career by Monday night. Then, of course, there are the politicians. Sheffield United and Hartlepool have already endured such a response, and it was now Oldham’s turn. There was a protest not just from local MP Debbie Abrahams but Labour leader Ed Miliband and shadow sports minister Clive Efford. Efford called for the FA to intervene and reject Evans’s registration as a player. ‘There are many professions that people cannot return to after committing this sort of crime and football must be one of them,’ he said. Like much of the country, Evans thought he was going back to work. After talks over the weekend he believed a club that could seriously use a striker of his ability — not least after a disastrous December that included a 7-0 thrashing by MK Dons — was prepared to take him on. Board members, owner and chairman Simon Corney among them, appeared prepared for the inevitable backlash in the belief that the pros — a striker who scored 48 goals in 113 games for Sheffield United — outweighed the cons. Oldham boss Lee Johnson later spoke to reporters outside Boundary Park on Monday . A police officer stands outside Oldham Athletic's training ground on Monday morning . So for the first time in nearly three years, Evans thought he was going to be training with a squad of professional footballers again. It would not have been the most glamorous of returns for a player who made 16 league appearances for Manchester City and has represented Wales 13 times. Not when a lack of facilities means the squad and staff change and shower at Boundary Park and make the three-mile journey to and from the training ground in a convoy that includes a kit van. But professional football it remains, and on Sunday Evans was led to believe he was finally emerging from the wilderness. Albeit on a relatively modest £400 a week that some were suggesting was being covered by his fiancee’s millionaire father, who is also funding the legal fight to clear his name. For Lee Johnson, at 33 the youngest manager in the Football League, it seemed a most unwelcome distraction. He handled himself well, facing the media when his employers and the club’s own media officer hid inside Boundary Park. Oldham chief executive Neil Joy reads out a club statement outside Boundary Park on Monday afternoon . At one stage Johnson even emerged in the icy cold with some biscuits and then organised teas and coffees, apologising for the delay in issuing an official club statement. Thanks to Johnson, Monday was not a complete PR disaster for a club that also once found a place for Lee Hughes, who served half of a six-year prison sentence for causing death by dangerous driving. Johnson, it is believed, was against bringing in Evans in the first place even if he did tell the media that he would ultimately support the board’s decision. Whatever the outcome of this sorry saga, his stock has certainly risen. When Neil Joy, Oldham’s chief executive, finally emerged from his Boundary Park office at 4.30 afternoon, it was to deliver a holding statement. ‘We continue to have conversations,’ it read, before asking that the privacy of ‘stakeholders and partners’ be respected. Evans pictured in action for Sheffield United on March 28, 2012 . Evans pictured during a League One match between Sheffield United and Chesterfield in 2012 . Clearly, they still want 26-year-old Evans and clearly they didn’t appreciate being pushed around. It seems they also didn’t appreciate Gordon Taylor’s apparent reluctance to attend a press conference as the chief executive of the PFA. The PFA only represent their members but Oldham rather hoped Taylor would share the burden of responsibility at any possible unveiling. By Monday night, however, the far bigger issue concerned the intervention of Northumbria Police and Crime Commissioner Vera Baird. Responding to reports that Ashley would not object to Oldham’s recruitment of Evans, Baird wrote to the billionaire owner of Newcastle United in the strongest possible terms by urging him to ‘withdraw Sports Direct sponsorship at the club’. If Ashley bows to the pressure, Evans will once again find himself searching for an employer.","Ched Evans has been linked with a move to League One outfit Oldham .

"It weighs six tonnes, it's spinning out of control and now NASA says it is going to plunge back to Earth sooner than expected. NASA space junk experts say the giant satellite is plummeting quicker than expected, with the U.S. space agency now predicting the climate probe will smash to ground on September 23, a day earlier than previously reported. And there is a one in 3,200 chance that pieces of the defunct satellite could hit someone when it does crash land. It would be the first time in history someone was injured by space debris. Danger: The six-ton Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite will crash to Earth and could land in Britain . Best guess: The satellite could fall anywhere between the two latitudes, where billions of people live . The Upper Atmosphere Research . Satellite, or UARS, ran out of fuel in 2005 and could land on any of six . continents. NASA says it could land at any point between 57 degrees . north and 57 degrees south - which includes almost all the populated . areas of our planet (see map below). The bus-size satellite was expected to fall to . Earth sometime this year, with experts initially pencilling a week-long . window between late September and early October, then narrowing it to . the last week of this month. That window, NASA now says, has been trimmed to just three days. 'Re-entry is expected Sept. 23, plus . or minus a day. The re-entry of UARS is advancing because of a sharp . increase in solar activity since the beginning of this week,' NASA . officials wrote in a status update yesterday. NASA spokeswoman Beth Dickey . confirmed with SPACE.com earlier today that the reason UARS is expected . to fall early is because of the sharp increase in solar activity. Solar effects from the sun can create . an extra drag on satellites in space because they can heat the Earth's . atmosphere, causing it to expand, agency officials have said. Astronomer Dr Ian Griffin, from the UK Association of Science and Discovery Centres, says the Earth's atmosphere slows down falling satellites a great deal. He explained that what remains of UARS will hit the ground relatively slowly and 'certainly not at orbital velocity of 17,500mph'. Much of any satellite crashing to Earth will be disintegrated by heat, caused by friction with the atmosphere. It's the reason we get shooting stars - created by meteors burning up in the upper atmosphere. UARS is large enough, though, that up to half a ton will strike the ground. It will probably not be in one piece, however:  space vehicles experience incredible stress on re-entry. The load can be as much as 10Gs. An F1 car experiences around 5Gs with maximum braking from high speed. The reason why the location of the crash site is so hard to predict is because the density of the atmosphere varies so greatly higher up, producing different amounts of drag. A prediction that was wrong by even a few minutes would mean the satellite landing a huge distance away, owing to its speed. Most of the satellite will burn up . during re-entry, but a hefty half-tonne of metal will still plummet to . the Earth's surface. It’s being tracked by the Joint Space . Operations Center of U.S. Strategic Command at Vandenberg Air Force . Base in California, but Nasa admits it has no idea where it will come . down, or when. It predicts that it will enter the atmosphere in late September, but it could be October. The . space agency said that the crash site will be anywhere between 57 . degrees north latitude and 57 degrees south latitude and the remains . could scatter over a 500mile area. That means pieces of it could land in Scotland – or somewhere in Chile. However some experts believe it will . fall into the one of the planet's oceans. 'Look at how much of Earth is . covered with water,' Victoria Samson, the Washington Office Director of . the Secure World Foundation, an organisation dedicated to the peaceful . use of outer space, told SPACE.com this week. 'There's a really good . chance it's going to go straight into the ocean.' And a NASA spokesman pointed out that there has yet to be any reported injury from falling space debris. He said: ‘The risk to public safety or property is extremely small, and safety is NASA's top priority. Since the beginning of the Space Age in the late-1950s, there have been no confirmed reports of an injury resulting from re-entering space objects. ‘Nor is there a record of significant property damage resulting from a satellite re-entry.’ This satellite is far smaller than . the 135-ton Russian space station Mir, which fell to Earth in 2001 or . the 100-ton Skylab that fell in 1979. Mir . fell into the South Pacific, while Skylab hit the Indian Ocean and . parts of sparsely populated western Australia. Because two-thirds of the . Earth is ocean, space debris usually hits water. NASA is urging anyone who finds a piece of the UARS satellite not to touch it. The . spokesman added: ‘If you find something you think may be a piece of . UARS, do not touch it. Contact a local law enforcement official for . assistance.’ It was launched . back in 1991 by the Space Shuttle Discovery to measure ozone levels, . wind speeds and temperatures in the stratosphere. Junk yard in space: UARS is one of the thousands of objects in Earth orbit being tracked by Nasa, as shown by this computer graphic . But now it's one of 370,000 pieces of junk floating in space at speeds of up to 22,000mph. The volume of debris was greatly increased by a 2007 Chinese anti-satellite weapon test and a 2009 crash-in-orbit of two satellites. The widely criticised Chinese test used a missile to smash an ageing weather satellite into 150,000 pieces of 1cm debris and 3,118 pieces can be tracked by radar on the ground.","New date for crash land set for September 23, say NASA space junk experts .

"At Manchester City’s brand new £200million academy, an entire wall is dedicated to the young stars who have graduated to the first-team. Each one has his own disc commemorating the date of his debut. Not surprisingly, Ched Evans has been left off the list. Evans is no longer a source of pride for City. His conviction for rape has understandably overshadowed anything he ever achieved on the football pitch. But there is a reason why clubs like Sheffield United and now Oldham Athletic are prepared to risk their reputations and even sponsorship revenue to sign the player following his release from prison after serving half of a five-year sentence for raping a 19-year-old woman in 2011: Evans is still potentially a very good player. Evans last played for Sheffield United in April 2012 before being sentenced to five years in prison for rape . Evans is yet to sign with a club after serving half the term, but he could still be a very good player . The two-and-a-half years spent behind bars and time away from a professional sports environment will inevitably have taken its toll. However, at the age of 26, these clubs know that Evans could still regain his fitness and form and become a valuable asset to their teams. Those who witnessed Evans’ progress as a young striker are well aware of his potential. Coming through the ranks at City before going out on loan to Norwich and then joining Sheffield United for £3million in 2009, he earned comparisons with a young Alan Shearer. Evans, pictured with fiance Natasha on Tuesday, could sign a deal with League One's Oldham until  2017 . Oldham Atheltic's deal to sign Ched Evans is at an advanced stage and is set to be announced on Thursday . Standing 6ft tall, powerfully built, and quick off the mark, the Welshman had all the tools to be a top striker. He was a natural finisher, scoring 35 goals in 42 games in his last season at Sheffield United before his conviction. But he could also lay on plenty of goals for his teammates and had the kind of awareness and anticipation that separates good strikers from average ones. He was a hard-working forward, strong in the air and more than capable of holding the ball up. Evans slips the ball past Portsmouth keeper David James for Manchester City in 2008 .

Sheffield United '09–12: 103 games, 42 goals . Evans emerged through the ranks at City in the days before the Abu Dhabi takeover. He was a member of the team that reached the 2006 FA Youth Cup final, and the following season scored 16 goals in 23 starts for the club’s youth team, and six in 10 starts for the reserves. He was promoted to the first-team squad and made his debut off the bench in a Carling Cup win over Norwich in September 2007. The youngster was called up by Wales Under-21s and scored 13 goals in 12 games at that level, including hit a hat-trick against France. Evans went out on loan to Norwich for the rest of the season and enhanced his burgeoning reputation by scoring 10 goals from 28 appearances for the Canaries. He was one of a number of young players called up to the senior Wales squad in May 2008 along with Aaron Ramsey and Sam Vokes, and scored the winner against Iceland with a backheel just three minutes after coming off the bench. It was the first of 13 senior caps for his country. Welshman Evans (right) played 13 times for his country and scored on debut against Iceland . Evans (left) is challenged by Scotland's Daniel Fox (right) during an international friendly in 2009 . Following the City takeover, Evans played 25 games for the club in 2008-09, scoring his only Premier League goal in a 6-0 win over Portsmouth. But when Carlos Tevez, Emmanuel Adebayor, Roque Santa Cruz and Craig Bellamy arrived in the summer of 2009, he knew that first-team opportunities would be limited and stepped down to the Championship with Sheffield United despite speculation linking him with a number of other Premier League clubs and Celtic. It was the Blades who first invited Evans to train with them following his release from prison before the invitation was withdrawn in the face of a public backlash and opposition from club patrons, sponsors and even local MPs. Hartlepool and Tranmere both rejected the chance to sign him, and now Oldham have stepped into the firing line. Given his playing career to date and the often cynical world of football, the club’s interest in Evans should perhaps come as no surprise. Nor, however, should City’s desire to erase him from history.","Ched Evans served two-and-a-half years of a five-year sentence for rape .

"Around 3.8 million military veterans will miss out on disability compensation if the government shutdown continues into late October, it emerged today. And some 315,000 vets and 202,000 surviving spouses and dependents will see pension payments stopped, said Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki. But as Shinseki prepares to testify Wednesday in a House hearing about the federal budget stalemate's impact on veterans services, a key Republican is demanding information about an expensive public relations campaign the agency has been running since before the shutdown began. Florida Rep. Jeff Miller, who chairs the House Veterans Affairs Committee, wrote to Shinseki on Tuesday to fund out why his agency 'has continued to run a costly advertising campaign, including expensive television commercials during National Football League games and Major League Baseball playoffs.' 'It appears,' Miller contends, 'that VA spent more than $1 million on television advertisements from September 9th through October 13 , 2013, in the Washington, D.C. metro area alone.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . AAging veterans toured the  World War II memorial on October 2 in Washington, D.C. It was technically closed because of the government shutdown, but visiting veterans groups demanded access . Bad timing? A $1 million public relations campaign is not what the VA wants lawmakers to see while it's complaining about shutdown-related budget shortfalls . The VA sent MailOnline a statement saying that its 'outreach campaign' is 'part of a comprehensive effort to inform Veterans of the benefits and services they have earned and deserved.' But the ad doesn't discuss specific VA benefits, nor does it refer to the shutdown. It tells the story of a female veteran who thanks the agency, vaguely, for helping her grandparents and great-grandparents after they retired from active military duty. 'Every generation of my family has served, and VA has served us all,' the ad's voice-over says. In a separate inquiry, Kansas Republican Sen. Jerry Moran has demanded to know how the VA justified spending $526,000 on artwork at the end of the fiscal year, as shutdown fears loomed largest. Despite its ability to afford the pricey ad blitz and the artwork, the VA now blames shutdown-related furloughs for what it expects will be an increased backlog in processing disability claims. An agency spokesperson said in a statement that . it would no longer be able to assign workers to 'overtime that has . helped VA significantly reduce the disability claims backlog by more . than 190,000 claims over the last six months.' The agency has required its claims processors to work at least 20 hours of overtime ever month since taking a more aggressive approach to the problem in mid-May, according to Military.com News. Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki, a retired U.S. Army four-star general, is facing criticism for heavy spending on nonessential plans like TV ad blitzes and artwork purchases while his agency faced the same shutdown-related cuts as other government offices . Demanding answers: Rep. Jeff Miller (L) and Sen. Jerry Moran (R) want to know why the VA is spending heavily on fluff while leaving hundreds of thousands of veterans' disability claims in a backlog file . Between the overtime strategy and a new paperless claims system, the backlog of 611,000 cases in March shrunk to about 418,500 when the partial government shutdown kicked in. 7,000 of the furloughed workers were posted at the Veterans Benefits Administration, and the rest were employed at the VA’s Office of Information Technology, which runs the more efficient paperless system. Indiana resident Joseph Lohman, a U.S. Marine corporal who served four years before a training accident left him disabled last year, held an all-night, all-day vigil on a freeway overpass this week with an upside down American flag -- a signal of distress . While programs assisting veterans slow to a crawl, regional offices are shuttered and the backlog in those disability claims trends in the wrong direction, a stalemate has brought one house of Congress to act and the other to sit on its collective hands. As the shutdown took shape a week ago, Republicans in the House of Representatives began executing a plan to fund a dozen popular parts of the federal government through separate budget measures, while leaving more contentious programs for later negotiations. The Department of Veterans Affairs was the subject of one of those bills. On Oct. 3. 224 Republicans and 35 Democrats approved the legislation and sent it to the Democrat-controlled Senate. But despite bipartisan support for the resolutions – others included funding for Head Start, the National Institutes of Health, and nutrition for Women, Infants and Children programs – the White House has threatened vetoes and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has declined to bring them up for votes. 'Consideration of appropriations bills in a piecemeal fashion is not a serious or responsible way to run the United States Government,' read a White House statement issued Oct. 2. President Obama did, however, sign into law a Republican-backed measure guaranteeing the paychecks of active-duty servicemen and women during the partial shutdown. His signature came two hours before the spending freeze took effect. And Sen. Ted Cruz, the fiery Texas conservative, said Tuesday that such 'piecemeal' funding measures are 'the traditional means of appropriating and legislating that for centuries this [Senate] has done.' He also said funding soldiers' paychecks and veterans' benefits should go hand-in-hand. 'If we could work together in a bipartisan manner to say we're not going to hold the men and women of the military hostage,' Cruz asked, 'why can't we work together in a bipartisan manner to say we're not going to hold our veterans hostage?' Veterans made their voices heard on Oct. 2 after U.S. Park Police erected barricades to block access to national parks and memorials. Some Republicans have claimed the Obama administration made the shutdown as inconvenient as possible in order to inspire Americans to demand a quick resolution . Sen. Ted Cruz talked with World War II veterans at their outdoor memorial on Tuesday in Washington. He snapped at Democrats for holding veterans 'hostage' in the prolonged budget fight . Senate Democrats have joined Obama in holding out for a more comprehensive solution, a so-called 'clean continuing resolution' that would fund the entire government at once, with no strings attached. Republican House Speaker John Boehner has refused to bring that measure to the floor because his conference requires one very specific string: language that would change portions of the Affordable Care Act that the GOP finds objectionable. President Obama continued to play tough on Tuesday, telling Republicans he would refuse to negotiate over government spending until they had surrendered and reinstated funding across the board . No Republican lawmaker voted in favor of the act, better known as the Obamacare law, when it passed in March 2010. And President Obama has made several changes to the law without consulting Congress. Republicans say one such change, a year-long delay in the law's requirement that businesses offer their employees health insurance plans, should be matched by a similar delay in the law's provision that requires individual taxpayers to sign up for coverage. While the two sides duke it out on the political stage, the individual program funding bills languish in the Senate, with Republicans crying foul and Democrats insisting on an all-or-nothing endgame. Tuesday's statement from the VA, itself an arm of the Obama administration, demanded the latter approach. 'Clear progress for veterans and their families is at risk,' it read, 'without immediate action by Congress to make fiscal year 2014 funding available by passing a clean continuing resolution to reopen the government.' The VA also warned that more basic services like payments related to 'pension, education and vocational rehabilitation programs' could be suspended after late October 'when available funding is exhausted.' The agency's most visible program – its hospitals and other health-care delivery operations – will be immune from the shutdown axe since they're considered 'essential' services.","Around 3.8 million military veterans will miss out on disability payments if shutdown continues to late October .
And some 315,000 vets and 202,000 surviving spouses and dependents will see pension payments stopped .
But Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki is in the hot seat for green-lighting massive feel-good ad blitzes while the shutdown loomed .
One U.S. senator wants to know why the VA spent more than a half-million dollars on fine art in the final days before Oct. 1 .
The agency now says the shutdown has slowed its processing of disability claims by forcing nearly 10,000 furloughs .
House Republicans have passed a standalone bill restoring full funding for veterans programs, but Senate Democrats won't consider it ."
"Juventus continue to hold interest in Patrice Evra despite the Frenchman signing a new contract. The 33-year-old is wanted by Louis van Gaal but knows he won't play regularly following the £28million purchase of Luke Shaw from Southampton. United are being offered numerous stars at the moment but they are wary of being used as a stalking horse for other deals. Packing his bags? Patrice Evra must decide whether to stay at Manchester United or head to Juventus . CLICK HERE to read more big transfer news from Simon Jones. Real Madrid are asking if they have interest in Angel di Maria with agent Jorge Mendes ready to move the Argentine winger to make way for his other client James Rodriguez from Monaco. Di Maria has also been discussed in Madrid's talks involving Radamel Falcao from Monaco. Carlo Ancelotti would prefer Di Maria to stay and he is a poular figure in the dressing room. However, Madrid need to balance the books and know there is better cash available in England from United, Chelsea and Arsenal for Di Maria and Germany midfielder Sami Khedira. World Cup star: Angel di Maria scored the winning goal for Argentina against Switzerland in extra time . Lovren set to leave Southampton . Dejan Lovren is not expected at Southampton for pre-season training after declaring his intent to leave. The Croatian is being pursued by Liverpool who have had two offers rejected so far. The 24-year-old believes an agreed figure has already been bid by Liverpool but Southampton have stalled on a deal while they seek replacements. Italian striker Dani Osvaldo did not turn up for training after providing a note citing medical reasons. He is hoping for revived interest from Inter Milan or Valencia. Southampton hope to finalise Graziano Pelle's move from Feyenoord for around £6.5million. Getting to grips with the situation: Dejan Lovren (right) is ready to play hardball with Southampton . Bacca interesting Newcastle boss Pardew . Newcastle are looking to Spain for their next signing with Sevilla's Carlos Bacca among their targets. Manager Alan Pardew has received glowing reports on the Colombia striker who was voted the best La Liga signing of 2013-14 by Spanish newspaper Marca. Bacca signed from Club Brugge for £5m and Sevilla promptly inserted a buy-out clause of £24m. He went on to score 21 goals in 50 games last season and impressed with his workrate as well as finishing. Injury blow: Colombia were hoping to use Carlos Bacca (left) more at the World Cup but for a thigh strain . Everton, Barcelona and Juventus scouts have all watched him this season and he would have played a more significant role in Colombia's impressive World Cup campaign but for a thigh strain. Newcastle want four more players, depending on sales, following the purchase of Siem de Jong and two strikers are priorities. Alexandre Lacazette of Lyon remains another possibility while a move for Remy Cabella of Montpellier is not dead. Arsenal have made an approach for Mathieu Debuchy but are short of Newcastle's £12m valuation. Taylor to swap West Ham for Burnley . West Ham midfielder Matt Taylor will sign for Burnley on Thursday on a two-year deal. The 32-year-old was out of contract at Upton Park and despite an initial offer of a new deal failed to agree terms. He will have a medical ahead of signing for Sean Dyche. Burnley signed Matt Gilks and have held talks with Steven Reid, another free agent after he left West Brom, over a two year contract. Lancashire here I come: Matt Taylor (centre) is set to leave West Ham for Burnley . Burnley have also had a £5m bid for Watford striker Troy Deeney rejected but will try again. Burnley face competition from West Brom, Swansea, Aston Villa and Norwich but Deeney knows Dyche from his time at Watford and Burnley hope that will help - if they come up with the right money. West Ham have made offers for Dundee United's Andrew Robertson and Norwich's Martin Olsson but held talks yesterday again over a possible deal for Nice left-back Timothee Kolodziejczak. Zenit target Spurs midfielder Sandro . Zenit St Petersburg are keen on Tottenham midfielder Sandro. The Brazilian is favoured by Andre Villas-Boas who knows the player well from his tenure at White Hart Lane. Napoli have shown an interest but have been put of by Tottenham's valuation. Zenit, though, do have more cash to spend and may match Daniel Levy's £20m price tag. Liverpool midfielder Lucas is another option for Napoli whose priority was Maxime Gonalons of Lyon. Hands up if you're on the market: Brazilian midfielder Sandro has a £20m price tag at Tottenham . Tottenham will not be pursuing a deal for Esteban Cambiasso. The 33-year-old Argentina international was offered to Mauricio Pochettino and Franco Baldini but there is no interest as they look for younger players. Cambiasso may now look at options in Spain. Robert Earnshaw is considering an offer to play for ambitious Newport. The much-travelled 33-year-old is the only player to score a hat-trick in all divisions of the English Football League and is a free agent after leaving Blackpool at the end of the season. The League Two side are managed by former Tottenham defender Justin Edinburgh who recognises Earnshaw still has the ability to score goals. Sunderland are willing to let Danny Graham leave for £1m. The 28-year-old cost Sunderland £5m when he joined from Swansea City 18 months ago when Martin O’Neill was in charge on but Graham was quickly discarded after failing to score in 13 games. He spent the whole of last season out on loan, at Hull City then Middlesbrough and scored six goals in 18 games. Middlesbrough remain interested. Moving on: Danny Graham (centre) looks likely to leave Sunderland, with Middlesbrough his likely destination . Sunderland, meanwhile, are among clubs to have been offered the chance to sign France international Mathieu Valbuena. The 29-year-old is performing well at the World Cup but Marseille are willing to sell for around £8m. West Ham have also begun to explore the possibility but are wary Valbuena will want to join one of Europe's elite clubs should he depart France. Wrexham are discussing the possibility of signing Lewis Nuttall from Burnley, Liam Walsh of Swindon and former Leeds United youth captain Corey Roper as part of the pioneering scholarship scheme they have up and running with Glyndwr University. Ipswich defender Aaron Cresswell is having a medical at West Ham ahead of a proposed move to the Premier League club, with Sam Allardyce quickly moving on to new targets after seeing an offer for Norwich's Martin Olsson rejected. West Bromwich Albion had failed to offer the desired amount to Ipswich who have been chasing £3m for the 24-year-old.

"Chelsea are exploring the feasibility of bringing Didier Drogba back to Stamford Bridge. The 36-year-old has interest from clubs in Qatar while Juventus continue to flirt with the idea of taking him to Turin. Yet Jose Mourinho has a strong relationship with the Ivorian and is interested in the idea of him taking on a player-coach role. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Chelsea favourite Didier Drogba score for Ivory Coast . Legend: Mourinho (left) brought Drogba to the club in 2004 from Marseille, and his faith paid off . Elsewhere: The 36-year-old has interest from clubs in Qatar while Juventus continue to flirt with the idea . Qatari clubs are willing to offer greater money with salaries being discussed of around £3million a season after tax but the idea of a return to Chelsea is something both parties wish to look at. Mourinho has great affection for Drogba and knows he could have great influence on a squad that is changing this summer. He declared prior to the Champions League tie with Galatasaray in March that Drogba could return and is keen to fulfil that wish. Drogba won three Premier League titles, four FA Cups and the Champions League while at Chelsea and Mourinho wants to use that experience to good effect with his new additions. Diego Costa has arrived from Atletico Madrid with compatriot Filipe Luis expected to follow. Kurt Zouma has arrived and will go out on loan possibly to Sunderland while another centre-back, midfielder and striker are still to be recruited. Drogba's friend, Petr Cech though could yet depart with Monaco and Paris St Germain at the fore for the the 32-year-old. Return? Drogba was Chelsea's hero in the 2012 Champions League final win over Bayern Munich . Manchester United face a dilemma after Patrice Evra's declaration that he would like to leave. They have invested heavily in Luke Shaw and his age dictates they should possibly look for an established defender to replace Evra and share the burden of being United's first choice left-back. Options: United have talked about Ben Davies of Swansea and Ricardo Rodriguez of Wolfsburg . Native: Louis van Gaal may look towards Dutch international Daley Blind . However, they have spoken about Liverpool and Tottenham target Ben Davies of Swansea and Ricardo Rodriguez of Wolfsburg who are both 21. Another player that has impressed is Daley Blind who is 24. The Dutchman does fall into the category that Louis van Gaal likes of being able to play in a couple of positions but he may be short of pace to play left-back in the Premier League. Evra will be sorely missed at Old Trafford as he moves on to Juventus and he may be followed out the door by quite a few names yet. Van Gaal likes to work with a relatively small squad of around 22 players but United already have a first team squad pushing 40 in number. Near: Barring an unexpected U-turn, Juventus are confident of concluding a deal by the end of this week . Barcelona midfielder Xavi is still considering the option of choosing New York City as his next destination. The 34-year-old has two more years left on contract but is expected to depart. He had an outline agreement with Al Arabi for £6.4m over six months and other offers in Qatar with Michael Laudrup's Lekhwiya interested. Manchester United were also reputed to have made an approach but Xavi wants to take a step down with friends saying he is tired mentally and physically after 16 seasons at the top. The idea of New York appeals as he would join friends David Villa and Thierry Henry plus Frank Lampard. Also the franchise doesn't begin till next year so gives him time to re-charge. Reports have claimed New York has already allocated its designated player budget but the MLS is exploring possible changes to fit in with sensible financial management. Options: Xavi's future is unclear, but the Spaniard has plenty of options around the world . West Ham are hopeful of finalising the transfer of Enner Valencia from Pachuca ahead of competition from Stoke. The 25-year-old scored all three of Ecuador's goals at the finals in Brazil as they went out in the group stages. Porto, Everton and Newcastle have also shown an interest with Pachuca looking for £12million but a deal could be struck at around £10m with Pachuca looking to maintain a sell-on clause. Pachuca club president Jesus Martinez said: 'There are various offers for Enner Valencia, the strongest and closest to what the player and us are demanding is from a club from England. We are making huge steps to finalise the negotiation. From midfield: West Ham are hopeful of finalising the transfer of Ecuadorian Enner Valencia . Talking to Ecuagol, he added: 'We are seeking the possibility that is convenient for him and the club and that he is sold for the price that we like for everything the Mexican league is worth. 'We want to keep a percentage of the player in case he is sold in the future to another big team in Europe. I won't talk about prices, but if he is sold, it will be the highest transfer fee ever in Mexican football, otherwise he won't be sold. 'It hurts me, I don't want to sell him and neither does the manager or the fans but we can't go against the career the kid aspires to, first because of the salary that they pay there, five times bigger (than what he is paid here) and he also wants to prove himself in the best league in the world, which is the Premier League and that will make Pachuca very proud as we will be sending other players to Europe.' Wigan are in discussions with former Cardiff midfielder Don Cowie. The 31-year-old rejected a contract offer from Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and is a free agent. Solskjaer said: 'Don has been a great servant to the club and a fantastic lad to have in the dressing room. There was a contact there, but we have made signings now and Don wanted to keep his options open so all we can do now is wish him all the very best for the future.' Up north: Cowie (right) rejected a contract offer from Cardiff boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer . The Scotland international has had interest from Rangers, Watford and Blackburn but likes the idea of teaming up with Uwe Rosler at the DW Stadium. Meanwhile, Gary Caldwell has made a surprising decision to turn down a prospective move to Greek side Olympiakos. The Greek champions, who completed the signing Patjim Kasami from Fulham on Wednesday. Newcastle have not given up on the possibility of signing Loic Remy from QPR for his designated £8million buy-out. Arsenal have long been considered favourites but Newcastle are hoping Remy has been put off by the prospect of being on the sidelines while Olivier Giroud and Alexis Sanchez dominate the starting slots. Newcastle are also prepared to match Remy's personal terms. Arsenal have enquired about Javier Manquillo the Atletico Madrid right-back. The 20-year-old was due to sign for Marseille on loan but that has stalled after the player heard of Arsenal's interest. Arsene Wenger wants another right-back as well as Mathieu Debuchy with Carl Jenkinson available for sale. Arsenal have considered Calum Chambers at Southampton but the south coast club are reluctant to keep selling their best talent. A loan deal for Manquillo may suit all parties with Chambers being made available next year. Enlarge . Doing a deal: Arsenal want to tie up an £8m move for Queens Park Rangers striker Loic Remy . Liverpool are reluctant to loan Iago Aspas back to Spain and are looking to recoup the majority of the £7million fee they paid to Celta Vigo for the 26-year-old. Sevilla want the striker but can't expect too many favours after their demands over left-back Alberto Moreno's valuation forced Liverpool away from that deal. Aspas will also have to take a 20percent pay cut. Liverpool will sign Benfica's Lazar Markovic today and hope to fend off Tottenham and Borussia Dortmund for Divock Origi from Lille. Money back: Liverpool are reluctant to loan misfit Iago Aspas back to Spain . The £75million deal for Luis Suarez is in place but Barcelona want to finalise the transfer of Alexis Sanchez to Arsenal before announcing and await clarification on FIFA's ban on the Uruguayan. Barcelona are ready to offload Cristian Tello, Isaac Cuenca, Alex Song, Bojan Krkic, Ibrahim Afellay and goalkeeper Oier to help offset spending which will continue with the recruitment of another midfielder and defender. Tottenham's Jan Vertonghen has impressed their scouting team in Brazil. Burnley have expressed an interest in signing Sunderland misfit Danny Graham. Middlesbrough and Watford have also asked about 28-year-old Graham who Sunderland are willing to sell for just £1million. However, Burnley may even be allowed to take him on loan for a season with a small loan fee with Sunderland keen to get his wages off the books.

"They might be three points clear at the top of Serie A, but Juventus manager Massimiliano Allegri is planning further improvements to his attacking forces. Allegri is sizing up Paris Saint-Germain striker Edinson Cavani, according to Corriere dello Sport, although the paper also reports that any deal is only possible if a big money offer comes in for Paul Pogba. And according to Tuttosport, Real Madrid could do exactly that. It also reports that Allegri would use the fee to bolster numerous positions in the Juventus squad, but that Pogba is not desperate to leave the Italian champions.

Sport, meanwhile, emphatically quashes rumours that Lionel Messi could leave Barcelona, describing any potential deal to any club in the world as 'impossible'.
