"One in four women in some parts of the North of England smoke while they are pregnant, shocking new figures have revealed. And across the country as a whole, one in eight women smoke during pregnancy. Despite strong health guidance urging women to quit while preparing for motherhood, about 12 per cent of mothers-to-be in England classed themselves as smokers in 2013/14. The highest rates of smoking during pregnancy were found in Blackpool, South Tyneside and South Tees . This rose to an 27.5 per cent of mothers-to-be in Blackpool. However, the overall figures have dropped to an eight-year low – in 2006/07 15.1 per cent of expectant mothers smoked. Despite this, the researchers say more still needs to be done to reach a national target to bring the rates of smoking in pregnancy down to 11 per cent or less by the end of 2015. In the 12 months to March this year, 75,910 expectant mothers classed themselves as smokers out of 632,960 pregnant women, according to the Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC). In some parts of the country more than one in four pregnant women admitted to being smokers. For example, of those being cared for by NHS Blackpool, 27.5 per cent of pregnant women were smokers. In 2013/14 12 per cent of pregnant women in England smoked - this was the lowest level for eight years . The second highest smoking rate was found in South Tyneside where 25 per cent of pregnant women smoked and South Tees comes in third with 23.9 per cent of mothers-to-be failing to kick the habit. Meanwhile only 1.9 per cent of women cared for by NHS Richmond or NHS Central London smoked during pregnancy. 1. Blackpool 27.5% . 2. South Tyneside 25% . 3. South Tees 23.9% . 4. Mansfield and Ashfield 23.5% . 5. Barnsley 23% . 6. Telford and Wrekin 22.4% . 7. Durham Dales, Easington and Sedgefield 22.3% . 8. Doncaster 22.1% . 9. North East Lincolnshire 22% . 10. Lincolnshire East 21.9% . ‘It is . encouraging to see that since 2006-07 the number of pregnant women who . smoked during pregnancy has declined,’ said HSCIC chairman Kingsley . Manning. ‘However, there is still a little way to go to achieve the national ambition. ‘Today's figures highlight there is a still work to be done and it is fundamental that mothers-to-be are aware of the damaging effects smoking can have on their baby.’ Louise Silverton, director for midwifery at the Royal College of Midwives, added: ‘The evidence about the damage to women and their developing baby from smoking is large and growing, so while the fall is welcome we must strive to reduce it even further. This is particularly needed in high smoking areas. ‘Targets for reduction are fine but they need to be backed up with resources. ‘Health providers should ensure there are enough midwives with the time to offer women support, advice and referral to smoking cessation services. ‘Continuity of care is also important so that midwives can develop a trusting relationship with women, which is critical if women are to feel comfortable in talking about issues such as this. ‘There is also a need for support services that work with the whole family. It is important for the health of the foetus and babies that the woman is in a smoke free environment.’ There's a national target to bring the rate of smoking in pregnancy down to 11 per cent by the end of 2015 . The news comes just days after research from the University of Edinburgh revealed white women in Scotland are more likely to smoke during pregnancy than those from any other ethnic group in the country. The study showed that a quarter of white women in Scotland smoke while pregnant, compared to about 15 per cent of white mothers of other nationalities living in Scotland. Indian, Pakistani and Chinese mothers-to-be in Scotland were the least likely to smoke - less than seven per cent of these women smoked when they were pregnant. Professor Raj Bhopal from the Centre for Population Health Sciences at the University of Edinburgh said: 'Scotland has one of the poorest health records in Europe. ‘It is vital that we take steps to reduce smoking during pregnancy and improve social circumstances for all Scottish mothers if we are to redress this imbalance.' Smoking during pregnancy is strongly discouraged because it can lead to stillbirth, miscarriage, low birth weight and an increased risk of cot death after birth.","Across the whole of England, one in eight women smoke during pregnancy .

"An e-fit of one of the two suspects police believe is responsible for a chemical assault - during which a 56-year-old victim was badly hurt . Police have issued an e-fit of a suspect believed to have left a disabled man with ‘life-changing’ injuries following a chemical attack - believed to be a case of mistaken identity. The 56-year-old, who has not been named, was reportedly assaulted with the 'harmful' liquid at the modern three-storey block in Witham, Essex, at around 10.45am on Friday - as he collected his post. The victim, who believe he was not the intended target, encountered two men banging on the main door. Following a brief exchange the two men threw the harmful liquid, which was in a bottle, over the man and ran off. The victim was taken to Chelmsford's Broomfield Hospital with serious injuries to his face and hands, while police immediately cordoned off the area to members of the public. Despite neighbours describing the attack as 'targeted', police confirmed this evening that the victim had not been the intended target. He remains in hospital receiving treatment for his burns. DS Becky Young said: 'We believe this e-fit to bear a strong likeness to the man involved. He had a distinctive braided hairstyle and we are sure if anyone knows this man they will recognise this picture. 'As we have indicated already the information that we currently have suggests that the victim was not the intended target of this attack. 'The two suspects are described as a white man and a black man and if anyone saw them either in the area prior to this attack or afterwards we would urgently like to speak to them.' Cordons initially put in place in the road have now been released but police have today been carrying out further house to house enquiries in the Bramble Road area. Attack: A man suffered 'life-changing injuries' after he was allegedly attacked with a chemical at the entrance to a block of flats. Above, a policeman and a forensic officers are pictured outside the flats on Friday . Scene: The unnamed victim, who is 56-years-old, was reportedly assaulted with the 'harmful' liquid at the modern three-storey block in Witham, Essex, at around 10.45am on Friday . Examination: A forensic officer examines an item outside the entrance to the block of flats (left), where the man was reportedly attacked  Right, an ambulance is pictured at the scene . Six fire engines and an air ambulance were called to the scene in Bramble Road following the incident, while the East of England Ambulance Service Trust also dispatched its Hazardous Area Response Team. On Friday afternoon detectives and forensic officers were seen going in and out of a ground-floor flat in the block. Donning protective clothing, they bagged up a number of items from the communal entrance to the block, including a drink bottle. The post boxes outside the doorway were also swabbed, while a Police Community Support Officer was posted outside a ground-floor flat to the rear of the building. A neighbour claimed the two male suspects had appeared to 'target' their victim. The woman, who did not wish to be named, said: 'It was a definitely a targeted attack. We saw the car pull up and two men get out. 'They definitely weren't from round here. The police have told us not to say anything more though I am afraid.' Response: Six fire engines, paramedics and an air ambulance attended the scene in Bramble Road . Inspector Dean Stratford, of Essex Police, described the incident as an 'assault' on the day of the incident and said 'chemicals were involved'. 'A man has been assaulted and chemicals were involved,' he said. 'We're making sure the area is safe for the public and the cordon will be in place until that time,' he added. 'At the moment we're trying to ascertain the circumstances around what happened and the investigation is ongoing.' Another neighbour said the attack had come as a 'surprise', saying: 'I've lived here for two years and there's never been any trouble. 'It's a nice area. I don't know the people who live there but it's come as a real surprise.' Investigation: A forensic officer prepares to examine items outside the block of flats on the day of the incident . An Essex Police spokesman said: 'Police were notified by the ambulance service at 10.45am today that a man had suffered injuries at an address in Bramble Road, Witham. 'Officers attended to find that the man had suffered injuries to his hands and face consistent with the use of a harmful liquid. 'The air ambulance were called to the scene but the man was subsequently taken to Broomfield Hospital for treatment by road ambulance. 'The man’s injuries are not believed to be life threatening, but are potentially life-changing.' Police are now appealing for witnesses to the incident.","Man, 56, allegedly attacked with chemical liquid outside flats in Essex .

"Newlywed Anni Dewani, 28, was shot dead while on honeymoon in South Africa . The killer of honeymoon bride Anni Dewani is set to be freed as her husband awaits trial over his alleged involvement in the murder. Gunman Xolile Mngeni killed Anni with a single shot as she sat in a taxi in Cape Town in November 2010 – but now he is set to be released from custody in a ‘mercy’ move because he is dying of cancer. Anni’s husband Shrien, a millionaire businessman from Bristol, is due to go on trial in October after a lengthy battle by South African detectives to charge him with murder. It is alleged he organised the attack. The move to free Mngeni has angered Anni’s family. Last night her father Vinod Hindocha fought back tears as he said: ‘The South Africans should not be thinking about Mngeni right now. They should be concentrating on bringing Shrien to trial.’ Mngeni, 25, is critically ill in a Cape Town hospital, and in a compassionate move similar to that which freed Lockerbie bomber Abdelbaset Al Megrahi, the South African government has now accepted that he has ‘only months to live’. The recommendation that he be released was published in a secret report compiled by South Africa’s correctional supervision and parole board. Official sources said a team of 11 doctors had assessed Mngeni’s condition and concluded that his time was running out. One said: ‘Basically, the doctors say he is going to die soon and it should be as a free man. They don’t see the point of him dying in a cell.’ South Africa’s Justice Department has been asked to seek ministerial approval before Mngeni is released, probably within a few weeks. Mr Hindocha, 64, would not say if he had been formally informed about Mngeni’s imminent release or whether he would be objecting. Xolile Mngeni at Cape Town High Court when he was sentenced to life in prison for the murder of Anni Dewani . But he . added: ‘It took two years to get this individual before the court and . during that time he received the best care doctors could give him. ‘He received a fair trial and was found guilty and given a life sentence. Why should he be freed? Anni's husband Shrien Dewani is due to go on trial in October after a lengthy battle with South African detectives who allege he organised the attack . ‘He showed no such mercy to Anni, a defenceless young woman. I do not want revenge against him. I just want justice.’ Mngeni’s trial was postponed several times after he was arrested for shooting Swedish-born Anni in the back of a taxi on the outskirts of Cape Town. Said to be suffering a brain tumour, he vomited blood and keeled over during one hearing, forcing the judge to adjourn proceedings. But in December 2012, he was given a life sentence, with the judge branding him ‘evil’. Two other men, Zola Tongo and Mziwamadoda Qwabe, are serving lengthy prison sentences for their part in the murder. Tongo alleged he was approached by Shrien Dewani, and claimed he offered him about £1,340 to organise the killing and make it look like a carjacking. Dewani, 34, denies the allegations. In April, Dewani’s battle against extradition ended and he was flown from Britain to Cape Town where has been on remand in a psychiatric hospital. He had fought the extradition on the basis that he was suffering post-traumatic stress.","Killer of honeymoon bride Anni Dewani is to be released in a 'mercy' move .

"A Chinese woman was horrified to be told she had an 8ft tapeworm living inside her. The woman, known only as Mrs Li, is thought to have picked up the worm from eating undercooked meat while travelling in South East Asia earlier this year. She has now had the worm removed but says the thought of it still makes her feel ill. The Chinese woman, known only as Mrs Li, had an 8ft tapeworm (pictured) removed from her intestines . She told Chinese media: ‘It’s disgusting and almost makes me faint.’ Mrs Li, who is in her 30s and lives in Xiamen, in China’s Fujian Province, visited a doctor after she started to feel unwell and noticed unusual fluids in her stools. She was diagnosed with teniasis – an infection cause by a tapeworm, The Mirror reports. She believes she picked up the worm by eating rare beef while on holiday in January. Doctors treated her with traditional Chinese medicines and she was able to pass the tapeworm in May. She is now recovering well. A tapeworm is a parasite that can live in a person's bowel. They tend to be flat, segmented and ribbon-like. Humans can catch them by touching . contaminated stools and then touching their mouths, by swallowing food . or water that contains traces of contaminated faeces or by eating . undercooked, contaminated port, beef or fish. Mrs Li is thought to have picked up the worm from some rare beef. Image shows a beef tapeworm's head . Symptoms of a tapeworm infection include stomach pain, vomiting and diarrhoea as well as weight loss and malnutrition. However, some patients have no symptoms and are unaware of their infection until they see segments of the worm in their stools. Beef tapeworms can be easily treated with tablets. However, infection with other tapeworms can lead to serious complications. This is because their larvae can settle in other parts of the body. Tapeworm infections are most commonly seen in the developing world - they are rare in the UK.","Mrs Li probably picked up the worm while travelling in South East Asia .

"A boxing commentator and radio host has been suspended from his job with ESPN-LA Radio following a conversation he had on-air. Max Kellerman was on the Mason and Ireland show which leads into his afternoon drive program when the subject of Ray Rice's domestic abuse of his wife arose. Kellerman admitted on-air that he hit his girlfriend many years ago. On-air admission: Max Kellerman told listeners that he once hit his girlfriend during a discussion of Ray Rice . The New York Daily News reports that ESPN suspended Kellerman following the 'inappropriate' comment. ESPN issued a statement Friday afternoon neither confirming nor denying that Kellerman had been suspended. 'Max Kellerman will return to ESPN-LA Radio and SportsNation on Thursday,' it read. The startling admission occurred as Kellerman related a story about his then-girlfriend, now wife Erin Kellerman. Married father: Kellerman with his family on a shopping trip . Suspended: The ESPN boxing commentator and radio host has reportedly been suspended for the comments . Sensitive issue: Stephen A. Smith was roundly criticized by Max Kellerman's (right) SportsNation co-host Michelle Beadle (center) for his comments about domestic abuse . According the the Daily News, he said that the pair were at a college party and both had too much to drink. The situation escalated and his girlfriend hit him. He hit her back, he said, but the incident was a one-off and they have been happily married for 20 years. While Kellerman's admission of having hit a woman was upsetting, the reason for his suspension is for discussing Ray Rice's domestic abuse, which is extremely controversial after Stephen A. Smith's recent debacle. 'Egregious error': The subject of Ray Rice's (left) domestic abuse has also gotten ESPN's Stephen A. Smith suspended . Kellerman's suspension comes three days after Smith was suspended for comments he made while discussing the same case. Smith condemned domestic violence but advised women not to 'provoke' men to it. 'Let's make sure we don’t do anything to provoke wrong actions,' he said, presumably to his female viewers. '...I think that just talking about what guys shouldn’t do, we got to also make sure that you can do your part to do whatever you can do to make, to try to make sure it doesn’t happen.' He later issued a taped apology calling his comments the most 'egregious error' of his career.","Max Kellerman has been suspended from his ESPN positions .

"Zinedine Zidane has revealed he told Real Madrid president Florentino Perez to sign Steven Gerrard in the summer of 2004 - but the Liverpool captain would not leave Anfield.

"A mother who ballooned to 20st eating takeaways when her daughter was seriously ill has gone on to shed 7st. Jodie Edkins, 34, from Belper, Derbyshire, was a self-confessed McDonald's addict, who would devour McDonald's food every day - and often for every meal. She ballooned to a size 26 after gorging on the greasy takeaways when her daughter, Isla, was diagnosed with a brain tumour in 2011. Jodie Edkins ballooned to 20st (left) when her . daughter, Isla, was battling a brain tumour. After Isla started to . recover, Mrs Edkins realised she needed to change her ways and she lost . 7st in a year (right) She spent so much time looking after her daughter, she grabbed meals from a drive thru’ on trips back and forth from the hospital. But after Isla was given the all-clear, Mrs Edkins realised she had become someone she didn't recognise - and after quitting her Big Mac habit, has lost 7st. During the past three years, Mrs Edkins has devoured over 1,000 Big Macs. She said: ‘I was a McDonald's addict. It was a dirty cycle of eating as the food was so cheap, quick and easy. ‘It was a quick fix - a case of grab and go. I had to be there for my daughter so I didn't have time to prepare anything healthy, or sit down to a home cooked meal.’ The stress of looking after Isla and ferrying her to and from hospital meant Mrs Edkins was constantly indulging her McDonald's habit. Mrs Edkins says that she put on weight because, while Isla was ill, her only comfort was food . She said: ‘With Isla being in hospital, I didn't have time to think of me, so I would just grab McDonald's wherever I could. ‘We would always make a pit stop at the drive thru’ on the way to or from the hospital. ‘And when we got home, I was too exhausted to cook so we would get a McDonald's meal. ‘I was an addict and to make it worse, the McDonald's was literally across the road from my house. It was so convenient, quick and cheap.’ At her heaviest Mrs Edkins weighed 20st and wore a dress size 26 meaning she was severely obese. Mrs Edkins, who works at Morrisons, said: ‘My priority was Isla and making sure she was alright, so I didn't really think about myself or how big I was getting.’ In 2013 the family received the news that Isla was able to have an operation to remove most of the benign tumour and the little girl is now fully recovered. Mrs Edikins (pictured during her weight loss) says that the thought of takeaways turns her stomach now . Mrs Edkins is now going to start running her own Slimming World classes . And this positive news meant Mrs Edkins could spend more time to spend on herself, for the first time in three years. She said: ‘I was going out one evening and I looked at myself in the mirror. I hadn't realised how big I had got. ‘I was horrified and didn't recognise the person I saw.’ Mrs Edkins realised all the days eating McDonald's for breakfast, lunch and dinner had had a massive effect on her weight, and health. She said: ‘I was out of breath all the time and it was a struggle to pick up my children- which was awful. ‘I finally realised how much I had neglected my health, eating all the Maccys all time. I was an addict and I needed to stop.’ Mrs Edkins, who is also mother to ten-year-old Izaak and Frankie, four, went to McDonald's for her last supper in June 2013, and had a Big Mac for one final time. Mrs Edkins (pictured with Isla since her weight loss) says she knew her junk food diet was killing her, but didn't care as she was so preoccupied looking after her daughter . She said: ‘After that I knew I had to turn my back on the McDonald's for the sake of me and for my family.’ Since then she has lost a staggering 7st thanks to the support of her Slimming World group and is now a size 14. She makes home cooked meals such as chili and salad, or pasta, and eats yoghurt and fruit for lunch. She said: ‘My children and my husband Doug can't believe the change in me- a year ago I was addicted to McDonald's but now I am loving my figure and leading a healthier life.’ Mrs Edkins has now trained to be a Slimming World advisor in her home town of Belper. She said: ‘I am so pleased I turned my back on the McDonald's. I look forward to going shopping now because of all the clothes I can wear and I want other busy mums to know that they can lose the weight too. ‘I don't even miss the McDonald's now- I am so much happier without it in my life.’","Jodie Edkins started to put on weight when her daughter, Isla, became ill .

"Ian Thorpe, the five-time Olympic swimming champion, is gay. He came out during an emotional interview with Sir Michael Parkinson broadcast in Australia on Sunday. It turns out one of the most successful blokes in Australian sporting history likes other blokes. Whoever would have thought it? I bumped into Thorpe at the BBC’s Olympic Park studio during London 2012. He was an excellent pundit — knowledgeable, respected and flamboyantly over the top in his enthusiasm. Someone was complimenting presenter Gabby Logan on the handbag that was lying around the green room. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Thorpe open up in an exclusive interview with Parkinson . Bold announcent: Ian Thorpe revealed that he is gay during an interview broadcasted on Sunday . ‘Oh that’s not Gabby’s,’ said the make-up lady. ‘It’s Thorpey’s.’ We all smiled. Of course it was. The reaction to Thorpe’s interview has been similar: overwhelmingly positive and supportive, thank goodness, but underpinned by a shrug of the shoulders. Thorpe has not announced his sexuality, but merely confirmed what everyone thought they knew. It’s more revealing that the 31-year-old had to wait until his competitive career was over to reveal the blindingly obvious. Thorpe claimed he was heterosexual as recently as his 2012 autobiography and only now, after battling depression, has he felt able to admit the truth. A reported £220,000 incentive for joining Australia’s Channel 10, with the interview no doubt timed to attract maximum publicity just before the start of the Commonwealth Games, perhaps provided the final nudge. It is telling, though, that this acutely personal journey has taken so long to reach its  public conclusion. All smiles: Thorpe (right) revealed his sexuality in a TV interview with Sir Michael Parkinson (left) Thorpe told lie upon lie until the web of deceit was too tightly spun for the truth to shine through. ‘What happened  was I felt the lie had become so big that I didn’t want people to question my integrity,’ he said. ‘A little bit of ego comes into this. I didn’t want people to question that... have I lied about everything?’ Thorpe’s hesitance to tell the truth is understandable. He was only 15 when he won his first World Championship gold medal and soon he was too famous and too deep in denials to go back on his word. Don’t forget, he lives in a world where an Aussie rules commentator, Brian Taylor, feels able to use the phrase ‘big poofter’ on national television and then only offer a half-hearted apology at half-time. Ruthless: Parkinson (left) did not hold back when he sat down with former Olympic swimmer Thorpe (right) No holds barred! The tell-all interview aired on Sunday on Australian channel Network Ten . Our default position to describe athletes who do decide to talk about their sexuality is still to call them ‘brave’ or ‘courageous’,  simply because they are still in the overwhelming minority. This is lazy and slightly patronising, because the many who remain silent are not weak, they are just more private individuals. Athletes do not have a responsibility to talk about their sexuality; only an obligation to do their job to the best of their ability — by winning matches or medals or whatever it happens to be. They have to do whatever is best for them during their short careers. If that does not include pandering to public interest about their sexual orientation, then so be it. Sport does, however, give athletes the opportunity and the platform to discuss their sexuality if they so wish; to become instant role models for youngsters who might be wrestling with the same feelings themselves. Nobody is saying it will be easy, particularly for a young man or woman already dealing with the pressures of sporting fame and fortune. Yet Thorpe turned down that chance, time and time again. He did not feel ready or able to seize it. The fact he finally has, after more than a decade as a public figure, makes it crass to simply shrug our shoulders and say ‘so what?’. Overnight, Thorpe has become Australia’s most successful gay swimmer. Or, to put it a better  way, we can finally see Australia’s most successful swimmer in his true light. A good get! 'Ian has always been near the top of my list to interview,' Parkinson said . American hurdler Queen Harrison, 25, provided not one but two of the best quotes of the Glasgow Grand Prix this weekend.‘Every time I race I go out there to have FUN, run FAST, and look FABULOUS!’ she said, adding: ‘I think the UK crowds love me because my name is Queen.’ Brilliantly bonkers. Great Britain’s Under 20 basketball team progressed from the group stage of the European Championships for the first time — a huge achievement for a developing team sport shockingly bereft of  elite-level funding. Meanwhile, the Government is apparently too busy handing over £7.5m to help set up GB’s America’s Cup team to notice.","Ian Thorpe reveals he's gay in interview with Sir Michael Parkinson .

"Leo Burrell, who was not expected to to walk after suffering brain damage at birth, has defied medics and taken his first steps after copying his favourite pirate programme . A toddler who suffered brain damage at birth has defied medics and learned to walk by copying pirates on his favourite TV show. Leo Burrell suffered a traumatic brain injury when he was starved of oxygen during his planned  home birth at the family home in Royal Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, in April 2012. He was rushed to hospital where doctors managed to get him breathing before he was put on a special temperature mat for three days to cool his body down. Doctors told his parents Carol, 33, and Matthew, 32, their son was likely to be disabled and would never walk, talk or feed himself. But after spending most of his first year in hospital for a series of operations and rehabilitation therapy, Leo defied medics by learning to speak aged 20 months. And the remarkable toddler then stunned his parents when he achieved another milestone and walked for the first time on his second birthday. Today, his proud parents recalled the moment he took his first wobbly steps after copying pirates walking the plank on his favourite CBeebies show Swashbuckle. Mr Burrell, who runs a software business, said: ‘He was at home against the sofa while his favourite programme Swashbuckle was on. ‘He loves Swashbuckle and gets all excited about it. His favourite bit is joining in with the singing and dancing bit. ‘He was standing against the sofa and copying them saying “walk the plank, walk the plank”. ‘At first he was throwing himself to the floor but he just started to take some steps. ‘We were amazed and after a few minutes he was walking halfway across the room. ‘Before . he could stand and balance and walk using his baby-walker or holding . our hands but it’s like the show just gave him the confidence to try it . on his own. ‘We were all crying because we were so happy, so proud. He’d only just learned to crawl three weeks before.’ Leo, pictured having treatment at Birmingham Childrens Hospital, was starved of oxygen during his birth and his parents were warned he would never walk or talk . Leo was born at home and had to be rushed to hospital where he spent time in intensive care (pictured) Full-time . mother, Mrs Burrell, who used to work as a project manager in the . charity sector before becoming Leo’s carer, added: ‘It was just amazing, . we just couldn’t believe it. ‘He was on his own and all of a sudden he just started walking. It was such an incredible moment.’ Leo's parents, who have another son, . William, five, are amazed by his achievements and hope he will soon no longer need the feeding tube he currently has. They also want doctors to be more positive when informing families about their child’s possible recovery from a brain injury. His . mother added: ‘He was born at home and was oxygen deprived so he was . taken to Warwick Hospital then Wolverhampton for brain cooling. ‘He . had quite a bleak prognosis and we were told it was likely he’d be . disabled. We didn’t think he’d walk, talk or feed without a feeding . tube. Leo Burrell (pictured with parents Mark and Carol) defied doctors to walk despite suffering brain damage . ‘It was devastating and it’s been difficult with him being in and out of hospital. But he’s gone on to do so well. ‘The . doctors told us the worst case because it was a severe case. But we . think they should be more honest and said it’s very unpredictable with . babies. ‘Some children with a brain injury make a really good recovery like Leo has so they should let people know that is a possibility too.’ Incredibly, just a week after he learnt to walk, Leo dressed up as Buzz Lightyear and joined his friends on the ‘Big Toddle’ at Inside Out Nursery in Bubbenhall, Warwickshire. The family originally planned to raise £100 for Barnardo’s but managed to gather almost £1,000 - the most single-handedly raised for the national event.","Leo Burrell, two, was starved of oxygen at birth and suffered brain damage .

"Re-live all the drama here . There was no transfer bombshell on deadline day at Real Madrid so Cristiano Ronaldo took it upon himself to send a few shockwaves through the club with a damning indictment of its transfer policy. ‘If I was in charge, maybe I would have done things differently’ he said at the Jarama racing circuit in Madrid on Monday fresh from a publicity shoot for watch makers Tag Heuer with Jenson Button. What did he mean by ‘doing things differently’? Did he mean he would not have allowed Angel Di Maria – Real Madrid’s top assist provider last season to leave? VIDEO Scroll down for Ronaldo: Falcao and Di Maria excellent players for United . Damning: Cristiano Ronaldo claims he would do things differently if he were in charge at Real Madrid . Did he mean he would not have sold the team’s hugely experienced midfield fulcrum Xabi Alonso to a direct Champions League rival in Bayern Munich before new man Toni Kroos was properly bedded-in? Did he mean would not have bought a Manchester United reserve team striker in Javier Hernandez in the name of providing competition for Real Madrid’s only out and out centre-forward, Karim Benzema? Did he mean he would not have left Benzema as the club’s only centre-forward by selling Alvaro Morata to Juventus? Upset? Ronaldo has seen Madrid's top assist provider Angel di Maria leave for Manchester United . Did he mean he would have moved on Sami Khedira who only has a year left on his contract or Alvaro Arbeloa who has fallen out with captain Iker Casillas as well as out of both the Spain and Real Madrid team? Or was he just referring to the failure to bring the prolific Radamel Falcao to the club on loan; an option subsequently taken up by Manchester United, after Madrid repeatedly turned down the offer. Ronaldo was vague. He also added: 'I have a very clear opinions but I can’t always say what I think’. He had said enough. Sign here, please: Di Maria signed for United in a £60million British record fee move . Real Madrid started the month of August so well. They had signed three of the best performers from the last World Cup in Kroos, James Rodriguez and Keylor Navas and won the European Super Cup against Sevilla fielding the most expensive team in history. What could possibly go wrong? Watching them collapse against Real Sociedad at the weekend albeit without Ronaldo has sounded alarm bells however. It was not just the tactical chaos – that might be expected after so many comings and goings; it was more the attitude questioned by Iker Casillas in his post match interview. He spoke about the weight of the Madrid crest on the shirts and how it needed to be respected with performances worthy of it. Red: Madrid have also missed out on Radamel Falcao, who signed for United on Monday . For Ancelotti it’s a case of back to the drawing board. The team he built to win the club’s 10th European Cup has been ripped up. Two-thirds of the Alonso, Modric, Di Maria midfield is gone. The Argentine was vital on the left of the middle three in the 4-3-3 system because he could protect the left-back (be it Marcelo or Fabio Coentrao) when their natural attacking tendencies left them exposed. Modric did the same on the right hand side because Carvajal, like Marcelo and Coentrao needs protecting. On Sunday against Real Sociedad James was left shielding Carvajal and the result was freeway of opportunity down Madrid’s right-hand side that Sociedad made the most of in their four goal comeback. VIDEO Game of two halves - Ancelotti . Bad start: Carlo Ancelotti's (right) side were beaten 4-2 by Real Sociedad on Sunday . Defensively the squad is untouched despite it not being too difficult to make a case for that group of four full-backs Marcelo, Arbeloa, Fabio Contrao and Carvajal needing to be freshened up. The decision not to sign Falcao was explained away by an interest in protecting Benzema who has just been given a new deal and according to general wisdom at the club, ‘performs better when not in danger of losing his place’. There was a feeling that Falcao would take his place and would also not dovetail so nicely with Bale and Ronaldo. It’s a decent argument – Benzema is happy to make those runs away from goal that open up space for Bale and Ronaldo that Falcao simply does not make. Step back? The Champions League winners signed Javier Hernandez (above) on transfer deadline day . You're driving: Ronaldo was speaking at a TAG Heuer event where he appeared alongside Jenson Button . Falcao relies on crosses that Bale and Ronaldo tend not to make –both like to come inside and shoot off their stronger foot rather than go on the outside and offer an assist. All that being the case why then buy a player who also relies on a six-yard-box service? Javier Hernandez is not quite Julien Faubert loaned to Madrid from West Ham in 2009 but he comes close in terms of strange unexpected signings. He may well score goals coming off the bench against weaker La Liga opposition and Khedira may well find the motivation in his final year to do Di Maria’s midfield running. That would enable Ancelotti to sort out the expensive mess. An expensive mess is after preferable to a cheap mess. But don’t expect the small fact that he won the Champions League just over 100 days ago to give him much of a grace period if he doesn’t get it right quickly. The pressure, after an at first impressive but ultimately questionable transfer window, is most definitely on. 'My opinion is very clear but I can’t always say what I think...If I was in charge I wouldn’t have done things like this...But if the President thinks the best thing for the team is to sign the players he signed and let others leave you must respect and support his decisions. 'With the new players the style will change, but it could change for the best or the worse. Hopefully it is for the best as they are players of a very good level. 'Di Maria and Xabi were very important for us, but they are no longer here and we must be happy with the new players. 'I’m sure it will all go well. Ancelotti has a lot of experience and knows what the team needs and doesn’t need. We lost but there is no need for alarm, we have to let the boss work in peace. 'Next week I will be 100 per cent for the ‘derbi’.'

"People who meet their sexual partners through dating apps are more likely to catch an STI, new research suggests. The study found the risk is higher for those who meet people through apps than for those who meet sexual partners online or in bars and clubs. In the last few years, smartphone apps - such as Tinder and Grindr - have become increasingly popular ways to meet potential sexual partners. People who meet sexual partners through phone apps are more likely to have an STI, study finds . They allow registered users to use their smartphones’ GPS to locate and network with other users in the vicinity. Grindr, which was one of the first such apps, accumulated 2.5 million new users in 2012, and in 2013 reported that it had six million users in 192 countries. But, the research, which was published in the journal Sexually Transmitted Infections, revealed they are not without their downsides. Researchers collected data on 7,000 gay men attending a sexual health clinic in Los Angeles between 2011 and 2013. All of the participants provided information about their drug use and how they find sexual partners. A third revealed they meet sexual partners in person only, 30 per cent said they use a combination of person-to-person and online dating and 36 per cent said they use smartphone apps. People who meet sexual partners through apps are more likely to have chlamydia (pictured) and gonorrhoea but they are no more likely to be HIV positive or to have syphilis . The results also showed the apps tend to be favoured by the under-40s and by well-educated men of white or Asian ethnic backgrounds. One theory is that smartphone . apps make it easier to meet potential partners more quickly than online . or more traditional methods, thereby boosting the chances of anonymous . and riskier encounters. Men who use them were also found to be more likely to use recreational drugs. The researchers analysed the results of these men’s sexual health checks and found those who used smartphone apps to hook up were more likely to have common STIs than those who met people in bars or clubs. They were also more likely to have sexually transmitted infections that were men who met sexual partners online. Overall, smartphone users were 23 per cent more likely to be infected with gonorrhoea and 35 per cent more likely to be infected with chlamydia. However, methods of approach made no difference to the likelihood of infection with either HIV or syphilis. The study authors wrote: ‘Technological advances which improve the efficiency of meeting anonymous sexual partners may have the unintended effect of creating networks of individuals where users may be more likely to have sexually transmissible infections than other, relatively less efficient social networking methods.’ They added: ‘Technology is redefining sex on demand. Prevention programmes must learn how to effectively exploit the same technology, and keep pace with changing contemporary risk factors for [sexually transmitted infections] and HIV transmission.’","People who meet sexual partners on apps are more likely to have an STI .

"The Ocean Drive mansion where Gianni Versace lived and died is to reopen this month as luxury boutique hotel Villa by Barton G. Situated on South Beach in Miami, the five-star property is where the Italian designer was shot dead on its front steps by serial killer Andrew Cunanan in 1997. Reopening fully by the end of March, the 10-suite Villa by Barton G boasts 54-foot 'thousand mosaic' swimming pool lined in 24-carat gold, which was designed by Versace. Boutique hotel: Villa by Barton G is to reopen at Gianni Versace's former mansion on Ocean Drive in Miami . Design marvel: The style of Villa by Barton G is very much in keeping with the lavish tastes of its former owner . Extravagant design: Each of the rooms boasts Egyptian cotton linens, patios and balconies, and Italian marble bathrooms . The hotel promises the 'ultimate sensory experience', with walls of decorative pebble mosaics, lavish frescoed ceilings and meals served on Versace-designed Rosenthal china. Rooms range in size from the Medallion Suite, the smallest at 434sq-ft, overlooking a stunning mosaic at the mansion, to the 1,428sq-ft Venus Suite, which features two private balconies with a view of Ocean Drive, and the Versace-designed swimming pool. Guests can also stay in the designer's former bedroom. The 1,174sq-ft Villa Suite boasts a nine-foot double king-size bed, two balconies, seven custom-made closets and an ornate oversized shower. Each of the guest rooms features king and double-king beds with custom Egyptian cotton linens, goose down pillows and duvets, patios and balconies, and Italian marble bathrooms. Casa Casuarina: Versace bought the mansion in 1992, spending £20m on renovations . New start: The The 23,000-square-foot mansion has 10 bedrooms, 11 bathrooms and an open-air courtyard . Boutique luxury: The property was bought for £25m by VM South Beach last year . A stay at the boutique hotel also includes access to two private lounges and the villa garden, and guests can enjoy spa services in their bedrooms, at the poolside or on the villa rooftop. Prices for suites start at $795 (£475) per night; the Villa Suite starts from $2,200 (£1,315) per night, with all prices exclusive of breakfast. The hotel is expected to attract VIPs, with Kim Kardashian pictured waving from one of its balconies last week, as one of the first celebrities invited to stay at the newly opened venue. Originally called Casa Casuarina, the gated mansion was purchased by VM South Beach for $41.5m (£25m) in September 2013. The company's principals include the Nakash family of New York, which owns American clothes company Jordache Enterprises. At the time, Joe Nakash, chairman of Jordache Enterprises, said he would retain all the vestiges of Versace's time in South Beach in the 1990s. Last month, Villa by Barton G launched its new Mediterranean restaurant Il Sole - Italian for 'The Sun'. Expansion: The home was remodelled by Versace after he fell in love with the property . History: Though the Versace family hasn't owned the oceanfront mansion since 2000, auctioneers hoped the designer's legacy would attract potential buyers . Renowned Miami chef Scott Linquist and pastry chef Luis Vasquez oversee the menu, which features dishes served on Versace-designed Rosenthal china, including fish flown in daily from Honolulu. 'We are certain that under the innovative and expert culinary guidance of Chefs Linquist and Vasquez, and the pleasure of working with the Nakash Family, Il Sole will define itself as an exciting new entry into the arena of South Florida dining,' Scott said. The mansion has been officially named Casa Casuarina for more than a decade, operating first as a private club and then as a boutique hotel until it closed last year. But locals still refer to it as 'the Versace mansion'. The designer bought a neglected three-story, Mediterranean-style home, originally built in 1930 by Standard Oil heir Alden Freeman, and a dilapidated hotel next door in 1992 and spent $33m (£20m) on renovations. The 23,000-square-foot mansion has 10 bedrooms, 11 bathrooms and an open-air courtyard.","Villa by Barton G boasts 54-foot 'thousand mosaic' Versace-designed pool .

"Kell Brook will end 18 months of waiting on Saturday night when he faces Shawn Porter for the IBF welterweight title in Carson, California. Both Brook and Porter made the weight when the two weighed in on Friday night with the IBF champion coming in slightly heavier. Unbeaten Sheffield fighter Brook tipped the scales at 146.5lbs while champion Porter was 146.75lbs.

Porter's subsequent four-round win over Paulie Malignaggi in April underlined the size of task facing Brook who heads into the fight with a 32-fight unbeaten record. But the Sheffield man is convinced all the waiting will have been worth it when he gets in the ring for a bout which will leave the winner in a position to take any number of lucrative showdowns ahead. Brook said: 'This has been a long time coming but I've finally arrived at the big stage now. 'It's every fighter's dream to win a world title and it's all I've been thinking about through training and waiting. Somebody's 0 has got to go: Both Porter and Brook are unbeaten in their careers . 'I know Shawn Porter is a very tough customer and a very worthy champion, but this is my time. I'm very well prepared mentally and physically and Saturday night cannot come quick enough for me.' While Brook has designs on a domestic super-fight against Amir Khan, Porter believes another headline win could put him in the frame for a meeting with Floyd Mayweather. Porter's slow-burning career looked to have stalled when he fought a draw with veteran Julio Diaz in 2012, but a subsequent rematch win followed by his last two top-level performances have suddenly made him a man to be reckoned with. Fighting fit: Both Porter and Brook looked in good shape as they weighed in ahead of their fight . Porter said: 'I am one of the quickest and strongest guys in my weight class and I'm probably the most confident too. 'I've done enough homework to know I can beat him.

"Banksy's latest creation in New York is an open-air gallery featuring two pieces on canvas hanging under the High Line in Chelsea. The pieces appear to be a collaboration between Banksy and Brazilian twins, Os Gemeos. Banksy reportedly paid the owner of the space $50,000 to hang his two paintings under the overpass on West 24th between 10th and 11th Avenues. Under guard: Banksy unveiled his latest artwork in the Chelsea neighborhood of New York as part of 'Better Out Than In' Best behavior: Banksy's guards imposed strict rules on crowds eager to view and photograph the works . It's the latest installment of 'Better Out Than In,' Banksy's month-long 'residency' in New York City. The artist announced the works himself on his website. 'Are you the sort of person who enjoys going to art galleries, but wished they had more gravel in them? Then this temporary exhibition space is for you. Housing just two paintings but also featuring a bench, some carpet and complimentary refreshments. Opens today through Sunday 11am til midnight,' he wrote. Refreshments is probably overstating it a little, unless you're in the market for some yellow liquid, reportedly non-alcoholic white wine, dispensed through a water cooler. Chelsea opening: In an area known for swanky galleries, Banksy offered a water cooler filled with white non-alcoholic wine for attendees . Collaboration: Brit Banksy created the works with Brazilian artist Os Gemeos .

According to Gothamist, the space is owned by New York property developer Alf Naman. Banksy has caused quite a stir in the Big Apple, where he's undertaking a month-long self-imposed residency. New Yorkers wake every morning to discover a new work adorning some corner of the city.

"A man who developed kidney failure after swimming in a dirty hotel pool has been given a new lease of life after his father donated one of his organs. Aidan Sheikh-Husseyin, 23, from Ringwood, Dorset, was on holiday in Turkey three years ago when he picked up E. coli from a swimming pool. The infection is thought to have led to him developing kidney failure and left him in desperate need of a transplant. Aidan Sheikh-Husseyin, 23, has been saved by his father, Ilkay Husseyin, 46, who gave him a new kidney . He is now recovering after his father, Ilkay Husseyin, gave him a new kidney. Mr Sheikh-Husseyin, who was diagnosed with kidney failure last year, said: ‘I was at college one day and was playing football when I started to lose colour, feel faint, my heart rate increased and I had swelling in my legs. ‘I went to the doctor who initially thought there could be a problem with my heart. ‘Nothing progressed from that and I felt OK, so I quickly moved on, until one day my girlfriend, Abi, made a comment about the appearance of my urine. ‘Together we looked on the internet at what bubbles in urine means and there was a suggestion of kidney failure. ‘Under Abi’s instruction I went to see my GP later that week with a urine sample, and that same day the GP referred me to Queen Alexandra Hospital in Portsmouth and said I needed a biopsy immediately.’ Mr Sheikh-Husseyin (pictured in hospital) is thought to have picked up E. coli from a hotel swimming pool. This bug is then believed to have caused damage to his kidneys . Mr Husseyin was found to be a suitable kidney donor for his son after six months of tests . A biopsy revealed Mr Sheikh-Husseyin had severe renal failure and doctors advised he needed a kidney transplant within a year or he would need dialysis. About 10 per cent of people who suffer from E. coli go on to develop a life-threatening complication called Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome. This is one of the most common causes of acute kidney failure in infants and young children and can also cause kidney problems in adults. E. coli multiplies in the intestines and bind to the cells that line it. It's presence allows for the absorption of toxins into the blood which transports it to the kidneys. This causes injury to the kidneys resulting in kidney failure. If this happens, patients can require a transplant or dialysis. Source: About HUS . His cousin and his father were immediately tested and both were matches for a kidney transplant. It was decided that Mr Husseyin would donate and the father and son underwent successful surgery three weeks ago. Father-of-one Mr Sheikh-Husseyin, a graduate at digital print agency, said: ‘We decided that my dad would be the donor as thinking strategically my cousin was much younger, therefore should I need a transplant in the future I could lean on him, and the opportunity might not be there with my dad in 20 or so years. ‘I was in my final year of university while dad was undergoing the tests and my girlfriend had just had our first born, Reilly. ‘My energy levels were noticeably deteriorating which was affecting my concentration at university and at home, so it was a stressful time. ‘The past . few years have been a bit of a whirlwind, but I’m looking forward to . starting my new position in September and carving a career for both . myself and my new family. ‘Print . and photography are a huge passion for me so I cannot thank my dad . enough for giving me the opportunity to be able to lead a normal life . with Abi, Reilly and my career.’ I.T . consultant and martial arts instructor Mr Husseyin, 46, from Southgate, . London, said: ‘I was well-prepared for the tests that I had to undergo . in order to qualify for the donation. The pair (pictured on Mr Sheikh-Husseyin's graduation day while he was waiting for a transplant) are recovering after having the operation three weeks ago . ‘Emotionally the process to be a candidate for kidney donation is like a roller-coaster ride where at every stage you have to undergo tests, and then wait for the results before you progress to the next stage. ‘Only one person can complete the process at one time so it was a constant worry that I may fail a stage at some point throughout the six-month period, and we would have wasted the one year clock the doctor gave Aidan to have his transplant in.’ Surgeon Sam Dutta is pleased with the outcome of the operation and hopes this transplant will help to promote organ donation amongst ethnic minority groups.","Aidan Sheikh-Husseyin, 23, picked up E. coli while on holiday in Turkey .

"A fantasist who was jailed in 2003 for falsely claiming she was raped by Neil and Christine Hamilton is back behind bars for wrongly telling police her boyfriend had attacked her with a samurai sword. Nadine Milroy-Sloan, 41, was sentenced to three years after wrongly claiming that the former MP and his wife had sexually assaulted her. Now she has been jailed for four years for perverting the course of justice, after lying that her now ex-boyfriend had threatened to kill her at the home they shared in Rye, East Sussex. Scroll down for video . Fantasist: Nadine Milroy-Sloan, 41, (left) who was jailed in 2003 for falsely claiming she was raped by Neil and Christine Hamilton (pictured outside a police station after the allegations were made in 2001) is back behind bars for wrongly telling police her boyfriend had attacked her with a samurai sword . He was arrested and later charged, spending three months on remand before police realised that she was lying. Mrs Hamilton said she had been contacted by the man's mother following his arrest. Although Milroy-Sloan was using her maiden name Checksfield and the first name Emily, she had suspected it was the same woman who had wrongly accused the couple in 2001. 'This poor guy was on remand for three months on totally trumped up charges,' Mrs Hamilton told MailOnline. 'Thank goodness he had the resolution to follow it through because there is a big cost, not just in terms of money but time, and he was determined that she was not going to get away with it.' False allegations: Milroy-Sloan (left) arrives at the Old Bailey for her 2003 trial. After their arrest in 2001, the Hamiltons launched a very public defence against the allegations, which were dropped when it became apparent they were entirely false . Falsely accused: Milroy-Sloan had made up the allegations against the couple . In June 2003, Nadine Milroy-Sloan was jailed for three years for falsely accusing Tory MP Neil Hamilton and his wife Christine Hamilton of rape. Milroy-Sloan, then 29, was convicted by a jury at the Old Bailey of two charges of perverting the course of justice, having lied to police in May 2001, claiming she had been attacked by former Tory minister Mr Hamilton and his wife in a flat in Ilford, Essex. She claimed she had been lured to the flat by 62-year-old Barry Lehaney, who she said had told her he was the Hamiltons' chauffeur. But Milroy-Sloan had never met the couple and invented the story to make money. Just two days before the alleged attack, she had been to see publicist Max Clifford with a story about the Hamiltons being involved in a vice ring and a tax scam. Following their arrest on August 10, 2001, the couple mounted a very public defence against the allegations, and said they were not at the alleged scene because they were hosting a dinner party, producing alibis from guests including former Conservative speechwriter and Big Brother contestant Derek Laud. The investigation against the couple was dropped when it became apparent that the accusations were entirely false. The jury of ten men and two women agreed with the prosecution that Milroy-Sloan, of Peterhouse Road, Grimsby, Lincs, was a 'cunning' fantasist who had come up with the scheme to find fame and fortune. The jury heard that shamed publicist Clifford, who was jailed earlier this year for a string of sex charges, told Milroy-Sloan she could expect around £100,000 from the media if she could prove her vice ring claims. Prosecutor Orlando Pownall QC said the Hamiltons were totally innocent and had been at Claridges Hotel on the night of the alleged rape. Milroy-Sloan's claims led to Mr Lehaney being arrested on May 7 and the Hamiltons being detained on August 10 'in a blaze of wholly unwarranted publicity'. Mr Pownall also told the court that Milroy-Sloan had been paid £50,000 by a Sunday newspaper to reveal her identity. The rape allegation was not the first time Milroy-Sloan made false complaints to the police. In 1997, she was convicted of a breach of the peace after attacking a friend. Six weeks later, she told police the woman had since attacked her in the street. Her mother-in-law Karen Sloan said she had also told police that her elderly, terminally-ill mother was a drug dealer who had hit her. Clifford, jailed for sexually assaulting a string of women earlier this year, later agreed to pay undisclosed damages and costs over comments he made to newspapers and to GMTV on the false allegations against the Hamiltons. Weeks after he was charged, the man had recorded a conversation with Milroy-Sloan, in which she admitted that the allegation made in April 2012 was false. She then tried to get police to withdraw the allegations, and the charges against him were dropped. Milroy-Sloan, of Deal, Kent, was jailed last week after she was found guilty of perverting the course of justice. She was cleared of a separate alleged offence of burglary. Police confirmed to MailOnline that Nadine Milroy-Sloan and Emily Checksfield were the same person. Detective Chief Inspector Mark Ling said; 'Checksfield had put this man through the ordeal of a convincing allegation, arrest, charge, initial court appearance and, for a while, a remand in custody until he secured bail. Anger: Mrs Hamilton, pictured earlier this year with her husband, described Milroy-Sloan as 'mad, bad and dangerous to know', and said she had 'devastated' her ex-boyfriend's life . 'We will always take all allegations of violent offences very seriously, and this one was thoroughly investigated, but it became clear that Checksfield had made the allegation out of personal spite and that it had no foundation. 'It is equally important that false allegations are considered for prosecution and we worked closely with the CPS to help ensure that she was eventually brought to justice.' In August 2001, Former Conservative MP for Tatton, Cheshire, Mr Hamilton, 65, and his wife, 64, were arrested after Milroy-Sloan claimed she had been attacked by them at a flat in Ilford, Essex. She claimed she had been lured to the flat by a man who had told her he was the Hamiltons' chauffeur. But Milroy-Sloan, who already had a criminal record, had never met the couple and had invented the story to make money. Two days before the alleged attack, she went to see publicist Max Clifford with a story about the Hamiltons being involved in a vice ring and a tax scam. The jury of ten men and two women agreed with the prosecution that Milroy-Sloan was a 'cunning' fantasist who had come up with the scheme to find fame and fortune. The Hamiltons were arrested and questioned for five hours in August 2001. But it emerged they had never met Milroy-Sloan or been near Ilford at the time of the alleged offence. ''It's a scandal,' said Mrs Hamilton today. She added: 'I know she didn't accuse him of rape, but she did in our case, and what she did to this poor guy was appalling. 'He real crime is against genuine  victims because every time someone cries wolf it makes it harder for them to be believed. It's a crime against women. 'She is thoroughly mad, bad, and dangerous to know and thank God she has not got away with it. 'She has devastated this fellow's life and it's terrible. Let's hope she is not allowed to do this to anyone else again.' A Sussex Police spokesman said: 'The allegation made by Checksfield against her then-partner in Rye in 2012 was thoroughly investigated and the facts, including her previous conviction in 2003, were submitted to the CPS who authorised his prosecution.'","Nadine Milroy-Sloan, 41, jailed for three years in 2003 for false rape claims .

"Rebecca Oldham, 25, went into surgery to have her ovaries removed and surgeons were shocked to find a 9lb baby growing inside her (file picture) A mother who went into surgery to have her ovaries removed has spoken of her total shock after doctors discovered a 9lb baby growing inside her. Rebecca Oldham, 25, was admitted to hospital with severe abdominal cramping and was due to undergo surgery to remove her ovaries as these were deemed to be the cause of her discomfort. But, when surgeons opened her up, they found a full-term baby boy inside her. Ms Oldham, from New Zealand, told the New Zealand Herald: ‘I was facing not being able to have any more children because they thought there were problems with my ovaries, and all of a sudden we had a son.’ Ms Oldham says she had had months of stomach cramps and had undergone intensive testing. She had three scans, two blood tests and six pregnancy tests as doctors attempted to establish the cause of her pain. Eventually, she was admitted to Middlemore Hospital, in Manukau City, in November last year for surgery. Surgeons were shocked to discover a healthy baby inside her and woke her up briefly to tell her the operation was being changed to an emergency caesarean. Ms Oldham, and her partner James Tipene, were already parents to Hayley, now 20 months, when baby James was born. Mr Oldham told the New Zealand Herald: ‘I am so glad they woke me and told me I was going to have another baby. ‘Even though it was short notice it was better than waking up and being handed a baby.’ The couple are now waiting to find out exactly how the pregnancy could have been missed. The operation was suddenly changed to an emergency C-section and baby James was delivered (file picture) It is . believed Ms Oldham developed stomach pains because the baby was lodged . along her back meaning he was unable to move around. She said she struggled to feed James because she wasn’t emotionally aware she was pregnant. According to studies, the phenomenon of surprise birth is not as rare as one might imagine.

"Well what are we going to do now? How are we going to survive without our daily World Cup TV treat? When’s the next one? No doubt the type of questions posed amongst friends and work colleagues the morning after the memorable 2014 World Cup drew to a fittingly dramatic climax with Germany beating Argentina late in extra-time on Sunday evening. An audience of 20.6million UK viewers watched the World Cup final, the vast majority, as expected on the BBC, as both football fans and those less committed, were drawn to a tournament that has surpassed expectations for excitement and audience engagement. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Blatter lauds near-perfect tournament . Super Mario: Goetze celebrates scoring the winning goal in the World Cup final against Argentina . Agony and ecstasy: Germany's players celebrate Mario Goetze's winning goal as Argentina are left dejected . The BBC’s coverage averaged out at 12.1m viewers, peaking with 16.7m during the match’s final five minutes. ITV averaged 2.9m viewers, peaking at 3.9m. This has been a World Cup that has caught the imagination of a wider public and been a shot in the arm for free-to-air broadcasting. A UK Listed Event, with the next two World Cups already contractually secured, the World Cup Finals, in their entirety, remain the protected domain of the BBC and ITV for the foreseeable future. And it would seem the two broadcasting giants fully appreciate what they’ve got. They have scheduled the matches generously. There has been plenty of room to preview and review the action and also to get a sense of the fun and festivities over there in Brazil. This has also been the first World Cup to truly combine traditional viewing and the new and growing breed of online users.

VIDEO Blatter lauds near-perfect tournament . Both broadcasters can take satisfaction from their coverage of the event. BBC TV has less sport than in its glory years but can still rise to the occasion and deliver memorable television. Gary Lineker’s presentation of the tournament has been outstanding – his journey from top-class striker to top-class TV presenter is now complete. He’s handled the whole proceedings with enthusiasm and eloquence. And, when reaching for his glasses to read a news story, there’s even been a touch of Desmond Lynam about him. Adrian Chiles divides opinion. Loved or unloved, he has enjoyed being at the World Cup and it’s showed. And whilst ITV’s beach-side ‘studio’, complete with knee-caps, was slightly over-done, it showed they had confidence in what they were about. Perhaps the ‘spirit of the 1970 ITV World Cup Panel’ was in play. Rio Ferdinand clearly proved himself to be ‘tomorrow’s’ man in the punditry stakes, as BBC’s Alan Hansen bade farewell. Alan Shearer put in a string of positive studio shifts and Martin Keown and Danny Murphy both gave BBC bosses serious options for more studio and co-commentary work in the future.

On ITV, Glenn Hoddle spoke like somebody who should still be at the very heart of the game, whilst Martin O’Neill has that wonderful touch of knowing his stuff but delivering it  in a marvelously circuitous way. A week or so ago on BBC Radio, John Motson was asked whether this was the best World Cup ever. Typically, Motty qualified his response. ‘It has been great but still needs a great game to define it.’ Within 24 hours we watched agog on BBC as Germany scored four goals in six minutes in their 7-1 demolition of hosts Brazil. This World Cup had its memorable match, and some. A final salute should go to HBS, the production arm that brought the matches to our screens. For over four and a half weeks their sure-handed match direction has captured the action perfectly and it is nice to know that the World Cup Final itself was directed by an Englishman, Jamie Oakford. This has been a hugely enjoyable World Cup for viewers to watch, and one that England’s early exit, failed to diminish. We wanted a ‘football party’ and we truly got one.

"Their daily YouTube updates have gained a cult following but now Charles and Alli Trippy are facing the biggest struggle of their lives as they deal with the news that Charles has cancer. And true to their confessional video blog which has charted their wedding, has its own theme song and caused an online sensation last month when Charles filmed himself undergoing brain surgery for his tumor while awake, the Trippy's are going to share their difficult journey with their followers. Charles and his wife Alli, discovered last week that his tumor has developed into malignant cancer, having previously been diagnosed as a benign growth on his brain and the pair shared this with the millions who subscribe to their Internet Killed Television blog. Scroll Down for Video . Bravery: Charles and Alli Trippy tell their YouTube video blog followers the sad news that Charles is now suffering with cancer but that they have both vowed to beat the disease . Expressing their thanks for the support they have received since Charles' health problems began in February, the heart-broken Florida couple vowed to remain upbeat and have decided to ban the word cancer from their home as they both prepare for the long road of chemotherapy treatment in front of them. On their October 4th YouTube video blog, Charles, 29 and Alli, 24, told their viewers that Charles' brain tumor which was previously a grade II oligodendroglioma had now been discovered to have become a grade III oligodendroglioma, which is malignant. Emotional News: After telling their followers that Charles's tumor has developed malignancy, the Trippy's vow to share their experiences and to draw strength from their followers . Looking to the plus side of the depressing diagnosis, the Trippy's said that doctors have said that the cancer is not capable of metastasizing - which means that it won't spread form his brain and will stay localized. 'We are both scared but we are both very hopeful,' said Alli during their latest video edition, which has been viewed by almost 900,000 people since it was uploaded. 'He has some very very good people on his team. He is most likely to be put on an oral regime of chemotherapy.' Speaking about his condition, Charles said, 'I don't know why I have what I have, but reading the comments from you guys cheers me up.' 'There is no other option but to f**k cancer.' Painful: Charles Trippy has the stitches from his surgery in September removed at the end of the month - while the picture on the right shows the day after his surgery which discovered his tumor was no longer benign . Strong Together: Alli and Charles make sure their online followers understand that they won't be beaten by the news that Charles has cancer . Resting: Charles recuperates after his surgery in September - during which he remained awake and which discovered that he was suffering cancer . In the most emotional segment of their most recent video blog, Alli leaves her viewers with a final message. 'We don't want the news to be shocking, please don't panic, please don't freak out,' said Alli Trippy. 'We are not freaking out, ou guys shouldn't freak out, we are trying to dictate to everyone how this is going to go. 'We are having to tell all our family and friends which his difficult as well, but we have a great support system and our medical team is amazing.' Charles' condition first came to attention in February 2012 when he was walking back from a gig he had performed with his band 'We The Kings' in Boise, Idaho and suffered a seizure and lost consciousness. It was in hospital that doctors discovered a brain tumor, that was at that time not malignant. Charles and Alli conveyed all of this to their devoted followers online and on March 6th, Charles underwent surgery to remove the tumor near their home in Sarasota, Florida and Charles was allowed to resume touring. Watch Video Here: . As They Are: Alli and Charles' YouTube video blog 'Internet Killed Television' is a web series which documents the lives of Charles and Alli Trippy, and their dogs Zoey and Marley . However, he began to suffer a series of seizures throughout the summer which culminated in a serious one on September 3rd, 2013. This led doctors to tell Charles he needed a small piece of his brain removed and on September 17th, he underwent the surgery while awake. The 29-year-old remained awake but heavily sedated throughout the operation at a Boston hospital, and at one point even handed his camera to the surgeon so he could be filmed lying on the operating table. As the camera is turned on him, he is seen giving a 'thumbs-up' signal, but refuses to make Ozzy Devil Horns, saying: 'I'll keep the devil out of here.' Speaking to his wife, Charles even manages to keep his sense of humor, saying: 'Hi honey - I love you. Everything's going great. 'My brain is open and you can see the TV remote isn't there like we thought.' Thumbs-up: Sedated, but conscious, Charles Trippy manages to make jokes while having a tumour removed . Rise and shine: Charles looks tired as he takes the lift the morning of his operation to have brain surgery . The operation took several hours to complete. The video diary charts his progress from his arrival at the hospital to a post-operation interview with Ali, who tells him he was hilarious even when he was sedated. When he asks her if it is still attached, Ali says: 'Is what attached?' 'My head,' replies Charles. But while Mr Trippy's achievement is impressive, he is not the first patient to have remained conscious during brain surgery. Scrubbed: Washed and ready, Charles is wheeled to the theatre where he will remain for several hours . Doting wife: Ali remained in the hospital throughout the operation and interviewed her husband straight after .

"NSW Premier Mike Baird said he experimented with cannabis in his youth . Recently appointed NSW Premier Mike Baird has admitted to experimenting with Cannabis during an interview that canvasses his support for legalising the drug. The devout Christian and father of three, who succeeded former premier Barry O'Farrell in April, said he had used cannabis as a young person but was quick to dismiss it had any part to play in his life - other than as a one-off experiment. The Premier told the Daily Telegraph in an interview to mark his 100th day since being thrust into the state's top job, 'we've all been young, so I'm not going to deny I did experiment in my youth.' He made the remark when quizzed about decriminalising the drug for medicinal purposes in NSW, but said his own experience with drug-taking was neither 'pleasant' nor 'regular'. 'It's got nothing to do with this issue anyway.' Mike Baird supports legalising marijuana in NSW to help people cope with terminal illness . Daniel, pictured with his mother Lucy Haslam, has found relief in cannabis during chemotherapy and a campaign to legalise the drug for terminally ill patients by his parents has more than 188,000 signatures . The premier, and a number of NSW MPs, have given in-principle support for legalising marijuana for terminally ill patients in the state after Mr Baird visited a Tamworth cancer patient. Daniel Haslam, a 24-year-old, was told in 2010 that he only had months to live but begun taking cannabis as a pain coping mechanism to help him deal with the disease. He has made vast improvements in his health, his mother - a former head the north west NSW  drug squad said, and she is now asking politicians to legalise the controversial drug. Mr Baird said he was 'struck with Daniel and the battle he's in' after meeting with him. 'It's heart-wrenching,' he said. 'I've got deep sympathy and empathy with their position.' Clinical trials of medicinal cannabis could happen in NSW, but Mr Baird is waiting on details about regulation and supply before making any commitments. Under a private member's bill to be introduced next month by Nationals MP Kevin Anderson, terminally ill people and their carers will be legally able to carry up to 15 grams of cannabis. Tamworth man Daniel Haslam is in a four-year battle with terminal bowel cancer and his parents are calling for cannabis to be legalised for treatment by the terminally ill . Asked if he would support a clinical trial, as proposed by the Australian Medical Association, Mr Baird said 'it may well be something we have to do'. 'I'm open to that,' he told ABC Radio on Thursday. But Mr Baird is waiting to see details of the bill and whether it will address his concerns about the sale and regulation of the drug. But if the bill satisfies Mr Baird, it seems likely Daniel and his family won't be forced to break the law for much longer. 'If we can provide relief to them in those circumstance, well, what premier would not want to do that?"" Mr Baird said. NSW Opposition Leader John Robertson said he's willing to work with the government but, like Mr Baird, wanted to see how the bill addresses things such as supply and access before fully endorsing it. 'I'm not writing a blank cheque, but I am very supportive of his notion,"" he told reporters on last week. 'If marijuana is part of the solution to dealing with those issues as a means of relieving people's pain, then we should be looking at that.'","Mr Baird made the remark in an interview on his 100th day as premier .

"Just over a month ago Joachim Low’s team arrived in Brazil with the mentality of champions. They bullied and beat everything in sight. Ask Per Mertesacker, a late substitute in the Maracana, what it takes to be a World Cup winner and he will tell you. ‘You think a Mickey Mouse team reaches the last eight of the World Cup?’ he snorted after they needed extra-time to beat Algeria 2-1 in Porto Alegre. On Sunday they hit all their targets. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Fans go wild in Berlin as Germany beat Argentina 1-0 . Inspired: Low says his final words to Mario Gotze before sending the matchwinner on . Germany know, more than any other team in the history of the World Cup, what it takes to go deep into tournament territory. So, too, does their coach. He raised four fingers at Frankfurt airport to signal their intent to win win a fourth World Cup. Now he can flick two fingers at anyone who doubted him. This has been a Slow Burn for the David Bowie lookalike, with near misses in the final of Euro 2008, the World Cup semi-final in 2010 and the last four of Euro 2012. Here they have been regarded as the best prepared team at the tournament for some time: Best players, best training ground, best coach, best everything. However much they will crow about the number of coaches in Germany after their fourth triumph, it takes a special unit to be together for seven weeks. It is far more than tricks and flicks. This was a target tournament, something every player involved with the German national team had made abundantly clear as they criss-crossed their way around this incredible country. If it felt and sounded ballsy, they backed it up on the biggest stage of all. They are footballing gods now. From Germany with Low: The Mannschaft boss celebrates at the final whistle . Low, along with some of the world’s finest footballers - Manuel Neuer, Philipp Lahm and, well, the list is endless - are staring down from heaven now. Quite how Argentina, Brazil, Holland, Italy and others - yes, even England - retaliate remains to be seen. It hurts to even type it. This team is Low’s baby now and by end the time the final whistle went, everyone involved with the German national team was blubbing. Mario Gotze got the goal, beautifully taken on his chest with the first touch and rifled beyond Sergio Romero with his second after 113 minutes. They had been rough around the edges until then and yet, somehow, you always knew they were going to win it. No matter how good Germany’s squad is, dealing with an unexpected event - an injury to one of their most influential players before kick-off - is never easy. Whatever happened in those moments after Sami Khedira pulled up lame in the warm-up, it upset Germany’s rhythm. It threw them out of kilter. Even Khedira’s replacement didn’t last long, with Christoph Kramer taken off with a head injury after just 32 minutes. Soon enough Chelsea’s Andre Schurrle was on. Injury blow: Influential Germany midfielder Khedira watches on from the touchline . Out clod: Kramer had to be substituted after being flattened by Ezequiel Garay . Watching on: Khedira's girlfriend Lena Gercke show her support from the stands . Cheerleaders: Khedira looks nervous  alongside substitutes Shkodran Mustafi (left) and Per Mertesacker . Still, Germany expects and the problem, after victories over Portugal, United States, Algeria, France and that extraordinary win over Brazil, is that so did everybody else. After victory here, it doesn’t matter that those powerful powerful combinations we have become accustomed to were spluttering. Philipp Lahm and Thomas Muller down the right; Toni Kroos and Bastian Schweinsteiger in the centre; Mesut Ozil and Miroslav Klose through the middle. Kroos was unsettled, ruffled by the menacing presence of Javier Mascherano and Enzo Perez in the centre of midfield. It was congested and dirty at times. Off colour: Germany playmaker Toni Kroos was far from at his best in the final . The two Argentinians are the types to wait in dark alleys in the dead of night and rob you blind of all your gear. This was another ambush. Kroos’ elementary first half mistake, a dopey, looping header over the top of Mats Hummels and his defensive partner Jerome Boateng gave Gonzalo Higuain a free run on goal. Inexplicably he fired wide. Kroos had a couple of chances, the best of them he sent wide of Romero’s left hand post. We had come to expect better from one of the stars of the tournament, but Low can pick over the bones of this performance at a later date. All that counts is the fact that this victory - the first by a European team on south American soil - has been in the calendar for quite some time.

"A teenager who suffered serious brain damage when he was knocked off his bicycle by a van has taken his first steps since the accident. Ryan Smith, 17, was left in a coma after he decided not to wear a helmet because he was worried it would spoil his hair. He remained in hospital for almost a year following the accident on July 22, 2013, near the seaside village of Chapel Saint Leonards, Lincolnshire. Scroll down for video . Ryan Smith, 17, has taken his first steps since suffering severe brain damage almost a year ago. He is pictured in the hydrotherapy pool where first walked with his father, Mark . Mr Smith, Ryan's father, said: 'There is a very long way to go but to be . told at the time that he would not survive - to him standing and walking . on his own - is incredible. It was a beautiful moment' At the time, Ryan’s father, Mark, released a heart-breaking image of him cradling his son as he lay unconscious in a hospital bed in the hope it would encourage other cyclists to wear helmets. The family were told by doctors that Ryan would probably not survive and even if he did, he would be severely disabled. But in November last year they were overjoyed when Ryan spoke for the first time after he came out of a four-month coma. And in April, the family reached another milestone when he defied doctors to stand unaided at the Children’s Trust Tadworth rehabilitation unit in Surrey. Today, Mr Smith, 44, told how his son had incredibly taken his first steps unaided in a special hydrotherapy pool on Sunday, just in time for Father Day. He said: ‘We are just so amazed. Ryan (pictured before his injury) was knocked off his bike by a van. He had not been wearing a helmet over fears it would spoil his hair style . Ryan (pictured with his father, Mark, shortly after the accident) spent four months in a coma and doctors warned his parents he probably wouldn't survive as his head injuries were so severe . ‘There is a very long way to go but to be told at the time that he would not survive, to him standing and walking on his own, is incredible. ‘It was a beautiful moment and bizarrely it happened by complete accident really. ‘He was in the pool with two supportive floats which then slipped out from under him. ‘But rather than letting himself sink, he placed his feet on the ground and took a couple of steps. ‘So we thought we’d try and see how far he could get - and amazingly he walked the entire width of the swimming pool. ‘We were told even if he survived he would not be able to do anything for himself. But now he is talking, eating and drinking all by himself. ‘He still has problems with his short-term memory but can hold conversations with people now. The steps he is taking are superb, but it is a slow and long process. ‘Ryan has had a fantastic amount of love and support around him and I cannot stress enough how integral that is for the recovery of people who have suffered brain injuries.’ The Smith family are now campaigning for a law to force cyclists to wear helmets. Ryan (pictured while he was in a coma) spoke for the first time since the accident in November last year and stood up for the first time in April this year . Olympic champion and Tour de France winner Sir Bradley Wiggins has also backed calls for legislation to force cyclists to wear them on roads. Former Welsh international footballer John Hartson, 38, who beat testicular cancer in 2009, visited Ryan on his birthday on March 31. Since seeing Ryan’s story, Mr Hartson has taken Ryan on as his ‘adopted son’ according to Mr Smith, and even changed his Twitter picture to the pair of them together. Mr Smith, a paramedic, added: ‘John Hartson has been magnificent with Ryan and we would all like to say a huge thank you to him. ‘He has been tweeting and supporting online, he has literally taken on Ryan as his “adopted son” it has been great. ‘By him doing all of this for us, which he didn’t have to, he wanted to, it widens our appeal and it is just brilliant.’","Ryan Smith wasn't wearing a helmet when he was hit by a van last July .

"In the weeks following liberation from the Nazis, Paris was hit by wave of crime and violence that saw the city compared to Prohibition New York or Chicago. And the cause was the same: American Gangsters. While the Allies fought against Hitler’s forces in Europe, law enforcers fought against the criminals who threatened that victory. Men who had abandoned the 'greater good' in favour of self-interest, black-market profits and the lure of the cafes and brothels of Paris: deserters. Parisians welcomed their Allied liberators in 1944 but soon the city's streets were flooded with a new kind of violence . The existence of these gangs is one of many revelations in a compelling new book, 'The Deserters: A Hidden History of World War II.' Glass's study of the very different stories and men grouped together under the label, Deserters . Highly organised, armed to the teeth and merciless, these deserters used their US uniforms as another tool of their trade along with the vast arrays of stolen weapons, forged passes and hijacked vehicles they had at their disposal. Between June 1944 and April 1945 the US army’s Criminal Investigation Branch (CBI) handled a total of 7,912 cases. Forty per cent involved misappropriation of US supplies. Greater yet was the proportion of crimes of violence – rape, murder, manslaughter and assault which accounted for 44 per cent of the force’s workload. The remaining 12 per cent were crimes such as robbery, housebreaking and riot. Former Chief Middle East correspondent for ABC News, the book's author Charles Glass had long harboured an interest in the subject. But it was only truly ignited by a chance meeting with Steve Weiss - decorated combat veteran of the US 36th Infantry Division and former deserter. Glass was giving a talk to publicise his previous book, 'Americans in Paris: Life and Death under Nazi Occupation' when the American started asking questions. It was clear, Glass recounts, that the questioner's knowledge of the French Resistance was more intimate than his own. Private First Class Steve Weiss pictured in Paris on Armistice Day, November, 11, 1945. His complex story of courage and desertion inspired author Charles Glass . Tested beyond endurance: This official US Army photograph taken in Pozzuoli near Naples in August 1944, captured Private First Class Steve Weiss boarding a British landing craft. He is climbing the gangplank on the right-hand side of the photograph. The Deserters, A Hidden History of World War II by Charles Glass . Hero or Coward? Steve Weiss receives the Croix de Guerre in July 1946 yet 2 years earlier the US army jailed him as a deserter . They met for coffee and Weiss asked Glass what he was working on. Glass recalls: 'I told him it was a book on American and British deserters in the Second World War and asked if he knew anything about it. 'He answered, ""I was a deserter.""' This once idealistic boy from Brooklyn who enlisted at 17, had fought on the beachhead at Anzio and through the perilous Ardennes forest, he was one of the very few regular American soldiers to fight with the Resistance in 1944. And he had deserted. His story was, Glass realised, both secret and emblematic of a group of men, wreathed together under a banner of shame that branded them cowards. Yet the truth was far more complex. Many were afraid. They had reached a point beyond which they could not endure and chosen disgrace over the grave. Some recounted waking, as if from a dream, to find their bodies had led them away from the battelfield. Others, like Weiss, fought until their faith in their immediate commanders disappeared. Was it a form of madness or a dawning lucidity that led them to desert? Glass does not claim to be able to answer that question to which Weiss himself had devoted his latter years to addressing to no avail. Others still deserted to make money, stealing and selling the military supplies that their comrades at the front needed to survive. Opportunists and crooks, certainly, but not cowards - the life they chose was every bit as violent and bloody as battle. 50,000 American and 100,000 British soldiers deserted during World War II. Yet according to Glass the astounding fact is not that so many men deserted, but that so few did. Only one was executed for it, Eddie Slovik. He was, until that point, by his own assessment the unluckiest man alive. The Unluckiest Man: Eddie Slovik, left, was the only American executed for desertion as his trial fell at a time when General Dwight Eisenhower, right, decided he could not risk appearing lenient on the crime . He never fought a battle. He never went on the run as most deserters did. He simply made it clear that he preferred prison to battle. Of the 49 Americans sentenced to death for desertion during the Second World War he was the only one whose appeal for commutation was rejected. His greatest sin, as Glass tells it, was his timing. His appeal came in January 1945 just as the German counter-offensive, the Battle of the Bulge, was at its peak. Allied forces were near breaking point. It was not, Supreme Allied Commander, General Dwight Eisenhower decided, time to risk seeming to condone desertion. Slovik was shot for his crime on the morning of 31 January 1945. He was dispatched in the remote French village of Sainte-Marie-aux-Mines and the truth concealed even from his wife, Antoinette. She was informed that her husband had died in the European Theatre of Operations. His identity was ultimately revealed in 1954 and twenty years later Martin Sheen played him in the television film, The Execution of Private Slovik. In it Sheen recites the words Slovik spoke before the firing squad shot him. ‘They’re not shooting me for deserting the United States Army,’ he said. Last Stand: Martin Sheen played Eddie Slovik in theTV film, The Execution of Eddie Slovik . Slovik's execution in France was kept a secret from his wife and his identity only emerged in 1954 . Eddie Slovik and his wife Antoinette on their wedding day in Detroit. He was executed on 31 January 1948 . ‘They just need to make an example out . of somebody and I’m it because I’m an ex-con. 'I used to steal things . when I was a kid, and that’s what they are shooting me for. 'They’re shooting me for the bread and chewing gum I stole when I was 12 years old.’ Private Alfred T Whitehead's was a very different story. He was a farm boy from Tennessee who . rushed to join up to escape a life of brutalising poverty and violence . at the hands of his stepfather. He ended up a gangster tearing through . Paris. Whitehead fought at Normandy and claims to have stormed the beaches on the D-Day landings. He considered himself a battle-hardened . professional soldier and bit by bit the small reserve of mercy that had . survived his childhood evaporated in the heat of war. He had been in continuous combat with . them from D-Day to 30th December 1944. He had earned the Silver Star, . two Bronze Stars, Combat Infantry Badge and Distinguished Unit Citation. When he was invalided out to Paris with appendicitis and assumed that he would rejoin his unit, the 2nd Division, on his recovery. Instead he was sent to the 94th Reinforcement Battalion, a replacement depot in Fontainebleau. When a young lieutenant presented Whitehead with a First World War vintage rifle for guard duty, he told the officer to take the ‘peashooter’ and ‘shove it up his ass.’ Loyalties Lost: Before deserting Alfred T Whitehead was decorated for bravery he has identified himself as the third soldier on the right, visible in profile, at the front of this D-Day landing craft approaching Normandy 6 June 1944 . Steve Weiss, left, pictured with author Charles Glass in Paris where he was court martialled for desertion. He was 19 and thought his life was over. He demanded the weapons he was used to – a .45 pistol, a Thompson sub-machine gun and a trench knife. His actual desertion was unspectacular. Whitehead was looking for a drink. The American Service Club refused him entrance because he didn’t have a pass and so he wandered on ‘in search of a bed in a brothel.’ He found one. By morning he was officially AWOL. The next day a waitress in a café took pity on him and added fried eggs and potatoes to his order of soup and bread. When Military Police came in and started asking questions she gave Whitehead the key to her room in a cheap hotel and told him to wait for her there. From decorated soldier he moved seamlessly into life as a criminal in the Paris underworld. A chance meeting led to him taking his place as a member of one of the many gangs of ex-soldiers terrorizing Paris. Led by an ex-paratrooper sergeant, raids were planned like military operations. Whitehead himself admitted, ‘we stole trucks, sold whatever they carried, and used the trucks to rob warehouses of the goods in them.’ They used combat tactics, hijacked goods destined for front-line troops. Their crimes even spread into Belgium. They attacked civilians and military targets indiscriminately. His gangland activities gave Whitehead ‘a bigger thrill than battle.’ Quoting from the former soldier’s memoir Glass recounts his boasts: ‘We robbed every café in Paris, in all sectors except our own, while the gendarmes went crazy.’ They robbed crates of cognac and champagne, hijacked jeeps and raided private houses whose bed sheets and radios were ‘easy to fence.’ They stole petrol, cigarettes, liquor and weapons.Within six months Whitehead reckoned his share of the plunder at $100,000. Little wonder that when Victory in Europe was announced on 7 May 1945, Whitehead admitted, ‘That day and night everyone in Paris and the rest of Europe was celebrating, but I just stayed in my apartment thinking about it all.’ Because Private Whitehead’s desertion did not end his war – it was a part of it. As it was a part of many soldiers’ wars that has long gone unrecorded. Ultimately Whitehead was captured and court martialled. He was dishonourably discharged and spent time in the Delta Disciplinary Training Barracks in the south of France and in federal penitentiaries in New Jersey. Many years later he had that ‘dishonourable discharge,’ turned into a General one on rather disingenuous legal grounds. In peacetime appearances mattered more to Whitehead than they ever had in war. Back then, he admitted: ‘I never knew what tomorrow would hold, so I took every day as it came. War does strange things to people, especially their morality.’ Those ‘strange things’ rather than the false extremes of courage and cowardice are the truths set out in this account of the War and its deserters.

"We should, perhaps, forgive the poor naive men who think women spend their 'time of the month' horse-riding along beaches, rollerblading and skydiving, and that period blood is blue. For there are, it seems, a few of them out there. One of these is Richard Neill, a disillusioned boyfriend who light-heartedly bemoaned being mis-sold the truth about menstruation on Bodyform's Facebook page, and who has received feedback from the company in the form of a hilarious spoof YouTube video which has gone viral. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . An actress playing Bodyform CEO Caroline Williams explains 'the truth' about periods to Richard Neill on the company's spoof YouTube video, also posted on Facebook . Mr Neill penned a Facebook wall missive to feminine hygiene brand Bodyform on 8 October, explaining how confused their advert for sanitary products made him. He said that as a boy he watched jolly, carefree women cavorting along the beach and hurling themselves out of planes, having 'blue water' periods that gave them fun-sounding 'wings', all to the backdrop of that age-old aural ear-worm: the 'Woah Bodyform, Bodyformed for you!' song. He went on to explain how acquiring a girlfriend later in life had exposed the horrible truth about periods, and how they actually transformed his 'loving, gentle, normal skin coloured lady to the little girl from the exorcist with added venom and extra 360 degree head spin'. His witty tale of woe prompted much amusement on the social networking site, and his message has, to date, received 86,743 'likes' and 3,735 comments. Posted on Bodyform's Facebook page on 8 October: . 'Hi, as a man I must ask why you have lied to us for all these years. 'As . a child I watched your advertisements with interest as to how at this . wonderful time of the month that the female gets to enjoy so many . things, I felt a little jealous. 'I . mean bike riding, rollercoasters, dancing, parachuting, why couldn't I . get to enjoy this time of joy and 'blue water' and wings!! Dam my . penis!! 'Then I got a girlfriend, was so happy and couldn't wait for this joyous adventurous time of the month to happen .....you lied !! 'There was no joy, no extreme sports, no blue water spilling over wings and no rocking soundtrack oh no no no. 'Instead . I had to fight against every male urge I had to resist screaming . wooaaahhhhh bodddyyyyyyfooorrrmmm bodyformed for youuuuuuu as my lady . changed from the loving, gentle, normal skin coloured lady to the little . girl from the exorcist with added venom and extra 360 degree head spin. 'Thanks for setting me up for a fall bodyform, you crafty b@gger' Caroline Williams explains that the depictions of women rollerblading and having pillow fights during their periods are in fact metaphors . In response Bodyform spotted a golden PR opportunity and yesterday released a hilarious . YouTube video retort, conceived by their advertising agency Carat. 'Bodyform Responds: The Truth' is a two minute clip . in which company 'boss' Caroline Williams (actually played by an . actress) sits down to explain the truth about periods to Richard. Posted on their Facebook page, the . video - which went viral overnight - shows Bodyform's 'CEO' sitting at . her desk with a jug of blue water. Addressing Richard she says: 'Hello Richard. We read your Facebook post with interest, but . also a sense of foreboding - and I think it's time we came clean. We . lied to you, Richard. And I want to say sorry.' Ms . Williams then breaks the news to Richard that Bodyform's prolific use of . skydiving and mountain bike-riding in their adverts was actually metaphorical, an illusion used to represent periods because men 'can't . handle the truth'. Richard Neill's original post on Facebook, in which he complained about the lies he was being sold regarding periods by Bodyform's adverts . 'There's no such thing as a happy . period,' she says, going on to explain how a series of focus groups in . the 1980s proved that 'the cramps, the mood-swings, the insatiable hunger, . and yes, Richard, the blood coursing from our uteri like a crimson . landslide' were all too much for men to really bear. The spoof video - which has so far notched up 135,036 views on YouTube, 2,213 Facebook 'likes' and 211 comments - ends with the CEO thanking Richard for lifting the veil on their lies and exposing the truth. SCA, manufacturers of Bodyform, and the brand's advertising agency Carat, co-ordinated the idea for the video response. The concept was scripted and filmed by Rubber Republic. A still from a Bodyform advert, uploaded onto YouTube, shows a carefree women skydiving from a plane . Yulia Kretova, Brand Controller, at . Bodyform said: 'We found Richard's post very amusing and wanted to . continue the positive dialogue around periods that this generated. 'Working with the brand for five years breaking down the taboo around Bodyform and periods has always been a challenge and I hope that we have started to address this. 'Carat has created an original and uniquely personalised response, brilliantly PR-ed by Myriad, allowing Bodyform to quickly engage in consumer conversations in a meaningful way.'

"Poet John Keats may have written an ode to the rich colours of autumn, but one chemistry teacher has explained exactly why the leaves change hue. Already summer's leaves have already begun their transition to vibrant oranges, reds and magentas and this is down to a range of chemical compounds - including those that make carrots orange and tomatoes red. Bournemouth-based teacher Andy Brunning who is the author of the blog, Compound Interest explained that the compounds – chlorophyll, carotenoids, flavonoids - are present in leaves all year round, but become more noticeable at this time of year. Season of mists and mellow fruitfulness: Chemistry teacher Andy Brunning explained that the compounds – chlorophyll, carotenoids, flavonoids (shown above) - are present in leaves all year round, but become more noticeable at this time of year, explaining why leaves change colour to bright yellows and rich reds . Chlorophyll is the chemical compound responsible for the green colouration of most leaves. The . chemical is held within chloroplasts in the cells of leaves and is an . essential ingredient in photosynthesis, in which plants use energy from . the sun to convert carbon dioxide and water into sugars. Plants . need warm temperatures and sunlight to produce chlorophyll so as autumn . begins and the nights draw in, chlorophyll production slows and the . existing amounts of chemical compounds in the leaves decomposes. Notable carotenoids include beta-carotene, which makes carrots orange, lutein, which contributes to the yellow colour of egg yolks, and lycopene, which is also responsible for the red colour of tomatoes. Anthocyanins aren’t present in leaves all year round but create the bright red and magenta hues . Green: Chlorophyll gives plants their green colour. It dominates for most fo the year but less is produced when there is less light during the daytime. Yellow: Carotenoids and flavonoids are always present in leaves but come to the fore in autumn, turning leaves yellow. One example of a carotenoid is lutein which makes egg yolks yellow. Orange: Carotenoids contribute orange colours. Beta-carotene is one of the most common carotenoids in plants and is responsible for the orange colour of carrots. Red: Anthocyanin synthesis is kick-started by the onset of autumn, producing the red and magenta hues in leaves. As a result, other compounds present in the leaves are more noticeable. Carotenoids and flavonoids are examples of these compounds. The . colours of the compounds are created because of the chemical bonds they . contain. These can be single bonds, which consist of one shared pair of . electrons between adjacent atoms, or double bonds, which consist of two . shared pairs of electrons between adjacent atoms. The colour-causing molecules in autumn leaves contain systems of alternating double and single bonds, which is known as conjugation. A . large amount of conjugation in a molecule can lead to them being able . to absorb wavelengths of light in the visible spectrum, which leads to . the appearance of colour. The colours of the compounds that alter the hues of leaves (stock image) are created because of the chemical bonds they contain. These can be single bonds, which consist of one shared pair of electrons between adjacent atoms, or double bonds, which consist of two shared pairs of electrons between adjacent atoms . Both families of compounds contribute yellows, whilst carotenoids also contribute oranges and reds. These compounds do degrade along with chlorophyll as autumn progresses, but at much slower rate so their colours become visible. Notable carotenoids include beta-carotene, which makes carrots orange; lutein, which contributes to the yellow colour of egg yolks; and lycopene, which is also responsible for the red colour of tomatoes. Anthocyanins, are another member of the flavonoid class of compounds, but they aren’t present in leaves all year round. As the days get darker, their synthesis begins because of increased concentration of sugars in the leaves, combined with light. No one is exactly sure why they do this, but some scientists think they may perform some kind of light-protective role, allowing the tree to protect its leaves and stop them from falling for the maximum amount of time. Anthocyanins provide the vivid red, purple and magenta shades seen in autumn leaves. The colour of the leaves is also affected by the acidity of tree sap.","Bournemouth-based teacher Andy Brunning drew up an infographic explaining the chemical compounds behind leaves' colourful transformation .

"We spend a third of our lives doing it. Now scientists have finally discovered why we need to spend so much time sleeping - it helps clear the mind of the day’s chemical clutter. While our body is at rest, the brain is hard at work removing toxins produced during our waking hours. Scientists have finally discovered why we need to spend so much time sleeping - it helps clear the mind of the day's chemical clutter . 'George, they've come to drain your toxins' Left to build up, these compounds can result in Alzheimer’s and other neurological diseases. The researchers conclude the clean-up process is so energy intensive, it would hinder our thinking if done when we are awake - hence the need to sleep. ‘This study shows that the brain has different functional states when asleep and when awake,’ said lead researcher Dr Maiken Nedergaard, from the University of Rochester Medical Centre (URMC), in New York. ‘In fact, the restorative nature of sleep appears to be the result of the active clearance of the by-products of neural activity that accumulate during wakefulness.’ The purpose of slumber has been debated for centuries, with Thomas Edison branding it ‘a criminal waste of time.’ And although practically every species needs to sleep, many have suggested it is a faulty evolutionary hang-up that makes us more vulnerable to predators. The team found that unlike the rest of the body, which depends on the lymphatic system to drain away toxins, the brain has its own separate method of rubbish removal. Scans on mice revealed the amount of energy used by the brain did not dramatically fall during sleep. This is because its cleaning activities increased 10-fold at times of rest, according to the researchers, who observed that significantly higher levels of toxins were also removed. The amount of brain power needed to clean up toxins means we would be unable to think clearly if the process took place during waking hours, the team speculated. While our body is at rest, the brain is hard at work removing toxins produced during our waking hours . The findings, published in the journal Science, go some way to explain the biological purpose of sleep and could lead to new ways to treat neurological disorders. ‘The brain only has limited energy at its disposal and it appears that it must choice between two different functional states - awake and aware or asleep and cleaning up,’ said Dr Nedergaard. ‘You can think of it like having a house party. You can either entertain the guests or clean up the house, but you can’t really do both at the same time.’ And to aid the clean-up operation, scientists found brain cells can shrink by up to 60 per cent during slumber, to allow waste to be removed more effectively. They also observed that a hormone called noradrenaline is less active during sleep, suggesting it could be controlling the contraction and expansion of the brain’s cells during sleep-wake cycles. ‘These findings have significant implications for treating “dirty brain” diseases like Alzheimer’s,’ said Dr Nedergaard. ‘Understanding precisely how and when the brain activates the glymphatic system [brain’s cleaning system] and clears waste is a critical first step in efforts to potentially modulate this system and make it work more efficiently.’","Sleep is required to clear the by-products of neural activity that build-up when people are awake - if they build up they cause diseases like Alzheimer's .

"Passport chiefs are targeting 100 postcode areas for fraud investigations as they tackle the backlog which hit hundreds of thousands of families, it has been revealed. Staff at the Passport Office have been ordered to give extra scrutiny to applications for travel documents for children from districts on the watchlist. The agency, which is part of the Home Office, aims to focus its investigations on suspect areas as officials struggle to clear delays affecting more than 360,000 people, according to insiders. Scroll down for video . Staff at the Passport Office have been ordered to give extra scrutiny to applications for travel documents for children from districts on the 100-postcode watchlist . Critics said the ‘postcode lottery’ was unfair on innocent people who could face delays just because of where they live. More than 40 of the postcodes are in London, and others are in Manchester, Edinburgh, Birmingham, Nottingham, Leeds and Brighton. Many have high ethnic minority populations. Other areas targeted include the historic market town of Bury St Edmunds in Suffolk, Tidworth in Wiltshire – a garrison town with, a survey said, the country's most desirable postcode areas – and Andover, Hampshire. In May and June, thousands of families’ holidays were ruined by mounting chaos at UK passport offices. Staff are so overwhelmed they are struggling to issue travel documents in time. There were reports of holidaymakers being advised to pay up to £55.50 to fast-track passports, guaranteeing they arrive on time. Unions said the agency was in crisis because of job cuts and office closures. Tory MP David Davis said it 'sounds like a deliberate postcode lottery' caused by 'lazy thinking' Prime Minister David Cameron was forced to intervene after it emerged that more than 360,000 applications had not been processed within the three-week time limit. The policy emerged in a document titled Confirming Identity Examiner Processes that said officials handling applications for new passports from the 100 postcodes should complete ‘additional checking’. That could include contacting the countersignatory – the person who has agreed to confirm that the application for a child’s passport is true and accurate. Fraudulent applications can use the name of a dead person to conceal a traveller’s real identity or rely on fake birth certificates or stolen forms. Offenders wishing to conceal their identity include fugitives and terrorists. They may hope to illegally enter the UK or avoid deportation, commit financial crimes or get involved in drug or people trafficking. Tory MP David Davis, a former shadow home secretary, said: ‘This sounds like a deliberate postcode lottery. It is lazy thinking to save money and save resources. Doubtless there are an awful lot of non-fraudsters living in those areas whose service should not be altered by this policy.’ Professor Richard Webber, an expert in the use of postcodes to identify trends, said: ‘This seems to me an example of a postcode lottery. Targeting of this sort might make sense for avoiding the waste of government resources. But it is important that the service that citizens receive shouldn’t be adversely affected by where they live.’ Mark Serwotka, the leader of the PCS union which represents Passport Office staff, said: ‘Rather than this sticking plaster approach of basing decisions on what is a potentially discriminatory postcode system, the Passport Office should agree to sit down with us to talk about the resources they need to provide a full and proper service now and for years to come.’ A Passport Office spokesman said: ‘Preventing and detecting fraudulent applications protects the public and, in the case of child passports, safeguards children. ‘All applications are subject to a number of security checks. No one factor alone will determine the outcome of an individual application, a range of evidence is considered and taken into account. ‘All checks are carried out in accordance with UK law. Procedures have been subject to a full equality impact assessment prior to introduction but remain under review.’","The move is in a bid to clear delays affecting more than 360,000 people .

Showdown: Ms Kang appeared on CNN this Saturday along with Chrystal Bougon (pictured) a plus-size lingerie store owner who she slammed last week for launching a 'selfie' campaign promoting 'real beauty' She added: 'A lot of people can just tell that [a] person is not healthy.' Many who tuned in to watch the discussion disagreed with her standpoint. 'I'm sure this lady would take one look at me and deem me ""healthy."" But OH, what lies beneath the skinny surface,' one female commentator wrote. 'These are women who are obese and they're saying how real women should look like. I thought ""no, that's not what real women should look like'"" Another jokingly added: 'I wonder if she . would even notice the Flaming Hot Cheetos dust coursing through my . veins. Or my notoriously high gummi candy levels. Can you see my health, . Kang? Can you?' Others highlighted how ironic Ms Kang's comments were considering she battled bulimia in the past - an illness which often goes undetected for a long time because a person appears a 'healthy weight' on the outside. Face-to-face: During a live TV showdown between the two women, Ms Kang insisted that she was not a fat-shamer, but said the ladies depicted in Ms Bougon's photo gallery 'are not how real women should look like' Ms Bougon, 45, who sells underwear in size 14 and up at her San Jose-based store, Curvy Girl Lingerie, also voiced her outrage after hearing what Ms Kang had to say. 'You can't tell whether or not I work . out. You can't tell how healthy I am by looking at a photo of me. You . just can't,' she responded. On her website Ms Bougon states that . she has been 'curvy' since she was in Third grade and now makes it her . mission to make other plus-size women feel 'sexy and confident' in their . own skin. Body confidence: In a bid to celebrate 'real beauty' without the magic of Photoshop, Ms Bougon appealed to women who are U.S. size 14 or up to post 'sexy' selfies on her professional Facebook page . But Ms  Kang wrote on Facebook last Friday that . she was 'annoyed' by 'stories about how overweight should be proud of . their bodies' - referring directly to  the Curvy Girl Lingerie campaign . (above) Last month she appealed to women who are U.S. size 14 or up to post 'sexy' selfies on her professional Facebook page in a bid to show 'what regular women look like when they step into all of their beauty and sexy.' Encouraging participants to step forward, . she wrote: 'You never know who you might touch. Who you might help. Whose life you may change when they see they are NOT the only woman with . cellulite, rolls, scars, saggy breasts or stretch marks.' 'We need to change this strange mentality we are breeding in the U.S. and start celebrating people who are a result of hard work, dedication and discipline' But Ms Kang, who runs a fitness-focused non-profit organization from home, said she was 'peeved' when she read about the initiative on MailOnline. She told CNN: 'These are women who are overweight and who are obese and they're saying how real women should look like. 'I was a little bit peeved because I thought ""No, that's not how real women should look like.""' 'There's a fine line we're walking right now, as a nation, with the obesity crisis that we're in.' Stirring trouble: Ms Kang came to the public's attention last month when she posted this photo of her toned post-baby body to Facebook . Venting her outrage after learning about Ms Bougon's campaign, Miss Kang took to Facebook and her own website stating that she was 'annoyed' by . 'news stories about how overweight, nearly obese women should be proud . of their bodies.' However, she was soon locked out of the social network site after her post was reported and cataloged as a 'hate speech'. 'I'm not bashing those who are proud and overweight, I am empowering those who are proud and healthy to come out and be the real role models in our society' Her access to Facebook was restored after two days, but her post was not. Miss Kang – who was first accused of ‘fat . shaming’ when she posted a portrait of herself in workout gear online . last month along with the caption ‘what’s your excuse?’ - said she did . not intend to upset people and was merely 'telling the truth.'

"A very British problem of a leaky church roof could be about to give the world the chance to glimpse the legendary Ark of the Covenant. That's because the claimed home of the iconic relic - a small chapel in Ethiopia - has sprung a leak and so the Ark could now be on the move. The Ark - which The Bible says holds God's Ten Commandments given to Moses on Mount Sinai - is said to have been kept in Aksum, in the Chapel of the Tablet, adjacent to St Mary of Zion Church, since the 1960s. According to the Old Testament, it was first kept in the Temple of Solomon in Jerusalem for centuries until a Babylonian invasion in the 6th century BC. Leaking roof: The Chapel of the Tablet in Ethiopia that holds the Ten Commandments and has the water damage. The St Mary of Zion church, that originally held the tablet, can be seen in the foreground . Since then it's been the goal of many adventurers and archaeologists to find it. Most-famously, but also fictitiously, Indiana Jones was shown in the 1981 Steven Spielberg film Raiders of the Lost Ark. There has also been a long-running claim from the Orthodox Christians of Ethiopia that they have had the Ark for centuries, and since the 1960s it has apparently been kept in the chapel. This small and curiously-styled building is surrounded by spiked iron railings, and situated between two churches, the old and new, of St Mary of Zion in central Aksum. No one has been allowed to see the holy object, described in scripture as being made from acacia wood, plated with gold and topped with two golden angels, except one solitary elderly monk, who must watch over the Ark for the remainder of his life, and is never allowed to leave the chapel grounds. But now the chapel - which was designed by the Ethiopian leader Emperor Hailie Selassie - has had to be covered in a tarpaulin to stop rain getting in. The water damage could mean the Ark will be moved for the first time in decades giving religious worshippers and adventurers alike a chance to see it. British photographer Tim Makins, 54, who . is a travel photographer for publications like Lonely Planet, . discovered the church had sprung a leak whilst travelling through . Ethiopia last September. Holy work: Workmen clear the ground adjacent to the Chapel of the Tablet. Right, Paintings in the old church of St Mary of Zion and the covered entrance to the inner chapel . He believes the moving of the Ark could be one of the best ways to discover if there's any truth in the claims of the East African state. Tim said: 'During my most recent visit to the church, I was surprised to see some ground adjacent to the ''Chapel of the Tablet'' being cleared and levelled by workmen, and some quantities of building stone being assembled nearby. 'Asking around, I managed to discover that a new temporary chapel is due to be built, and the Ark is to be moved into it while the original chapel is repaired. 'It seems that the builders of the 1960s were not as careful as the builders of centuries past, and the roof of the chapel has developed some serious leaks that now need comprehensive repair work. Indiana Jones, right, carries away the glistening Ark of the Covenant in the 1981 film Raiders of the Lost Ark by Steven Spielberg . 'To protect the Ark, a tarpaulin now covers the roof of the chapel but this is just a temporary measure. 'To renovate the building thoroughly, the roof must be stripped back to the bare bones and so a replacement chapel is to be built next door providing a temporary home for it.' Tim said the construction of the new temporary chapel would take about three months according to workers and religious figures at the site, though he suspects that it will probably take much longer. He added: 'When the work is finished, the Ark of the Covenant will be carried to its new resting place.' 'That this can be done by the one person allowed to see it is unlikely, as The Bible describes the size of the Ark as 2.5 cubits in length, 1.5 in breadth, and 1.5 in height. 'Cubits in today's measurements translate to about 1.31 metres x 0.79m x 0.79m and it is normally carried on two long wooden poles. 'If it really is this size, and still contains the two stone tablets that list God's Ten Commandments, then the elderly monk will no doubt need some help to transport it.'","Ark contains Ten Commandments God 'gave' to Moses on Mount Sinai .
One holy monk is the only person allowed to see the holy box...

"Former cricketer Sir Ian Botham said the RSPB was more interested in political lobbying . A group of landowners has accused Britain’s biggest nature charity of misleading donors over how it spends its money. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds claims to spend 90 per cent of its income on conservation work. But the landowners – led by former cricketer and keen shot Sir Ian Botham – said the charity was more interested in political lobbying than protecting wildlife. Yesterday they reported the RSPB to the Charity Commission, claiming the organisation, which received £122million in grants, donations and commercial income last year, spent just £30million (24 per cent) on its bird reserves. Sir Ian, who runs a commercial shoot at his home in North Yorkshire and is one of the leaders of the You Forgot The Birds campaign, said: ‘It is a massive bureaucracy where donations are spent on homes for office workers not homes for birds. 'Birds don’t need hundreds of campaigners and lobbyists in suits – they need people with spades building habitat.’ Ian Gregory, the campaign’s director, said: ‘The RSPB seems to be more interested in political lobbying than conservation, which they seem to think is a bit boring.’ RSPB spokesman Grahame Madge said last night that managing nature reserves was only a tiny part of the charity’s conservation programme and that other activities, such as research and advising farmers, were also important. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds claims to spend 90 per cent of its income on conservation work . A total of £69million is spent on conservation, a further £19million on education and political lobbying, and £32million on fundraising, he claimed. It is the latest in a series of clashes between the charity and rural campaigners. The RSPB has criticised farmers over grouse shoots and blamed their use of pesticides for declining bird numbers, while landowners complain that the charity is heavy-handed in the way it tries to police the countryside. They can pose so beautifully, stretching out their wings. But as many a frustrated photographer will tell you, birds usually disappear the second you lift up the camera. But with a lot of patience and a heap of tempting mealworms, one enthusiast has earned the trust of the birds in his garden to the point that he has them eating out of his hand, allowing him to picture them closer than ever before. Great tit Georgie: This diligent photographer from Foolow, Derbyshire - known only as Villager Jim - has befriended the birds in his garden to the point that they are literally eating out of his hand . The 49-year-old father of two, known only as Villager Jim, even has names for his feathered friends: Deirdre the blue tit, great tit Georgie, a brown sparrow called Jack and Ralphie the robin. The photographer, from Foolow, Derbyshire, said: ‘It’s all down to the power of the mealworm. It’s a joy but you have to be patient. 'Their instinct is to fly away so it’s really special when they trust you enough to stay. Now they follow me and sit on the fence next to me. It’s wonderful.’ Feathered friends: Deirdre the blue tit (left) and Ralphie the robin (right) have also been photographed .","RSPB claims to spend 90 per cent of its income on conservation work .

"Businessman Dewani, 35, took an overdose of tranquillisers while depressed in the weeks following Anni’s death . Honeymoon murder suspect Shrien Dewani attempted suicide after his wife Anni was killed during a hijacking in Cape Town four years ago, a psychiatric report has revealed. Businessman Dewani, 35, took an overdose of tranquillisers while depressed in the weeks following Anni’s death, according to a medical panel reporting to the Western Cape High Court on Friday. The panel also said that Dewani had been experiencing nightmares and flashbacks from the night his wife died. Four psychiatrists and a clinical psychologist have been assessing him at the city’s Valkenberg Hospital since his extradition in April on a charge of murder. They have concluded that he is fit to stand trial. Dewani is accused of hiring hitmen to stage the hijacking of their taxi as he and Anni were driven through a poor township late at night during their honeymoon in 2010. Three men have already been convicted of hijacking, murder and robbery charges in connection with Anni’s death and are serving prison sentences. The report handed to the court on Friday described how Dewani, from Bristol, ‘took to his bed’ for a week after his wife’s funeral, suffering flashbacks and nightmares. He refused to attend a psychiatric facility and was instead being managed at home where he was treated for depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. Dewani is said to be ‘engaging well’ and is articulate and often affable at Valkenberg Hospital. His trial will start on October 6 and is expected to run until December 12.

"Vladimir Putin's cat: The Russian president works with a conservationist to put a satellite-tracking collar on Kuzya, a wild Siberian tiger . A Siberian tiger called Kuzya released into the wild by Vladimir Putin has defected - to China. Satellite tracking signals from a special collar shows that he swam across the Amur River border on Sunday, newspaper Novaya Gazeta reported. Ecologists say that the endangered Amur tiger was probably looking for better nutrition but there are now fears for his safety after he left the Jewish Automomous Republic in the Russian Far East. Vasiliy Gorobeiko, deputy head of natural resources management in the republic, said he is concerned because China is more populated and he could be shot for worrying farm animals. 'Certainly, China will be informed about President Putin's tiger via Foreign Affairs ministry channels but time is needed for this information to reach local ecologists, and before then the tiger may well alarm the local villagers and may even suffer,' he said. 'Kuzya knows how to avoid people and did so well in Russia but in that agricultural area of China, it will be hard for him.' Putin released Kuzya - then 19 months old - and two other tigers into the wild on 22 May in a remote area of Amur region. Kuzya was the bravest one and was the first to escape to the wild taiga, the natural habitat of the species. The other two tigers - Borya, Kuzya's brother, and Ilona - remain in the Amur region of Russia according to the satellite tracking data. A shortage of deer has meant they have sought other food, for example Borya feasted on a bear, and Llona a wolf. Both also came into conflict with humans after pestering farm animals. Scroll down for video . Defected: Now satellite tracking signals show Kuzya swam across the Amur River border with China on Sunday . Hello, kitty: President Putin reaches out to stroke the tranquilised Siberian tiger on his paw . 'We can only hope that Kuzya changes his mind and swims back to Russia as soon as possible, while the river is not iced over,' said the newspaper. News of the tiger defection came the day after Putin celebrated his 62nd birthday on retreat in Siberia. It comes amid reports of business people seeking to go abroad due to the plunging rouble and an economic crisis worsened by Western sanctions. Today the Kremlion strongman was in Siberia's largest city Novosibirsk opening a new bridge over the Ob River. Kuzya as a cub: Vasiliy Gorobeiko, deputy head of natural resources management in the Jewish Automomous Republic, is concerned because China is more populated and Kuzya could be shot for worrying farm animals . Putin has led efforts to protect the Amur tigers. The wild population of tigers is now several hundred, still well below a sustainable level without major conservation efforts. Putin was recently behind the unveiling of a computer animated tiger cub as a new character on Russia's longest-running children's TV programme.","Ecologists fear Kuzya may face danger in more-densely populated China .

"The long-held belief that carbon dioxide is wrapping the planet in a ‘blanket’ that traps more heat, causing global warming, is not quite right, scientists say. They claim that the story is more complex, although the potentially catastrophic consequences will likely be the same. Experts say that in the long term, global warming is more like tanning oil letting the Earth absorb more of the sun's incoming rays. Scientists from University of Washington and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology say that the long-held belief that carbon dioxide is wrapping the planet in a ‘blanket’ that traps more heat, causing global warming, is not quite right . A team from the University of Washington and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) explained that broadly speaking, carbon dioxide being belched out by factories and vehicles acts as a blanket, trapping long-wave infrared energy coming off the Earth. The atmosphere then emits less of this long-wave radiation to space because the upper atmosphere is cooler than the Earth's surface. But the Earth gradually heats up under this ‘blanket’ and hotter objects emit more long-wave radiation, according to the Pnas study. Without icecaps to reflect back the suns rays and increased humidity, Earth will begin to absorb more shortwave radiation - the high-energy rays coming directly from the sun (stock image shown) The use of fossil fuels must be phased out by the end of the century, UN scientists have warned despite growing concerns over energy supplies. The UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change issued stark predictions that continued greenhouse gas emissions will cause 'severe, pervasive and irreversible' impacts around the world. In its latest assessment of global warming, which was published last week, it urged governments to cut carbon dioxide emissions by up to 70 per cent by 2050. The authors said fossil fuels would need to be phased out completely from electricity production by 2100 unless new technology could safely bury carbon dioxide from power stations underground to prevent it from being released into the atmosphere. Rajendra Pachauri, chair of the IPCC, warned that the cost of delaying action to tackle climate change would be 'proportionally higher'. He said: 'The world needs a combination of adaptation and mitigation. 'We will not be able to adapt to the impacts of climate change if we don't to anything to tackle the root of the problem. The impacts will exceed our capacity to cope with them. 'In the absence of carbon capture and storage then power generation from fossil fuels would need to be phased out by the end of this century if we want to limit temperature increases to 2°C.' More than two thirds of the Britain's electricity comes from fossil fuels and cutting down on coal, oil and gas use is seen as a major challenge. So within about a decade the effect of adding the thicker ‘blanket’ has been cancelled by the warmer body emitting more energy, the experts explained. In the longer term, the study and its computer models show that the Earth will begin to absorb more shortwave radiation - the high-energy rays coming directly from the sun. Experts have previously shied away from talking about shortwave radiation because clouds can reflect this visible light back to space and clouds remain one of the big unknowns under climate change. The researchers warn that the planet is likely to have less ice and the air will become more humid under climate change, both of which will act to absorb more shortwave radiation from the sun. Those effects will be like putting tanning oil on the planet, letting it absorb more of the sun's incoming rays, they explained. Melting ice creates darker surfaces that can absorb more heat, and the more melting, the more heat it can absorb. Likewise, warmer air holds more water vapour, causing it to absorb solar radiation that might otherwise bounce back off clouds, ice or snow. ‘While greenhouse gases trap one type of radiation, it's the other type - visible, shortwave radiation - that is really sustaining global warming over the long term,’ said co-author Kyle Armour, a postdoctoral researcher at MIT. The computer models should help scientists better detect climate change in satellite data, which can measure both shortwave radiation reflected by the Earth and long-wave radiation emitted by the Earth. Most of the study's simulations involved a one-time addition of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Yet one scenario simulated continuously increasing carbon dioxide, as is happening now, and found the long-wave radiation effect lasted about 20 years before the shortwave effect took over. Professor of atmospheric sciences David Battisti at Washington University said: 'Our results do not change our overall expectation that the planet will continue to warm due to the burning of fossil fuels, but they do change our fundamental understanding of how that warming comes about.'","University of Washington and MIT scientists say global warming is more complicated than a ‘blanket’ of CO2 trapping heat .

As the icecaps melt, more high-energy solar rays will be absorbed .

"A 13-year-old boy has been killed after a sacrificial goat jumped off a building and landed on his head. Turkish schoolboy Heval Yildirim was playing with friends when the goat fell six floors from the apartment block and fell on him. The goat had been purchased by his father, Mehmet, in preparation for the Eid-al-Adha festival. Turkish schoolboy was killed when a sacrificial goat fell on him from the sixth floor of a building in Turkey . The goat fell from the top of this block of flats in Turkey and landed on Heval, who was playing in the streets . The Turkish schoolboy was taken to hospital following the incident but was confirmed dead on arrival . The festival honours the prophet Abraham's willingness to sacrifice his chosen son as an act of submission to God. Muslims slaughter a sheep or goat in an act of sacrifice to show gratitude for their blessings . The Greater Eid, or Eid-al-Adha, commemorates the willingness of Abraham to sacrifice his son Ishmael as an act of obedience to Allah. Eid al-Adha is also known as the Festival of Sacrifice. After witnessing Abraham's devotion and willingness to sacrifice his son, Allah gave him a lamb to sacrifice in the stead of his son, Ishmael. Muslims today sacrifice a sheep or a goat, the meat of which is shared among friends, family, and the poor, with each receiving a third. In the UK, people also sacrifice animals but are required to make arrangements to ensure it is slaughtered humanely. According to the scripture, God intervenes at the last minute to replace Abraham's son with a sheep - an act which forms the basis of its modern celebrations. In remembrance, Muslim faithful will slaughter a sheep or goat in an act of sacrifice to show gratitude for their blessings. They then divide the meat into three equal portions - keeping some of it for themselves, giving a third to the poor and giving the final third to relatives, friends and neighbours. Mehmet had placed the goat on the roof as the family flat was too cramped. The animal tried to escape by jumping over a small fence placed round the rooftop and fell on to Heval, who was playing with his friends on the streets below. He was taken to hospital but was confirmed dead on arrival. The goat also died. An investigation has been launched into the incident, with a prosecutor describing it as 'unprecedented.' His father Mehmet said: 'I am devastated but what more can I say? In fact there is nothing at all to say. 'Even the prosecutor has said this incident could be the first of its kind around the world.' The Eid-al-Adha festival is celebrated by all Muslims but it occurs on slightly different days depending on location because it is held according to the Muslim lunar calendar and moon sightings.","Heval Yildirim died when sacrificial goat jumped off building and fell on him .

"Record numbers of young people still live with their parents as the so-called boomerang generation struggle to buy their own homes. The young were hit harder by the recession than older people – being more likely to lose their jobs and suffering larger reductions in their incomes, a report says. The Institute for Fiscal Studies report, which is published today, also found that more than one in four 22 to 30-year-olds depend on their parents for somewhere to live. Record numbers of young people still live with their parents as the so-called boomerang generation struggle to buy their own homes . It exposed the staggering decline in home ownership among younger people compared to their parents at the same age. The proportion owning a home has halved in 20 years. Jonathan Cribb, a research economist at the IFS, said: ‘Young adults have borne the brunt of the recession. ‘Pay, employment and incomes have all been hit hardest for those in their 20s. A crucial question is whether this difficult start will do lasting damage to their employment and earning prospects.’ The research, which was commissioned by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, found that younger people had suffered more through the recession than older people in a number of ways. Researchers found that from 2011 to 2013, 28 per cent of those aged 22 to 30 were still living in the family home – a total of 2.1million. That is a rise from 1.8million in the same age bracket living with mum and dad between 2006 and 2008. The Institute for Fiscal Studies report exposed the staggering decline in home ownership among younger people compared to their parents at the same age . Among those born in the Sixties, 45 per cent owned a house by the time they were 25. That compares with 34 per cent born in the mid-Seventies and just 21 per cent of those born in the mid-Eighties. During the recession, 22 to 30-year-olds saw their incomes fall sharply. On average they experienced a dip in wages of 13 per cent from 2007 to last year. Among 31 to 59-year-olds, the fall was only 7 per cent. For the over-60s, average household income remained unchanged – in many cases because pensions and benefits were not cut in the same way  as wages. In the same period, employment  among the young fell by 4 per cent, while remaining stable for older workers. The report found that being able to live at home cushioned the blow of the recession for young people as they would have suffered more financially if they did not have that option. Notably, it also found there was ‘no clear North-South divide’ in terms of where the recession hit hardest. The figures counter Labour’s oft-repeated claim that those outside London are worse off than those in  the capital. Angus Hanton, of the non-party political charity Intergenerational Foundation, said: ‘That so many young people cannot afford to leave home should act as a wake-up call to policymakers. ‘These figures provide yet further evidence that the prospects of younger generations are being systematically sacrificed whilst older generations’ benefits continue to be protected. Why? Because more older people vote and they lobby hard for their own interests.’ The report prompted calls for ministers to increase home building across the country. Chris Goulden, head of poverty research at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said: ‘This research provides further proof that a shortage of affordable homes and the high cost of renting or buying a home is pushing hundreds of thousands more people into absolute poverty.’ Labour treasury spokesman Catherine McKinnell said: ‘While David Cameron denies there is a cost-of-living crisis, these figures show people have seen a substantial fall in their income. ‘With home ownership becoming ever more out of reach for young people, we need action to boost housing supply.’ However, Professor Frank Furedi of the University of Kent denies the report’s finding that the trend of young adults living with their parents is linked to the economy – saying it had been a growing shift even in the good years. He said young adults are being ‘treated childishly’, adding that parents are ‘allowing young people to remain in extended adolescence’ instead of forcing them to make their own way in life.","One in four 22 to 30-year-olds depend on their parents for somewhere to live .

Mark Summers, 31, said it was his first time attending the vigil. Summers, of Birmingham, England, is an Elvis tribute artist who performs theater shows across Europe. Summers wore a black shirt, black pants and a hairstyle shaped like a pompadour, just like his idol. He said no other performer 'could touch the charisma he had on stage.' Candles placed in a heart shape rest on Elvis blankets outside the gates of Graceland on Friday . People began arriving early in the day to get a spot in line outside Graceland's gates .

Summers said he admired Presley not only for his music and his act, but also for his good qualities as a person. Presley was known for giving money to charities and cars to fans. 'So generous, caring, loving, spiritual, all those kinds of things,' Summers said. 'Tonight is going to be really emotional.' The vigil is a highlight of Elvis Week, an annual celebration of Presley's career and his life.

"A convicted felon allegedly killed his daughter and six grandchildren before turning the gun on himself in a murder suicide in northern Florida - 13 years after he accidentally shot his eight-year-old son dead in a hunting accident. Don Spirit, 51, is said to have gunned down daughter Sarah, 28, and her six sons and daughters, before taking his own life at his home in Bell, a town of only 350 people 30 miles west of Gainesville. The Gilchrist County Sheriff's Office  confirmed that the victims were Kaleb Kuhlmann, 11, Kylie Kuhlmann, nine, Johnathon Kuhlmann, eight, Brandon Stewart, four and Destiny Stewart, five, and three-month-old Alana Stewart.

The suspect, Spirit, shot and killed his eight-year-old son Kyle during a hunting accident in 2001. According to the Orlando-Sentinel, he spent three years in prison after pleading guilty  to a charge of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon just as his trial was set to begin, in exchange for the minimum sentence. Spirit, having been convicted in 1998 for felony possession of marijuana, did not have rights to own a firearm. He was released in 2006. In 1990, he was arrested on a felony fugitive warrant. Others offences included drug charges and depriving a child of food and shelter, the New York Daily News reported. His daughter Sarah had been on probation for a theft in 2013, jail records show. Following yesterday's shooting, Gilchrist's county sheriff Robert Schultz said the suspect called 911, suggesting he was going to 'harm others as well as himself'. Units were then sent to the family address where the suspect was found dead, along with seven victims. Schultz added that some people were still alive after the shooting, but would not elaborate on the number or their relationship to the family. He added that the department was not looking for anyone else in connection with the shooting but insisted the investigation was ongoing.

'There are certain things in life you can explain; there are certain things you can't. This is one of those things that I can't explain.' Schultz added that Bell and the surrounding community is close-knit and people would pull together. 'We'll get through this,' he said. 'I will continue to ask everybody to pray for the families.' Florida Department of Law Enforcement spokeswoman Samantha Andrews confirmed the agency is investigating the shootings and that it appeared to be a murder-suicide. 'At this point, FDLE is investigating at the request of the Gilchrist County sheriff,' Andrews said. 'It appears to be a murder-suicide. There is no danger to the community. It was at a private residence there at Bell.' On Facebook, the sheriff's office wrote: 'At 4 pm today [Thursday], Gilchrist County deputies responded to an incident at a residence in Bell.

"Hundreds of protesters today descended on the BBC's Scottish headquarters in protest at its alleged bias in covering the independence referendum. A huge crowd of people, many with flags or banners, could be seen outside the Corporation's studios in Glasgow following a march from the city centre. First Minister Alex Salmond has previously accused the BBC of colluding with the Westminster Government in a bid to undermine the independence movement ahead of Thursday's vote. Scroll down for video . Protest: Hundreds of people have descended on BBC Scotland to demonstrate over their alleged bias . Anger: Scottish nationalists believe the BBC has given a one-sided view of the debate . In a new interview, he added that London-based journalists had been unable to 'separate their own view of the world from their view reporting Scotland'. Today Yes supporters gathered in the centre of Glasgow and proceeded to march on the BBC's headquarters. Pictures posted online showed hundreds  of people outside the studio, many with enormous saltire flags - Police Scotland estimated that up to 1,000 people were in attendance. Banners at the event described the BBC as the 'British Biased Corporation', with one placard saying the corporation was 'anti-democracy, anti-truth'. A line of police could be seen outside the entrance to the building stopping protesters from going in. Fury: Demonstrators held up placards denouncing the BBC's coverage over the past few months . Reaction: Unionists accused the protesters of focussing on irrelevant issues in the run-up to the vote . Gathering: The police estimated that up to 1,000 people had attended the demonstration in Glasgow . Dean Toner, 20, from Uddingston in Lanarkshire, said at the demonstration: 'It's a protest against the biased reporting the BBC have been taking part in. 'It's been a completely one-sided street, there's not been any coverage, proper true coverage, of the Yes campaign and it's not good enough any more.' But No voters expressed anger at the event, claiming that it was an attempt at intimidating the media. One unionist, Rhoda Macdonald, wrote on Twitter that the march was 'truly sinister', adding: 'I am ashamed of some of my fellow Scots.' Blair McDougall, leader of the anti-independence Better Together, tweeted: 'Last Sunday before the vote. Doors to be knocked? No, let's do this instead.' Convoy: The Yes supporters blocked the city's streets as . March: The demonstrators walked from Glasgow city centre holding home-made signs . Particular anger has focussed on the BBC's political editor Nick Robinson, who was this week accused of 'heckling' Mr Salmond at a Press conference. The fiery exchange came after the BBC reported that Royal Bank of Scotland was set to move its headquarters to London, quoting anonymous Government sources. Asked by the Sunday Herald today whether he thought the BBC was biased, Mr Salmond said: 'Yes, absolutely. Of course it is. The problem with Nick... I mean, don't get me wrong, I like these folk, but they don't realise they're biased. It's the unconscious bias which is the most extraordinary thing of all.' The First Minister added: 'I just think metropolitan BBC has found this whole thing extraordinarily difficult, to separate their own view of the world from their view reporting Scotland.' Despite the animosity felt towards the BBC by many Scottish nationalists, Mr Salmond has previously insisted that an independent Scotland would be able to keep broadcasting the Corporation's programmes. Clash: The BBC's political editor Nick Robinson had a fiery exchange with Alex Salmond earlier this week . The BBC said in a statement today: 'We believe our coverage has been fair and impartial and has adhered fully to the requirements of our Editorial and Referendum Guidelines.' Labour MP Ian Davidson said: 'Yesterday it was the banks and some of the largest employers in Scotland. Today it's the BBC and MI5. In the world of Alex Salmond and his fellow nationalists, everybody is against them. 'If you aren't actively for them then you are against them. And if they think you are against them they go on the attack.' Conservative MSP Alex Johnstone added: 'I can't understand on the last weekend of campaigning why so many Yes supporters would spend their time in this way.'","March began in Glasgow city centre and ended at BBC Scotland .

"National outrage: Nicholas Prettejohn joined members of the far-right Monday Club in 1980 . One of the leading contenders to become the new chairman of the BBC Trust once attended gatherings of a far-Right group who gave Nazi salutes, sang songs glorifying Adolf Hitler and campaigned in favour of ‘racial purity’. Nicholas Prettejohn, a City grandee who has served as an adviser to George Osborne, is on a shortlist of candidates who are being interviewed for the £110,000 role at the top of the Corporation. But it has now emerged that when he was a student at Oxford University, Mr Prettejohn attended a meeting of the Monday Club, an offshoot of the Conservative Party that has campaigned for voluntary repatriation of ethnic minorities. A photograph unearthed by The Mail on Sunday shows Mr Prettejohn, then a 20-year-old student at Balliol College, at a Monday Club event in 1980 which caused national outrage at the time. Newspapers reported attendees had shouted ‘Sieg heil’, talked about ‘racial purity’ and sung Tomorrow Belongs To Me, a song performed in the musical Cabaret by members of the Hitler Youth – despite the fact that the event was held close to a memorial to members of the college killed fighting the Nazis. James Sainsbury, son of Sir Timothy Sainsbury, a former Conservative Minister, was pictured at the event performing a Nazi salute. Mr Sainsbury, who was 19 at the time, later apologised, saying he had been ‘very, very drunk indeed’: he received an OBE in 2013 in recognition of his charitable works. There is no suggestion that Mr Prettejohn engaged in or condoned the chanting and saluting. Eight months before the dinner, Mr Prettejohn had been elected president of the famous Oxford Union debating society – with his political opponents claiming he had been swept to victory by a ‘Monday Club machine’ which mobilised Right-wing supporters. The Conservative Party severed its ties with the Monday Club in 2001, when then leader Iain Duncan Smith warned the group that its racist policies were damaging public perception of the party. The race to succeed Lord Patten as BBC Trust chairman was blown wide open last month after the favourite, Lord Coe, unexpectedly pulled out of the running. Mr Prettejohn, 54, who was recently appointed chairman of pensions and investment firm Scottish Widows, became one of a group of City advisers to Mr Osborne after the 2010 General Election. He became a BBC trustee last December. Controversy: Mr Prettejohn, aged 20, grinning at a drunken Nazi party at Oxford University . Shortlist: Mr Prettejohn, 54, became a BBC trustee last year and is now on a shortlist for the £110,000 job . The Chancellor is understood to have been heavily involved in the recruitment process for the Trust chairman, and called for the shortlist to feature candidates with strong City experience. Other potential contenders include Tory peer Patience Wheatcroft, a former Times journalist, and Suzanna Taverne, a BBC trustee and former senior manager at the British Museum. Government sources say that although Mr Prettejohn is a ‘strong candidate’, No 10 is keen for the successful candidate to be a woman. A BBC spokesman said: ‘Nick is on holiday at the moment and is not available to comment.’","Nicholas Prettejohn, City grandee who advised Osborne, aiming for BBC .

"Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice has finally publicly apologized for allegedly punching his wife before dragging her limp body from an elevator. The 27-year-old football player, who was caught on surveillance footage in February carrying his then-fiancee in an Atlantic City casino, told reporters on Thursday that his actions were 'inexcusable'. 'You know that's not me,' he said. 'You know that's something I have to live... with the rest of my life.' Last week, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said Rice would be suspended without pay for the first two games of the 2014 regular season - a punishment that many said failed to go far enough. Scroll down for video . Apology: Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice said on Thursday the attack on his wife was 'inexcusable' He was also fined an additional game check for 'conduct detrimental to the NFL,' the league said. At the press conference, he refused to say what had triggered the incident but said he was worried that his two-year-old daughter would find out about it on Google when she was older. 'It hurts because I can't go out there and play football, but it hurts more because I have to be a father and explain what happened to my daughter,' he said, CNN reported. 'I let so many people down because of 30 seconds in my life that you know I know I can't take back.' He called his wife Janay, who watched the press conference from a balcony, an 'angel' who could do 'no wrong' and said they were in counseling. Regrets: Rice was banned from two games following the alleged assault but he has still be at training . 'My job is to lead my family, my job is lead my wife, my job is to . lead in whatever I do,' he said. 'And If I'm not being the example, then my family . crumbles.' He added that his wife will speak out about domestic violence. 'When the time is right we will go out there and help as many people as we can,' he said. Rice entered a pretrial intervention program in May, meaning he won't be prosecuted, and the charges will be expunged after a year, the NFL explained. Rice's suspension will begin on August 30. He will miss the season opener against AFC North champion Cincinnati on September 7 and the September 11 game against the Pittsburgh Steelers. But he will be eligible for reinstatement on . September 12 and is allowed to participate in all . aspects of training camp and preseason games.

Happier times: The couple are going through therapy, which is helping, he said on Thursday . Shame: He said he feared his daughter finding about the attack. He is pictured right at training on Thursday . The NFL's announcement surprised many since other players have faced far worse punishments, often for non-violent offenses. 'It is disappointing that I will not be with my teammates for the first two games of the season, but that's my fault,' Rice said in an earlier statement issued by the Ravens. 'I failed in many ways. But Janay and I have learned from this. We have become better as a couple and as parents. I am better because of everything we have experienced since that night.' Rice has played six years for the Ravens. He is the team's career leader in total scrimmage yards and ranks behind only Jamal Lewis in total yards rushing.","Rice was contrite as he appeared at a press conference during training on Thursday - five months after he allegedly attacked his then-fiancee .

"A Lamborghini owner who was forced to abandon his £250,000 supercar on Tower Bridge after running out of petrol was arrested by police who came to his aid. When police arrived to assist the stranded motorist, they discovered that he was wanted on suspicion of harassment and taken into custody. The Italian sports car was left on Tower Bridge overnight until it was towed away earlier today. The white Lamborghini Countach was abandoned on Tower Bridge last night after the driver ran out of petrol . When City of London officers attended the scene, they discovered that the man was wanted by the Metropolitan Police on an outstanding harassment warrant. The man has been bailed pending further enquiries. However, officers investigating the case have discovered that the vehicle may have been driving on the number plate of a different vehicle. According to DVLA records, the personalised numberplate on the 1980s supercar belong to a Range Rover V8. The driver told officers that he is in the process of changing over the plates onto his Lamborghini. The white Lamborghini Countach was left on the bridge overnight and prompted Transport for London to post an image of the car after it began to cause problems for morning rush hour traffic. Staff wrote: ‘Tower Bridge N/B there’s a lane blocked due to an abandoned car…Anyone missing theirs?’ Metropolitan Police said the two door V12 Italian supercar, which was in production until the 1990s, remains on the bridge and ‘is not causing an obstruction’. A spokesman from the force said: ‘Police were made aware of a white Lamborghini car stationary on Tower Bridge. The Lamborghini was pictured by Tom Ebbs as busy commuters made their way around it this morning . Police say the car remains on the bridge and 'is not causing an obstruction' to traffic. But Transport for London tweeted this morning to say that the vehicle was blocking one lane . ‘The car had run out of petrol on the bridge at 6.30pm last night – October 8. ‘City of London police attended and discovered the driver was wanted on warrant for harassment - he was arrested and taken to an east London police station where he was passed into the custody of the Metropolitan Police. He remains in custody. The mid-engined supercar was produced by Lamborghini between 1972 and 1990. 2,042 of the two-door coupes were made. The LP 500S model can reach top speeds of 160mph while the LP 500 Turbo S Prototype can reach 207mph. The engine is pointed 'backwards', the output shaft is at the front, and the gearbox is in front of the engine for better weight distribution. Designed by Marcello Gandini, the supercar came third on the list of top sports cars of the 70s and 10th in the top ones from the 80s, by  car magazine Sports Car International. ‘The vehicle remains there and is not causing an obstruction. Officers continue to monitor the situation.’ The Daily Telegraph reports that the driver could also face a fine after DVLA records traced the number plate and found it was registered to a black Land Rover. The vehicle was removed from the road at around 3pm this afternoon. A genuine 25th Anniversary Edition of the car was used in the 2013 film The Wolf of Wall Street. In one scene the main character New York stock broker Jordan Belfort, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, recklessly drives his Lamborghini Countach whilst high on drugs and crashes into his driveway. The damage to the authentic vehicle sparked outrage from fans of the Italian supercar online, claiming that a replica should have been made.

"More than 140 schoolchildren are being 'brainwashed' into becoming suicide bombers for Islamist militants after being kidnapped in Syria, it emerged today. The Kurdish pupils, aged between 14 and 16, are being held hostage in the ISIS-controlled city of Manbij, where they are being forced to take lessons in radical Islamic theology. One 15-year-old boy, known as Mohammed, said masked fighters made him watch a video of fighters beheading a man on their first day - then warned he would face the same fate if he tried to escape. 'Brainwashed': Some of the 140 schoolboys reportedly captured by ISIS militants in Syria while travelling back home on a convoy of buses after taking their final exams in the city of Aleppo . Snatched: The Kurdish pupils, aged between 14 and 16, are being held hostage in the ISIS-controlled city of Manbij, where they are being forced to take lessons in radical Islamic theology . He said the men, armed with AK-47 machine guns, told him: 'This is jihad for the sake of God.' Despite the barbaric threat, he and a friend managed to escape after creating a diversion, climbing a fence and running to safety. His account comes days after a human rights group revealed how ISIS militants waging war in Iraq and Syria are recruiting children for roles ranging from soldiers and snipers to stretcher bearers and suicide bombers. Mohammed told CNN that he was kidnapped by armed fighters while travelling on a convoy of buses carrying children back from their final exams in the city of Aleppo on May 29. He said the men angrily questioned why the boys were sitting with the girls, yelling at them: 'It is forbidden!' Mohammed added: 'We were all so scared. We were excited to go home and see our families. We didn't know why they took us.' Boy jihadis: An Al Qaeda fighter stands with two children holding machine guns while watching ISIS parade in commandeered Iraqi security force vehicles in Mosul, Iraq . He was among more than 140 Kurdish schoolboys kidnapped in Syria last month by ISIS, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and local activists. The children were then taken to a mosque in Manbij, handed blankets and forced to sleep in a single rooms with 17 boys in each one. They are woken up at dawn each day for prayer, made to take lessons for several hours on Sharia law then forced to watch horrific videos of executions and suicide missions, he said. A father of one of the captured pupils, who is a senior Kurdish leader but didn't want to be identified in fear for his son's safety, said: 'They are trying to brainwash them. 'We have raised our children well, but we are worried how this will affect them psychologically.' Show of strength: ISIS parade in a commandeered Iraqi security forces vehicle down a main road at the northern city of Mosul, which the militants captured at the start of their insurgency in Iraq two weeks ago . Earlier this week, a report by Human Rights Watch revealed how rebel groups across the ideological spectrum have employed children in the civil war in Syria. Military and police forces in Kurdish-controlled areas have also used teenagers, it said. 'Syrian armed groups shouldn't prey on vulnerable children — who have seen their relatives killed, schools shelled and communities destroyed — by enlisting them in their forces,' said Priyanka Motaparthy, the author of the 31-page report. 'The horrors of Syria's armed conflict are only made worse by throwing children into the front lines.' Human Rights Watch said the extremist Nusra Front and the Islamic State have both targeted children as young as 15 through education programs, which include military training. The group, which said the number of children fighting in the conflict is unknown, based its report on interviews with 25 children and former child soldiers in Syria.","Pupils aged 14 to 16 being held hostage in rebel-controlled city in Syria .

"The man who produced the thank you note that brought down a New South Wales premier has revealed how it almost did not happen. Former Australian Water Holdings (AWH) chief Nick Di Girolamo said he had contemplated burning the note after Premier Barry O'Farrell denied he had received a $3,000 bottle of Penfolds Grange Hermitage from Mr Di Girolamo who has links with the family of Eddie Obeid, a corrupt former politician. Mr O'Farrell was appearing as a witness before the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) on April 15. Former chief of Australian Water Holdings Nick Di Girolamo was the man who brought down the premier with a thank you note for a bottle of wine . While giving evidence, Mr O'Farrell said he and his wife Rosemary had been on holidays in April 2011 when it was asserted the wine had been delivered to their Roseville home on Sydney's north shore. But the ICAC traced a telephone call from Mr O'Farrell to Mr Di Giromalo around that time. On the same night Mr O'Farrell took the stand, Mr Di Girolamo found a note penned in 2011 by the then-premier thanking him and his wife, Jodie, for the bottle of wine. In his home office, the businessman contemplated whether or not he would burn the note or front up and hand it over to his legal team. 'It would have been illegal, but at that moment I was not thinking like a lawyer,' Mr Di Girolamo told The Daily Telegraph. 'I was all over the place. 'I knew it was a perversion of justice, and still there was a small voice in my head asking, ""Should we have a bonfire session?""' Mr O'Farrell (left) says he does not recall receiving the $3000 bottle of wine (right) - a Grange Hermitage - from Mr Di Giromalo . After mulling it over - and despite the consequences he would later face for dobbing in the premier - he knew what he had to do. The next day Mr O'Farrell's lawyers received a copy of the note Mr Di Girolamo had found and within hours NSW's most powerful man resigned from his post. He also revealed he had received death threats on March 18 and 23, which was the first week of the ICAC hearing, according to The Daily Telegraph. In one of the calls, someone called from a blocked phone number while he was at home, saying: 'You're dead, you piece of shit.' Five Dock funeral director Andrew Valerio was charged a few weeks later with using a carriage service to menace/harass/offend. Despite doing the right thing, Mr Di Girolamo struggles with the decision he made, telling The Daily Telegraph he wanted to apologise for the outcome of his discovery. 'It causes me great angst that I’ve in any way, shape or form forced the premier to resign,' he said. 'I’ve thought about reaching out. I suppose what has stopped me is the fear that I won’t get a great reception from the other end.' The note was produced to Mr Di Girolamo's lawyers and then given to Mr O'Farrell on the same day the premier resigned . When Mr O'Farrell tendered his resignation, he said he still did not recall receiving the bottle of wine, but 'he did accept there was a thank you note signed by me'. 'As someone who believes in accountability and responsibility, I accept the consequences of my actions,' he told media. 'The evidence I gave [at ICAC] was evidence to the best of my knowledge. 'I believed it to be truthful.' ICAC was investigating allegations Eddie Obeid's family covered up their investment in AWH when they were trying to win a contract with Sydney Water that would have made the Obeids $60 million, according to Business Insider Australia.","Nick Di Girolamo was behind the note that brought down Barry O'Farrell .

The adrenaline junkie and his friends, who do not use safety equipment or harnesses, treat the scaffolds surrounding multimillion pound towers as their own urban climbing frames. Scroll down for video . Harry Gallagher and his friends (pictured his friend Johnny on a crane over Canary Wharf) have scaled dozens of London's tallest skyscrapers to capture photographs . They are part of a growing community of cityscape adventurers known as Urban Explorers and prefer to use the huge cranes bestriding buildings to capture views of the capital. Last month Mr Gallagher, who is also a free-runner, mounted a crane taller than the under-construction Baltimore Tower at the Isle of Dogs, which will be almost 500ft when it is completed. He said: ‘We’d been planning it for weeks, every little detail like what time we should arrive - we ended up at the bottom of the crane at 4am. ‘There was security there but I was still surprised how easy it was. His legs can be seen dangling as he sits on top of a huge crane overlooking London to capture a series of photographs. He is part of group known as Urban Explorers . Harry Gallagher pictured on top of St Thomas' Hospital beside The Shard, which stands at almost 1000ft and is currently the tallest building in the European Union . ‘The view was amazing. We could see all of Canary Wharf and all over the rest of London. We stayed up there for three hours but I wanted to spend the rest of the summer there.’ His death-defying stunts are similar to the ‘skywalkers’ of Russia and Ukraine who hang from the edges of buildings, but the retail assistant insists he is more interested in taking photographs. He added: ‘For skywalkers it’s about the risk, to climb towers and balance. We go up to enjoy the experience and to take photos. ‘As far as hobbies go, it’s just as dangerous as other extreme sports like motor sports, skiing or snowboarding. ‘I feel perfectly safe whenever I climb because I’ve been training for a long time. I have been free running for seven years and I think that has given me strength and, importantly, balance. Harry and his friends observe the London skyline after scaling a huge building that over looks the 'Walkie Talkie' (left) and The Shard (right) The group have been able to evade security and without any safety equipment climb massive towers in order to capture these breath-taking images of the capital . ‘When I am at the top, I’m constantly making sure my hands have got a tight grip. I don’t move until I know I am secure.’ Mr Gallagher, who also favours extinct rail lines and disused reservoirs for climbs, explained the last thing to do is to think about slipping and plummeting whilst hundreds of feet above the ground. He said: ‘I understand that I might not be setting the best example. ‘My theory is that if I can do it at 10ft I can do it at 100ft or 40 stories. But I would be lying if I said I don’t think about falling. But if you think you will fall, you will fall. The key is to think positive.’ Despite evading security in dozens of cases, not all climbs have been successful as he discovered after his first and only run in with police while climbing the frame of plush new apartments in Vauxhall, south London. One of harry's friends lies inside the cab of a crane as it overlooks London. They were arrested six months ago for attempting to climb apartments in Vauxhall . His friend Johnny is seen at the end of a crane snapping photographs overlooking Canary Wharf on a bleak misty morning in the capital. Harry says his mother refuses to look at the images they capture and is 'not happy' about his high-climbing hobby . He explained: ‘We were arrested about six months ago - within about 30 minutes of starting the climb we were in the back of a police car. ‘There were cars, a helicopter and police dogs looking for us. ‘Luckily on that occasion the charges were dropped. I found if you respect the police, they respect you.’ Mr Gallagher and his friends have seen security being tightened up in recent times but he says he isn't worried about getting caught again. 'If I'm doing it to capture pictures and not to be destructive I think the police can understand.' But the teenager’s toughest challenge has been convincing his mother to look at his impressive portfolio of photographs. He said: ‘My mum knows what I’m doing. It was almost impossible for her not to find out because I was out all night. ‘But she doesn’t want to hear about it. I can’t say she is happy about it and she doesn’t want to see any of the photos.’ Harry stands on a narrow bar of a crane to take this vertigo-inducing image. He has been free running - or leaping from tall buildings - for seven years .","Harry Gallagher, 17, has scaled iconic London buildings such as 'Walkie Talkie', 'Cheesegrater' and Pinnacle .

"A man who has been left with ‘life-changing’ injuries following a chemical attack outside a block of flats was not the intended target, it has emerged. The 56-year-old, who has not been named, was reportedly assaulted with the 'harmful' liquid at the modern three-storey block in Witham, Essex, at around 10.45am. Police said he had gone to collect his post from the communal entrance of the building, which houses nine separate flats, when he encountered two men banging on the main door. Following a brief exchange the two men threw the harmful liquid, which was in a glass bottle, over the man and ran off. Attack: A man suffered 'life-changing injuries' after he was allegedly attacked with a chemical at the entrance to a block of flats. Above, a policeman and a forensic officers are pictured outside the flats on Friday . The victim was taken to Chelmsford's Broomfield Hospital with serious injuries to his face and hands, while police immediately cordoned off the area to members of the public. Despite neighbours describing the attack as 'targeted', police confirmed this evening that the victim had not been the intended target. Detective Inspector Leighton Hammett, of Braintree CID, said: ‘The information that we have currently gathered suggests that the victim was not the intended target of this attack. ‘Unfortunately he appears to have been in the wrong place at the wrong time. ‘The two suspects are described as a white man and a black man and if anyone saw them, either in the area prior to this attack or afterwards, we would urgently like to speak to them.’ Scene: The unnamed victim, who is 56-years-old, was reportedly assaulted with the 'harmful' liquid at the modern three-storey block in Witham, Essex, at around 10.45am on Friday . Examination: A forensic officer examines an item outside the entrance to the block of flats (left), where the man was reportedly attacked at around 10. 45am. Right, an ambulance is pictured at the scene this morning . Six fire engines and an air ambulance were called to the scene in Bramble Road following the incident, while the East of England Ambulance Service Trust also dispatched its Hazardous Area Response Team. This afternoon, detectives and forensic officers were seen going in and out of a ground-floor flat in the block, which remains sealed off. Donning protective clothing, they bagged up a number of items from the communal entrance to the block, including a plastic drink bottle. The post boxes outside the doorway were also swabbed, while a Police Community Support Officer was posted outside a ground-floor flat to the rear of the building. Earlier today, a neighbour claimed the two male suspects had appeared to 'target' their victim. The woman, who did not wish to be named, said: 'It was a definitely a targeted attack. We saw the car pull up and two men get out. 'They definitely weren't from round here. The police have told us not to say anything more though I am afraid.' Response: Six fire engines, paramedics and an air ambulance attended the scene in Bramble Road . Inspector Dean Stratford, of Essex Police, described the incident as an 'assault' and said 'chemicals were involved'. 'A man has been assaulted and chemicals were involved,' he said. 'We're making sure the area is safe for the public and the cordon will be in place until that time. 'At the moment we're trying to ascertain the circumstances around what happened and the investigation is ongoing.' Another neighbour said the attack had come as a 'surprise', saying: 'I've lived here for two years and there's never been any trouble. 'It's a nice area. I don't know the people who live there but it's come as a real surprise.' Investigation: A forensic officer prepares to examine items outside the block of flats on the day of the incident . An Essex Police spokesman said: 'Police were notified by the ambulance service at 10.45am today that a man had suffered injuries at an address in Bramble Road, Witham. 'Officers attended to find that the man had suffered injuries to his hands and face consistent with the use of a harmful liquid. 'The air ambulance were called to the scene but the man was subsequently taken to Broomfield Hospital for treatment by road ambulance. 'The man’s injuries are not believed to be life threatening, but are potentially life-changing.' Police are now appealing for witnesses to the incident.","Man, 56, allegedly attacked with chemical liquid outside flats in Essex .

"They have been one of the retail sensations of the Christmas season. Sales of eReaders, the handheld devices on to which electronic books can be downloaded, rocketed through December. It is good news for makers such as Amazon, which produces the best- selling Kindle and collects 30 per cent of the price of downloaded books. But there are fears that their profits could be hit by a the sheer number of pirate eBooks available to download for free. ePiracy: One of the illegal downloads being made available for the Amazon Kindle (left) is 77 Shadow Street by Dean Koontz. It can be obtained for free from pirate sites, while those who pre-order it from Amazon will have to pay nearly £12 . Just as pirates and websites including Napster undermined the music  industry by putting music on the web for free, so the same is now happening with eBooks. An agreement between six major . publishers including Harper Collins and Penguin also recently saw prices rocket for many ebooks - some of . which are more expensive than the paper version. Creating pirate copies of published books is simple and can be done using a computer and a scanner in a relatively short period of time, or by converting the file format of a 'bought' ebook. Freely available software which people can download to their home computers is able to convert just about any document file for reading on a Kindle or other ereader. Hitting back: Publishers have asked Google to demote pirate websites to make sure they do not appear at the top of web searches for free eBooks . One pirate website boasts: ‘With a Kindle there is pretty much no protection against pirated books. There are programs which can simply convert any piece of text into the proper format and it will show on your Kindle as if you had bought it!’ It is estimated that up to 20 per cent of eBook downloads are from pirate sites. The Publishers Association issued 115,000 legal threats to websites to stop them offering free pirated books in 2011, a rise of 130 per cent on 2010. Passwords could become a thing of the past as firms such as Apple develop face-recognition software to let users access their smartphones, tablets and laptops. The technology scans the face that is looking at the screen, picking out key features such as the distance between the eyes, the size of the nose or the shape of the lips, then comparing them to a stored image, the Apple Insider blog says. Some PCs from firms such as Dell and even smartphones from Samsung already use the technology. Hi-tech firms are racing to rescue users from the need to remember a growing store of passwords  to access their technology. Apple and Google are both understood to be developing facial recognition 'passwords' - and the new version of Windows will include an option to circle people on screen in family photos as opposed to memorising huge strings of numbers and letters. Publishers are in talks with the Government and Google to find ways to combat the trade, which breaches their copyright. They have asked Google to demote pirate websites to ensure they do not appear at the top of web searches for consumers looking to find eBooks. Pressure is also being put on internet service providers to shut down pirate websites. One of the best-known eBook pirate websites offers a selection of best-sellers that should not yet even be available to the public. One example is 77 Shadow Street, the new novel by Dean Koontz. Amazon customers will have to pay £11.96 to pre-order it – but an eBook and audiobook version are already available for free from the pirate site. The rise of the pirate eBook websites coincides with concern among consumers about the high price of legal book downloads. Five big publishers, together with Apple, are under investigation by the European Commission for allegedly colluding to push up the price of eBooks by as much as 50 per cent. Many eBooks are available for as little as 99p, however a bestseller can cost more than £10. In some cases, Amazon and Apple are charging more for an eBook download than the real book.","Up to 20% of eBooks are sourced from illegal sites .

"A pensioner has become the oldest woman in the world to climb the highest mountains on every continent. Carol Masheter, 65, reached the summit of Australia’s Mount Kosciuszko on March 17, to complete a mammoth undertaking lasting over five years. Against her family’s wishes, she braved soaring heights, plunging temperatures and even went blind for 10 hours descending Mount Everest. Determined: Carol poses at the 7,310 feet Kosciuszko summit in Australia, the final part of her goal to climb the world's highest mountains . 'I should be learning how to knit and play bridge and doing things that are more age appropriate to people my age, but that’s just not me,' she said. At age 60, Carol first conquered the 22,841 feet Aconcagua, South America’s highest peak in Argentina, before topping the 19,340 feet peak of Kilimanjaro, Tanzania, the highest peak in Africa, at age 61. Next she would take on Asia’s and the world’s highest mountain, reaching the summit of the mighty 29,035 feet Mount Everest in Nepal, age 61, on May 24, 2008. Unswerving Carol then mastered the highest peak in North America at age 63 by topping the 20,360 feet Denali in Alaska, USA., also known as Mount McKinley. She next scaled Europe’s 18,510 feet Elbrus in Russia, age 64, before this year moving on to Antarctica’s 16,077 feet Vinson Massif in January following her 65th birthday. Her final climb was the smallest at 7,310 feet Kosciuszko in Australia’s Snowy Mountains, New South Wales. Carol started high-altitude mountaineering at age 50 to cope with grief and anger . Victory: At the 29,035 feet summit of Mount Everest in Nepal, the world's highest mountain . Atop the 19,340 feet Kilimanjaro summit in Africa. Carol tackled Kilimanjaro in preparation for Everest . Amazingly, a series of harsh personal events prompted her to make her world record bid. Carol said: 'When I turned 50, my life fell apart. Within 18 months, I lost a job I loved, I learned the man I loved was involved with someone else, my mother died, and my own health deteriorated. 'To cope with grief, anger, and stress, I went to the Bolivian Andes for high-altitude mountaineering training, summitting seven peaks over 17,000 feet. I found I was a pretty good at it, and felt my best in the mountains. 'It led me to later climb Cho Oyu, the sixth highest mountain in the world in China in 2005. I could see the summit of Everest from the summit and thought: ""I don’t want to die without knowing whether I could climb Everest because I didn’t try.""' In preparation for Everest, she tackled Kilimanjaro, and after reaching the top of Everest set her sights on the 'Seven Summits' - the highest peak on each continent. Carol is in the process of having her record validated and will take the record currently held by Kay LeClaire who completed the feat aged 60. At the 20,360 feet Denali ridge in Alaska. Carol was 63 . Aged 64, Carol climbed the Elbrus summit, the highest peak in Europe at 18,510 feet .

"It was intended as a romantic gesture to welcome his girlfriend home from a month abroad. But a hapless boyfriend’s attempt at setting the mood backfired when candles he placed on the bedroom floor started a blaze which then tore through the house. With champagne chilling and flowers scattered, Amanj Issen used tea lights to spell out his girlfriend’s name and a heart. Scroll down for video . Hapless romantic: Amanj Issen lit his girlfriend's name in tea lights in their bedroom - sparking a huge fire . A hunk of burning love: How the bedroom looked after the fire. His girlfriend was still touched by the gesture . However, as he waited excitedly by the front door for Jana Stankeviciute to return, he heard a loud bang. Mr Issen ran upstairs at their home in Chatham, Kent, only to be beaten back by flames and smoke. The couple’s bedroom was destroyed by the fire on Saturday and the rest of the terraced house suffered smoke damage. Miss Stankeviciute, 24, said she was still touched when Mr Issen showed her photos of the display – and he insisted he would repeat the gesture ‘but maybe just with flowers and chocolates’. The 29-year-old builder yesterday said he was shocked the small candles had led to such extensive damage. Relieved: Mr Issen (left) was left red-faced, but fortunately his girlfriend (right) forgave him . His girlfriend had been visiting family in Latvia and was almost home when he was forced to call 999. ‘I just wanted to surprise Jana as I had not seen her in so long,’ he said. ‘She called me when she was just a couple of minutes away and asked if I could meet her outside the house to help her with her bags. ‘I told her that I was already outside and that I was in big trouble.’ When the builder explained what had happened, his girlfriend simply assured him that she was happy nobody had been hurt. Mr Issen added: ‘The first thing she said to me was ‘I’m just glad you are OK’. Then I showed her the picture of the candles and she aid ""wow"". She really loved it.’ The ‘stressed’ couple are urgently looking for new accommodation as the rented home – which they have lived in for 15 months – has been destroyed by fire and smoke. Mr Issen, who has lived in the UK for 12 years after moving from Kurdistan, said that he hopes the experience will make other people use candles safely. He said: ‘I hope this can save somebody else as I would not want anybody to have to go through this.’ Fireman Paul Nash, who attended the blaze, said tea lights reach ‘extremely high temperatures’, adding: ‘If they’re placed directly on a plastic or combustible surface they quickly melt into the material and can cause a fire. 'We realise that tea lights have become increasingly popular in recent years to create a relaxing or romantic atmosphere in the home. ‘However, many people are still unaware of the dangers that candles and tea lights can present. ‘The flame from a candle can quickly ignite a nearby curtain or clothing if it’s placed too close, or gets knocked over. ‘Candles that are forgotten and left unattended can also cause fires if not placed in proper candle holders. ‘Because tea lights come with a flat metal base many people think it is safe to place them directly onto any surface without a candle holder or a heat resistant saucer.' Mr Issen said: 'I hope this can save somebody else as I would not want anybody to have to go through this' Desperate times: The couple have gone from flowers and champagne to searching for a new home .","Amanj Issen lit girlfriend's name in tea lights in bedroom in Chatham, Kent .

"Monty Panesar has been fined for urinating on two bouncers at a nightclub in Brighton . At his finest, he has been feted as a national treasure. But cricketer Monty Panesar was in disgrace yesterday after a drunken rampage which ended with him urinating over a group of bouncers. The spin bowler had already been thrown out of a nightclub after a group of young women complained that he was bothering them. Panesar, 31, had been in the 14-man England squad for the Test that ended with England retaining the Ashes on Monday, but did not play. He has not been included for the next one, which starts tomorrow. The trouble began in the early hours of Monday when he was ejected from Shooshh on Brighton seafront, which was hosting a Gay Pride event. He is believed to have gone on to the promenade above the club and relieved himself over the doormen below. Witnesses said the bouncers gave chase and cornered the cricketer in a pizza restaurant before putting him in an arm lock and dragging him back to the venue in tears. A source added: ‘The bouncers noticed water falling on them – then realised what was happening. ‘They chased Monty into a pizza shop and he was shouting, “Help! Help!”. ‘He struggled a bit and didn’t want to go. But once they had him locked in, he gave up and walked back with them.’ The married cricketer, who lives in nearby Hove, was detained for 45 minutes before the police arrived and issued him with a £90 spot fine for being drunk and disorderly. The incident happened at Shooshh nightclub on Brighton beach when Panesar was kicked out of the club . Shamed: Monty Panesar is a firm favourite with cricket fans, but his off-field exploits have landed him in trouble . He had been to a vodka bar before moving on to the club. Panesar’s spokesman said he did not dispute being fined for his drunken antics and added that he wanted to express his ‘unreserved apologies for any offence caused by his behaviour’. The bowler, whose full name is Mudhsuden Singh Panesar, is a Sikh who has said he ‘channels the discipline’ of his beliefs into his cricket. But alcohol is prohibited by his religion. Two years ago he was arrested by police after reports of an argument with his wife in a pub car park. He was interviewed before being released without charge. Victorious: Matt Prior, Jonny Bairstow, Graeme Swann, Tim Bresnan, Stuart Broad and Joe Root exit the bar . Aptly named: England chose the 'Australasia' bar in Spinningfields to celebrate the win . Panesar, who has 164 Test wickets, plays for Sussex. County chief executive Zac Toumazi said it had begun a ‘full investigation’. This is not the first time England’s star players have got themselves into trouble with their drunken antics. Following the Ashes series win in 2005, Andrew Flintoff and Kevin Pietersen went on a marathon drinking session before a reception in Downing Street. Flintoff later denied reports that he had urinated in the flowerbeds at No10. Flintoff also infamously had to be rescued from a pedalo in St Lucia after a drinking session during the 2007 Cricket World Cup. In a further embarrassment to the England team, players were photographed smoking after their Ashes triumph. Batsman Joe Root, 22, and bowler Tim Bresnan, 28, went to a nightclub in Manchester hours after retaining the Ashes with a draw. Spinner Graeme Swann, 34, was also seen with cigarette in hand during a celebration that went on until the early hours. Out of hours: Root and Bresnan enjoy a smoke after the third Test at Old Trafford was washed out . The sight of top sportsmen smoking is sure to upset their coaches. Mark Leather, a leading physiotherapist, said: ‘It doesn’t send out a good message at all, quite apart from the health issue.’ However, a spokesman for the England and Wales Cricket Board took a relaxed stance. ‘It’s a lifestyle choice,’ he said.","The spin bowler urinated over nightclub bouncers after being ejected .

"It is commonly thought that age brings wisdom. And this is largely true, it seems – unless you are Japanese. In which case, by the time you are 25, you are likely to be just as wise as your elders, an astonishing new study reveals. Americans, however, are more conventional and develop deep understanding over time, according to research by the University of Waterloo in Ontario, Canada. Wise heads on all shoulders: Japanese have similar levels of measured wisdom at ages 25 and 75 - whereas Americans get wiser as they age, a study shows . In one of the tests, designed to measure five crucial aspects of reasoning,  U.S. citizens’ scores improved by 22 per cent over 50 years. But, in the examination scored out of 100, both 25-year-old and 75-year-old Japanese participants had an average quotient of 51 for intergroup wisdom – the idea of understanding society. With Americans, on the other hand, results from the same tests varied between averages of 45 and 55 between the two age groups. Also, interpersonal wisdom – the understanding of relationships between individuals – the scores of the 225 U.S. participants climbed from 46 to 50. In the case of the 186 Japanese people recruited by lead researcher Igor Grossmann, their scores actually dropped slightly from 53 to 52. The tests also recorded other unexpected results. Given the U.S. reputation of an individualistic society, you might expect its participants’ interpersonal wisdom to be higher than their supposedly more collectivist Japanese counterparts. Yet the study showed that by 75, the Japanese scored higher in the interpersonal wisdom and Americans, in fact, achieved higher results in the intergroup variety. Conventional wisdom: Americans tend to get steadily wiser as they get older . Dr Grossman suggested that perhaps, then, you need individual skills when society is collective, and social ones when it is individualistic. His study, published in Psychological Science and reported in The Economist, recruited Japanese and Americans with a range of different occupations. Assessors scored their responses on the degree to which they discussed what psychologists consider five crucial aspects of wise reasoning. They are ‘willingness to seek opportunities to resolve conflict, willingness to search for compromise, recognition of the limits of personal knowledge, awareness that more than one perspective on a problem can exist and appreciation of the fact that things may get worse before they get better’. Participants were asked to read a series of pretend newspaper articles. Half – designed to test intergroup wisdom - described conflict between groups, such as a debate between residents of an impoverished Pacific island over whether to allow foreign oil companies to operate there following the discovery of petroleum. The other half – used to measure out their interpersonal wisdom - took the form of advice columns that dealt with conflicts between individuals, including siblings, friends and spouses. After reading each article, participants were asked ‘What do you think will happen after that?’ and ‘Why do you think it will happen this way?’ Their responses were recorded and transcribed. Then, to ensure that assessors couldn’t know whose record came from which respondent, age-related information and clues to participants’ nationalities were removed from the texts.","Scientists scored different age groups out of 100 in tests designed to measure five aspects of wisdom .

"Airborne surveys of the Arctic appear to have found a puzzling new source of greenhouse gas - methane seeping directly from the Arctic ocean . A report in Nature Geoscience suggests that as well as huge 'surges' of methane being released by melting permafrost, the gas might be being released from the ocean itself. Methane is a potent greenhouse gas - and this unpredictable effect makes the climate puzzle even more complex. As more glaciers and permafrost melt, the effect could become even MORE severe . 'Uncertainty in the future atmospheric burden of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, represents an important challenge to the development of realistic climate projections,' say the scientists. 'The Arctic is home to large reservoirs of methane, in the form of permafrost soils. Furthermore, methane is produced in the surface ocean and the surface waters of the Arctic Ocean are supersaturated with respect to methane.' Until now, it had been unknown what happened to this oceanic methane. Now it seems that some at least is being released into the atmosphere - causing unknown and unpredictable effects on the environment. 'The fate of this oceanic methane is uncertain,' say the scientists. 'We use airborne observations of methane to assess methane efflux from the remote Arctic Ocean, up to latitudes of 82° north. The methane near the surface of the . ocean is NOT accompanied by carbon monoxide - indicating that it doesn't . come from man-made combustion processes. Far East Siberia: The melting of 'permafrost' under the sea has led to huge releases of methane - far more abrupt and intense than anything on land . 'We estimate that sea–air fluxes are , comparable to emissions seen on the Siberian shelf. We suggest that the surface waters of the Arctic Ocean represent a potentially important source of methane.' 'While working out the past history of climate change is relatively straightforward (especially for the past fifty to one hundred years, for which we have direct measurements), predicting its future is more difficult – and one of the uncertainties is the role of the potent, but less-common greenhouse gas, methane,' said The Register, which reported the research. It's already known that methane is being released into the atmosphere - both from the Siberian permafrost, and, as more recently discovered by survey ships, from the sea bed. A Russian research ship recently made a terrifying discovery - huge plumes of methane bubbles rising to the surface from the seabed. 'We . found more than 100 fountains, some more than a kilometre across,' said . Dr Igor Semiletov, 'These are methane fields on a scale not seen . before. The emissions went directly into the atmosphere.' Earlier . research conducted by Semiletov's team had concluded that the amount of . methane currently coming out of the East Siberian Arctic Shelf is . comparable to the amount coming out of the entire world’s oceans. Now Semiletov thinks that could be an underestimate. The . melting of the arctic shelf is melting 'permafrost' under the sea, . which is releasing methane stored  in the seabed as methane gas. These releases can be larger and more abrupt than any land-based release. The . East Siberian Arctic Shelf is a methane-rich area that encompasses more . than 2 million square kilometers of seafloor in the Arctic Ocean. Methane bubbles trapped in ice: Normally, bubbles from the seabed turn into carbon dioxide before reaching the surface, but the East Siberian Arctic Shelf is so shallow the methane travels directly into the atmosphere . 'Earlier we found torch or . fountain-like structures like this,' Semiletov told the Independent. 'This is the first time that we've found continuous, powerful and . impressive seeping structures, more than 1,000 metres in diameter. It's . amazing.' 'Over a relatively small area, we found more than 100, but over a wider area, there should be thousands of them.' Semiletov's team used seismic and acoustic monitors to detect methane bubbles rising to the surface. Scientists estimate that the methane trapped under the ice shelf could lead to extremely rapid climate change. Current . average methane concentrations in the Arctic average about 1.85 parts . per million, the highest in 400,000 years. Concentrations above the East . Siberian Arctic Shelf are even higher.The . shelf is shallow, 50 meters or less in depth, which means it has been . alternately submerged or above water, depending on sea levels throughout . Earth’s history. During Earth’s coldest periods, it is a frozen arctic coastal plain, and does not release methane. As . the planet warms and sea levels rise, it is inundated with seawater, . which is 12-15 degrees warmer than the average air temperature.In . deep water, methane gas oxidizes into carbon dioxide before it reaches . the surface. In the shallows of the East Siberian Arctic Shelf, methane . simply doesn’t have enough time to oxidize, which means more of it . escapes into the atmosphere. That, combined with the sheer amount of methane in the region, could add a previously uncalculated variable to climate models.","Methane detected near surface of Arctic ocean .

"Police officers who were chasing two illegal immigrants near the US-Mexico border were stunned when they stumbled across a marijuana farm spread across two acres of prime land. The officers had been pursuing the illegal immigrants about 15 miles southwest of Raymondville in Texas. But they got much more than they bargained for when they stumbled across a farm with rows of 8-foot tall marijuana plants just 25 miles from the US-Mexico border on the Texas side. Maintenance: Long irrigated rows that once held 11,500 marijuana plants are spread over two acres near Raymondville, Texas . Willacy County Sheriff Larry Spence said: 'I haven't seen anything like this. I've seen where guys would hollow out a place in the brush in their backyard or something close to their house, just a little bit. 'But this was quite spread out and dense and most of them were already pretty high.' The farm had once been used to grow watermelons and grain. The farm was well tended too and had white pipes and a pump diverting water from a canal which delivered to the 60-foot long rows by carefully excavated trenches. Mark Dawson, Homeland Security Investigations deputy special agent in charge of Laredo and the Rio Grande Valley, was shocked by the quality of the irrigation system. He said he hadn't encountered something like this in his 17 years in the area. Mr Dawson said: 'I guess we shouldn't be surprised by how well it was done . considering it's the Rio Grande Valley and people down there are very . experienced in irrigation and just growing (fruits and vegetables) in . general.' Every year, tons of marijuana crosses the border daily from Mexico and large-scale growing operations are routinely found. Last month, authorities dismantled a massive pot farm in the woods about 70 miles northeast of Houston that yielded 100,000 plants. But such a large crop so close to the border is unheard of, according to authorities. Water: A section of pipe that was used to irrigate a two-acre marijuana farm is hidden in the brush . Derelict: An abandoned milking barn where immigrants were being held is located on the pot farm . Interior: Rotten foam covers the floor of an abandoned milking barn where immigrants had been held near Raymondville, Texas . The 11,500-plant farm was located nearly a mile from a paved road, on an . old dairy farm long left to its own devices. A well-kept citrus grove sat across the dirt . road, and horses browsed in a pasture nearby. The . marijuana was on the back portion of the overgrown parcel and authorities . had to plow a road in just to access it. Adjacent to the field of pot were . small shelters which were carefully camouflaged with branches. Officers found an empty case of instant noodles, scattered egg shells . and a 50-pound bag of fertilizer in them. Nearby, a large black plastic tarp . could be unfurled for shade - most likely for the immigrant pot farm workers. According to police, the . crop's owners would have soon brought in another valuable harvest of a . dozen immigrants if they weren't rumbled by officers who ran straight into the pot farm on August 13. The . night before, a man dialed 911 and claimed that he had been held, . beaten and threatened in a stash house for three weeks. He tried to . lead sheriff's deputies back to the spot, but couldn't find it in the . dark. Authorities returned . in the daylight and found more than they bargained for when they pursued . the immigrants down twisting paths. According to police, the man and other immigrants were likely forced to care for . the marijuana plants, as three weeks is an unusually long time to be . held in a stash house. Three men were arrested on immigrant harboring . charges, but prosecutors dropped cases against two of them earlier this week and . the third waived his preliminary hearing in federal court. Miracle grow: An empty fertilizer bag is left behind at the two-acre pot farm . No one has been charged yet in the pot growing operation. But an investigation is underway by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. However, it is still too early to know why the location was selected. Local farmer Javier . Davila of Edinburg has his own theory. He said that the owners of the pot farm probably used that piece of land because they had more security on the border. He believes that they grew the weed close to the border to able to cross over with it. Mr Davila had not farmed that parcel of his family's land since . 1996. He has another 40 acres next door and has told Border Patrol . before that he suspected immigrants were passing through the land . because he found water bottles, food cans and backpacks. Last . year, the Texas Domestic Cannabis Program, in which local and federal . law enforcement agencies participate, eradicated 147,277 outdoor . cultivated plants in 24 separate seizures.","The land was located near the US Mexico border in Texas and was once used to grow watermelons and grain .

"A mother and her daughter have been awarded more than $15m in compensation after the woman hurt her back as the bus she was traveling in went over a speed bump, it merged today. Maria Francisco, 20, on a shopping trip with her four-year-old daughter Mia, jumped in her seat as the coach hit the traffic speed bump and landed so badly on her back she damaged one of her vertebrae. No-one else was injured in the incident and at first the bus driver refused to believe she was in pain. Eventually she was taken to hospital where she had to have back surgery. Scroll down for video . Shock: Surveillance video captures the sequence of events when Maria Francisco and her child, Mia, were thrown when the driver hit the speed bump too fast when the mother was returning from a shopping trip . Impact: The moment the bus hits the traffic calming device. Maria was thrown against the back of the seat, damaging one of her vertebrae. She can still walk but her lawyers say she is in chronic pain . Spin to win: Critics says the case throws up the irrationality of the US legal system - where such a large figure can be arrived at. The payout included $10m for Maria's emotional pain and suffering on top of $3m for her medical expenses in the past and future . Distress: The huge award also included $1m for Mia's emotional pain caused by witnessing the accident . Now three years later, a jury has ordered the transit company to pay the unemployed mother $14.3m in compensation, including $10m for her emotional pain and suffering. Her daughter was awarded a further $1m for past and future emotional pain caused by witnessing the incident. Ms Francisco, who can still walk, said she was pleased to have received the money as the incident had put 'a tremendous strain on her and her family'. But others criticised the size of the pay out, the biggest in the transit company’s history. Walter Olson, Senior Fellow at the Libertarian think tank the Cato Institute, branded the pay out as 'spin to win'. 'Why $10 million for pain and suffering in this one case?' he said. 'Why . $1 million, paid by taxpayers, to a 4-year-old for seeing her mother . fall off a bus seat? Why not $100,000 and $10,000 instead? 'In . a case like this the American legal system has no real reason for . picking one number rather than the other and no real consistency between . cases. It's just spin to win. Ms Francisco, her daughter and other members of her family were travelling to buy birthday presents at a mall in Richmond, California, when the incident happened in August 2011. The Alameda-Contra Costa bus driven by Dollie Gilmore hit the speed bump at 30mph – twice the limit as it was a school zone – and the impact catapulted Ms Francisco into the air. The jury were shown a video of Ms Francisco flying up and then as she lands hitting her back on the edge of the plastic seat. The film then shows Ms Gilmore stopping the bus and walking down the isle accusing Ms Francisco of faking the pain. She threatens to prosecute her for wasting time. Ms Francisco, whose boyfriend and father-of-her child works in a coffee shop, was taken to hospital where she was found to have suffered a burst fracture of her back. Pain: Maria had to have three surgeries, . including the fusion of a lower vertebra, and medical bills so far . nearing $1 million. It is estimated she will need a further $2.4m worth . of treatment throughout her lifetime . She had to have three surgeries, including the fusion of a lower vertebra, and medical bills so far nearing $1 million. It is estimated she will need a further $2.4m worth of treatment throughout her lifetime. At the time, AC Transit refused to admit any liability until it was time and then offered $2.75m out-of-court settlement. It conceded that Francisco's injuries were its fault but argued that they, along with Ms Francisco's inability to work, were exaggerated. But Ms Francisco, represented by Los Angeles-based firm Panish Shea & Boyle, fought the case and this month a jury at Alameda Superior Court jury awarded her and her daughter $15.3m. The pay out included $10m for her past and future pain and suffering, $3.3m in past and future medical expenses and $800,266 for future loss of earnings. Ms Francisco’s daughter was awarded $1m for past and future emotional distress relating to her witnessing the incident. 'I am happy to have been able to show the jury I was seriously hurt and was unjustly attacked by AC Transit,' she said. 'I pray they do something so this never happens to anyone else as it has been a tremendous strain on me and my family with more to come.' Ms Francisco is able to walk but says the injury leaves her in constant pain and that the condition will get worse in the future. It has also affected her sex life and she is unlikely to have more children. Brian Panish, her leading attorney, defended the pay out. 'She wasn’t looking for this to happen,' he said. 'She has chronic pain for life. She has a fused spine and she is going to need to have future surgeries. 'It has severely damaged her quality of life and it is only going to get worse. She can walk but she struggles to bend and stoop. 'It is going to be hard for her to get a job. Rather than accepting responsibility for its negligence, AC Transit instead chose to challenge Ms Francisco’s credibility. That tactic didn’t work, and the jury did the right thing with this verdict.' Life sentence: Maria's lawyer said she has a fused spine and she is going to need to have future surgeries. It has severely damaged her quality of life. She can walk but she struggles to bend and stoop' Fellow attorney Spencer Lucas added: 'This verdict will ensure that Ms Francisco is able to get the long term treatment that she needs and will be able to take care of herself and her daughter. 'That is what this case was about.' Meanwhile, Mr Olson added: 'What I can say is this: no rational system would give out this much money for every incident like this, even accepting the plaintiff's claims'. AC Transit spokesman Clarence Johnson said it was still looking over the details of the pay out. 'We are still mulling over the verdict as it were and deciding what the steps may be,' he said. 'We have no comment in the meantime.' It is not the first time the law firm Panish Shea & Boyle has obtained big pay outs. In 2011, it obtained a $10.5m settlement against AC Transit when a bus knocked a woman over on a crossing. She now has to walk with a cane. Crazy: Walter Olsen, of the Cato Institute, said: 'What I can say is this: no rational . system would give out this much money for every incident like this, even . accepting the plaintiff's claims' In 2005, it obtained a $27.3m verdict against the City and County of San Francisco after a four-year-old girl was crushed to death against a wall following a crash between a municipal truck and two cars. This was the largest personal injury verdict ever against the City and County of San Francisco.","Video shows the moment Maria Francsicso, 20, is thrown in air when bus hits speed bump while on shopping trip with daughter, Mia, 4 .

"A man in Pennsylvania has adopted his partner of 44 years to circumvent high property taxes that would be imposed on either of the men if the other dies. John, 65, and his partner Gregory*, 75, made the decision to become father and son to avoid a 15 per cent tax on any property and assets willed to one if the other should die - a much higher tax than married spouses or family members are required to pay. The state of Pennsylvania, where the men reside, recognizes marriage as being only between a man and a woman and has no provision for civil unions at this time. Penn pals: John (pictured) met his partner Gregory in Pennsylvania 44 years ago, but the couple has never been able to legally marry in the state . 'If we just live together and Gregory willed me his assets and property and anything else, I would be liable for a 15 per cent tax on the value of the estate,' John told ABC News. 'By adoption, that decreases to 4 per cent. It's a huge difference.' It was decided that John, the younger of the couple, should be the adoptive father, since Gregory's father is still alive at 95. 'I had panic attacks about a sibling swooping down if Gregory predeceased me,' John said. 'A couple of siblings are homophobic and I thought, ""We better get our ducks in a row.""' The couple began putting their affairs in order. 'I made all my end-of-life arrangements,' said John. 'I want to be cremated. With my Irish-Italian family, there would have been a four-day viewing and a Catholic mass and I don't want to put Gregory through that.' In the absence of hope that . Pennsylvania would legalize gay marriage in their lifetime, John and . Gregory took the decision to adopt to protect themselves from high . taxes. 'We didn't have . the confidence that same-sex marriage would ever be approved in the . Commonwealth [of Pennsylvania],' John told ABC News. Rights: Despite the recent ruling against Proposition 8 in California, most states still do not allow gay marriage, including Pennsylvania . The idea of adoption as a way to have their relationship legally recognized was suggested to the couple by a close friend, Nino, who faced a similar dilemma. In the event of Nino's death, his partner would not be able to afford the taxes on assets left to him and 'would lose their home and be homeless,' John said. It's just one of the financial issues gay couples face in places where their relationships aren't legally recognized. Other issues include rules regarding state and federal estate laws, inheritance laws, joint state and federal tax filing restrictions, health insurance tax restrictions, and problems with social security benefits. John and Gregory met at a gay bar in Pittsburgh. Though their relationship hasn't always been acceptable to their respective families, the couple has been together for 44 years. '[My family] was very Irish-Italian Catholic and made me feel guilty about sex preferences,' John told ABC News. Desperate measures: Adoption was the only way for John and Gregory to ensure their financial security for the future . 'Gregory was very closeted and when his parents would come to visit - they had a habit of dropping in - I would have to run to the bedroom and make sure the beds were pushed apart and put a nightstand between them.' In April, Philadelphia state House Representative Mark Cohen proposed legislation legalizing civil unions. This would mean that any couple joined in a civil union would enjoy the same legal rights as married couples. Cohen said in a press release that civil unions are a 'middle-of-the-road compromise position between constitutionally banning and permitting gay marriages.' Cohen previously attempted to introduce civil union legislation in 2011, but it died in committee. The current legislation is pending. A Franklin & Marshall College poll in May found that 54 per cent of Pennsylvanians support same sex marriage, while 41 per cent are opposed. Small steps: People in California are celebrating the Supreme Court's decision that the Defense of Marriage Act is unconstitutional, but in Pennsylvania, John had to adopt Gregory to gain the same legal rights as a married couple . Before their day in court, the couple worried that their request for John to adopt Gregory would be denied. Their home 'is in the conservative Bible Belt,' John told ABC News. 'What if the judge says no?' The couple's lawyer told the couple that they wouldn't be required to tell the judge their sexual orientation or the nature of their relationship, but John worried the judge would ask, and he'd have to tell the truth under oath. The judge, as it happened, did ask. 'He said, ""I am really curious, why are you adopting [Gregory]?""' 'I said, ""Because it's our only legal option to protect ourselves from Pennsylvania's inheritance taxes,"" said John. 'He got it immediately.' After signing the papers, the judge turned to John and said, 'Congratulations, it's a boy.' *Gregory's first name has been changed; surnames not given .","John, 65, adopted his partner of 44 years, Gregory, 73, in Pennsylvania to avoid high inheritance taxes should either of them die .

The pound-for-pound No 1, fresh from his victory in his rematch with Marcos Maidana last month, was in Brixton on Tuesday night for a trim. But he was accosted by a female customer who told him she had no idea who he was. Floyd Mayweather was shocked when a woman told him she didn't know who he was . Mayweather beat Marcos Maidana for a second time in their rematch in Las Vegas last month . Mayweather posted this picture on Twitter of him lying in bed with piles of money . 'I don't know you,' she said in a video posted on SpiffTV. 'What's the big deal? I just don't watch boxing. I know about Mike Tyson.' Mayweather, who was accompanied by several members of 'The Money Team', appeared stunned and retorted: 'You know what? I need to Google you!' But the woman refuses to back down, saying: 'I just want to know what the biggest fight you ever fight is? 'I like big fights, I like exciting fights,' she says. 'If it's not big, I don't watch it.' At this point, one of Mayweather's team interjects: 'He's the biggest in the world.' The woman in the barbers said she knew who Mike Tyson (right) was and that she watched big fights .

"Police forces across the UK were inundated with calls last night after a large fireball, thought to be a meteor, was spotted in the sky. Reports of a 'bright light' and an 'orange glow' were received by police across Scotland and the north of England at about 9.40pm yesterday. Some people are believed to have phoned the police fearing a plane had crashed. A spectacular shot of the meteor taken by amateur astronomer Graeme Whipps in northern Scotland . The Met Office tweeted: 'Hi all, for anyone seeing something in the night sky, we believe it was a meteorite.' The Kielder Observatory also reported the sighting of a 'huge fireball' travelling from north to south over Northumberland. The Observatory posted on Twitter: 'Of 30 years observing the sky, fireball best thing I have ever seen period.' Meteors are particles from space that . burn up in a streak of light as they enter the Earth's atmosphere, . whereas meteorites are larger objects that survive the trip and reach . the surface of the Earth. Dr David Whitehouse, an author and . astronomer, said: 'Judging by its brightness, it may have have been . large enough to survive and hit the ground but until people work out its . trajectory we won't have any idea where it might have come down.' Stargazing: The shooting star photographed over Kirkby photographed by Jake Ross . Star bright: Close up of meteor taken by Graeme Whipps who took this photo when he was studying the  aurora . Dr Whitehouse said the object was about the size of a fist and was probably the debris of a planet that never properly formed. 'It's a chunk of rock that's probably . come from somewhere between Mars and Jupiter has been in space for . thousands of millions of years. 'There are tens of thousands of bits . of rock and grains of sand orbiting between Mars and Jupiter. Some of it . comes out of that orbit and some of it hits the Earth.' Starstruck: The meteor, visible in the top right hand corner of this image as an elongated white streak, was seen in the skies across the north of England and was spotted as far south as Peterborough . Starburst: In this video footage the meteor arrives at the top left of the screen . Amateur astronomer, Graeme Whipps, spotted the bright light while taking photos of the aurora in Chapel of Garioch near Aberdeen. Graeme, 48, who works as a meteorologist, captured the image with a Canon 40D, 15 second exposure. He said: 'It looked like it was moving south or southwest, whilst brightening.' He is one of a number of people across Britain who saw a meteor across the north of England and Scotland. Mike Ridley, an amateur photographer, of . Durham City, managed to capture a stunning image of the meteorite . against the backdrop of the 'Global Rainbow' - a laser display by artist . Yvette Mattern installed in Whitley Bay to celebrate the London 2012 . Cultural Olympiad in the north-east of England. Mr Ridley, 49, a Quality Assurance . Inspector for Nissan in Washington Tyne and Wear, said: 'I was standing . with my friend when we saw a bright light in the sky moving really fast. 'I was there to photograph the laser show in Whitley Bay, but the light caught my eye so I turned the camera around. 'At . first I thought it was a firework, then my friend said he thought it . was a meteor or comet - I caught the white light and an orange glowing . tail in my picture. Amazing: The stunning meteor is captured shooting across the sky behind a laser show in Whitley Bay, North Tyneside. The shot was taken by amateur photographer Mike Ridley using time-lapse photography . 'I managed to capture the trail it left because I took my photo with a long exposure. 'The light was heading north to south. It lasted thirty seconds or more, It was really spectacular. We waited around to see if we would see anything else, but it was over very quickly.' Fire up: The meteor sparked a huge reaction on social networking sites including Twitter as users posted their own images and video . A spokesman for Strathclyde Police . said the force had been 'inundated' with calls about a bright object in . the sky across the west of Scotland. In Durham, calls started to come in at about 9.45pm to its constabulary from concerned members of public . who had seen a 'bright light or a fire in the sky' and believed it may . have been incidents involving an aircraft.

"White House Press Secretary Jay Carney endured a sustained grilling from reporters on Wednesday as he struggled to explain an email showing the White House's involvement in spinning a false account of why four Americans died in Benghazi, Libya less than two months before the 2012 presidential election. The email, written by Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes, described a 'prep call' with then-UN Ambassador Susan Rice which took place four days after the September 11, 2012 terror attack, and less than a day before she was to be a guest on five different Sunday morning political talk shows. During the initial weeks after the attack, the White House and congressional Democrats told the public that Muslim protesters, upset over a crude American-produced YouTube video mocking Islam, demonstrated outside U.S. diplomatic facilities in Benghazi before channeling their anger toward arson and artillery. Rhodes informed the West Wing communications team – including Carney – that one 'goal' of the Sept. 15, 2012 call would be to prepare Rice 'to ​underscore that these protests are rooted in an Internet video, and not a broader failure or policy.' Scroll down for video . White House Press Secretary Jay Carney put on a defensive sparring clinic Wednesday, trying in vain to protect the Obama administration from revelations contained in a newly released internal email dating from the first days after the Benghazi terror attack . Palace intrigue: Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes (R) set up a pre-TV-show 'prep call' for then-UN Ambassador Susan Rice (L), outlining a communications strategy that now suggests the White House purposely misled the nation into thinking a crude YouTube video incited the deadly Benghazi terror attack . Scene of the crime: U.S. consular facilities inside the Benghazi compound were torched the night of September 11, 2012, and four U.S. personnel including Ambassador Chris Stevens lost their lives . Carney insisted Wednesday during a White House press briefing that Rhodes' email 'was explicitly not about Benghazi. It was about the overall situation in the region, the Muslim world, where you saw protests outside of embassy facilities across the region, including in Cairo, Sana’a, Khartoum and Tunis.' But Wednesday night the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform sent MailOnline a cover letter showing that on April 17, the U.S. Department of State provided committee staff with copies of a batch of documents in response to a subpoena for Benghazi-related materials. The Rhodes email was among them, although committee staff told MailOnline that most of it was redacted, or blacked-out. 'As part of the Department’s ongoing document production we are providing an additional set of documents in connection with the Committee’s investigation into the attacks on the U.S. Special Mission in Benghazi,' State Department Assistant Secretary for Legislative Affairs Julia Frifield wrote. 'This production consists of documents responsive to the Committee’s subpoena of August 1, 2013.' The Rhodes email, declared 'classified' by the White House prior to the release of related materials in May 2013, would likely have remained out of public view but for a Freedom Of Information Act lawsuit filed against the State Department by Judicial Watch, a center-right watchdog group. Its later pages also specifically refer to Benghazi. Rhodes wrote that Rice needed to be prepared to answer the question: 'What's your response to the Independent story that says we have intelligence 48 hours in advance of the Benghazi attack that was ignored?' A scripted answer provided for the 'prep call' read: 'We are not aware of any actionable intelligence indicating that an attack on the U.S. Mission in Benghazi was planned or imminent. The currently available information suggests that the demonstrations in Benghazi were spontaneously inspired by the protests at the U.S. Embassy in Cairo.' Utah Republican Rep. Jason Chaffetz told former CBS investigative reporter Sharyl Attkisson that the White House seems to have tried to keep the Rhodes email out of public view by declaring it 'classified' out of convenience. 'They retroactively changed the classification,' Chaffetz said. 'That was an unclassified document and they changed it to classified.' Judicial Watch communications director mocked the White House press secretary on Wednesday evening for downplaying the significance of the documents her group surfaced. 'The Benghazi documents we released were produced by a LAWSUIT,' she emphasized in a statement to MailOnline. 'That Carney would imply that the State Department gave us some random document doesn't pass the giggle test.' U.S. Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens perished in the terror attack, which included militants from the al-Qaeda-linked group Ansar al-Shariah . Rhodes, who often briefs reporters on conference calls and it typically referred to vaguely as a 'senior White House official,' wrote an email days after the Benghazi attack that Republicans now see as a smoking gun . 'Now we know the Obama White House's chief concern about the Benghazi attack was making sure that President Obama looked good,' Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton said Wednesday. 'And these documents undermine the Obama administration’s narrative that it thought the Benghazi attack had something to do with protests or an Internet video. Given the explosive material in these documents, it is no surprise that we had to go to federal court to pry them loose from the Obama State Department.' Republican National Committee chair Reince Priebus mocked the Obama administration for what now appears a ham-fisted attempt to keep sensational details about its response to a deadly terror attack out of public view. 'If the White House felt this talking points memo was classified, what else don't we know about Benghazi and is all of this stonewalling just to protect Hillary?' he jabbed. President Obama stood for re-election eight weeks to the day after the Benghazi attack, and ultimately shifted gears to emphasize that the attack was premeditated, highly organized, ruthless and coordinated by al-Qaeda-affiliated Islamist militants. The question of who inserted the video, titled 'Innocence of Muslims,' into his administration's official narrative about the murderous chaos that ensued has been a political football since Rice told those five TV audiences that it was the lit match that set off a deadly powder keg. 'Based on the best information we have to date,' she told CBS's 'Face the Nation' in one example, 'what our assessment is as of the present is in fact what began spontaneously in Benghazi as a reaction to what had transpired some hours earlier in Cairo where, of course, as you know, there was a violent protest outside of our embassy – sparked by this hateful video.' History, Obama-style: To this day news bureaus encounter captions on photos like this one, showing the Benghazi diplomatic station in mid-conflagration, referring to the event as the outgrowth of a protest that never happened . Not true: Susan Rice told CBS viewers five days after the terror attack that 'our assessment is' that the Benghazi attack 'began spontaneously' after a 'violent protest [was] sparked by this hateful video' elsewhere in the Muslim world . South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham told reporters Wednesday that the emails Judicial Watch released 'show that Benghazi, in the eyes of the White House, was a political problem for re-election and they approached it from that point of view.' The email setting Rice's talk-show agenda, he added, 'clearly shows that Ben Rhodes was trying to be a political operative rather than a national security spokesman.' On TV that Sunday, Rice was working from a series of talking points that Democrats in Congress had requested for their own use in media interviews. That document's initial draft, prepared by the CIA, declared that 'we do know that Islamic extremists with ties to al-Qaeda participated in the attack.' By the time the talking points filtered down to Rice, however, that notice was gone – along with other declarations about terror threats in Benghazi during the previous months, including some from an al-Qaeda-affiliated group called Ansar al-Shariah. Many of those edits, it emerged later, were made at the State Department, with then-spokeswoman Victoria Nuland objecting just days after the attacks in an email that the administration shouldn't name specific terror groups because 'we don't want to prejudice the investigation.' Carney assured reporters in November 2012 that 'the White House and the State Department have made clear that the single adjustment that was made to those talking points by either of those two institutions were changing the word ""consulate"" to ""diplomatic facility"" because ""consulate"" was inaccurate.' Sen. Graham told Attkisson that 'the political shop at the White House took over early on. They understood it was a terrorist attack, that they had a political problem, and were going to handle it politically.' 'They weren't going to entertain anything other than what they wanted the public to hear.' Graham co-signed a letter Monday with fellow Republicans Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire and John McCain of Arizona, asking the House Foreign Affairs and Senate Foreign Relations committees to force Obama administration figures to explain whether State Department or White House personnel were involved in briefing Rice. They referred former deputy CIA director Michael Morell, who testified this year that Rice linked the YouTube video to the attacks despite the CIA never making that connection in its analysis. 'How could former Ambassador to the United . Nations Susan Rice, during the five Sunday talk shows on September 16, . 2012, claim that the attacks on our compounds were caused by a hateful . video,' the senators wrote, 'when Mr. Morell testified that the CIA never mentioned the video as . a causal factor?'","Ben Rhodes, the president's deputy national security adviser, wrote three days after the terror attack about coaching then-UN Ambassador Susan Rice for upcoming TV appearances .
Rice falsely told five different Sunday talk-show audiences that the devastation in Benghazi was the result of anti-America protests that spiraled out of control .
Demonstrations in other Middle East cities that week were reportedly sparked by a crude anti-Islam video, which Rice, Obama and Hillary Clinton all blamed for Benghazi .
Rhodes' email said that a prep session with Rice would prepare her 'to underscore that these protests are rooted in an Internet video, and not a broader failure of policy'
Jay Carney insisted that Rhodes was writing generally about protests in the Muslim world, and that his email 'was explicitly not about Benghazi'
But the State Department included the same document in a batch of materials it released to a congressional committee on April 17, writing that it was 'responsive' to its subpoena for Benghazi-related files ."

"It took 12 minutes before a section of Newcastle’s fans started their weekly invitation to Alan Pardew to seek alternative employment. How much leeway, if any, can be bought with a point at the Liberty Stadium remains to be seen. Certainly, the prognosis looks better, a draw coming against a backdrop of 19 points taken from the previous 26 games. More than that, there was the evidence here of a fighting spirit, manifested in the goals of Senegal’s Papiss Cisse, who twice pulled Newcastle level in a game they often looked like losing but, ultimately, might have won. VIDEO Scroll down to watch post-match reaction from a disappointed Garry Monk and a defiant Alan Pardew . Papiss Cisse celebrates one of his two goals for Newcastle against Swansea at the Liberty Stadium . Swansea (4-2-3-1): Fabianski 5.5; Richards 6, Fernandez 5.5, Williams 6, Taylor 6; Ki 7, Shelvey 6.5; Dyer 6.5 (Montero 85), Sigurdsson 7.5 (Emnes 85), Routledge 7.5; Bony 7 .

Booked: Coloccini, Sissoko, Janmaat . Manager: Alan Pardew 6 . Referee: Lee Mason 6 . Att: 20,622 . MOM: Papiss Cisse . So that is progress and, most likely, a stay of execution for a manager who could desperately use some popularity points. Not that you would know it, with his frostiness towards elements of the media continuing after the game. ‘The players will be more confident coming out of the game than they were coming in,’ Pardew said, with extra praise reserved for recalled striker Cisse, who had his first start of the season and took his tally to four goals. ‘Papiss had a tough season [in 2013-14] with a lot of injuries and Loic Remy took his place. He looks like the rest has done him good. The first finish was brilliant and the second was instinct. He is in a good place at the moment.’ Not everyone at the club, particularly Pardew, can say that. Swansea manager Garry Monk has certainly been in a better mood than he was after this match. His side gave away the lead on two occasions, after Wilfried Bony and Wayne Routledge had scored. He was also unhappy with the refereeing of Lee Mason. He said: ‘It is two points dropped for us. The goals we conceded were poor. A lack of concentration really has cost us dearly. ‘After the second goal, possession became too easy for Newcastle. In those situations you have to learn to keep your concentration, don’t get sloppy. We should have won by a couple of goals.’ The refereeing, in particular, agitated him, coming days after he complained that sides are allowed to get away with too much by disrupting his passing side with fouls. ‘I don’t know what else I can say,’ Monk said. ‘It has gone unheard. They had 10, 13, 14 fouls before anything [a yellow card] happened.’ For Pardew, there was the vindication of a brave selection succeeding. He dropped two summer signings in Remy Cabella and Emmanuel Riviere, who cost a combined £18 million and have, as yet, failed to deliver. In came Gabriel Obertan and Cisse and they played well for the team. For a time, theirs was the only contribution worth cheering. Indeed, the game was less than 10 minutes old when owner Mike Ashley was the subject of frustrated fans’ attention with a chant of ‘you fat Cockney b******, get out of our club’. Supporters then dished out similar treatment to Pardew a couple of minutes later. By then, Cheick Tiote had already played a pass straight into touch.

Data courtesy of the EA SPORTS Player Performance Index, the Official Player Rating Index of the Barclays Premier League . ‘Pardew for England,’ sang the Swansea fans. It can be a cruel game sometimes. For Pardew, that extended to going one down just moments after Newcastle’s first promising attack. Obertan had fired wide in the 17th minute following some impressive pressing, but in the very next phase Swansea were ahead after a white blur of one-touch passing. Ki Sung-yueng played through the middle, Bony laid off for Gylfi Sigurdsson and the Iceland forward’s pass was perfect. Bony went through and scored his first of the season, a staggering statistic in light of his 25 goals last time round. Newcastle would have been two down in the 38th minute had it not been for goalkeeper Tim Krul’s agility. Routledge had out-paced Daryl Janmaat on the left and play switched to Nathan Dyer on the right. There was a solid argument to be made for either of Swansea’s wingers to get an England call earlier in the week and Dyer strengthened it by darting past Paul Dummett. Dyer’s low cross was met on the volley by Bony, but Krul reacted swiftly to tip the shot wide. Against such Swansea momentum, Newcastle levelled two minutes before half-time. Poetically, it was the two men Pardew drafted in who did the damage. Obertan found space on the right and hit a low cross to the near post. Cisse got away from Ashley Williams and glanced a finish across keeper Lukasz Fabianski. It was Newcastle’s first away goal in 763 minutes. Wayne Routledge beats Krul to reclaim the lead for Swansea at the Liberty Stadium . Cisse scores is second equaliser of the match to bring Newcastle level at 2-2 . Did it inspire a significant improvement? Jack Colback kicked straight into touch from the kick-off and within five minutes Swansea were ahead again. Jonjo Shelvey, who has been called up by England, took possession on the left and squared to Sigurdsson. The forward held off a weak challenge from Moussa Sissoko and slotted a pass to Routledge, whose chipped goal was delightful. Krul then denied Bony, his save perhaps even better than that in the first half, and once more it was followed by a Cisse equaliser. Sammy Ameobi, on as a substitute, made it with a 75th-minute cross from the right and Cisse found space between Jazz Richards and Williams to poke the ball over the line. It was a poor goal to concede, but it was a blessing for Pardew. Cisse got on the end of Sammy Ameobi's cross and squeezes his shot under keeper Lukasz Fabianski .

"He denies all charges against him and the case continues . Kenneth Ngobele, a nurse from Basildon Hospital is accused of having sex with a patient . A nurse had sex with a patient after romancing her over a meal at a tapas restaurant while she was being treated for a mental breakdown, a tribunal has today heard. Kenneth Ngobele quizzed the woman, a manic depressive, about her sexual history and her attitude to Nigerian men, it is alleged. Ngobele later took the woman to a La Tasca restaurant and told her 'You know I want to f*** you', the Nursing and Midwifery Council was told. 'Patient A' met Ngobele while she was being treated at Basildon Hospital in Essex following a mental breakdown. The vulnerable woman initially kept the alleged affair secret but eventually revealed all to health workers at a clinic. Ngobele was working as a deputy charge nurse at the time of the allegations in 2009. It is claimed he met up with the woman after she was discharged from the hospital and twice visited her home for sex. He also threatened to release confidential information about the woman to her employer unless she met with him, the panel heard. In a statement, Patient A said: 'Kenneth questioned my quite heavily about my sexuality, the number of sexual partners I had had, whether they were relationships, whether I had introduced them to friends and family or whether they were one-night stands. 'As we were walking, he asked me what kind of men I liked, questioned my sexual preferences and was being quite flirty. 'I was in a really bad way and suicidal at the time. 'My stay at the hospital was two nights. It looked to me as if Kenneth was avoiding work as much as possible and then trying to come onto me. 'Kenneth came into the female-only television room to come and sit with me. 'Kenneth said, ""I'm a nurse, I can go anywhere"". 'Kenneth stated that he had been studying me and he had noticed that I interacted with men very well. 'I remember feeling really freaked out by that statement.' Just as Patient A was due to be discharged, Ngobele told her she would no longer be his patient and they could meet safely, she claims.He also wrote down his phone number in her diary. Kenneth Ngobele quizzed the woman about her sexual history and her attitude to Nigerian men, it is alleged. Ngobele later took the woman to a La Tasca restaurant and told her 'You know I want to f*** you', the Nursing and Midwifery Council (pictured) was told . 'He was staring at my body in a really sexual way,' added Patient A. 'Kenneth said that as soon as I get out, he wanted me to text him.' When they met up for the first time, Patient A said she was feeling 'really manic'. 'One way it expresses itself is I become promiscuous', she explained.'I knew that sex was on the cards.' Describing their meeting at La Tasca on June 14, she said: 'Kenneth paid for everything. I remember him saying, ""You owe me"" and said it in a sexually aggressive way. 'As soon as the door closed, it became really aggressive.' The pair then met up again on July 7 and again had sex but Patient A then began refusing to answer his calls. During an internal interview with trust bosses, Ngobele at first admitted some of the allegations. But soon 'his assertions began to shift, with him creating an alternative scenario', the panel was told. Tope Adeyemi, for the NMC, said: 'It is submitted that all of the registrant's conduct was sexually motivated and constitutes a gross breach of his privileged position.' Ngobele was sacked following the investigation. He denies all the charges he faces at the NMC hearing. If found guilty of misconduct he could be kicked out of the profession. The hearing continues.

"A father of four, who applied for a one-way-ticket to live on Mars, could be looking at a divorce as a result of his extraterrestrial ambition. Ken Sullivan made it the next stage of the Mars One project, which could potentially see him making a new life on Mars – but his wife and children are not happy about the news. Mr Sullivan, who lives in Utah, is among the 1,058 applicants selected so far who could colonise the red planet and never return to their families and friends on Earth. Ken Sullivan made it the next stage of the Mars One project, which could potentially see him making a new life on Mars, but his wife and children are not happy about the news. He is pictured  with his family (left to right: Kaitlyn 12, Kaunner 3 and Tana 6 months. His oldest daughter Jocelyn 13, is not pictured . While the 38-year-old might be excited about his potential ticket to an extraterrestrial life, his wife of five-and-a-half years, Becky, is contemplating getting a divorce. ‘The question is do we get divorced now or get divorced later. If I stand in the way of his dreams and passions, then we get divorced now, so I have to be supportive,’ she told The Salt Lake Tribune. If he did make the final cut to live on Mars, Mr Sullivan would also have to leave behind his four children, who range in age from just six months to 13-years-old. His 12-year-old daughter Kaitlyn is upset at the idea she might never see her father in person again and said that she would miss him, yet her older sister Jocelyn told the newspaper: ‘If he wants to go to Mars, he should go to Mars.’ Colony: The mission will aim to set up a permanent manned outpost on the Red Planet which could later expand and the first 24 participants will die on Mars . The Mars One project needs to raise $400,000 (£245,000) by 25 January to fund its plans. Once enough funding has been raised, the Dutch firm plans to launch a supply mission to land on Mars as soon as October 2016. A ‘settlement rover’ will then land in 2018. The landing systems will be tested eight times before they are used to transport humans - a move that Mars One said will make the trips ‘much safer than moon missions’. The group said it aims to have a human settlement on Mars within a decade. Journey time to Mars, which is approximately 40 million miles away depending on its position in orbit, would be around 200 days. The £4bn project, founded in 2010 by engineer Bas Lansdorp, is set to recoup its costs by selling the broadcasting rights to the mission - by comparison, Nasa's rover Curiosity cost £1.8 billion. The older children have already had a long-distance relationship with their father who worked as a contractor in Iraq fixing helicopters. The first Mars One mission is set for 2024, by which time his older children will have grown up, but his younger daughters will still need their father. Mr Sullivan hopes that the mission is delayed so that his youngest daughter Tana will be around 18-years-old. ‘I just hope the family will be able to forgive me down the road,’ he said. ‘Hopefully there isn’t too much hatred of my being selfish in pursuing a dream that isn’t theirs.’ There . is only a slim chance of Mr Sullivan being selected to live on Mars, as . just 24 people will be chosen, but his wife is sad that he did not ask . her opinion before completing the application form and said that she . could not contemplate leaving her children. However, . Mr Sullivan says he loves his family more than Mars, but also wants to . be the first to live on the Red Planet and make a name for himself. He . admits that he will be relieved if he is not selected as he will not . have to make the difficult decision, but also said he will be . disappointed if he is not among the chosen 24.

"Everton defender John Stones is a natural leader and a future captain, according to manager Roberto Martinez, who believes the youngster is learning from some of the best at Goodison Park. The 20-year-old has started five of the last six matches, missing only the Capital One Cup defeat at Swansea in that time, and is developing a maturity beyond his years. He had an excellent game in last weekend's Merseyside derby and faces as tough a test on Sunday as Everton head to Old Trafford looking to produce a repeat of their landmark win at Manchester United last season. John Stones is a natural leader and future Everton captain, according to Toffees boss Roberto Martinez . 'John Stones has been in terrific form ever since he played his first (pre-season) friendly in the USA,' said Martinez. 'Since then he has been growing as a footballer and he is a complete centre-half. 'In the modern game you need centre halves who are as good in defensive duties as they are exposing one versus one situations and being good on the ball. Stones, pictured at Anfield in the Merseyside derby, has impressed since joining Everton from Barnsley . 'John has gone to the next level this season. He has shown he is ready for any challenge. 'Every time he has played for England he has done well and he is growing at club level every game. 'John is really well rounded but the focus is on what he can do at Everton - it is not up to me to measure his possibilities with the national team. 'He is a leader. He is born with that quality. He has real high standards in everything he does and for a young man he has always got the right approach on a daily basis. 'In my eyes he is a potential captain and leader, someone very close to Phil Jagielka and Gareth Barry. 'He has a good core to learn from - Jagielka, Sylvain Distin and Antolin Alcaraz and it has been beneficial having Tim Howard behind him. 'Clearly in the last few weeks he has earned his place and performances have shown that.' Everton travel to Old Trafford after a long trip to southern Russia in the Europa League in midweek but they will not use that as an excuse. Last season they recorded their first league win at United since 1992, on the way to doing the double over the Red Devils, but Martinez expects a tougher task this time around. Stones celebrates Phil Jagielka's derby day equaliser with manager Martinez on the Anfield touchline . 'To be able to win was a real mental barrier which we had to break down and it was a real feeling of satisfaction and dose of confidence,' he said of last year's performance. 'This season it is completely different. We need to go there again and face a completely different side and way of playing and be able to adapt to that. 'The challenge is to go there and be ourselves and try to win the game.'","John Stones is a future captain, according to manager Roberto Martinez .

"Paul Scholes has questioned Roy Hodgson's decision to deploy Jack Wilshere as a holding midfielder, insisting the Arsenal star is an 'attacking' player who 'is stuck between two roles' at the moment. Wilshere was utilised in front of the back four for the Three Lions against Switzerland and Scholes feels that his talent is being misused and wasted due to both Hodgson and Arsene Wenger constantly switching the 22-year-old's role in the side. Writing in his column in The Independent, former Manchester United and Three Lions midfielder Scholes said: 'I still have my concerns about the diamond formation in midfield (for England) and most of all about Jack Wilshere’s role in it. New role: Paul Scholes does not believe Jack Wilshere (right) should be deployed as a holding midfielder . Opinionated: Scholes (pictured) believes that Jack Wilshere's best role is as an 'attacking midfielder' Strong: Wilshere has always been a player who can dive into a tackle, but can improve that part of his game . 'Don’t get me wrong, Jack has great ability and at some point I hope that he will be in a position to score goals and to create them. 'But I just do not believe that playing in front of the back four, on his own, suits him.' The 11-time Premier League winner also made comparisons between Wilshere and himself, believing both to be 'attacking' midfielders by nature. Scholes claims Wilshere is being asked to play in an undefined role, almost a middle-ground between attacking and defensive midfield. He continued: 'Wilshere is an attacking midfielder, as I was for most of my career. He is not a defensive midfielder and I feel at the moment he is stuck between the two roles. He is being asked to control the play from a deep position, which does not play to his strengths.' Attributes: Arsene Wenger believes his midfield man has the abilities to play further back .

"As Louis van Gaal's Manchester United reign began with a dispiriting 2-1 home defeat by Swansea City, the disintegration of his team may have taken him by surprise. While United's players have produced vibrant and intense performances in pre-season, this was a return to the sluggish, timid and disappointing performances of last season. Van Gaal has spent the last month training him players intensively in the 3-5-2 formation but that system was shelved after just 45 minutes amid a spate of injuries and an unconvincing first half showing. Here, Sportsmail analyses why Van Gaal's favoured philosophy came up short and how the Dutchman can correct United's ills... VIDEO Scroll down to watchVan Gaal: Our confidence will be smashed down with result . Head in hands: Manchester United slipped up to a 2-1 defeat to Swansea at Old Trafford on Saturday . Failed: Louis van Gaal tinkered with many systems but couldn't turn United's fortunes around . Why didn't the 3-5-2 work? Louis van Gaal will be reluctant to use injuries as an excuse but clearly United were handicapped by several of their most important players being out injured. Antonio Valencia, Jonny Evans, Luke Shaw, Michael Carrick and Robin van Persie would all have walked into the starting line-up and offered a more formidable threat. Throughout the team, United players looked uncomfortable, short of purpose and it resulted in a sluggish and flat performance. Holes emerged everywhere. Phil Jones appeared uneasy as part of the defensive three while Darren Fletcher and Ander Herrera failed to provide a shield to the defence, leaving their team-mates brutally exposed for Swansea's opening goal.  Nothing, however, should be taken away from Swansea, who made 28 passes in the lead up to Ki's superbly taken strike. Perhaps the biggest concern for Van Gaal will have been the anonymity of Juan Mata. If this system is partially devised to liberate the Spaniard in his favoured central position, then Van Gaal needs Mata to shine. Wayne Rooney was similarly ineffective in in the first-half, while Javier Hernandez was substituted at half-time. In truth, though, the Mexican is a penalty-box forward and relies on service from his team-mates. He was the one picked out by Van Gaal but Hernandez was let down by those behind him. Built around him :But Juan Mata didn't shine in a 3-5-2 formation . Do United have the players to play 3-5-2? The evidence of pre-season suggests so but on Saturday lunchtime, it was dysfunctional and there were too many square pegs in round holes. Jesse Lingard was caught out a couple of times at right wing-back before succumbing to injury early on. Adnan Januzaj replaced him in that position and he, frankly, is far too good going forward to have to worry about defensive concerns. Van Gaal's preference to play three at the back is sadly undermined by the glaring truth that only Jonny Evans has proved himself as a defender of Manchester United quality in recent years. The jury is out on Phil Jones and Chris Smalling while Tyler Blackett, the most impressive United defender against Swansea, has only one Premier League appearance to his name. Evidently, Van Gaal needs his chief executive Ed Woodward to close some deals. Marcos Rojo of Sporting is believed to be close but United now have only two weeks to act. They knew Nemanja Vidic was leaving at the turn of the year and it was expected that Rio Ferdinand would follow - how have they left it so late? No cover: It was unfair to expect Tyler Blackett to solve problems on his United debut . United also appear short in central midfield. Ander Herrera is stylish and composed and Darren Fletcher is steady but Van Gaal needs some bite in there and somebody that can grab a football match by the scruff of its neck. United continue to deny links to Juventus' Arturo Vidal but he would be an ideal signing after missing out on Cesc Fabregas and Toni Kroos. Paul Scholes said on BT Sport: 'The big thing for me was the quality just wasn’t there in the midfield. '[Wayne] Rooney and [Juan] Mata couldn't feed off anything. 'The big thing about Louis van Gaal spending big money now is – who comes in? Is the quality there? The two big players haven’t come – Toni Kross and Cesc Fabregas.' Pace of the league Ander Herera struggled adapt to the rigours Premier League . Too much space: Ki rounded off a fine first half for the visitors with the opening goal . What changed in the second half? United changed to what Van Gaal described as a 4-3-3 but to the layman appeared to be a 4-4-1-1: De Gea; Jones, Smalling, Blackett, Young; Januzaj, Herrera, Fletcher, Nani; Mata, Rooney. For 20 minutes, the plan appeared to be working as Rooney equalised. Briefly, United threatened to build up a head of steam but the momentum was killed by Swansea's second goal. In previous years, when United equalise at Old Trafford, you expect the whole tone of the game to shift and the Alamo to be launched towards the opponent's goal, as United attack with dynamism, pace and fury. A Rooney free-kick aside, United barely threatened. Even in six minutes of added time - Mike Dean had only signalled for four (some things stay the same at Old Trafford) - United did not create a chance of note. In a striking similarity to last season, United were ponderous, hesitant and seemed to lack the belief to go for the throat of the opponents. Again, players looked uneasy in their roles, and Ashley Young's misjudgement for the second goal was typical of an attacking winger being asked to play as a full-back. Ultimately, systems, formations or philosophies can become meaningless if the personnel is not up to scratch or the players are bereft of confidence. Impressive: Adnan Januzaj could be the flying winger United fans have come to expect at Old Trafford . Should Manchester United be ditching the wingers? Evidently, Nani, Ashley Young and Shinji Kagawa have not demonstrated enough in recent times to warrant a place on the wing in a 4-4-2. You can understand, therefore, why Van Gaal has experimented with the 3-5-2. However, we should not forget that these United supporters have been groomed on the Sir Alex Ferguson philosophy that centred around flying wingers - Kanchelskis, Giggs, Beckham, Ronaldo. In Adnan Januzaj, United appear to have another and he is, without question, the most exciting player on United's books. In the long-term, United view him as a number 10 but his willingness to commit opponents and produce quality makes him United's stand-out wide player. If United were able to recruit another winger - Angel di Maria has been monitored this summer, while Marco Reus was a target earlier this year - Van Gaal would then have the personnel to revert to a style of play that United fans adore. If that signing is not forthcoming, United followers may have to be patient with this new philosophy - but five shots on target in a game at Old Trafford falls below the call of duty. On the lookout: Van Gaal must strengthen the squad... but fans also have to be patient with his philosophy .","Van Gaal started with 3-5-2 formation but players looked lost .

"A concentration camp uniform for sale on eBay is almost certainly a fake.

The findings have added to the distress of the family of the man it was claimed wore the striped uniform, who were furious when it was put up for sale at £11,000. This concentration camp uniform for sale on eBay at £11,000 is almost certainly a fake, according to an expert . The report caused worldwide outrage and led to an apology from the online trading site, which removed 30 items from sale – including the uniform. Last week, scientists at Contact Traces, a forensic laboratory near Oxford, examined 27 fibre samples from the uniform. Expert Lorna Stevens said: ‘The black thread used to sew the badge and the buttons on appears to be coloured with a Reactive Black 5 dye, which was not invented until 1954. ‘This throws serious questions on the likelihood the badge is associated with this uniform. ‘The findings so far appear to challenge its credibility as a genuine uniform.’ The striped pyjama-style concentration camp uniform was worn by death camp inmates .

"Troubled former England footballer Paul Gascoigne had to be helped to his feet after he lost control of a golf buggy he was driving and crashed into a ditch. The 47-year-old, who was admitted to hospital a fortnight ago after an alcoholic relapse, was driving the 15mph buggy when it swerved off the course and into a grassy ditch at a golf course in Bournemouth. He was said to be dazed but unhurt after the incident, which happened at the Playgolf course in the south coast resort at 10.30am on Sunday.

Photographs of the incident show a can of Stella Artois amid the golf clubs which spilled as the buggy overturned. Peter Gilbert, head of operations at Playgolf Bournemouth, confirmed Gazza was at the wheel of the £18-a-time buggy, though he said it hadn't been hired out in his name. He told MailOnline the footballer and father of three was a regular and popular visitor to the course, which is near his home in the millionaire's enclave of Sandbanks, and said they never had any problems with him. Mr Gilbert said: 'He comes here once or twice a week, every week, and we never have any trouble with him - he's always happy to have his picture taken with children.' England soccer legend Paul Gascoigne being escorted from his Bournemouth home by police to an ambulance two weeks ago . Last month, Gascoigne was taken to hospital after he was pictured clutching a bottle of gin in the street near his rented apartment in Sandbanks, Dorset. He was also seen wandering the streets outside his expensive apartment block, holding a carrier bag full of cans of Stella Artois, and sitting with his head in his hands. Neighbours called 999 for help after finding the former Spurs and Lazio star slumped against a wall, and an ambulance arrived to take the former England star to hospital. After pictures emerged showing Gascoigne looking much older than 47, looking gaunt with sunken eyes, QPR manager Harry Redknapp, who also lives in Sandbanks, offered him the chance to work alongside him in football. He said: 'I saw him about a month ago and said ""I'll pick you up in the mornings, Gazza, come training with me and do a bit of work with the kids"". I’d love it if he could do that. It's an open invitation. 'He's a great lad and it's sad to see what’s happened to him and how he's looking at the moment.' In a TV documentary shown last September, Gascoigne described the pain of fearing he might start drinking again, despite knowing it could kill him. He was first sent to rehab in 1998 by Middlesbrough manager Bryan Robson, having found been unconscious after drinking 32 shots of whisky. Since then he has fought a public battle against both drink and drugs, particularly after leaving the world of professional football a decade ago. Scroll down for video .

"The vast majority of passengers do not trust their train company to be truthful or communicate well wen things go wrong, a survey has found. Just one in five travellers have a high level of trust in First Capital Connect - the worst rated company - with only a quarter have faith in South-eastern and Southern. Top of the league table is Merseyrail, which is trusted by 52 per cent of customers, followed by Grand Central at 48 per cent. First Capital Connect topped the league table with one in five travellers having a high level of trust in company . However the poll of 4,000 travellers by watchdog Passenger Focus found that passengers are more forgiving of poor service if they feel announcements convey honest information. Equally the majority do not trust them to be truthful, fair or communicate well when things go wrong, it says. As a result passengers treat rail travel as a ‘distress purchase’ to be endured rather than enjoyed, with passengers’ perception of the railways damaged accordingly. Their report said: 'Customers do not currently feel that train companies are ""on their side"", acting with their interests at heart. 'Acting with honesty...and treating customers fairly are important for trust, but are areas where train companies perform less well than they do on punctuality.' Busy commuter services across London and south east England inspired the least trust, according to the report. South West Trains was trusted by just over a quarter of its customers and First Great Western by 27 per cent, which angry passengers have dubbed ‘Worst late Western’ following complaints about punctuality and overcrowding. Behind them are London Midland with 27 per cent and Greater Anglia with a third. By contrast, among those with the highest levels of trust is Grand Central with 48 per cent, Chiltern Railways with 47 per cent, Virgin trains with 46 per cent and C2C with 45 per cent. London and the South East rate worst on ‘trust’, driven largely by high fares, poor punctuality and overcrowding . They are followed by the state-run but soon to be re-privatised East Coast at 44 per cent and ScotRail at 43 per cent. The report says that although passengers do complain about late running trains, firms which communicate well, explain the problem and offer some relief are much more trusted than those which appear distant and untroubled by their passengers’ plight. It says: ‘ Although the punctuality of the service is important, being open and honest in communicating with customers about the reasons behind any delay is also critical.’ On the importance of trust it concludes: ’The best performing train operating companies (TOCs) all have relatively high levels of trust and low levels of distrust, reinforcing general positivity towards the rail industry.’ Noting how commuter services in London and the South East rate worst on ‘trust’ – driven largely by high fares, poor punctuality and overcrowding - it adds: ’ Having a punctual and reliable service is essential in building trust and this is known to be particularly important for commuters as they are reliant on train companies to get them to work, and currently rate punctuality lower than other passenger.’ London Midland (pictured) had 27 per cent 'trust' in the poll of 4,000 passengers by Passenger Focus . It says: ’While improving punctuality is a key starting point, communicating openly and honestly with passengers when there are any problems is also vital. ‘Improving performance on these measures could help put passengers in a more positive state of mind when things do go wrong.’ It concludes: ’There is low trust in the service delivered by train companies since they are perceived as failing to deliver.’ Despite this, rail as a whole is rated closer to supermarkets and airlines ‘than more maligned industries such as banking and energy.’ But the report notes: ’However, while passengers are fairly positive about the industry, few would recommend rail as a way of travel’. Passenger Focus chief executive Anthony Smith said: ‘There is much that train companies - and governments - can do to improve trust. It is important for train companies to get the basic service right ahead of everything else. ‘Passengers should feel that train companies are ‘on their side’.","One in five rated company First Capital Connect with a high level of trust .

"The political Twittersphere erupted into guffaws Saturday after a women's lifestyle magazine published a soft profile of ABC journalist Claire Shipman – the wife of White House Press Secretary Jay Carney – and applied ham-fisted Photoshop edits to a photo of the family bookshelf.

Rumors had swirled around the White House that Carney was angling for a posting as the U.S. ambassador to Russia, but the former Moscow bureau chief for TIME said it wasn't in the cards since his family had only just now 'won me back.' Carney has not enjoyed a rosy relationship with White House correspondents, often parrying accusations that he has made the West Wing far less accessible to journalists than it had been under previous presidents. His . alternatively glib and cheerful exterior at the briefing podium often . gave way to more forceful, sometimes vulgar exchanges with reporters . when open-press events spiraled out of control. In . one case, when a reporter with the center-right Daily Caller asked a . question out of turn during a 2011 Rose Garden press conference and . sparred with Obama over immigration policy, Carney called the news . outlet's executive editor – this reporter – and cursed a blue streak, . threatening to cancel the reporter's press credentials. Obama . seemed to paper over such outbursts on Friday, saying that Carney 'has . good judgment. He has good temperament and he has good heart.' 'Be nice to him on his farewell tour,' the president joked. ON DECK: Josh Earnest (L) will take over as White House press secretary, giving correspondents a new daily whipping boy . CHEAT SHEET: Carney was known for referring often to a briefing binder full of talking points, rather than addressing many tough questions off-the-cuff . The cover of the spring 2014 issue of 'Washingtonian MOM' magazine featured Shipman and the two Carney children . xxxxxxxx . Earnest, 39, has been the go-to replacement for Carney on Air Force One and in the press briefing room when his boss was away. But reporters have not yet tested his day-to-day mettle. 'Today the flak jacket is officially passed to a new generation,' Obama said. This isn't the first such transition in the West Wing. Obama’s first presidential press secretary, Robert Gibbs, moved on to found his own strategic communications firm, The Incite Agency. He also has a contract as an on-air commentator at the liberal cable news network MSNBC. Carney, 49, said he won't step down right away but will continue to brief reporters until he decides what to do next. 'I haven't made any decisions yet,' he said. 'I'm excited by some of the possibilities. I'm sure you guys will be among the first to know after I've decided what to do.' The outgoing press flack often made reporters cringe by deflecting tough questions to Obama administration cabinet departments. National Journal assembled a clip reel of examples on Friday, showing his go-to line when he didn't have answers. His clashes with the press were the stuff of legend, including he full-throated defense of shifting White House policy that saw news photographers excluded from many – if not most – of Obama's daily calendared events. That change brought condemnation from the powerful White House Correspondents Association, and from some newspapers – chief among them USA Today – that said they would no longer publish the posed and manicured 'official' White House photographs that the administration habitually distributed instead. It was the president's trip to South Africa for Nelson Mandela's memorial service that proved to be the final straw, with CNN reporter Brianna Kellar accusing the Obama White House of operating by a different standard of openness. 'I mean, anyone here can tell that there's less access than under the Bush administration,' she said durign a December 12, 2013 briefing,  and yet ... it was President Obama who talked about transparency being a hallmark of his administration.' 'So isn't it sort of the problem is that he has set up a standard himself that he's not meeting, that his White House is not meeting?' People magazine spilled the beans after Hillary Clinton had a secret lunch Thursday with Obama in the White House, and reporters were steamed to have been left out of the loop . On Thursday Carney faced reporters' anger after news emerged from people magazine that former Secretary of State and likely 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton had a secret lunch with the president, an event that was omitted from the daily calendar distributed to reporters. Ultimately, Carney offered a time-worn explanation for his retreat from government service, saying he wanted to spend more time with his wife and their young children. 'They are never the age they are today again,' he said wistfully.","Carney will be replaced by his deputy Josh Earnest .

"The family of Stephen Collins fear the 7th Heaven star is on the brink of suicide over shocking allegations he molested several underage girls. The actor, who played a beloved pastor on the hit family friendly show, has been left distraught after his taped confessions made during a marriage therapy session were made public. Now those closest to the 67-year-old are deeply concerned the star has hit rock bottom and fear he may harm himself. Scroll down for videos . Broken trust: In bombshell divorce documents obtained by MailOnline, Stephen Collins  estranged wife Faye Grant claims the actor used his celebrity status to prey on underage girls and ‘engender the trust of the families of the children he molested’ in a decade of abuse. Grant has also come out to say Collins even had incestuous thoughts about their only child when she was pregnant . Before the storm: Collins flew from New York to Los Angeles on Monday, the day before the child molestation allegations surfaced . Shock: 7th Heaven cast members can't believe the claims against the TV dad, who played  Rev Eric Camden on the long-running family drama about parents raising seven children. The cast included  (left to right) are David Gallagher, Jessica Biel, Barry Watson, Beverly Mitchell, Mackenzie Rosman (seated with dog Happy ), Catherine Hicks and Stephen Collins . Family reunion: Last month Collins tweeted this photo of a cast reunion dinner attended by his former co-star Jessica Biel, center . 'His family by no means condone what he's said to have done, but it doesn't stop them worrying about him,' a close family friend told MailOnline. 'They fear he could take his own life. That's how low he is right now. No one wants to leave him by himself.' His estranged wife Faye Grant has now claimed that Collins even had incestuous thoughts about their only child when she was pregnant. She says just before giving birth, he told her how glad he was they were having a girl, who they named Kate, instead of a boy who he may have abused. 'The comment you made just before I gave birth to our daughter when you said you hoped we didn't have a little boy, because ""you just didn't know if you could keep his little penis out of your mouth"" was indication enough that you were sick,' Grant wrote in an email obtained by TMZ. 'I should have followed my gut then, and then again 14 years ago, and kicked your ass to the curb,' she added. But a source close to Collins told the gossip site that the allegations are 'absolutely untrue,' that he never received that email and Grant never brought these claims up during their contentious divorce proceedings. According to court papers obtained by MailOnline, Grant is attempting to indemnify herself and the divorce settlement from  settlement any civil action stemming from the pediphelia charges. Ar stake is property worth $13million including over $5 million in real estate and Collins' $100,000 worth of vintage guitars. On top of that, a Massachusetts woman who worked as a nanny in New York in the 1990s, in the same building as Collins, has come forward to reveal his strange daily visits in pajamas and the 'semi-pornographic novel' he was writing. The woman named Ilene called into Boston radio station Mix 104.1 Wednesday morning. The family source says cast and crew of 7th Heaven - the popular long-running family drama which ended in 2007 - are in 'shock' over the bombshell claims. Neighbor tweets: Collins' neighbor, former Baywatch star and Playboy model Donna D'Errico, tweeted just after 8pm pacific time that the actor shot himself . Oops: After it was determined that there was no shotgun fire or suicide last night, D'Errico left a statement taped to her door stating her side of what she did and asking for privacy . False alarm: Police arrived at a house where Stephen Collins was believed to be staying in Tarzana, California, in response to the false report . In an interview with MailOnline, a cast member, who asked not to be identified, said, 'I'm very confused right now. Knowing Stephen the way I do, I find it hard to put this together. 'He wasn't that guy. He wasn't someone with secrets and angst. He was always very present with us. Fun and teasing. All we did is laugh all day long at work and a lot of it was because of him. He's not that guy to me. 'He took care of me and all of us during those years. He really was a father figure. Taught us to read music a little bit and would make up songs for any occasion for us. He was our glue that held us together. Our rock. 'We all had dinner together a few months ago. If this is true, it's disturbing because there was no outside appearance of problems. He never did anything sneaky when I knew him and I saw him every day. 'It must be buried in him. I wish him the best of luck to make it through this. I hope he goes to rehab and comes out the same role model rock star that we know him as.' Collins, who famously played Reverend Eric Camden, the virtuous father-of-seven, is currently being investigated for child molestation. An NYPD official confirmed to MailOnline that they had received a complaint and the Special Victims Squad is investigating. And the LAPD is also reviewing their own 2012 investigation into Collins, and will be collaborating with New York authorities. Law enforcement in California received the therapy session recordings two years ago but closed their case after finding 'no verified victim'. In the recorded therapy session, Collins seemingly admits that he exposed himself to several young girls between the ages of 10 and 13 in both Los Angeles and New York. Leering: Collins starred  in the 1996 Lifetime movie The Babysitter's Seduction in which he played a recently widowed dad who becomes obsessed with his childrens' babysitter, played by Keri Russell . Too young: The dirty dalliance between  Felicity's Keri Russell and Reverend Camden from 7th Heaven ended badly . Following the tapes released by TMZ on Tuesday, Collins life and career have been falling apart as he resigned from his position on the Screen Actors Guild board and was fired from the film Ted 2. Reruns of 7th Heaven are not being broadcast and he will no longer appear on the hit TV show Scandal. LAPD officers rushed to Tarzana, California, after getting a 911 call about a shot fired inside Collins' house last night. Collins' neighbor, former Playboy model and Baywatch star Donna D'Errico, tweeted just after 8pm PT that the actor shot himself . It turned out to be a false alarm sparked by a member of the media who heard a loud pop . The actor allegedly made a written confession to his now ex-wife Faye Grant in 2012, which sparked the therapy session. Grant secretly recorded the session under the advisement of her lawyer, who told her it was legal in California to record conversations in order to gather evidence on a person who has committed a violent felony. And in explosive court documents Grant reveals she was 'sickened' after her husband allegedly confessed to living a vile 'secret life' in which he abused several children. She claims the actor used his celebrity status to prey on underage girls and 'engender the trust of the families of the children he molested' in a decade of abuse. Ironically Collins starred in the 1996 Lifetime movie The Babysitter's Seduction in which he played a recently widowed dad who becomes obsessed with his childrens' teenage babysitter, played by Keri Russell. Sex tape: Collins' estranged wife Faye Grant secretly recorded the session with her therapist in which he admitted to sexually abusing three underage girls . Devastated Grant also revealed Collins was treated for a sex addiction and was seeing a 'sexual dysfunction' therapist, but he refused to seek proper help or hospitalization for his 'predilection towards children', she said. ""The family feels absolutely betrayed by him. He's not the man they all thought he was and that's incredibly hurtful and confusing,' said the family source. ""With everything that has come to light they fear there could be other victims. There's so much that he has already hidden from everyone he's worked and lived with, they don't know what could come out next. Some are even wondering if he admitted everything he's done on those tapes, or if there's more he's keeping secret. ""The family are mortified and embarrassed. They remain concerned however for Stephen because they now know he has deep seeded issues.” Yesterday cast and crew of 7th Heaven were said to be reeling over the news. The family source, who knows several cast members and often visited the 7th Heaven set, said: 'No one had any idea. They had a reunion just last month and everyone loved it. 'There were never any signs Stephen had these issues. No one ever suspected a thing. 'Everyone who has worked with him has said he's amazing and lovely and one of the nicest guys ever. 'It's like the neighbors of the serial killer with bodies buried in the basement who always say, 'He was always such a nice guy'. 'We are all blown away by the revelations.' Calls to Collins' representatives were not returned to MailOnline.","Actor Stephen Collins has hit rock bottom since the child molestation claims have become public .

"He has been accused of the most heinous of crimes. Luring a pregnant young woman to a remote mountainside, murdering her in cold blood and dumping her lifeless body down an abandoned mine-shaft in the hope she will never be found. But for those who know former Marine rifleman Christopher Brandon Lee it seems unthinkable that this 'family man' with a 'big heart' could have killed 19-year-old Erin Corwin. Scroll down for video . Family man: Christopher Lee was a devoted husband to wife Nichole and loving father to six-year-old Liberty. He was a very gentle and patient father, friends tell MailOnline . Home on the range: In these snaps, taken in July just after Erin vanished, the  little cow girl Liberty, holding a toy gun, gets cozy with her mom and dad. They were staying in the bunk house of the friend's horse ranch before moving to Alaska . As our exclusive photos show, Lee seemed every bit the devoted husband to wife Nichole and loving father to six-year-old Liberty. In a series of snaps he posed with his little ‘cow girl’ sat on his knee holding a toy gun and his wife beside him. And in exclusive video obtained by MailOnline horse lover Lee is also seen happily showing children how to ride a miniature pony around a paddock. And two days before Erin’s disappearance friends say Lee attended a children's birthday party in which he delivered a birthday cake to a young girl. But behind his popular 'nice guy' image was Lee hiding a dark side that cost a young girl her life? Did he snap simply to stop his family unit from falling apart? Lonely: MailOnline has learned Erin became ‘distant’ from her husband Marine Corporal Jonathan Corwin because he was often deployed for weeks at a time on ‘war game’ maneuvers away from the Twentynine Palms base. She was a friend of Lee's wife Nichole.  It’s believed Lee cheated on high-school sweetheart Nichole with  neighbor Erin in a secret five-month affair amid claims she became pregnant with his child . Lassoed: Horseman Christopher Lee is now lock-up in Alaska, awaiting extradition to San Bernadino County in California where he faces charges for Erin's murder . Closer: Chris and Nichole were best friends as well as being a couple.  Friend Michele Herring said Lee and Nichole would come to the White Rock Horse Rescue Ranch at least twice a week to care for two horses they sponsored named Humorous and Mack . Erin's body was found last weekend at the bottom of a 140ft deep mineshaft two miles south east of the Twentynine Palms Marine base in California, where she lived with her husband Marine Corporal Jonathan Corwin. Lee stands accused of murder and was charged on Tuesday with killing Erin. The San Bernardino District Attorney’s Office also filed the special circumstance allegation of 'lying in wait', adding an even more sinister angle to the case. Lee was arrested on Sunday by officers in Alaska and is currently awaiting extradition to California. His arrest has come as a huge shock to his family and friends. Close friend Michele Herring said she finds it ‘impossible’ to believe that Lee is capable of such a horrible crime. She says he was every bit a ‘nice man’ who loved his wife and daughter. ‘He was devoted to them,’ she said. ‘He would have done anything for them. ‘He wasn’t an angry person, he was just a nice guy. Chris and Nichole were best friends as well as being a couple, the way they interacted was so good, they just got along so well.’ Michele said Lee and Nichole would come to the White Rock Horse Rescue Ranch at least twice a week to care for two horses they sponsored named Humorous and Mack. She said Erin also visited with the couple to see her sponsored horse named Cassie and the three seemed like good friends. But while she never saw Lee flirting with Erin she says his focus was on wife Nichole. ‘They were very much in love, very close. They were together at high-school, since they were teenagers so they had this connection. A lot of people grow apart after high-school but Chris and Nichole never seemed to lose that closeness. ‘As for his daughter, Chris adores that little girl and Liberty loves her daddy too. ‘He was a very gentle and patient father.’ Ranch owner Isabel Megli was equally as shocked by his arrest, ‘he is a nice guy, no one expected this,’ she said. While ranch goer David Lange added: ‘He was a normal guy, not a guy you would think capable of murder.’ Marine wife: A Sheriff Department spokesman said he wasn't aware of any marriage problems when Erin went missing . Tragic loss: Erin’s body was found last weekend at the bottom of a 140ft deep mine shaft two miles south east of the Twentynine Palms Marine base in California, where she lived with her husband. Neighbors say she was close friends with Lee's wife N . On the face of it Lee, 24, was the perfect man; a Marine who served his country, a devoted husband and a father who adored his young daughter. Weeks away from being discharged from the Marine Corp, Lee was hoping to move his family back home to Alaska where he planned to return to school to build a better future. But lurking behind this ‘nice-guy’ image it’s alleged a sinister side emerged. It’s believed Lee cheated on his high-school sweetheart Nichole with his neighbor Erin in a secret five-month affair amid claims she fell pregnant with his child. He told police that although the two had kissed, they had never had intercourse. But the investigation found that Lee and Erin did have an 'intimate relationship' dating back to at least February, Sheriff's Sgt. Trevis Newport said. MailOnline has learned Erin became 'distant' from her husband, Jonathan, because he was often deployed for weeks at a time on 'war game' maneuvers away from the Twentynine Palms base. A friend, who asked not to be named, said: 'They started to grow apart because Jonathan was away all the time, he was sent away in to the wilderness for long periods, sometimes a month at a time. 'He was a corporal and would be away on war maneuvers, Erin found it hard. 'Jonathan was also very controlling and she didn’t like this. While he was away she become close to Lee, she felt she could talk to him.’ Erin – who was also close friends with Lee’s wife Nichole - learned she was pregnant two weeks before she vanished. It’s believed she told Lee the child was his just days before he was due to leave the Marine Corp and move his family to Alaska. It’s alleged Erin was hoping to meet with Lee on the day she disappeared so the pair could celebrate having a baby. One theory is that Lee was shell-shocked about the pregnancy and feared his wife would almost certainly find out about the affair and leave him. Most of all he was likely terrified that he might lose contact with his daughter Liberty as a result. Unthinkable: Those who know former Marine rifleman Christopher Brandon Lee it seems unthinkable that this ‘family man’ with a ‘big heart’ could have killed 19-year-old Erin, here with her Marine Corporal husband . Bird's eye view: A friend says she never saw Lee flirting with Erin. She says his focus was on wife Nichole . Seeing his perfect family unit crumbling before him, could Lee have then plotted to murder Erin to keep them together? These are the questions detectives are trying to answer. And as the San Bernadino Sheriff’s department continues its investigation every possible theory is being explored. Police sources say Lee has admitted conducting internet searches on human body disposal, and a witness told detectives that Lee asked him 'what was the best way to dispose of a human body,' a sheriff's investigator wrote in a document filed in San Bernardino County Superior Court in support of an arrest warrant. This tallies with the theory that Lee was allegedly premeditated in murdering Erin. Erin’s life was cruelly snatched away on June 28 when she vanished. Her killer dumped her body down a 140ft deep mineshaft in a remote area around two miles from her home on Twentynine Palms Marine Base in California. Erin had told her Marine husband Jonathan she was headed to Joshua Tree National Park to scout trails she and her mother could later bike, but she never returned home. Her Toyota Corolla was found two days later abandoned just blocks from the Twentynine Palms Marine Base. Man in orange: Lee made his first appearance in an Anchorage, Alaska, courtroom Tuesday on murder charges. He fought his extradition to California and is being held on a $2 million bail. Murderer? Lee stands accused of murder and was charged on Tuesday with killing Erin.The San Bernardino District Attorney’s Office also filed the special circumstance allegation of 'lying in wait', adding an even more sinister angle to the case . According to search warrant documents, tire tracks matching those of Lee’s Jeep were found near to Erin’s car. Search and rescue teams scoured a 300-square-miles area round Joshua Tree National Park, including more than 100 mine shafts, for nearly two months before Corwin's body was found. The investigation grew to focus on Lee, who was the Corwins' neighbor at the Marine Base, according to court papers. Erin’s friend told investigators that Corwin and Lee were having an affair and that the unborn child might be Lee's, the papers show. Lee is being held on a federal hold and will be extradited to California from Alaska where he will face a murder charge. He is accused of snuffing out a young life.

"More than a million young people are subjected to 'extreme cyberbullying' every day, according to the largest ever survey into online abuse. The report found young people are twice as likely to be bullied on Facebook than any other social network. Experts say cyberbullying can have a 'catastrophic' impact on self-esteem and have called for parents and regulators to recognise the seriousness of the issue. A cyberbullying survey found more than a million youngsters suffer 'extreme' abuse online daily and more than half of 13 to 22-year-olds polled said they had been bullied on Facebook (file picture) Liam Hackett, founder of national anti-bullying charity, Ditch The Label, which produced the report, said many people assume cyberbullying is not as hurtful as face-to-face abuse. But he said it can be even more distressing because it is more public. The survey of 10,000 13 to 22-year-olds found that levels of cyberbullying were much higher than previously reported. It found that 70 per cent of youngsters had experienced cyberbullying and one in five said it had been 'extreme'. Of those surveyed, almost 40 per cent said they were bullied online frequently. Mr Hackett said: 'I think there's a . tendency for older people to think that cyberbullying is a lesser form . of bullying because there is this idea you can delete a comment or you . can block it and it's gone. 'But . actually, we have seen that content becomes viral very quickly and when . comments are put out on a public platform it can be more distressing . for the victim because a lot of people are exposed to this content, so . it's incredibly harmful.' Facebook, Ask.fm and Twitter were found . to be the most likely sources of cyberbullying, and 54 per cent of Facebook users reported cyberbullying on the network, the survey said. Charity Ditch The Label said cyberbulling can have a 'catastrophic' impact on youngster's self-esteem . Ask.fm has . faced growing criticism is recent months after being linked to the . suicide of a number of teens. Schoolgirl . Hannah Smith, 14, was found hanged at her Leicestershire home in August . months of abuse on the site, where users are able to hide their . identities. Ditch The Label's research also suggested that young . men and women are equally at risk of cyberbullying but transgender people were more likely to suffer online abuse. Mr Hackett, who was bullied and . cyberbullied while at school, said: 'We asked people to rate the impact . cyberbullying had on their lives on a scale of one to 10, with one being . not severe and 10 being incredibly severe. 'On . average, the effect on their self-esteem was 7.5 out of 10, which can . go on to affect their social lives and their optimism for the future. Hannah Smith, 14, was found hanged after months of abuse on Ask.fm . 'It's having a massive impact on young people and it's heartbreaking to . read.' Mr Hackett said he hoped the report would be used to educate young people, parents, schools and the Government about cyberbullying and how to report it. He said: 'Social media outlets have a massive duty of care to teen users. They are already doing a lot but more investment needs to be put into the resources of moderation. 'There also needs to be stronger integration between the Government and social networks. 'What we believe social networks should have to do is produce an annual external audit which would measure cyberbullying activity on a network, how many people are reporting cyberbullying and what happened as a result, and we believe that those reports should be made public.' A Facebook spokesman told The Independent: 'We don't tolerate bullying on Facebook and that's why we provide the best tools and support in the industry for people to report bullying to us or to someone else who can help them.' A Government spokesman said David Cameron expects social media websites to have mechanisms to report online abuse and 'to take action promptly when abuse is reported and to make it easier for users to turn off anonymous posts.'","Ditch The Label report found 70% of youngsters have been cyberbullied .

"Anti-Semitism is still prevalent in Germany with some 19 million adults harbouring negative sentiments towards Jews, according to a new study . Anti-Semitism is still prevalent in Germany with some 19 million adults harbouring negative sentiments towards Jews, according to a new study. The Anti-Defamation League's Global 100 Index found that 27 per cent of German adults answered 'probably' or 'definitely' true to six or more of 11 stereotypes about Jews in the survey. The finding places Germany - which has an adult population of around 69 million - among the countries with the highest levels of anti-Semitism in western Europe. Austria (28%), Spain (29%), France (37%) and Greece (69%) were higher. Meanwhile, Sweden, with 4 per cent, had the least. In the United States, 9 per cent of adults . were found to harbour anti-Semitic views, while the figure for the UK was 8 per cent. The highest level of anti-Semitism in the world was found in the Palestinian territories of West Bank and Gaza at 93 per cent. The global average came in at 26 per cent, meaning some 1.1billion adults hold anti-Semitic views around the world. The study, which the ADL called 'the broadest survey of anti-Jewish attitudes ever conducted', found the lowest level of anti-Semitism in Laos, with just 0.2 per cent of the adult population expressing such views. 'Our findings are sobering but sadly not surprising,' said ADL National Director Abraham Foxman. 'We can now identify hotspots, as well as countries and regions of the world where hatred of Jews is virtually non-existent.' Foxman said findings about Greece had already led to an invitation from that country's prime minister to discuss possible remedies. 'Jews are more loyal to Israel than to this country/to the countries they live in,' was the most commonly accepted stereotype with 41 per cent of respondents surveyed across 101 countries and the West Bank and Gaza saying that it was at least 'probably true'.

The second most accepted stereotype, held by 35 per cent of respondents, was: 'Jews have too much power in the business world.'

The Middle East and North Africa region was found to be the most anti-Semitic and the Oceania region the least, followed by the Americas. Anti-Semitic attitudes were relatively low in English speaking countries at 13 per cent compared with 30 per cent for Spanish-speaking countries, the report found.

"True Lady: Margaret Thatcher was many things, including always well quiffed . It’s certainly not the kind of legacy many prime ministers can expect to have. Since Baroness Thatcher’s death earlier this month, scores of women have been paying tribute to her in a rather unexpected way – by adopting her hairstyle. One hairdresser, in Chelsea said he had been inundated by requests for ‘The Thatcher’, as the iconic style has become known. Celebrity stylist Maximiliano Centini says his salon has been inundated with demands for the style and bookings are full. ‘I have not known anything like this for many years,’ said Mr Centini. ‘We have now done the style for over . 100 women, it is a surge. I experienced something similar when the . Jennifer Aniston style became popular but that surge built slowly - this . has come completely out of the blue.’ Thatcher’s famous hairstyle originated in Chalmer’s salon in Mayfair during the early 1970s. The Iron Lady’s first modern look was adapted slightly as she aged but the cut never lost its unique power. ‘I decided to recreate the early look on one of my actress clients,’ reveals Mr Centini. ‘It blossomed from there. The cut . looked striking on her, other models and actresses that she knows were . soon calling asking for the ‘Thatcher’. At first I found it amusing but . now the domino effect has become serious, the demand is too much to cope . with.’ ‘I immediately fell in love with the cut,’ said the actress. ‘It is the perfect mix of feminine . style with a hint of masculine power. I think for a modern woman that is . now an ideal balance. When my other model and actress friends saw it . they were immediately intrigued. I have been turning a lot of heads.’ Margaret Thatcher’s powerful image - steely and professional, yet always feminine -  was a key part of her status. However, few women replicated the look . during her time in office. Now, in a time perhaps of greater equality, . women have happily embraced the look. Maggie tributes: The former Prime Minister's famous hairstyle is now requested in salons as women want to copy 'The Thatcher' The impact has now echoed into . Hollywood. Sharon Stone caused a stir at the weekend when she arrived at . the White House sporting a ‘power statement’ style. Her famous blonde hair was swept . tightly to her head, adopting the same lines as the ‘Thatcher’. Her look . at the Obama hosted event made headlines across the world. Italian-born Christina Bellucci, 37, a digital consultant, said she felt the look reflected a modern attitude. ‘This is a strong style and gives me authority,’ she said. ‘When I walk out the door I feel a few inches taller, it gives me power without sacrificing any of my femininity.’ ‘We’ve done over seventy of the styles . since the news broke of Margaret’s death,’ reveals Centini. This lady is not for turning! From her days running the country to her later years, Margaret Thatcher's hairstyle never changed . ‘It is a . steady flow at the moment. What I like is that women are using it to . give their lives and general attitudes a boost, many of them tell me . that they step out of the chair with more confidence. It started with younger girls adopting . the style - now they have started sending their mums in! What I find . interesting is that every women will have a different image of Thatcher . in their mind depending on their age.’ Achieving the look is initially a . complicated process. ‘Margaret Thatcher paid a surprising amount of . attention to her style,’ says Centini. Holly Carpenter, a 32-year-old mum of . two, said she appreciated the style’s practicality. ‘She was a busy . lady, and so am I. Once the cut is done, the ‘Thatcher’ is quick and . easy to knock into place and I can run out the door.’ Celebrity clients of the salon range . from Sophie Dahl to the ‘Made in Chelsea’ stars; we may be seeing ‘The . Thatcher’ on our screens soon. ‘I never reveal client details and I will . not say who has expressed an interest,’ says Centini. ‘But, yes, I . think it is safe to say that more star names are set to take this style . back onto the world stage.’","Ladies of London rush to copy the late Baroness Thatcher's quiff .

"A week dominated by headlines about the most famous Italian in the Weighing Room can end with a fellow Sardinian with his name in lights. The tremors were almost off racing’s Richter Scale when Frankie Dettori lost the ride on Treve on Monday. The 43-year-old, on board John Gosden’s Forever Now in this afternoon’s £650,000 Ladbrokes St Leger, will be an observer at Longchamp tomorrow when the filly tries to justify her place as Arc favourite against nine rivals in the Prix Vermeille. Andrea Atzeni poses at Doncaster racecourse on Friday . 23-year-old Andrea Atzeni rides Kingston Hill in October 2013 . Andrea Atzeni has already ridden some winners this week - pictured jockeying Silk Sari on Thursday . By then Andrea Atzeni, 20 years Dettori’s junior, could be dreaming of the biggest race in Europe on October 5 should 3-1 favourite Kingston Hill do what he and trainer Roger Varian believe he can over the extended mile and three-quarters of the season’s final Classic. That is how highly they regard their colt, winner of the Group One Racing Post Trophy at the course last year. He has yet to win this season but produced solid efforts in both the 2,000 Guineas and Eclipse while his Derby second, when length and a quarter behind Australia, is form none of his rivals can touch. This a group one performer up against fair rivals but ones who can’t boast a win above Group Three level between them. With Varian giving Kingston Hill the green light to run after fears over the ground, there is an issue over whether Kingston Hill will stay. Frank Dettori shocked the racing world when he failed to win on Treve on Monday . 'Don't Stare' ridden by Andrea Atzeni wins the Frank Whittle Partnership Classified Stakes . Roger Varian, trainer of Kingston Hill, is hopeful of a win on Saturday afternoon at Doncaster . His sire Mastercraftsman has yet to father a winner at today’s trip but his performance over a mile and a half in the Derby hardly suggests lack of staying power. Atzeni, who needs two winners to ride 100 in a season for a first time, doesn’t think so. He said: ‘In the Derby, the draw didn’t look good and I had to use the horse to get a position. He still galloped all the way to the line so has every chance of staying. ‘He has never been a flashy worker but his work last week was better than ever. He has never run a bad race and ran a blinder in the Derby probably against the best horse out there. To win my first Classic would be amazing.’ Atzeni, recently appointed Jamie Spencer’s 2015 successor as No 1 jockey to Qatar Racing, faces a strong challenge from Sir Michael Stoute’s Gordon Stakes winner and Great Voltigeur Stakes runner-up Snow Sky. He will also respect team Gosden – the trainer has won the race four times - which also includes Derby third Romsdal and Marzocco. If his temperament can be kept in check, James Given’s Odeon can out-run his long odds. And Atzeni will not be taking anything for granted, the fate of Cotai Glory in yesterday’s Flying Childer’s Stakes underlined racing’s propensity for the unexpected. The Charlie Hills-trained colt was cruising to victory when veering right and unseating jockey George Baker yards from the line handing victory Richard Hannon’s Beacon. In contrast, the Queen’s Estimate was a thoroughly worthy length and a quarter winner of the Doncaster Cup under Ryan Moore, digging deep to pull clear of Whiplash Willie. However, a tilt at the Melbourne Cup with Estimate is now looking unlikely.","23-year-old Atzeni could steal the headlines from Frankie Dettori if he wins .

"Treasury spokesman says duty is important source of revenue as Government  focuses on cutting deficit . Homebuyers paid nearly £1billion more in stamp duty last year as house prices rocketed, it is revealed today. A typical family will spend £12,000 on the tax over their lifetime – rising to nearly £40,000 for Londoners. A report by the banking giant Lloyds lays bare the crippling impact of what has been labelled ‘a strong contender for the UK’s worst-designed tax’. Rising prices: Homebuyers paid nearly £1billion more in stamp duty last year as house prices rocketed . Households are being forced to pay more and more in stamp duty because house prices are rising so rapidly, currently increasing by around £220 a day. Experts say it is yet more evidence that the tax is ‘distorting’ the housing market and preventing people from buying and selling homes. Buyers must budget for ever-increasing stamp duty bills while sellers stay put to avoid paying the tax on their next purchase. Twenty per cent of homes sold last month exchanged for more than the asking price, compared with 7 per cent in September, according to the National Association of Estate Agents. More than eight people are chasing every available property. Rocketing: Households are being forced to pay more and more in stamp duty because house prices are rising so rapidly, currently increasing by around £220 a day . Over . the last year, the Lloyds report estimates homebuyers in England and . Wales spent an extraordinary £5.6billion on stamp duty. Twenty years . ago, they were paying £255million a year. There . is now a growing list of bodies – from the Council of Mortgage Lenders . (CML) to the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) – calling . for the duty to be overhauled. The Institute for Fiscal Studies, the . leading economic forecaster, said the duty was perhaps the country’s . ‘worst-designed tax’, and said the way that it was charged was . ‘perverse’. RICS said it was ‘archaic’ and ‘distorting the market’. Paula Higgins, of the Homeowners’ Alliance, said: ‘The Government needs to take a radically different approach make stamp duty fairer and to help fix the dysfunctional housing market.’ The CML said stamp duty bills were ‘sufficiently large to discourage some people from buying and selling’. Marc Page, mortgages director at Lloyds Bank, said: ‘The £12,000 stamp duty bill over a lifetime just goes to show that, unfortunately, some dreams still come with a price tag.’ Official figures from the taxman show the amount raked in from the levy was £4.7billion in England and Wales in 2012/13, the latest year for which figures are available. But today’s report from Lloyds estimates the bill this year has jumped to £5.6billion – an increase of almost £900million. Others say it might be even higher. Today’s report from Lloyds looked at a family that takes three steps up the housing ladder. In the example, they bought their first home in 1998, their second one in 2006 and their third this year.On their first home, which cost £54,246, they paid no stamp duty in 1998. In 2006, they paid £1,898 on their home, which cost £189,837. This year they paid £9,884 on their home bought for £329,460, making a total bill of £11,782. In London, the bill is £38,048. Lloyds said the Government’s failure to increase the levels at which the tax is charged has been a money-making trick. Until 1997, it was charged at 1 per cent on all homes sold for £60,000 or more. Today it is charged at 1 per cent on properties costing between £125,000 and £250,000, 3 per cent up to £500,000 with rates rising to a maximum of 7 per cent on homes over £2million. In 1998, the average first-time buyer did not pay stamp duty. Today they typically pay £2,382. A Treasury spokesman said the duty was an important source of revenue as the Government  focused on cutting the deficit.","Typical family will spend £12,000 on the tax over their lifetime .

"Every 13 year old boy dreams of scoring that one goal that will go down in the history books. Ipswich Town's Under 14 team achieved something very close to that when they crafted a beautiful goal that looked like it had come straight from Barcelona's famed La Masia academy.

Just like the tiki-taka style of play employed by Pep Guardiola's famous Barcelona side - who won three La Liga titles and two Champions League trophies in three years - the youngsters showed great control as they worked their way towards goal. From start to finish, the ball was in the opposition net after just 30 seconds following a fine thirteen-pass combination. The memorable masterpiece was rounded off with an inch-perfect through ball and an equally precise finish and will surely have caught the attention of first team boss Mick McCarthy.

"Secret files have revealed the astonishing level of ingratitude shown towards the British by Charles de Gaulle for defeating the Nazis and liberating France. Details of General de Gaulle’s attitude emerge in files released by the National Archives relating to the strange case of a French admiral called Emile Muselier.

Ingratitude: Prime minister Winston Churchill stands with French General Charles de Gaulle in January 1944 . Muselier was arrested by the British for allegedly passing secrets to the Vichy government. The evidence against him had been forged by the deputy head of de Gaulle’s own intelligence service, the Deuxieme Bureau.

"Leeds defender Giuseppe Bellusci rescued a Sky Bet Championship point for his side with a deserved late equaliser in a 1-1 draw against Yorkshire derby rivals Sheffield Wednesday. The Italian centre-half applied a striker's finish when he steered home a bouncing ball in the 79th minute to cancel out Chris Maguire's effort earlier in the second half.

Leeds head coach Darko Milanic has still to taste victory after three games in charge, but there were signs of an enterprising team in the making. The Owls' impressive start to the season could easily have stalled after their recent Capital One Cup walloping at Manchester City, but, under popular manager Stuart Gray, they displayed a resilience that has been lacking in recent campaigns. The hosts were the more effective side going forward in the first half, but had nothing to show for their dominance. Alex Mowatt dispossessed Jose Semedo in midfield and threaded a fine pass into Souleymane Doukara's path inside the penalty area, but the French striker dragged his low right-footed shot just wide. Rudy Austin then lashed in a dipping 30-yard effort from out of the blue that Westwood tipped over the crossbar. Leeds countered swiftly in the 26th minute and more incisive interplay ended in left-back Gaetano Berardi's thumping drive ricocheting off Mowatt. Striker Mirco Antenucci then looked to have put the home side ahead when he latched onto Austin's slide-rule pass to slip the ball under Westwood, but he was deemed offside. Wednesday's best chance in the first period fell to striker Stevie May, who headed right-back Liam Palmer's cross inches wide of Leeds goalkeeper Marco Silvestri's right-hand post in the 44th minute. Leeds twice threatened early in the second half when Antenucci's lob over Westwood was cleared by Palmer and the Wednesday goalkeeper made a fine save with his foot to deny the lively Italian again soon after.

Westwood then denied Leeds again with another superb save from Antenucci's rising shot after he had been played in by strike partner Doukara. May spurned a golden chance to double Wednesday's advantage when he pulled a low shot wide after a clever turn in the box. Leeds built up a head of steam as they chased a late equaliser. Austin's shot was blocked by Palmer, but, when Mowatt's excellent free-kick bounced to Bellusci on the left edge of the area, the centre-half side-footed the ball cleanly on the half-volley into the bottom corner to haul his side level in the 79th minute.

But I want to improve that we don’t lose the ball so easily. That is our problem, not our defence. ‘We are easily losing the ball but that is also the character of our team because we have a lot of creative players and they need more discipline. ‘So we are looking for a balance - without thinking too much of only attacking but also guarding.’ Much has been made of United’s injury problems at the back and the fact Van Gaal did not spend heavily on a world-class central defender in the summer. The 19-year-old Paddy McNair will play again on Sunday as United still have three central defenders injured . Radamel Falcao is yet to score in three Premier League appearances so far for Manchester United . But he added: ‘I want my defensive organisation to be better but the defence begins in the striker’s position. The media are writing that the problems are because of the weak defence and I have explained I want to improve your knowledge of football also. 'It’s team work so when we concede a goal, it’s not only because of an individual error in the defence. It starts somewhere else and that we have to analyse and improve. ‘All the teams are scoring goals out of counter-attacks mostly against us and free-kicks and corners. They don’t make their goals like we do out of building up, first, second, third and fourth phase. ‘That’s the difference and when you want to be a big team you have to perform like that.’ Failure to dominate possession has been a United problem for a few years, even stretching back to Sir Alex Ferguson’s time at the club. Last season, meanwhile, Everton beat United twice in the league, the second game proving to be David Moyes’s last before he was sacked in April. In the absence of defenders Phil Jones, Jonny Evans and Chris Smalling, McNair will continue alongside Marcos Rojo at the back, getting the nod ahead of Tyler Blackett because he is right-footed. Marouane Fellaini is back in the United squad but is unlikely to start. David Moyes' last game in charge of United was his second defeat to former club Everton in April .

"QPR midfielder Joey Barton has accused Arsenal of having 'no spine or character'. Gunners manager Arsene Wenger celebrates 18 years at the helm with a London derby against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Sunday. In the previous campaign, the Frenchman's side took just three points from a possible 15 in away matches against the other teams in the top seven, conceding 21 goals. Joey Barton believes that the big teams work out Arsene Wenger's tactics . Arsene Wenger's (right) side go to Stamford Bridge on Sunday to face Chelsea, and the Frenchman's record against Jose Mourinho (left) is terrible - never registering a win against the Portuguese . Speaking to BBC Radio 5 live, Barton said that rival managers 'had Wenger on toast'. 'In big games they get under his skin and work them out tactically,' he explained. Barton said: 'You think of his teams of [Emmanuel] Petit, [Patrick] Vieira, [Tony] Adams, [Martin] Keown and all those kind of warriors. You look around the Arsenal dressing room now, the people who would win you those kind of games against the top four clubs - they don't really have an abundance of them. Barton believes the current Arsenal team lack 'warriors' like former Gunners Patrick Vieira and Tony Adams . 'At the latter stages of a season they come unstuck because of that lack of - I hate to say it - a real lack of character or spine within the team.' Away to Everton, that poor away form looked likely to continue as Wenger saw his side go 2-0 down, before managing to take a point away with late goals from Aaron Ramsey and Olivier Giroud. The Gunners biggest test comes on Sunday at Chelsea. And with Wenger's terrible record against Jose Mourinho, Arsenal will do well to get something out of the game.","Joey Barton believes that the big teams work out Arsene Wenger's tactics .

"A stunning new map that reveals a shrinking Antarctica in unprecedented detail has been made available to the public. The map, which was created by stitching together 3,150 individual satellite images, offers the most detailed view of the continent since 1997. By comparing it to earlier maps of the same regions, scientists have found large chunks of ice in the Antarctic disappearing into the surrounding waters. Scroll down for interactive map . The map, which was created by stitching together 3,150 individual satellite images, offers the most detailed view of the continent since 1997. The Canadian Space Agency, along with the University of Waterloo, collected the images over several months in 2008 aboard the Radarsat-2 satellite . The Canadian Space Agency, along with the University of Waterloo, collected the images over several months in 2008 aboard the Radarsat-2 satellite. This satellite was able to cut through cloud cover to get a more accurate reading. Its high-resolution images were then tiled together into a coast-to-coast view of the entire continent. 'These colours in a nutshell represent different physical characteristics of the ice, which the scientist can interpret,' Professor Ellsworth LeDrew, director of the Canadian Cryospheric Information Network, told Emily Gertz at Popular Science. 'It's what is called polarimetric information. It's like looking through a camera's polarising filter. Some wavelengths are up and down and some are side to side.' This satellite was able to cut through cloud cover to get a more accurate reading. Its high-resolution images were then tiled together into a coast-to-coast view of the entire continent. This image shows a closeup view of Antarctica near the Ronne Ice Shelf . The Antarctic ice sheet is more unstable than first thought with a recent study suggesting melting began 5,000 years earlier than previously believed. The study was conducted by an international team including researchers from Germany, Canada, Hawaii, Lapland and Australia. It reveals that shrinking of the vast ice sheet accelerated during eight distinct periods between 20,000 and 9,000 years ago. During one period 14,600 years ago, melting glaciers released so many icebergs into the ocean that sea level rose 6.5ft (two metres) in just 100 years. The results provide the first clear evidence for dramatic melting in Antarctic's and reflect predictions for the region's future. It also follows recent news that destabilisation of part of the West Antarctic ice sheet has already begun and could be 'unstoppable.' Professor LeDrew added that scientists can use the data to show see where the edge of a glacier is, or where the ice is thinning as land bound glaciers expand towards the sea. Ships also use the information for navigation, he says. The map is currently available free of charge to the public online, via the Polar Data Catalogue. 'The Earth's polar regions are considered a bellwether for the effects of climate change,' said Professor LeDrew. 'When compared to the previous Antarctic mosaic, we can map changes in the icescape with unprecedented accuracy and confidence.' A similar mosaic for Greenland is currently underway and the researchers plan to continue creating mosaics of Antarctica every few years in order to track ice cover. Earlier this year, Nasa said vast glaciers in West Antarctica seem to be locked in an irreversible thaw linked to global warming that may push up sea levels for centuries. In a few hundred years they say the irreversible melt that has already started could eventually add four to 12ft (1.2 to 3.7m) to current sea levels. A Nasa study looking at 40 years of ground, airplane and satellite data of what researchers call 'the weak underbelly of West Antarctica' shows the melt is happening faster than scientists had predicted, crossing a critical threshold that has begun a domino-like process. Evidence shows 'a large sector of the West Antarctic ice sheet has gone into a state of irreversible retreat', says lead author Eric Rignot of the University of California, Irvine, and Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. The coastal ends of the glaciers rest on bedrock below sea level, holding back a vast weight of ice and making them vulnerable to melt, he said. 'It does seem to be happening quickly,' says University of Washington glaciologist Ian Joughin, lead author of a separate study into the same phenomenon. 'We really are witnessing the beginning stages.'

"Step too far: Jonathan Charles Stevens, 24, was arrested for impersonating a police officer on Sunday after he pulled over a real cop in Tampa, Florida . A Florida man pretending to be a police officer pushed his luck way too far on Sunday when he pulled over a real cop - and got arrested for his troubles. Incredibly, this is the second time in three months that 24-year-old Jonathan Charles Stevens, of Palmetto, has been charged with impersonating an officer. According to Tampa Police, Stevens was driving a white Chevy Tahoe equipped with flashing red and blue emergency lights. He then reportedly used the lights to stop a female officer at around 10.30pm at 17th Street North and 7th Avenue East in Ybor City. Stevens told the policewoman that he wanted to report a reckless driver. Officers say that he had also called police dispatch to tell them about the same complaint. Stevens reportedly told the officer that he worked for Homeland Security, and he had a Glock .45-caliber handgun and a badge around his neck. But, according to the police report, the policewoman grew suspicious of the phony agent. She continued to talk to Stevens and discovered that his vehicle was not registered to any government agency. After further questioning, the man admitted that he wasn't a law enforcement officer. He also didn't have a concealed weapon permit.

"The mother of the Boston Marathon bombing suspects was put on the CIA terrorist watchlist 18 months before the tragedy, officials said on Friday as lawmakers revealed Zubeidat Tsarnaev is now considered a 'person of interest' in the federal investigation into the attack. Two U.S. lawmakers said that investigators have traveled to Dagestan, Russia, . to learn more from close associates who knew the suspects' mother. The outspoken mother shot back, saying that claims that she had ties to terrorist activity were 'lies and hypocrisy.' Mother: Zubeidat Tsarnaeva (left, in a media interview in Dagestan, Russia on Thursday) has claimed her sons were framed for the Boston Marathon bombings (right, Zubeidat's mugshot for a 2012 shoplifting arrest) In a series of bizarre media . interviews, Zubeidat Tsarnaev has staunchly defended her sons Tamerlan . and Dzhokhar, who are accused of the terrorist attack on April 15 that . left 3 dead and more than 260 injured. Zubeidat Tsarnaeva, 45, has sparked outrage for her incendiary comments to the media and now officials say they are probing her possible involvement in the tragedy. '[She (Zubeidat) is a person of interest that we're looking at to see if she helped radicalize her son, or had contacts with other people or other terrorist groups,' Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger, a Democrat from Maryland, who serves on the House Intelligence Committee, said on Friday. Rep. Michael McCaul, the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said investigators are looking into whether the mother encouraged her son, Tamerlan, to embrace Islam extremism. Outrage: The world has been shocked at Zubeidat Tsarnaev's claims that the entire Boston Marathon attack was a setup (the mother speaking to the UK's Channel 4 News in Russia this week) Family: Investigators want to know about the mother's influence over her sons (Zubeidat, center in an undated photo holding a baby Tamerlan, with the boy's father Anzor (left) and uncle Muhamad Suleimanov (right) 'The mother in my judgment has a role in his radicalization process in terms of her influence over him (and) fundamental views of Islam,' the Texas Republican told reporters. He added that a team of U.S. investigators had traveled to the Chechen region to interview sources who knew the family. Unnamed officials have also reveled that the CIA asked for the Boston terror suspect and his mother to be added to a terrorist database in the fall of 2011, after the Russian government contacted the agency with concerns that both had become religious militants, according to officials briefed on the investigation. About six months earlier, the FBI investigated Tamerlan Tsarnaev and his mother, Zubeidat Tsarnaeva, also at Russia's request, one of the officials said. The FBI found no ties to terrorism. Hometown: U.S. officials are traveling to Dagestan, Russia (pictured) to interview associates who know the bomber's mother, Zubeidat Tsarnaev . Tip off: Officials now say they had been warned about possible ties Zubeidat Tsarnaev had with terrorism (pictured, the home of Anzor Tsarnaev, in Dagestan) The revelation that the FBI had also investigated Zubeidat Tsarnaeva and the CIA arranged for her to be added to the terrorism database deepened the mystery around the family. Zubeidat Tsarnaeva to the news on Friday, slamming officials who are trying to implicate her. 'It's all lies and hypocrisy,' she told The Associated Press from Dagestan. 'I'm sick and tired of all this nonsense that they make up about me and my children. People know me as a regular person, and I've never been mixed up in any criminal intentions, especially any linked to terrorism.' A former official of the Russian government told Congress on Friday that Cold War-era distrust may have made American officials less inclined to act on tips from Russian security services about one of the alleged Boston Marathon bombers . Andranik Migranyan, a former member of the President Council of the Russian Federation, told a House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Friday that Russia and the United States have long viewed each other warily. Because of that, he said, American officials, in his words, 'just didn't pay enough attention' when . Suspect: Both the CIA and the the FBI were warned about Tamerlan Tsarnaev by the Russian government . Russian agencies asked the FBI and CIA to look into bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev. The Tsarnaevs are ethnic Chechens from southern Russia who immigrated to the Boston area in the past 11 years. This . new revelation shows that both major intelligence agencies were aware . of his possible terrorist  ties, as it has been reported that . the Russians contacted the FBI about Tsarnaev earlier that year. The FBI . conducted an investigation and did not find he had any terror . connections. Tamerlan was listed on the U.S. government's highly classified central database of people it views as potential terrorists. But . the list is so vast that authorities did not automatically keep close . tabs on him, sources close to the bombing investigation said on Tuesday. The details come as it's revealed . that Russian authorities had contacted the U.S. government repeatedly . about Tsarnaev's suspected ties to radical Islam, according to senators . briefed on the FBI investigation. The FBI has previously said that it was only contacted once regarding a potential threat posed by Tsarnaev, but after an investigation, found nothing of concern. Following a closed briefing of the Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday, Sen. Richard Burr, a Republican representing North Carolina, said he believed that Russia alerted the United States about Tsarnaev in 'multiple contacts.' Revealed: The name of one of the Boston Marathon bombing suspects, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, was listed on the U.S. government's highly classified central database of people it views as potential terrorists . Tsarnaev, 26, was killed in a police shootout early on April 19, while his younger brother Dzhokhar, 19, was captured later that day. Prosecutors say the brothers, ethnic Chechens who had been living in the United States for more than a decade, planted two bombs that exploded near the finish line of the marathon on April 15. Sources said Tamerlan Tsarnaev's details . were entered into TIDE, a database maintained by the National . Counterterrorism Center, because the FBI spoke to him in 2011 while . investigating a Russian tip-off that he had become a follower of radical . Islamists. Warning: Officials investigated Tamerlan and his mother in 2011 but found no ties to terrorism . The FBI found nothing to suggest he was an active threat, but all the same placed his name on the 'Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment' list. The FBI has not said what it did find about Tsarnaev. But the database, which holds more . than half a million names, is only a repository of information on people . who U.S. authorities see as known, suspected or potential terrorists . from around the world.Because . of its huge size, U.S. investigators do not routinely monitor everyone . registered there, said U.S. officials familiar with the database. As . of 2008, TIDE contained more than 540,000 names, although they . represented about 450,000 actual people, because some of the entries are . aliases or different name spellings for the same person. Fewer than 5 . per cent of the TIDE entries were U.S. citizens or legal residents, . according to a description of the database on the NCTC website. The . TIDE database is one of many federal security databases set up after . the September 11, 2001, attacks. The database system has been criticized . in the past for being too cumbersome, especially in light of an . attempted attack on a plane in 2009. Intelligence and security agencies . acknowledged in Congress that they had missed clues to the Detroit . 'underpants bomber' Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab. Officials said after the . incident that he had been listed in the TIDE database. Republican Senator Susan Collins said there were problems in sharing information ahead of the Boston bombings, too. 'This . is troubling to me that this many years after the attacks on our . country in 2001 that we still seem to have stovepipes that prevent . information from being shared effectively,' she said. Collins was . speaking after the FBI gave a closed-door briefing to the Senate . Intelligence Committee on Tuesday, but she did not elaborate. Bombing suspects: Tsarnaev, 26, (right in black hat) was killed in a police shootout early on April 19, while his younger brother Dzhokhar, (left in white hat) was captured later that day . However, in the case of Tamerlan . Tsarnaev, the issue appeared to be that because he was not deemed an . active threat, his name was only briefly on a list that would have . triggered monitoring. Tsarnaev was not put on the 'no-fly' list that would have banned him from boarding an airplane in the United States. Neither was he named on the Selectee List, which would have required him to be given extra security screening at airports. Another list, the Terrorist Screening Database, is a declassified version of the highly classified TIDE with fewer details about terrorist suspects. One source said Tsarnaev was on this list, too. After being put in the TIDE system, his name was entered in another database, this one maintained by the Homeland Security Department's Customs and Border Protection bureau which is used to screen people crossing U.S. land borders and entering at airports or by sea. Tsarnaev was flagged on that database when he left the United States for Russia in January 2012 but no alarm was raised, presumably because the FBI had not identified him as a threat after the interview. Picking a fight: Tracy argues that the media and 'play actors' have made up the bombing that left three dead and more than 260 injured . When he returned from Russia six months later, he had already been automatically downgraded in the border database because there was no new information that required him to continue to get extra attention. So he did not get secondary inspection on his re-entry at New York's JFK Airport. It was unclear exactly what the procedure was for such a downgrade. Sean Joyce, deputy director of the FBI, defended the FBI's performance in the Boston bombings at two closed hearings in Congress on Tuesday. While government agencies declined to publicly discuss how the watch list system handled Tsarnaev, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano disclosed some details at a separate, open hearing on immigration on Capitol Hill. 'Yes, the system pinged when he was leaving the United States. By the time he returned, all investigations - the matter had been closed,' Napolitano told the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday.","Zubeidat Tsarnaev and her son Tamerlan were added to the CIA terrorism watchlist 18 months before the Boston bombings .

"The son of a hockey legend has been arrested for allegedly selling New York Rangers' player Derek Boogaard the prescription drugs that killed him in 2011. Jordan Hart, 31, was arrested on Long Island on Tuesday morning by the DEA's New York drug enforcement task force and appeared in court in Manhattan on Tuesday. A Utah physician's assistant, Oscar Johnson, was also arrested in the death and stands accused of writing bogus oxycodone prescriptions for Hart,FOX reported. Hart, the son of Islanders player Gerry Hart and himself a former minor league player, is accused of selling 28-year-old Boogaard the pills ahead of his death in Minneapolis on May 13, 2011. Arrest: Jordan Hart (left), a former minor league player, has been arrested for allegedly selling Rangers' player Derek Boogaard (right) the prescription drugs that killed him in May 2011 . Taken in to custody: Hart, who is from Long Island, is pictured after his arrest on Tuesday morning . It was ruled that his death, which came after years of injuries and addiction to painkillers, was caused by an overdose on oxycodone and alcohol. Boogaard had become addicted to prescription painkillers and Ambien while playing for the Minnesota Wild between 2005 and 2010, Fox reported. For the 2010-2011 season, he signed with the New York Rangers but at the end of 2011, he suffered a severe concussion in an on-ice fight that left him with debilitating migraines. He never played for the team again. Family ties: Hart is the son of NHL legend and New York Islanders player Gerry Hart, pictured in 1976 . To deal with the injury, he turned to Ambien, which was prescribed by the Rangers, and Percocet - which contains oxycodone - which had not been prescribed by the team. When he was looking for a source of the drugs, an unidentified teammate put him in touch with Hart, who began supplying him in Long Island, the indictment said. Johnson, the Utah physician's assistant, allegedly often wrote the prescriptions for him. In March 2011, Boogaard tried to return to the team but within weeks, teammates noticed that he was barely able to stand and appeared to be under the influence of something, the indictment said. He was sent to rehab in California for a few weeks before deciding to spend the summer in Minneapolis. But first, he stopped in New York to pick up belongings - and one final stash from Hart. On April 29, he met with Hart in Huntington, Long Island and spent $4,000 to purchase pills, which the player then kept at his Minnesota apartment, the indictment said. He returned to rehab and, after being given permission to leave again for a family commitment two weeks later, he flew to Minnesota, where he took one of the pills and headed out for a night of heavy drinking. He was found dead in bed in his brother's Minneapolis apartment on May 13, 2011. After his death, an examination of his brain found that he had chronic traumatic encephalopathy (C.T.E.), a degenerative brain disease that is caused by repeated blows to the head. New life: Hart, pictured with his wife Bella (also pictured right), was investigated after Boogaard's father found a check written to him for $4,000. He could face up to 20 years in prison if convicted . Legend: Hart is pictured with his wife Bella and family, including his hockey legend dad Gerry (center) After Boogaard's death, his father, Len, found the check for $4,000, which had led to the investigation, the New York Times reported. Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, said that Hart was accused of 'feeding Boogaard's growing, debilitating addiction'. 'Ultimately, that addiction, fueled at least in part by the drugs that Johnson illegally prescribed, and Hart peddled for cash, culminated in Boogaard's tragic overdose death,' he said. Hart is charged with one count of conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute oxycodone. If convicted, he faces a maximum of 20 years in prison. He appeared in court on Tuesday and wiped away tears from his eyes as he entered a not-guilty plea, the New York Times reported. He was ordered released on $500,000 bond. His attorney said prosecutors would have a hard time proving the player died from pills Hart allegedly sold him. Debilitating: Boogaard is pictured fighting in a game against the Philadelphia Flyers. He was left with a severe concussion that forced him to quit, and he became increasingly hooked on painkillers . Missed: His family shake hands and receive a game worn jersey from Josh Harding (37) and Nick Schultz (55) of the Minnesota Wild in November 2011 - six months after the player was found dead in Minneapolis . Johnson, 59, is charged with 26 counts of distributing and possessing with intent to distribute oxycodone, each of which carries a maximum of 20 years in prison. Johnson, who allegedly sold as many as 3,000 pills to Hart, was also charged with one count of making a false statement, which carries a maximum of five years in prison. He was arrested in Salt Lake City and also appeared in court on Tuesday. Hart, who married his wife Bella in 2012, had been a prospect for the Islanders while in college but never played for them. Instead, he played minor league hockey and ended his career in 2009 with the Bridgeport Sound Tigers. His father, Gerry, played for the Islanders from 1972 to 1979. Hart Sr. also played for the Detroit Red Wings, Quebec Nordiques and St. Louis Blues.","Boogaard, 28, was found dead from a painkiller and alcohol overdose after a night of heavy drinking in Minneapolis in May 2011 .

"Emerging from his campaign bus with ‘Better Together’ helpfully written on his hand, John Prescott had one simple job to do – convince Scots voters they should stay in the UK. But it was one simple job too far for the former deputy prime minister, who quickly seemed to forget his brief and instead caused division. Clutching notes that reminded him that he was ‘Welsh and Northern’, he didn’t exactly have them rolling in the aisles when he told an already hostile crowd that the England and Scotland football teams should be combined. Labour bruiser John Prescott appeared to have been given instructions not to forget to mention the cross-party Better Together - with reminders on his notes and even the back of his left hand . His scrawled notes also included references to being Welsh, buying whiskey at the airport and how he was not planning to talk about currency uncertainties . Not content with that, he then suggested Labour voters were not clever enough to understand the arguments about independence, leading one senior party source to brand him a ‘f****** moron’. Lord Prescott, 76, was in Rutherglen, near Glasgow, to take on the Scottish nationalists with only a week until the referendum, but he seemed to be stuck in general election mode, launching an attack on the party’s Better Together allies, the Tories. At one point, Lord Prescott, who famously punched a man who threw an egg at him on the campaign trail, lost his temper and shouted in the face of a man who had heckled him. He turned to the man who had been chanting, ‘Thirty pieces of silver’, and said, ‘Listen, I’d give you 30 pieces of silver to just shut up’. The Labour peer was told ‘you’re mental’ by a man in the crowd after he said England and Scotland should unite their football teams in order to beat Germany. ‘When I got on the campaign bus they told me it was the Scottish football team’s coach? I’ve got a revolutionary thought for you,’ he told the crowd of both Yes and No activists. ‘Perhaps if England and Scotland together had one team, we could at last beat the Germans, who knows?’ He later claimed his remarks had been a joke, but added: ‘There is a serious question there about whether England, Wales, Germany (sic) should be treated as separate teams in Europe. 'But I’m not making that proposal . . . the national feeling in the countries is they wouldn’t want to. 'They still want to shout for England even though we lose every bloody time. They want to shout for Scotland.’ The former Deputy Prime Minister waved a copy of the Daily Mail, which today published an article by Prime Minister David Cameron . Lord Prescott was surrounded by No campaigners, as he insisted he would not talk about currency unions but about a more simple argument about why Scotland was better off in the UK . Lord Prescott even suggested England and Scotland should form a joint football team to 'at last beat the Germans' The Labour Party has argued that in the event of a No vote there will be further devolution to Scotland as they and their pro-union allies – the Conservatives and Lib Dems – have each promised this. But Lord Prescott cheerily went off-message, saying: ‘When Cameron is up here he talks about devolution. They fought us for 30 years on devolution. They do not believe in it.’ Clutching a copy of yesterday’s Daily Mail front page featuring the Prime Minister’s plea to Scots to remain in the UK, Mr Prescott said: ‘I picked the Mail up, never been known to pick the Mail up. ‘What a headline. Cameron says, “don’t rip our family apart”. Bloody hell, they’ve ripped our families apart for decades.’ Lord Prescott then seemed to suggest the issues surrounding the referendum debate were too complex for Labour supporters. He said: ‘I’m not here necessarily to talk about the currency and all the uncertainties, most Labour voters will find that very difficult to understand.’ Yes and No campaigners jostled on the streets of Glasgow, yelling slogans and trying to drown out Lord Prescott's speech . The visit came as Ed Miliband gave a speech in Cumbernauld, near Glasgow. The Labour leader was challenged by a party member who urged him to apologise for the lacklustre campaign. Rosemary Holmes told him: ‘This might be the time to say we in the Labour party miscalculated because we thought the message was clear about what we stood for and what we were promising in this referendum. ‘That message is coming out now with a timetable, but we have eight days to go. We have to try something different – we have to be honest and say, “sorry, we got it wrong”.’ Mr Miliband yesterday said he would be campaigning in Scotland all week. A poll last night showed that support for independence among Labour voters had fallen from 30 per cent to 26 per cent in the past fortnight. Better Together leader Alistair Darling issued a grave warning to Scots about independence .","Former Deputy Prime Minister tries to convice Scots voters .

"Jose Mourinho's Chelsea are top of the Premier League and unbeaten entering Sunday's clash with Arsenal, but the Blues boss does not expect the feats of Arsene Wenger's 'Invincibles' to be emulated. The Gunners negotiated the 2003-04 Premier League season without defeat, an achievement previously only performed by Preston in the 1880s. Just like Chelsea's one-in-a-generation 6-0 defeat of the Gunners in March - in Wenger's 1,000th game in charge - Mourinho believes it is not something which will happen in the modern Premier League era. Arsenal won the Premier League in 2003-04 without losing a single game, it was the last time they won it . 'It's something that happened once in a lifetime,' Mourinho said. 'I don't see, in modern football with the competitiveness of this Premier League, one team being champion without a defeat. 'That will stay in the history as the second and the last time. '(That is) my opinion, but we don't know.' Chelsea have won five and drawn one of their six Premier League games so far this season and face a Gunners side also unbeaten. Jose Mourinho said the it was a 'once in a lifetime' achievement and did not think Chelsea would emulate it . Arsenal capitulated on their last visit to Stamford Bridge, a match remembered for the gaping defensive holes as well as referee Andre Marriner's mistake in sending off Kieran Gibbs for a handball committed by Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. Mourinho anticipates a much sterner test of his side, which features former Arsenal captain Cesc Fabregas pulling the strings in midfield. Fabregas was a precocious teenager when Arsenal won the 2004 title. 'They will always be a difficult opponent,' the Blues boss added. Mourinho loves the intensity of a derby day and testing himself against the best. Last time the two sides met Andre Marriner sent of Kieran Gibbs after a handball by Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain . His players will also need no additional motivation, just a few instructions. 'I like it difficult,' he said. 'I like to play against the best. My players also like it. 'Sometimes we are worried about the focus and we are worried about the approach. 'When you play big matches you know the players are more than ready for that. 'I have a meeting with them, but not a motivational meeting. Just a meeting to try to analyse a few things, a few images. 'Just about football. Never about the emotional side of it, or the motivational side of it.' Cesc Fabregas will face his old club for the first time when the two sides meet on Sunday .","Jose Mourinho's Chelsea are unbeaten and top of the Premier League .

"A friend recently asked where he should take his (second) wife on honeymoon. Without much hesitation, I suggested Ponta dos Ganchos in southern Brazil. Just one problem. I had not been there. My punt was based on pretty pictures on the internet and a feeling that Brazil in general has become one of the world’s hottest destinations (even though things have turned tricky in the build-up to the World Cup). It also filled me with a keen ambition to see this splendid retreat for myself. Paradise: Ponta dos Ganchos in Southern Brazil is a 25-bungalow beach resort where staff outnumber guests three to one . So, here I am — on the expansive terrace of bungalow 24 (excuse the name-dropping, but Paul McCartney has stayed in the bungalow next door), watching an old fishing boat chugging across a bay that looks more like a giant lake than the Atlantic Ocean. A range of hills is silhouetted on the horizon, two vultures are circling high above in the blue sky, and my own wife is splashing about in the infinity plunge pool, proffering insights such as: ‘Oh, my God, this is unbelievable!’ She is right, as usual. This beautiful and tranquil spot has managed to remain off the radar of discerning British travellers despite occupying a privately owned peninsula, about 20 miles south of Florianopolis . This is an extraordinarily beautiful and tranquil spot, one which somehow has managed to remain off the radar of discerning British travellers despite occupying a privately owned peninsula, about 20 miles south of Florianopolis in Santa Catarina, for more than 12 years. It is surrounded by the sea, and is hidden on a hill where every tree and shrub seems to be blooming with unbridled happiness. There are only 25 bungalows poking out from the lush greenery, each completely private, many with hammocks on the terrace, some with pools or hot tubs. There is a private beach, and across from the restaurant there is a little island where my friend and his blushing bride will be served dinner surrounded by hundreds of dancing candles. The two main investors — one from Uruguay, the other from Britain — wanted to launch a hotel that had only one rule: there should be no rules. Breakfast, lunch or dinner? The only rule is that there are no rules and guests can eat whatever, whenever they want . This means breakfast is available all day, dinner all night. You wear what you like when you like, and even if you never want to emerge from your bungalow, the charming staff — nearly all of whom come from the fishing village at the bottom of the hill — will miraculously tidy up without you noticing. Santa Catarina is unlike anywhere else in Brazil. There are native Germans, Italians, Poles, Russians, Japanese, Greeks, Irish, Indians, Africans and many more — most of whom arrived during the 19th century, lured by the lucrative whaling business and the opportunity for new beginnings. Those employed at Ponta dos Ganchos have impeccable manners and out-number guests by almost three to one. Some of them float around as if in a state of higher consciousness, imbuing the whole place with an irresistible Zen-like ambience. But they wear it all so lightly — just as the whole resort plays down its home-made eco system, its strict recycling policy, its quiet sophistication. You can fish, play tennis, work out in the gym (if you must), go rafting, kayaking and snorkelling, watch movies in the private cinema, or do nothing except listen to the creaking bamboos when the wind blows. Ponta dos Ganchos is part of the Relais & Chateaux group, which is generally indication that the food will be top-notch. It is — and it’s different, too. On offer at breakfast is a tasting menu that changes every day, comprising ten exquisite little offerings, from a shot of pineapple, coconut water and mint juice to miniature goat cheese-and-herb omelettes in little shells. Bathroom with a view: The bungalows all feature phenomenal views out to sea . Oysters and mussels — harvested locally — are available around the clock, and the baked sea bass dissolves in your mouth like butter, but with fewer calories. At dinner, there are French, American and Portuguese influences and the Brazilian wines are sensational. According to legend, Ganchos de Fora — as the village is called — was named after Captain Hook, referred to as Captain Ganchos (gancho means ‘hook’ in Portuguese). Another theory is that the name derives from the special hooks used by local fishermen. One morning, a member of staff takes us on a trail which ends up on a beach that is only accessible on foot. Here, we find two surfers bobbing up and down in the water, and hundreds of crabs scurrying around as if enjoying their own carnival. That evening, rain hammers down. We go to the beach. Forget Singin’ In The Rain — Swimmin’ In The Rain hits all the right notes and feels like a holy baptism of sorts. We are joined by gulls dive-bombing the water in search of a few tiddlers for supper. I read somewhere that Brazilian hospitality can be separated into two categories: before your stay at Ponta dos Ganchos, and after. This could well be right. What I know for sure is that my honeymoon recommendation is utterly brilliant. The Ultimate Travel Company (020 3051 8098, . theultimatetravel company.co.uk) offers seven nights at Ponta dos .

"As the players in blue shirts trudged downcast into the tunnel, manager Sean Dyche cut a path between them towards the far corner of the King Power Stadium where travelling fans were united in jubilation. For Burnley, who ended a goal drought stretching back to mid-August by twice coming from behind to draw — the point-saver arriving in the sixth minute of added time — this resembled a victory they are yet to savour in the Premier League. The two promoted sides have had vastly different starts in the top flight. While Burnley have four points from four draws, Leicester have scored 10 goals at home, a record that surpasses any other side in the League. VIDEO Scroll down to watch post-match reactions from Nigel Pearson and Sean Dyche . Ross Wallace curled in a free-kick in the 96th minute to claim a dramatic point for Burnley . The midfielder celebrates vociferous after netting the stunning last-gasp equaliser . Leicester (4-4-2): Schmeichel 5; De Laet 5, Morgan 6, Moore 5.5, Konchesky 6; Hammond 6 (James 78min, 5), Mahrez 7.5 (Knockaert 72, 5), Schlupp 7, Drinkwater 6; Vardy 7.5, Ulloa 6 (Nugent 63, 5).

Subs (not used): Gilks, Lafferty, Long, Hewitt. Booked: Ward, Arfield . Goals: Kightly 39' Wallace 90+6' Referee: Phil Dowd . Attendance: 31,448 . The conflicting ways Dyche and his opposite number Nigel Pearson greeted the final whistle reflected different expectations. ‘I thought it was much more a reminder of what we are about,’ said Dyche. ‘We started with a will and a demand. They were terrific from start to finish.’ Pearson, who enjoyed the high of a dramatic 5-3 win over Manchester United in Leicester’s last home game, was seething. ‘I’m annoyed,’ he said, acknowledging that Leicester, who had the lion’s share of the chances, missed a plum opportunity to climb to fifth. ‘We’re better than we were last season and they’re not as good,’ he added. ‘It’s disappointing because we should have won. It was a scrappy game, they didn’t come here to play fluid football, they came to be difficult to beat.’ Burnley have lifted themselves off the bottom of the table by being consistent in defence, with the exception of last week’s thrashing at West Bromwich. Goals, meanwhile, have been hard to come by. Their only other goal this campaign came in the 14th minute of the opening game of the season, a match they eventually lost 3-1 to Chelsea. So Michael Kightly’s strike, which levelled the score after Leicester’s opener, was very sweet after a wait of 10 hours and 54 minutes. However, it was three minutes too late to avoid breaking an unwanted club record set in the 1970-71 season of the longest spell without a goal. ‘I know we’re creating chances,’ said Dyche. ‘I thought we made a lot of good chances today but it’s the quality of the chances that are important. 'We’re trying to build the team and make it learn quickly. Leicester have been trying for this for years.’ Wes Morgan of Leicester City outjumps Ashley Barnes of Burnley in an aerial battle during the first half .

Data courtesy of the EA SPORTS Player Performance Index, the Official Player Rating Index of the Barclays Premier League . Leicester’s deserved breakthrough came in the 33rd minute with a smart finish from Jeff Schlupp, for his first Premier League goal. Riyad Mahrez used his quick feet to confound Scott Arfield and squeeze a ball into the box which Ghana star Schlupp took sweetly, angling into the top corner of the net. Burnley made their mark when an Arfield cross found Lukas Jutkiewicz, who knocked the ball down with his head. Kightly swept into the box to drive the ball past Kasper Schmeichel. Dyche, who has acknowledged his side need to improve in front of goal, slung his water bottle towards nearby advertising hoardings and raised his hands above his head in applause before letting a few expletives fly. It had been a while. Leicester, who have lost just once at home in their last 19 games, took just one minute to restore their lead through Mahrez, who has experienced a swift rise at Leicester since arriving from French Ligue Two side Le Havre nine months ago. The Algeria international burst into the box to head in a cross from the excellent Jamie Vardy, who combined well with Schlupp in the build-up to the goal. But a trip by Matty James on Arfield late in added time resulted in a free-kick and substitute Ross Wallace stepped up to fire home into the top corner from 20 yards to dramatically earn a share of the spoils, to the delight of Dyche.

"Former senior aides to Mitt Romney have hit back at the 'craven hypocrites' in the Republican party who just days before the election were clamouring for jobs in a Romney administration and are now belittling him. 'I'm sure Governor Romney is finding out now who his real friends are,' a former adviser told MailOnline. 'There were one or two well-known figures who were late committing to support him, were the most eager to curry favour when it looked like we would win and are now out there trashing the governor. 'In politics, when you win you are a genius and when you lose everyone calls you an idiot. But to see the way certain craven hypocrites are acting right now really sticks in the craw.' A happy Thanksgiving: But since his defeat in the presidential election, Mitt Romney has been under constant attack from other Republicans . Speaking on MSNBC, Dan Senor, a former top foreign policy adviser to Romney, accused some of the former Massachusetts supporters of being fair weather friends. At a big event in Ohio just days before the election, he said, there were leading figures cozying up to Romney and trying to land cabinet positions. 'Tens of thousands of people, you could feel the energy, a hundred top-tier Romney surrogates were at the event,' he remembered. 'I’m backstage with some of them - I won’t mention their names - but they’re talking about Romney like he’s Reagan. '""His debate performances were the best performances of any Republican nominee in presidential history. He’s iconic."" They were talking about him because they believed he was going to win in four or five days. And in fact, some of them were already talking to our transition to position themselves for a Romney cabinet.' Fight: Romney took on Barack Obama in a bitter battle for the White House waged over several months . Defeat: The Romneys after the candidate conceded defeat to Obama on November 6 . Within days, however, there was a 'stunning' turnaround as the same people turned on Romney with a vengeance. 'They were on television, it was unbelievable, it was five, six days later, absolutely eviscerating him,' Senor said. But the other senior adviser, who declined to be named when criticising senior Republicans, singled out Governor Bobby Jindal of Louisiana and Newt Gingrich as among those who had been quickest to lambast Romney. After Romney told donors on a post-election conference call that many voted had plumped for President Barack Obama because he had offered them 'gifts', Jindal said Romney's comments were 'absolutely wrong'. He said: 'We have got to stop dividing American voters. We need to go after 100 per cent of the votes, not 53 per cent - we need to go after every single vote.' Allies: Romney spent time on the campaign trail with Louisiana governor Bobby Jindal . Betrayal? Jindal and Newt Gingrich have both criticised Romney in the wake of his landslide defeat . That was a reference to Romney's notorious '47 per cent' comments in which he said that proportion of voters was dependent on government and would inevitably back a Democrat. Gingrich called the 'gifts' comments 'nuts' and 'insulting' to voters. The anonymous adviser said: 'Bobby Jindal wanted very, very much to be Vice President. He appeared publicly with Governor Romney after the 47 per cent comments, which the governor himself said were totally wrong. 'Newt Gingrich made it clear to us he wanted to be part of a Romney administration. 'Both these guys - and others - were the governor's best friend when it seemed he was on the brink of becoming our 45th President. Now they're calling him a bum. Real profiles in courage.'","Presidential candidate has come under fire from Republicans after loss .

"The cobra, one of the most recognizable rock formations in the badlands outside Moab, Utah, has been beheaded after standing tall for 245million years. The top of the precarious formation crumbled and fell last week. Bureau of Land Management officials say they aren't sure what caused the collapse, but they believe it was a combination of high winds, heavy rain and possibly lightning. Since the 1990s, the hoodoo has been a popular formation for climbers to scale thanks to its unique shape and relatively low top. The 'cobra' rock formation was a popular ascent for climbers - thanks to its unusual shape and its relatively low top . No more: Last week the cobra was 'beheaded' when he top of the formation fell off after enduring wind, rain and climbers for 245million years . Officials aren't sure whether the human traffic on the rocks contributed to the collapse. Climbers in the know say it was only a matter of time before the cobra lost its head. 'It was really a surprise to no one that that tower, at least the cap rock, was going to come off at some point in time,' Lisa Hathaway, a veteran climber, told the Salt Lake Tribune. On climbing site MountainProject.com, the first comment - from February 2002 - alludes to just how precarious the formation was . 'This sick tower gets my vote as ""most likely to fall down in the next 10 years"". What is holding it up?' wrote user George Bell. The cobra outlasted Mr Bell's prediction by only two and a half years - a remarkable margin of error considering it has stood for hundreds of millions of years. Another user on the site wrote: 'Why climb the Cobra? Because it shouldn't still be there.' The once-majestic rock outcropping - which is located about 20 miles northeast of Moab - now looks like a stump against the desert sky. The cobra formation gets its name, of course, from its remarkable shape.

"Rail passengers on Britain’s busiest commuter routes have delivered a damning verdict on their late, overcrowded and expensive services.

Overall nearly half (45per cent) of Southeastern’s passengers considered their ticket either poor or unsatisfactory in terms of value - the highest dissatisfaction level among the UK train companies. By contrast customers on the Yorkshire-to-London train company Grand Central rated their ticket the best value, with nearly eight out of ten (78per cent) judging it satisfactory or good and only 11per cent rating it poor or unsatisfactory. Other low marks for the value for money of tickets were scored by Abellio Greater Anglia where just over a third (35per cent) reckoned their ticket offered good or satisfactory value, followed by South West Trains (37per cent good or satisfactory) , First Capital Connect (38per cent) and Southern (39per cent).

Across all train companies, the national figure for those reckoning their ticket offered good or satisfactory value for money was still under half (45per cent) -  a slight improvement on a survey last year . Passenger Focus said the rise was likely to be a reflection on the Government’s decision to cap annual season ticket rises at the level of inflation.

The company’s managing director Charles Horton said: ‘We’re not surprised that our customers have responded to the survey in this way as we too were frustrated by the problems that hampered services over the winter.’ But Passenger Focus chief executive Anthony Smith said: ‘Getting trains on time is the key factor underpinning passenger satisfaction while how delays are dealt with is the key factor behind scores for passengers’ dissatisfaction. ‘Better communications during weather-related disruptions may have ensured passengers’ satisfaction in dealing with delays has held up with some train companies.’ East Coast, which has been run in the public sector since 2009 but is to be sold back to  a private operator in November, had an overall customer satisfaction level of 91per cent - one of the best nationally. Manuel Cortes, leader of the TSSA rail union, said: 'This is another vote of confidence in our only public-run rail franchise. Passengers have voted it the best service, just a year after the Office of Rail Regulation confirmed it was also the best value for taxpayers.’ Michael Roberts, director general of industry body the Rail Delivery Group, said: ‘Passengers are at the heart of what we do and the rail industry knows it must keep on getting better, driving up the quality of services to respond to customers’ needs.' Office of Rail Regulation chairman Anna Walker said: 'This survey is an excellent barometer of what matters to those at the heart of the railways - its passengers.' She added: ‘The results reinforce our decision to bring in tough new performance targets for the railways to reduce the disparity in punctuality between different routes and train services.’ Southeastern is run by Govia which is majority-owned by the Go-Ahead transport company. Last month the Government announced that a Govia Thameslink joint venture had won the battle to run a new mega-franchise - the Thameslink, Southern and Great Northern (TSGN) franchise - which will operate for seven years from this September. Rail Minister Stephen Hammond said: ‘While satisfaction remains high, passengers are demanding more trains, better connections and better customer service. ‘Over the next five years, we are spending more than £38 billion to maintain and improve the railways to meet these challenges, but train operators need to recognise that, while they have done good things, they need to do more.’","Southeastern's Kent to London tickets rated worst value .

"Fighter: Aimee Copeland, 24, has been upgraded to 'good' condition by doctors as her battle against the flesh-eating bacteria continues . The young woman who became the first . person to fall victim to a flesh-eating disease has been suffering the . worst pain of her entire ordeal, her father said. Aimee Copeland's agony has become so overwhelming that she has now started taking morphine after initially refusing medication. However in a Father's Day post on his blog, Andy Copeland said the painkillers were not enough to block his 24-year-old daughter's severe pain, which has spread beyond her amputation sites. Miss Copeland developed necrotizing fasciitis after cutting her leg in a fall on May 1 from a homemade zip line over a west Georgia river. Her left leg, other foot and both hands have been amputated at Doctors Hospital in Augusta. Despite her agony, Mr Copeland wrote on his blog that his daughter managed to wish him a happy Father's Day. Last week doctors upgraded her condition to serious from critical after Miss Copeland fought back from the brink of the death. On . June 17, Mr Copeland wrote on his blog: 'Over the past 48 hours, Aimee . has had the most difficult pain she’s experienced through her entire . ordeal.' He added: 'The surgery Aimee had on Friday is far more severe than any dressing change imaginable. Aimee is now taking pain medication in as liberal a dose as can be prescribed. 'If she even dared to refuse taking it, which she wouldn’t, then the doctors would most certainly administer it in an IV drip.' Agony: Aimee Copeland had hoped to be treated with only holistic medicine but the extent of her injuries were too severe . Her father said she occasionally cries from the pain but has to stop because the crying hurts her stomach. The . student had originally indicated that she felt a 'traitor to her . convictions' by using drugs to manage her pain, because she believed in . holistic medicine. Her father explained that his daughter had ‘struggled mightily’ with . pains shooting in her hands – even though they had been amputated. He . wrote: 'Although her condition had improved significantly, . her pain has been considerable. Phantom pain now plagues her ''hands''.' The . University of West Georgia student had to have her left leg amputated . at the hip, her right foot and both hands in order to save her life . after a cut to her leg became infected. The . pain has now spread from her amputation sites to a wound on her left . side and her right thigh where she has had skin grafts.

Much-loved: Aimee's friends and family are praying for her survival and eventual recovery (from left - Aimee, mother Donna, father Andy and sister Paige) The bacteria that attacked Miss Copeland's wound released a toxin that destroys skin, muscle and a layer of tissue below the skin known as fascia, her father said. Despite the painful skin grafts, the student has crossed several milestones in recent weeks. She can breathe on her own and no longer needs dialysis. She had been able to eat on her own but has trouble digesting solid food. Miss Copeland ate after her surgery on Friday but she ended up vomiting up everything during the night. This weekend, thousands of people took part in a fundraising event outside Atlanta to help the family with medical expenses. The two-day benefit concert in the family’s hometown of Snellville began at 5pm on Friday and ran  through to Saturday night. Andy Copeland's blog has . been an inspiration to many all over the world who admire the strength . and courage of the 24-year-old and her family. Progress: Aimee Copeland's condition has now been changed from serious to good at the Georgia hospital . Describing his daughter's phantom pains on the blog on June 6, Mr Copeland wrote:  'Although she has no hands, her brain . is apparently still telling her body that the hands are there. 'I asked . her if she could describe the pain and she told me, ""It feels like I . have been carrying bags of rocks"". 'She said her ''fingers'' feel . contorted and twisted. Nothing really helps her pain much.' Aimee has been trying . to keep positive about the extent of her injuries, but her father . revealed she struggled to keep calm and accept what has . happened to her. He wrote: 'This past week the proverbial poopy hit the fan for Aimee. She was . lashing out at her care givers, she was in pain, she was sick to her . stomach, she was unable to tend to her own basic needs and she was very . unhappy. She had every right to be unhappy.' After praying, he said his daughter had gained a sense of clam and returned to her normal 'sweet self'. 'Prayer has changed and . will continue to change much over the coming days, weeks, months and . years,' he said. When the student was able to say her first words, which they called Aimee Day, she said to her sister: 'Hello. Whoa. Wow, my mind is blown.' Mr Copeland was in church at the time and had to wait until the next day to hear his daughter's voice. When . her father finally got into Copeland's room around 5pm, he asked her . how she felt. He said he was thrilled to hear her respond: ‘It feels . weird being able to talk.’ Andy . Copeland described his daughter’s newly regained voice as weak and . raspy, but said that she already has been joking with family, talking . about her life at the hospital and asking what everyone else has been up . to. Miss Copeland has . improved incredibly rapidly with the support of her family and . well-wishers who have made donations on the website Mr Copeland set up . for his brave daughter. She was able to ask for ice-cream, and let her family know when she was bored and wanted a book to read. Miss Copeland suffered a deep gash in her leg after falling from the zip line over a Georgia river, and the bacteria took hold in the wound. Doctors at the local emergency room in .

"Former European light-middleweight champion Jamie Moore admits he thought his time was up after being shot twice in Marbella last month. The Salford native was attacked in the Spanish town, where he had been training Birmingham middleweight Matthew Macklin, and left for dead. However, the 35-year-old defied the odds to survive the ordeal and is back in Manchester on the road to recovery. VIDEO Scroll down to see a clip of the Jamie Moore documentary . On the mend: Jamie Moore is recovering in Manchester after his ordeal in Spain . Former champ: Moore was forced to retire from boxing in 2010 . But Moore says he feared the worst when he collapsed in a pool of blood on August 3. He recalls: 'I thought: ""I'm not going to make this"". I thought I was finished and it's the emptiest, most horrible feeling ever. I felt helpless and lonely – lying on a driveway at night bleeding to death. I thought: ""I can't die here … how am I going to leave my kids with no dad?"" 'Considering the circumstances,' Moore told the Guardian, 'I was really calm.

"After taking his company public last week, GoPro's 39-year-old founder Nick Woodman is now officially a billionaire. On Monday, the third day of trading for the sporty camera company, the stock price opened up an additional 8 percent from the close of business on Friday. GoPro shares are now up 60 percent from the IPO price of $24 a share. Cha-Ching! GoPro founder Nick Woodman is now a billionaire after taking the camera company he founded public . The day the company first went public, Woodman and his wife, Jill, who helped him found the business, sold 3.6 million shares of GoPro stock to rake in an astounding $86 million before taxes. As if that weren't enough, Forbes reports that Woodman still owns more than 52 million Class B shares, which gives him a voting stake of 48 percent of the company. When the company first went public, Woodman's shares were worth slightly more than $1.2 billion at the IPO price. As stock prices continue to increase, and including some of Woodman's other assets, Forbes estimates that his net worth is now more than $2.3 billion. Other investors are also cashing in on the IPO, including the Chinese tech manufacturer Foxconn, which owns about 11 million shares of GoPro stock that are worth a collective $425 million. Riverwood Capital, a private equity firm, currently has about $650 million in GoPro stock. Woodman's father, Dean, has also found himself an overnight millionaire. The elder Woodman loaned his son $200,000 to help get GoPro off the ground. Dean Woodman - who sold none of his shares at the IPO - now owns $280 million in GoPro shares. As Forbes notes, that is a 140,000 percent return on his initial $200,000 investment. Stock rising: GoPro stock prices have increased by 60 percent since its IPO on Thursday . The company, which has its headquarters in San Mateo, California, was founded in 2004 by Woodman and his wife. Its first product was a waterproof camera that used film. In 2006, it launched its first digital camera. Three years later it began selling a high-definition camera. The cameras are light, small and waterproof. They have other uses besides sports. TV producers use them to film in areas where big professional cameras can't go. Its list of competitors is short, but growing. Consumer electronics companies Garmin, Samsung and Sony have all entered the market. GoPro had the best-selling camcorder last year, according to government paperwork filed by the company. Since launching its high-definition camera in 2009, it has sold 8.5 million of them, including 3.8 million in 2013. Its cameras are sold in more than 25,000 stores and cost between $200 and $400. Competition: GoPro's list of competitors is short but growing, as Garmin, Samsung and Sony have all entered the market with similar products . It also sells accessories such as cases, battery packs and mounts that help users attach their cameras to surfboards, helmets or their wrists. It also has a free app and software that lets users edit, store and publish their videos to their social media accounts including Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and YouTube. Additional growth may come from the wild videos its cameras create, which the company hopes to use to create a media company. 'We believe GoPro is well-positioned to become the first media company whose content is captured exclusively using its own hardware,' the company said in its government filing.","GoPro went public on Thursday with an IPO price of $24 per share .

"As Cesc Fabregas prepares to face Arsenal with Chelsea this weekend, we asked Sportsmail's PHIL DUNCAN five questions about the Spaniard. Will he be booed? Will he celebrate? And was Arsene Wenger right to stick with Mesut Ozil rather than bring Cesc back? Cesc Fabregas will play for Chelsea against Arsenal at Stamford Bridge this Sunday . Fabregas learnt his trade and Arsenal and was the club captain... here are the questions that need answering . How do you feel about seeing Fabregas in Chelsea blue and how will the majority of Arsenal fans react to him at Stamford Bridge? It’s been hard to watch Fabregas in the Chelsea strip and even harder to see him doing so well. You don’t get many more loathed teams or indeed fans at the Emirates than those who sport the blue. But should we feel distaste towards the Spaniard? No. He wanted a move back to London, and Arsenal didn’t want him. What did we expect him to do? Join Spurs? Come on, he wants to win trophies. But forget Robin van Persie, Ashley Cole, Samir Nasri and the rest… this reunion is the one which will hurt the Arsenal fans the most. It's been hard to watch Cesc Fabregas in the Chelsea strip... but there was nothing else he could have done . Forget Robin van Persie, this reunion will hurt the most for Gunners fans . If he scores, do you expect him to celebrate, or show respect like Frank Lampard did to Chelsea supporters at Manchester City? I think you’ve got more chance of seeing Wojciech Szczesny score the perfect hat-trick than Fabregas celebrating a goal against the club who made him what he is today. He’s admitted he is still a Gooner at heart and would rather have donned the red of Arsenal this season than the blue of Chelsea after quitting Barcelona; that’s probably why the Chelsea fans don’t like him very much. Let’s just say that if he does do the unthinkable and score against his former employers, I’m confident he won’t do an ‘Adebayor’ and sprint the length of the pitch before sliding on his knees to antagonise the away fans. He’s better than that. Most people are. Frank Lampard was respectful after scoring against Chelsea... expect the same from Cesc . Fabregas is a Gooner at heart and would have rejoined the club were he to have the chance . There will be no chance of Fabregas replicating Emmanuel Adebayor and running the length of the pitch... What are your favourite memories of Cesc in an Arsenal shirt? Giving the Juventus trio of Emerson, Mauro Camoranesi and his mentor Patrick Vieira the runaround at Highbury before scoring and then teeing up Thierry Henry in Arsenal’s 2-0 win in the Champions League last eight will be somewhere near the top of the list. ‘He’s only 18, he’s better than Roy Keane,’ sung the Arsenal fans, and he certainly came of age that night. Staying in Europe his late spot-kick against Barcelona – scored on one leg after sustaining an injury winning the penalty – as Arsenal rallied back from two goals down to draw 2-2 at the Emirates in 2010. And, who can forget his solo strike against Tottenham where he snatched the ball on the halfway line to score against the arch enemy? Fabregas had many great moments at Arsenal: including this when he gave Juventus the runaround in 2006 . Fabregas scored a penalty despite an injury against hometown club Barcelona in 2010 . The captain ran from the halfway line to score against archrivals Tottenham in the same year . Are Arsenal better with – or without – Cesc in their midfield? This is a difficult question. We never wanted him to leave; he was our captain, talisman, and fans’ favourite, but how many medals can the Spaniard claim to have won at Arsenal? A solitary FA Cup triumph in 2005, and that was a fortunate win, on penalties against a Manchester United side far superior on the day. Undoubtedly a star player, who stood head and shoulders above his peers, but he is also one who personified a different Arsene Wenger era – a move away from the power of Petit, Vieira, Henry and Co and one built around slighter, diminutive players – albeit as skilful – but which ultimately has proved to be nowhere near as successful. Fabregas only won one trophy at Arsenal, the FA Cup after a penalty shoot-out in 2005 . His rise saw a move away from the physical side brought to the club by Patrick Vieira . Ozil or Fabregas? Who would you rather have directing operations for your team right now? Based on current form Fabregas, but is he a better player than Ozil? I’m not sure. Is his game more suited to the Premier League, however? Probably. That said I understand why Wenger didn’t move for Fabregas in the summer. He and Ozil could not have played in the same side, and when you’ve spent a club record fee on a player why would you undermine that by bringing in someone who lines up in the same position? Nor can we forget Aaron Ramsey’s breakthrough campaign last year. Would it have been as a step back to sign Fabregas? I think so. Nevertheless, he’s still a class act, a player who has delivered consistently in England, whether it was at Arsenal or now in the early stages of his career at Chelsea, and oozes star quality. Let’s hope he has an off-day on Sunday. Mesut Ozil is as good a player as Fabregas if not better, but the latter is better suited to the Premier League . A move for Fabregas would have been a step backwards... Arsene Wenger has done all he can .","Chelsea host Arsenal at Stamford Bridge this weekend .

"Eerie photos have emerged of hundreds of retired aircraft parked in rows and set formations in aviation graveyards across America. The 'boneyards' in Arizona, California and New Mexico are home to hundreds of retired commercial and military aircraft that are stored in the dry desert conditions to prevent them from going rusty. Boeing, McDonnell Douglas, Lockheed and Airbus store planes at these bases, with the hope the planes will fly again. However many are eventually scrapped or used for spare parts. Scroll down for video . Commercial aircraft sit on the tarmac at the Southern California Logistics Airport in Victorville, California. In the aftermath of the September 11th terrorist attacks, the airline industry suffered a drop in revenue which resulted in many older airplanes being taken out of service and grounded . There are 11 major bases across the U.S. that are used to store retired planes, yet these images are taken from largest and most densely populated bases. These are the Pinal Airpark in Marana and the 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group (AMARG) at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Tucson, Arizona, California's Southern Logistics Airport in Victorville and the Mojave Air & Space Port, and the Roswell International Air Center in Roswell, New Mexico.

An intact T-33 Shooting Star aircraft sits in the shadows of a dismantled B-47 Stratojet aircraft at the Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Center in Tucson, Arizona. More than 2,500 aircraft from all services are stored at the centre. Most of the aircraft are used for parts, returned to service, sold to foreign governments or donated to federal and state agencies . The Airpark is used as a parachute testing and training facility and in March Navy SEAL SCPO Brett Shadle was killed during parachute training at the facility, and another SEAL was injured. At the 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base there are more than $35billion (£22billion) worth of . outdated planes kept as spare parts for current models. The base was named after Lieutenants . Samuel H. Davis and Oscar Monthan who died in military aircraft . accidents during the First World War. This shot is an aerial image of the Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group (AMARG) located on the Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona. AMARG has approximately $35 billion (£22 billion) worth of aircraft, totalling around 4,500 planes, from all of various commercial and military companies . The planes in AMARG are used to replace more than 350,000 spare parts for active planes including engines, munitions, wiring and . electronics. Some planes are stored at the . base between deployments but for more than 80 per cent of the 4,500 . aircraft kept there are for parts. Current military planes stored at the base include an intact T-33 Shooting Star aircraft and dismantled B-47 Stratojet aircraft. Staff at the facility recycle, on average, more than . 19,000 parts worth $568million (£366million) and the U.S. government allows the military in other countries to buy parts and planes from the site. Major aircraft carriers in the U.S store dozens of passenger planes at the 5,000-acre former Air Force base in Victorville, California. The planes are mix of retired planes and planes that have been temporarily discontinued due to budget constraints.

"Several exclusive golf clubs in New York wouldn't let President Barack Obama play on their courses on Labor Day weekend, it emerged on Wednesday. The Trump National Golf Club, the Winged Foot Golf Club and the Willow Ridge Country Club all turned down Obama, NBC 4 New York reports. The news station says the president's advance team gave courses only a day or two of notice that Obama would be in the area, and clubs may have rejected the White House's request to protect their wealthy members from being inconvenienced during the holiday weekend. Scroll down for video . President Barack Obama, pictured here at a golf course on the island of Martha's Vineyard during his vacation last month, was reportedly turned away from several elite golf clubs in New York on Labor Day weekend . Membership dues at the swanky golf clubs run upward of $100,000 a year. NBC 4 says it learned of the president's golf plans from sources who were informed of the calls made by Obama's advance staff. The news station says it reached out to the clubs that were approached, but they declined to comment. The president was in New York on the weekend in question, and he was scheduled to overnight in West Chester Country on Friday after headlining a fundraisers in Rhode Island and New York earlier that day. The following evening Obama was to attend the nearby wedding of White House chef Sam Kass and MSNBC host Alex Wagner at Blue Hill Farm in Pocantico Hills. Obama had no other public events on his schedule Saturday. The day before the trip, Obama's chief spokesman said the president wouldn't be staying the night in New York after all and would instead return to the White House on Friday after his speaking engagements.

"Primary schools are squeezing pupils into temporary classrooms and building rooftop playgrounds in a desperate bid to cope with surging numbers, it was revealed today. The Local Government Association has warned that councils are going to 'extraordinary lengths' to ensure there are enough places for children across the country. This includes introducing extra reception classes, as well as using former police stations, church halls and other disused buildings for lessons. Birkdale Primary School children leaping high on their brand new rooftop playground . The primary school place crisis has been fuelled by a baby boom that began more than a decade ago, along with rising immigration and more parents opting out of the private sector. Experts have previously claimed that Labour and the Coalition have ignored repeated warnings to act over impending shortages. Births in England have been steadily rising since 2002, causing a surge in the number of primary aged pupils from 2010. A blackhole of at least £1billion in school place funding is compounding the problem, according to the LGA. This has led to local authorities borrowing millions of pounds from developers, raiding school maintenance cash and other building programmes in order to plug the gap. Last year, councils created an additional 90,000 primary places, but analysis by the LGA reveals a further 130,000 would still be needed by 2017/18 – and 80,716 new secondary places by 2019/2020. Under-pressure schools are already turning IT and music suites into classrooms or using mobile teaching areas. Some are considering bussing pupils to different areas, building on split sites and even on the green belt. A baby boom that began more than a decade ago, along with rising immigration and more parents opting out of the private sector have fuelled the crisis . The only way was up for Birkdale Primary School when it expanded to meet rising pupil numbers. Architects put the playground on the extended roof of the 378-pupil school in Southport, Merseyide, due to a lack of space. The facility was unveiled in February as part of a £1.5million scheme to create new classrooms, a kitchen and entrance to the school, and was funded through Sefton Council's New Starts programme. Headteacher Nick Sheeran said: 'We're all thrilled with the development at the school. 'It was a joy to see the faces of our children when they first saw their new play space. 'It was an incredible feat of skill and engineering and all involved should feel very proud of their achievement.' Inspectors said: 'Pupils can access an exciting range of exercise equipment, and the new roof-top 'playdeck' provides an ingenious solution to the school's previous lack of outdoor space.' Brighton and Hove Council is converting a former police station into a junior school, while a former infant school is being leased back to officials by a further education college. Bournemouth is considering introducing village schools in former church halls or day centres. LGA research published today shows that more than three-quarters of councils did not receive enough government money to create the extra school places needed in their area between 2011/12 and 2016/17. A survey of chief finance officers in 150 English councils found that 38 per cent had borrowed money as a result. Almost a quarter (22 per cent) took money from other building programmes and half raided funds from programmes such as school building maintenance, while 67 per cent used cash put aside by developers. Councillor David Simmonds, chairman of the LGA's Children and Young People's Board, said: 'Mums and dads expect their child to be able to get a place at a good local school and this research shows councils are delivering, but at a cost.' * Parents fear their children are being rammed into 'cattle classes' putting their safety at risk amid the growth of supersize primaries, according to a survey of 2,000 parents by the Netmums website. One in four believe that areas around school gates have become 'dangerously overcrowded' due to an influx of primary pupils. Over half – 53 per cent – want their children taught in smaller classes, while almost one in five think that schools are packing too many youngsters into classrooms.","Local Government Association warns children are being squeezed in .

"Steve Bruce spent close to £40m in the summer transfer window, but the Hull manager cannot have done many better bits of business than the acquisition of Mohamed Diame and Andy Robertson. The pair, who cost about £6.3m between them, combined to score the crucial first goal against Crystal Palace before Nikica Jelavic sealed the points with a minute to go, ending Neil Warnock’s run of unbeaten league matches. Diame’s header in the 60th minute from Robertson’s left-wing cross was his third goal in four matches since signing from West Ham. VIDEO Scroll down for reaction from both managers .

Jelavic then added his fourth goal of the season in the closing stages after being put through on goal by Jake Livermore. ‘In the end it was a wonderful cross and a great finish from Diame to get us the victory then a good finish from Jela too,’ Bruce said. ‘I first came across Diame when he was at Wigan and blasted one in . ‘I think he got me the sack when I was at Sunderland, actually. He’s a really good player. ‘He’s got a right foot, a left foot and now he’s scored with a header. He’s not quite complete but he’s big, strong, athletic, he handles the ball well. He’s good in the air. ‘He’s had a really good start so let’s hope it continues.’ Hull came into this having conceded 13 goals in a winless run of five matches, so it was little surprise that Bruce opted to revert to the 3-5-2 system that has served him so well in his two years with the club. The Tigers based promotion from the Championship and then survival on a sound defensive base but that steely determination has eluded them recently. The onus was on wingbacks Ahmed Elmohamady and Robertson to bombard Palace with crosses and Hull finally carved out a chance when the visitors failed to fully clear a delivery from the former. Diame played a one-two with Abel Hernandez to create space eight yards out but the Senegal midfielder’s shot from an angle flashed across the face of goal and wide. The visitors finally cracked on the hour mark. Hull had plenty of bodies forward and another accurate Robertson cross from the left was met by the head of Diame, giving Julian Speroni no chance. Yannick Bolasie was quiet but burst into life when he checked inside to shoot from 30 yards. At 39, goalkeeper Steve Harper was sprightly enough to keep it out with a one-handed save.

"History buff: Carolyn Ekins cooked ration recipes for years before plunging into WWII life . Carolyn Ekins recalls the day her mother-in-law revealed the highlight of  her wartime childhood. ‘The weekly treat for her and her sister was sharing one fried egg,’ she says. ‘I thought: “Wow, how did you cope?” ’ Carolyn’s interest was more than merely academic. A history buff, she had been cooking ration recipes for fun for many years, and knew that the frugal wartime regime had actually left the population healthier — despite the food shortages — than it had ever been before. ‘There was a huge team of people at the Ministry of Health during the war working on healthy recipes that contained loads of vegetables,’ she says. ‘That’s what really captured my imagination that you could live on a lot less and feel good on it. It struck me that living on Forties rations might be an interesting way to lose weight and save money.’ The social media administrator from Nottingham had fought a losing battle with her weight for many years. At her heaviest, she tipped the scales at almost 25st. ‘Everyone has a crutch they can rely on and mine has been food,’ she says. ‘I’m an emotional eater.’ A series of family traumas, including separation from her husband, had led her eating habits to spiral out of control until she worried for her own wellbeing. ‘I had a racing pulse, I was sweating, my back was hurting,’ she says. And as a single mother to three children, Jess, now 25, Josh, 21, and Emily, 16, she felt a responsibility to look after her health. And so she embarked on a year-long ration diet. The results were extraordinary. In 12 months, Carolyn lost 5st 10 lb, getting her weight down to 15st 9 lb. Numerous diets had failed her. ‘Slimfast, WeightWatchers, Slimming World, I tried them all,’ she says. ‘I had some success, but none captured my imagination. And I didn’t like relying on processed food full of preservatives.’ So in place of the diet meal replacement bars and milkshakes she had previously relied on, she began to feed herself and her family on mock apricot tart made with carrots and Lord Woolton Pie. Scroll down for video . Past life: Before she started her diet in 2012, Carolyn Ekins weighed 25st and ate 5,000 calories a day . Shock: Carolyn, pictured before her weight loss, used to eat several pounds of cheese a week . ¿I had a racing pulse,' she said. 'I was sweating, my back was hurting.' And as a single mother to three children, Jess, now 25, Josh, 21, and Emily, 16, she felt a responsibility to look after her health, Carolyn said . The latter, named after the Minister of Food who popularised the recipe, involved dicing and cooking potatoes or parsnips, cauliflower, swede, carrots and turnip. Rolled oats and chopped spring onions were added to the thickened vegetable water, which was poured over the vegetables. The dish was then topped with potato pastry and grated cheese and served with vegetable gravy. Haute cuisine it certainly wasn’t, as Carolyn discovered. ‘The first two or three weeks or rationing was like going cold turkey,’ she says. ‘To begin with, I felt it was really bland, but after a week or two I began to appreciate it because my palate had changed.’ The portion sizes were another shock. After all, the weekly ration of four slices of bacon and 2oz of butter wouldn’t see many of us through a single breakfast. ‘I used to eat pounds of cheese a week, but the ration was as much as you’d have on one generous slice of cheese on toast. It made me realise how much I’d been consuming,’ says Carolyn. As well as the bacon or ham and . butter, a weekly adult ration allowed for the equivalent of two small . meat chops, 2oz of cheese, 4oz of margarine, 4oz of cooking fat and . three pints of milk. War on fat: Carolyn Ekins as she is today with some of the recipes which helped her slim. Right, a WWII leaflet . Enthusiast: The mother-of-three was interested in wartime rationing and had reproductions of pamphlets . Cooking in wartime: A weekly adult supply included two small meat chops, 2oz of cheese and 4oz of margarine . It also included 8oz of sugar, 2oz of tea and one whole egg or one packet of dried eggs every four weeks, along with 12oz of sweets. Every two months, a pound of preserves was added. Families would also have bread, oats, fruit and vegetables, and a monthly points allowance could be used to buy foods that were in short supply. The maximum 16 points would buy one can of fish, 2 lb of dried fruit or 8 lb of split peas. Carolyn estimates her calorie intake decreased from around 5,000 a day to a far healthier 2,000. Not only this, her meals were packed with vitamins and goodness. She was eating so many vegetables that she rarely felt hungry. Her lifestyle became healthier in other ways, too. Realising that the wartime housewife would have taken far more exercise than she did, she tried to mimic the effects of petrol rationing by walking up to three miles a day. Meanwhile, the demands of whipping up something tasty from the available rations meant she had to give up TV in the evenings to spend her time on her feet cooking. ‘It was labour-intensive, cooking everything from scratch in a wartime way,’ she says. ‘I tried to be authentic, so I used wooden spoons rather than a blender.’ Novel: The Lord Woolton pie contains potatoes, carrots, cauliflower, swede, Marmite and rolled oats . Tasty: Unlike traditional diets the recipes were not all salads - these spam fritters, for example . Keep calm and carrot on: These cookies may look unhealthy, but they were made out of carrots . Well-travelled: 'Anzac' biscuits were made to send to the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps . Back in the comfort zone: Some of the more reassuring recipes included these spam sandwiches . Her recipes were sourced from the internet, and she also found old pamphlets and Marguerite Patten’s cookery books for inspiration. Her children grew accustomed to the strange smells emanating from their mother’s kitchen. ‘They loved the Anzac biscuits, made from oats and desiccated coconut, and the carrot cookies — but anything that involved Spam or curry didn’t go down well,’ she says. ‘What I mostly did was to slip vegetables into cakes without telling them, because if I’d said I was doing apricot flan made from carrots they wouldn’t touch it with a barge pole.’ The fake banana sandwiches, made from over-cooked parsnips mashed up with banana essence and golden syrup, weren’t popular either — ‘though Emily swallowed a few mouthfuls before she realised and her face contorted into a priceless expression of horror!’ Carolyn’s personal sticking point was powdered egg — ‘It does the job, but I’d advise you not to stick your nose in the packet’ — and a carrot curry she attempted. ‘That was revolting,’ she says.  ‘It just tasted like carrots and  curry powder.’ For Christmas dinner, she served up cake with mock marzipan (flour, margarine, sugar and almond essence), eggless Christmas pudding and Mock Duck made from sausage meat (vegan in her case, as she is vegetarian).

To perforate or not to perforate: There was a heated debate at the time over wasting time with scissors . Doing the maths: Elizabeth Ingarfield went shopping with 29 ration books for her six married daughters . Her children participated by hand-making the decorations. By October 2012, at the end of her experiment in living history, Carolyn was amazed by her huge weight-loss. And what’s more, she found she had saved almost £3,000 in the same time by giving up takeaway coffee, processed food and sandwiches in favour of home-cooked rations. ‘I could feed myself on £1 to £2 a day. It made a significant difference,’ she says. ‘Before my ration diet, I was spending between £5 and £10 a day on food and coffee.’ But since returning to her normal diet 18 months ago, Carolyn has seen the weight piling on again. Now she is back to over 20st, so once more, she’s dusting off the old pamphlets and recreating wartime delicacies in the hopes of shedding 7st. So far, she’s whipped up eggless pancakes for Shrove Tuesday and dished up her favourite recipe, Lord Woolton Pie, more than once. ‘I make it most weeks and it’s fantastic,’ she says. And after just three weeks back on the World War II diet, she’s already lost 12 lb. There’s no doubt that rationing helped us win the war. But perhaps 70 years on, we should once again be eating for victory — this time to win the battle of the bulge. 1940sexperiment.com .","Carolyn Ekins had tried Slimfast, Weight Watchers and Slimming World .

"Want a shoulder to cry on? Then find a woman in her 50s, like Nigella Lawson or Jennifer Saunders, psychologists reckon. For no one else, male or female, has as much empathy as women of this generation, according to a study of more than 75,000 adults. They will listen more other people's problems and also react better to their needs, showing sympathy, concern and emotion, the research claims. The perfect shoulder to cry on... Nigella Lawson, 53, . and her 50-something female peers have the most empathy of any particular . demographic, according to a study of more than 75,000 adults . Women are widely considered better listeners than men and those in their 50s are best of all because of both their stage of life and the period in which they were born, it added. Researchers argued that growing up in the Sixties and Seventies may have opened the eyes of these women to the struggles and experiences of others, from apartheid and gay rights to women's lib and anti-war protests. Older adults born earlier are more likely to be grumpy and cynical as their emotional functions fade with age, said study by U.S. universities of Michigan and North Carolina. They also grew up in periods of greater hardship, such as during the war or post-war austerity, which could affect their attitudes to the seemingly minor problems of others. And younger generations are from more materialistic times, the researchers wrote in the Journals of Gerontology: Psychological and Social Sciences. This could make them more self obsessed and so wrapped up in their own problems that it makes it harder for them to be concerned about that of others. But the baby boomer generation who are now in their 50s grew up in a more enlightened and media-driven age, with a greater knowledge of the world around them. This pair could cheer you up with a joke, too: . Dawn French, 56, and Jennifer Saunders, 53. Researchers claim growing up . in the Sixties and Seventies opened the eyes of these women to the . struggles of others . Famous women in their 50s include TV chef Nigella, 53, as well as Dawn French, 56, and her comedy partner Jennifer Saunders, 54, and TV presenter Fern Britton, 55. Lorraine Kelly is 53, just one year younger than Hollywood sirens Sharon Stone and Michelle Pfeiffer. The researchers looked at three nationwide U.S. studies in which 75,000 adults of all ages were questioned over lifestyles, attitudes and other aspects of their daily lives. And who wouldn't mind crying on these shoulders? Michelle Pfeiffer, left, and Sharon Stone, right, both 54. The baby boomer generation grew up in a more enlightened and media-driven age, it is claimed . It found that over a lifetime, levels of empathy started and ended low but peaked in middle age and particularly among the so-called post-war baby boomer generation. Report co-author Sara Konrath of the University of Michigan, said: 'Overall, late middle-aged adults were higher in both of the aspects of empathy that we measured. 'They reported that they were more likely to react emotionally to the experiences of others, and they were also more likely to try to understand how things looked from the perspective of others.' The study added: 'Those born in the 1950s and '60s - the middle-aged people in our samples - were raised during historic social movements, from civil rights to various antiwar countercultures. 'It may be that today's middle-aged adults report higher empathy than others because they grew up during periods of important societal changes that emphasized the feelings and perspectives of other groups.' Empathy is not just about being a good listener though, said the authors of the report, it can also play a major role in society from involvement in community work to charity contributions.","No-one else has as much empathy as women of the baby-boomer generation, research claims .

"Yes, miss: Bernice McCabe said that failing to stretch students does ‘no favours to those from disadvantaged backgrounds’ in particular . Schools that attempt to make learning ‘relevant’ or ‘accessible’ rather than concentrating on ‘challenge and rigour’ are just patronising pupils, a leading head teacher will warn today. Bernice McCabe, an adviser to Prince Charles, said that failing to stretch students does ‘no favours to those from disadvantaged backgrounds’ in particular. This is because youngsters are deprived of ‘potentially powerful knowledge’, which helps them get ahead in life. Mrs McCabe, headmistress of the North London Collegiate School – the top independent for GCSE results last year – is addressing head teachers at a conference at The Prince’s Teaching Institute, a charity that helps teachers rediscover their passion for subjects. She will point out that at the institute’s first leadership conference in 2011, everyone agreed the best way to attain achievement is to ‘ensure that high quality education is there for everyone.’ She will add: ‘Because if challenge and rigour in teaching and learning are not there for all, not only is it harder for universities and employers to find applicants with the required levels of knowledge and skills, but we do no favours to those from disadvantaged backgrounds by depriving them of potentially powerful knowledge – quite the opposite of government intentions. ‘To provide young people just with what is regarded as ""relevant"" or ""accessible"" is patronising and presumes to place a limit on their capacity for learning. It does nothing to enhance life prospects. ‘The purpose of their education must surely be to open our pupils’ eyes to new horizons.’ Teachers are not ‘ill equipped’ to do this. But attempts are being hampered by governments that focus on ‘short-term results and favourable headlines about rising standards’. She says: ‘Britain has a strong tradition of liberal education that encourages independent thought, intellectual curiosity and cultural enrichment. ‘These values are in the DNA of the British education system and we should not be shy about celebrating them. ‘The trouble is that we have educational policies dictated by governments who want short-term results and favourable headlines about rising standards. ‘While this may be understandable, given the huge investment of public money in our schools, it is also unreasonable in that the full effects of the education we provide may not be revealed until years later. ‘Only then can we see whether our former pupils have become effective and successful in their work, fulfilled in their personal lives, and are making an effective contribution to society.’ Clever clogses: Last year, girls at North London Collegiate School passed 98.1 per cent of their GCSEs with As or A*s, making it top of a league table for private schools. (Stock picture) Mrs McCabe admits that the Coalition has given head teachers more freedom and a revised national curriculum. She adds: ‘So there is currently plenty of encouragement, in theory at least, for heads to choose their own pathways and priorities, and to determine their own aims and objectives to suit the particular circumstances of their school.’ Last year, girls at North London Collegiate School passed 98.1 per cent of their GCSEs with As or A*s, making it top of a league table for private schools. This was despite the fact it has ditched the ‘too easy’ English Literature GCSE, with students taking an AS-level in the subject instead.

"Grant Hackett reckons former swimming teammate Ian Thorpe retired early because of the emotional burden of keeping secret the fact he was gay. 'I believe this was the major factor that led Ian to wrap up his career in his mid-twenties,' Hackett wrote in a blog for an online bookmaker on Friday. 'The heights he scaled throughout his career were unprecedented, but there could have been a whole lot more to the CV of Ian Thorpe.' Scroll down for video .

Hackett believes Thorpe could have had much more success but retired early due to emotional struggle with concealing his sexuality . Grant Hackett has written in a blog that Ian Thorpe must have struggled with the 'emotional burden' of the secret of his sexuality. Australian champion swimmer Ian Thorpe (right) revealed he was gay in a television interview with Michael Parkinson (left) on Sunday night . Three-time Olympic gold medallist Hackett applauded Thorpe's courage to come out in a television interview with veteran British journalist Sir Michael Parkinson on Sunday, but claimed 'it wasn't a surprise to many'. 'It would've been unbearable to think of the emotional burden Ian has carried over the years,' he said. Ian Thorpe revealed that he is gay in an interview with Sir Michael Parkinson aired last Sunday night . 'I think the expectation of the public and media every time he competed, coupled with the lack of insight into dealing with his depression, and not feeling comfortable enough to open up about his sexuality, created too much of a high pressured environment.' Ian never said he disliked swimming - it was always the outside factors that contributed to his early retirement.' Hackett added that very few people could appreciate the internal struggle Australia's most successful Olympian faced in having to lie about his sexuality. 'At the end of day, this is not my business nor anybody else's, however the pressure that is placed upon high profile individuals and their sexual orientation seems outrageous,' he said.

"Hundreds of thousands of students will be hit by a marking boycott by academics amid a bitter row over pensions. The University and College Union (UCU) said yesterday that industrial action will start across 69 UK institutions on Thursday. Students will not be set coursework, receive formal marks or feedback on work. Any planned exams will also be brought to a halt. Boycott: Students will not be set coursework, receive formal marks or feedback on work. Any planned exams will also be brought to a halt . The industrial action comes a week after the UCU announced that its members had backed industrial action in the row over pensions. More than three-quarters (78 per cent) of those who voted in the recent ballot supported strikes, while 87 per cent were in favour of action short of walkouts, which includes the assessment boycott. The union balloted members who are in the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS) at 69 institutions. Turnout for the ballot was 45 per cent. The dispute focuses on changes to the USS, which are understood to have been prompted by an expected deficit in the pension scheme. UCU claims that the process used to work out the deficit is too simplistic and does not take into account the strengths of the scheme. Talks were held between the union and employers’ representatives last week, but UCU insisted that these failed to provide them with a guarantee that employers were making an effort to protect the pensions of their members who are in the USS. It added that more detailed negotiations are needed to solve the dispute. Strong support: More than three-quarters (78 per cent) of those who voted in the recent University and College Union ballot supported strikes . UCU general secretary Sally Hunt said: ‘The employers failed to convince us of the need for their dramatic changes or the reasons behind the methodology for its deficit reduction plan. ‘Their proposals remain full of holes and the information they are apparently relying on to back them up keeps being exposed as misleading. ‘We are setting plans for an assessment boycott in place because USS members have made it clear they are unconvinced by the employers’ arguments as well. ‘We are being asked to buy a pig in a poke and that is simply not acceptable. We hope the employers will come back to the table for genuine negotiations aimed at resolving the enormous gap between our two positions.’ Universities UK has previously said it was ‘disappointed’ that UCU was threatening students with a boycott, adding that it believed the employers’ proposals are the best that could be achieved.","University and College Union (UCU) say industrial action will start Thursday .

"A bolt of lightning caused serious damage to a church when it struck the bell tower and caused one of its turrets to explode. Worshippers were left stunned to find a gaping hole in the roof of the church in Pillaton, near Saltash, Cornwall, after a storm swept over the region late on Monday. Most buildings in the area managed to avoid damage, but St Odulph Church suffered a direct hit when a bolt of lightning struck the church steeple. Devastation: Church warden Richard Lowther assesses damage to the church which was struck by a bolt of lightning during a storm on Monday . Damage: Slate tiles on the roof of the church were smashed by the flying debris, which left wood dangling precariously near to the pulpit . It caused flying rubble to smash slate tiles on the church's roof and left huge pieces of wood precariously dangling into the church below, close to the pulpit. Church warden Richard Lowther said everything in the church had been affected, including the roof, pews and other furnishings. He said: 'We won't be able to hold services until... I don't know how long. 'We estimate the damage will be in excess of £500,000, at a very minimum, to repair.' He said the first work to be carried out would be to prevent water getting into the building and causing further damage. Bell ringing captain Richard Warwick said Pillaton residents had been 'shaken from their beds' during the thunderstorm. Structural damage: The lightning bolt left a gaping hole in the ceiling of the church after it struck the bell tower . Cost to repair: The damage is estimated to cost at least £500,000 to fix . He said: 'There's pretty major structural damage to the church. 'One of the four pinnacles on the roof, which weigh several tonnes, has exploded and the main part of it has made a huge gaping hole in the body of the main church. 'We don't know about the bells yet because we're not allowed up there to take a look.' Nearby pub The Weary Friar also saw damage to its picnic benches from the falling debris of the church. Protected: The parish church, which became a listed building in 1968, is made from slatestone rubble with granite dressing . Parishioner Tony Rowe, who is organising repairs following the devastation at the church, said: 'One of the turrets on the tower exploded. 'There are around four or five holes on the roof of the church. Also some of the stone fell in front of the pub.' Mr Rowe said he feared work to repair the damage could take a long time. He said: 'We are having emergency roofing put on the building to secure it.' Storm: Residents in the village were 'shaken from their beds' during the thunderstorm which struck on Monday night . The church has been closed to the public while it is made safe, secure and water tight. The Weary Friar is a 12th Century country inn that was originally used to house the builders of the church and then became a rest-house inn. A spokesman for the pub said: 'There is no real damage to the pub building but a power surge took out the computers and phones, which I think happened across the village. Our credit card machines are also down. 'Some of the stone from the church fell onto one of our picnic benches outside and smashed it in half which we'll have to replace, but the pub itself hasn't been damaged.' The parish church became a listed building in 1968. It is made from slatestone rubble with granite dressing.

"Britain  is still ‘deeply elitist’, with privately-educated pupils and Oxbridge graduates continuing to dominate the top roles in society, a new report warns. Many of the nation’s judges, politicians, armed forces chiefs, journalists, TV executives and public officials attended fee-paying schools before studying at Oxford and Cambridge. The Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission is calling for disadvantaged students from less prestigious universities to be fast-tracked into leading professions to correct the bias. David Cameron, pictured, attended Eton and Oxford along with several members of his government . It wants leading employers to ignore the university background of applicants during recruitment rounds and publish data on the social background of all their members of staff. The commission – an advisory body of the Department for Education – believes the move is necessary as its research shows the UK’s top jobs ‘remain disproportionately held by people from a narrow range of backgrounds’. But critics fear that the recommendations for employers amount to discriminating against privately-educated pupils and warn against quotas. The commission analysed the education of more than 4,000 individuals holding the most prestigious jobs in British society and concluded that the country’s elite is still ‘formed on the playing fields of independent schools’ and ‘finished in Oxbridge’s dreaming spires’. George Osborne, pictured, also went to Oxford and was a member of the Bullingdon Club with Boris Johnson . No less than 71 per cent of senior judges, almost two thirds of senior armed forces officers, more than half of senior diplomats, and over a third of the Cabinet attended a fee-paying school. David Cameron attended Eton and Oxford. Nationally, around seven per cent of the UK population attended a private school. The proportions were similar when the researchers examined who went to Oxford or Cambridge among the leading professions, even though 62 per cent of UK adults did not even attend university. The commission says the ‘sheer scale of the dominance of certain backgrounds’ raises questions about whether getting a top job is about ability or knowing the right people. It has called for a national effort to ‘break open’ Britain’s elite. It wants employers to use ‘contextual evaluation of academic achievements’ and ‘university-blind applications’ during recruitment drives. This would involve bosses taking into account the family or school background of an applicant. The commission also wants leading employers to publish data on the proportion of staff who have claimed free school meals, attended private schools and whose parents went to university. Alan Milburn, its chairman, said yesterday: ‘Firms risk missing out on the best if they arbitrarily restrict recruitment rounds to certain institutions or cherry-pick applicants on the basis of university alone.’ The end of the grammar school system is believed to have helped widen class divisions. It meant that bright pupils from poor backgrounds no longer had the 11-plus exam as a means of getting ahead in education. Former grammar school Prime Ministers include Harold Wilson, John Major and Margaret Thatcher. Ruth Lea, economic adviser at Arbuthnot Banking Group, said the recommendation for companies to introduce ‘university-blind’ applications was ‘completely impractical’ and ignored the fact that a number of universities are known to excel at certain types of subjects. Three quarters of all senior judges attended Oxbridge colleges according to new research published today .","More than a third of David Cameron's cabinet attended a fee paying school .

"BBC Radio 2 presenter Sara Cox helped put two burglars in prison after she tweeted CCTV images showing them raiding her brother's luxury home. The DJ, 40, posted pictures of unemployed brothers Gary and Barry Foulkes breaking into artist Robert Cox's garage before making off with tools worth £720. The brothers, who are both drug addicts, were arrested less than 24 hours after Ms Cox asked her 750,000 Twitter followers for help tracking the men down. Scroll down for video . Gary (left) and Barry Foulkes (right) were jailed for burglary after raiding the home of BBC DJ Sarah Cox's brother . The Radio 2 presenter thanked her Twitter followers for helping catch the burglars after she tweeted CCTV images showing them at her brother's home . The brothers make off with tools worth £720 after taking them from artist Robert Cox's luxury home in Bolton . Her tweet said: 'These lads are robbing my brothers @rcoxART house thurs night, Bolton/Ainsworth area. DO YOU RECOGNISE THEM?'. She later added: 'Look, more pics of the lads stealing from my big bro's house the gits. Who are they?' Gary Foulkes, 33, who has clocked up 111 earlier offences including several burglaries, was jailed for 16 weeks. His brother Barry, 28, was jailed for 12 weeks after both admitted burglary. They were each ordered to pay £360 compensation as none of the stolen gardening equipment has been recovered. The pair raided Mr Cox's garage at his gated home near Bolton on January 8 after the artist, who also runs a travel company, stopped painting work for the night, Bury Magistrates' Court heard. Martin Brogan, prosecuting, said: 'He returned at 9am and noticed a number of items missing - two hedge trimmers, chain saw and leaf sucker to the value of £720. 'His property is covered by CCTV and he reviewed the CCTV and saw two people climbing over the wall from the public footpath. After reviewing the CCTV footage he called the police. The items stolen have not been recovered.' Brothers Gary (left) and Barry Foulkes (right), who are unemployed heroin addicts, were jailed for the burglary . Ms Cox, who presents Sound of the 80s on BBC Radio 2 on Saturday evenings, posted images of the burglary on Twitter and the culprits were caught within 24 hours . The Foulkes brothers were identified as the culprits shortly after Ms Cox's tweets were posted and re-tweeted more than 4,000 times. During police interviews shown to the court, both burglars admitted having drug problems. Defence lawyer Leanne Hurst said Barry Foulkes, who lives alone on benefits in rented accommodation, suffered from depression and had been a drug addict since the age of 24. She said: 'He tells me he is sorry for his actions and understands his behaviour is unacceptable. By its very nature this is a serious allegation - but it is not the most serious of its kind. There was no significant damage caused or any ransacking. I would argue that it may not be a significant loss to the victim. There is certainly no damage caused in terms of monetary value. 'He tells me he does have issues in relation to drugs, in particular heroin. He tells me at the time of this certain offence he was using heroin and gave this as the reason for the offence. He tells me he is able to be drug-free and tells me this is what he wants.' Caught: The CCTV images were seen by thousands of people on Twitter, with the men quickly arrested . Miss Hurst said Gary Foulkes, who lives with his pregnant partner, had been 'self medicating' with heroin after injuring his hand. She added: 'He again understands there is no excuse for his behaviour and he is remorseful for his actions. 'There is the option for employment as a labourer but this is dependent on the outcome of this court case.' Passing sentence, Dennis Hilton chairman of the bench said: 'We consider that this has crossed the custodial threshold and we have taken an account of the significant loss to the victim and prior convictions.' At the time the brothers' arrest Ms Cox, who presents Sound of the 80s on BBC Radio 2 on Saturday evenings, thanked her followers and said: 'You're all brilliant.

"Ashley Young has history for diving and the way he fell to try and win a penalty won’t help his reputation. There were two possible penalty incidents in close succession and Martin Atkinson called both correctly. The first came as Robin van Persie burst into the penalty area only to be thwarted by a well-timed last-ditch Santiago Vergini tackle, which took the ball cleanly.

Man Utd v QPR (April 2012) Perhaps Young’s most theatrical tumble. The United man won his side a penalty when he flew through the air after minimal contact with Shaun Derry. 3. Man Utd v Aston Villa (April 2012) Young’s penalty-winning clash with Ciaran Clark even prompted Sir Alex Ferguson to admit he ‘overdid’ the fall. 4. Man Utd v Crystal Palace (September 2013) David Moyes promises to reprimand the winger after admitting he tried to con the referee to give a penalty. 5.

"Britain missed David Cameron’s flagship foreign aid target last year despite handing out an extra £2.7billion, it emerged yesterday. The figures, buried in an official report, suggest the country could have to fork out up to £750million extra by the end of next month in order to hit the target this year – although Government sources insisted the final increase would be lower. The revelations are an embarrassment for the Prime Minister who has repeatedly boasted about meeting his pledge to spend 0.7 per cent of Britain’s annual income on foreign aid. Ministers are now backing legislation which would make it illegal for future governments to miss the aid target. Critics said the figures demonstrated the ‘idiocy’ of trying to hit an ‘arbitrary’ target. Tory MP Philip Davies said: ‘This just goes to show the absolute nonsense of committing this ludicrous target into law. We have thrown billions at it and still missed it, and now we will presumably throw hundreds of millions more at it.’ The foreign aid budget was increased by more than 30 per cent last year in order to meet the target. The £2.7billion increase took total spending to £11.5billion. In April this year the Department for International Development (DfID) boasted this amounted to 0.72 per cent of Britain’s Gross National Income (GNI) – exceeding the target for the first time. But the latest DfID report suggests that new, higher estimates of GNI mean aid last year actually amounted to 0.67 per cent. Spending was about £400million short of the sum needed. But, with UK growth running at an estimated 3 per cent, the Government would have to find another £750million to hit the new measure this year. The problem is similar to the one that landed the UK with a demand for £1.7billion from the European Commission last month. Estimates of GNI have been revised upwards three times this year by the Office for National Statistics, adding £107billion to the total. The changes mean targets based on GNI have gone up. The last of these revisions, which added about a third of the total increase, results from EU accounting rules that include estimates of parts of the black economy such as prostitution and drug running. Government sources said DfID will be allowed to stick to old accounting methods this year to ensure a ‘consistent methodology’. The effect of this will be to limit the impact of the rise in GNI. Our economy will grow ten times faster than that of France this year and four times faster next year, according to official Brussels figures. The European Commission expects output in the UK to increase by 3.1 per cent in 2014 and 2.7 per cent in 2015. This compares with growth of just 0.3 per cent in France this year and 0.7 per cent next year. The International Monetary Fund has predicted Britain will next year overtake France to become Europe’s second biggest economy behind Germany. But, even with this, the figures still suggest aid spending may have to rise by about £500million, taking the total aid budget to £12billion. DfID insisted it had met the target based on economic figures ‘at the time’. The department declined to comment on the likely implications for this year’s aid budget. International development minister Desmond Swayne told Total Politics magazine the aid budget is ‘not popular among a significant proportion of the public’ but said it was the right thing to do. The latest figures come despite a frantic effort by DfID to hit the target last year. A highly critical report by the Commons international development committee revealed ministers splurged almost £100million a day in December. Last week an independent report slammed DfID for a failure to tackle corruption in developing countries.","Cameron pledged to spend 0.7 per cent of annual income on foreign aid .

"Parents have long complained that it is a daily struggle to drag their sleepy sons and daughters out of bed in the morning in time for lessons. But a new study aims to show that lie-ins and a delayed school start could actually help improve teenagers’ exam results. This is because their body clocks are behind those of adults and they are less likely to be ‘optimally alert’ during morning lessons. A new study aims to show that lie-ins and a delayed school start could actually help improve teenagers’ exam results (File photo) Almost 32,000 Year Ten and 11 pupils (aged 14-16) from 106 schools will take part in the Teensleep project, led by the Oxford University Sleep and Circadian Neuroscience Institute. The scheme involves incorporating sleep education and 10am starts on to the secondary school curriculum and analysing the impact on GCSE results. In the first year, a group of teenagers will be given sleep education – such as the benefits of getting enough rest – and the other control group will not. The following year, one group of students will start lessons at 10am, one will receive sleep education, a third will receive both and a fourth group will have neither, continuing with normal school starts of between 8.30-9am. Pupils will be expected to keep sleep diaries and some will wear electronic devices, measuring the length of time they manage to rest each night. Researchers will look at the impact on attainment of five good GCSEs including English and maths as well as other areas such as the effect of mobile phones and tablets on sleep. Professor Russell Foster, the director of the Oxford University Sleep and Circadian Neuroscience Institute, said that a teenager rising at 7am was the equivalent of 5am for an adult. He said: ‘Recent advances in our understanding of the neuroscience of sleep has shown that the body clock of teenagers is delayed. ‘This biology, along with the impact of social media and other sociocultural influences, delays bed and wake times and greatly shorten sleep. ‘Our project will be the first large-scale randomised control trial to explore whether a later start to the school day, along with educational programmes regarding the importance of sleep, will have a positive impact upon both academic performance and overall health in the teenage population. It could also involve highlighting the benefits of getting a good night’s rest to pupils, such as being more likely to win a place on a sports team if they are on top form and appearing more attractive to the opposite sex, researchers suggested (File photo) Colin Espie, a professor of sleep medicine at Oxford University, said: ‘We know something funny something happens when you’re a teenager. You seem to be slightly out of sync with the rest of the world. ‘Of course, your parents think that’s probably because you’re a little bit lazy and opinionated and if only you got to bed early at night, you’d be able to get up in the morning. ‘But science is telling us in fact there are developmental changes during the teenage years, which lead to them actually not being as tired as we think they ought to be at normal bedtime and still sleepy in the morning.’ He added: ‘What we’re doing in the study is exploring the possibility that if we actually delay the school start time until 10am, instead of 9am or earlier, that additional hour taken on a daily dose over the course of a year will actually improve learning, performance, attainment and in the end school leaving qualifications. ‘If we adapt our system to the biological state of the young person, we might have more success than having to fit them into our schedules.’ The curriculum support will help youngsters understand the importance of sleep and eliminating distractions from electronic devices. It could also involve highlighting the benefits of getting a good night’s rest to pupils, such as being more likely to win a place on a sports team if they are on top form and appearing more attractive to the opposite sex, researchers suggested. The sleep research is among six neuroscience projects awarded grants totalling almost £4million by the Wellcome Trust and the Education Endowment Foundation.","Teenage body clocks are behind those of adults and they are less likely to be ‘optimally alert’ during morning lessons .

"Dr Patrick Moore has launched a scathing attack on Greenpeace, the organisation he helped co-found in the 1970s, saying it has become 'evil' Greenpeace has been branded an 'evil organisation' which has 'lost concern for humans' in an astonishing attack by its own co-founder. Ecologist Dr Patrick Moore, who quit Greenpeace in 1986, has launched a scathing criticism of the activist group, which he insisted has lost its humanitarian roots. His attack on the organisation he helped create comes as former Environment Secretary Owen Paterson campaigns against the 'self-serving' and 'highly-paid' network of environmental pressure groups he calls the 'green blob'. Dr Moore told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme: 'My problem with Greenpeace is they have lost any humanitarian roots they had. 'When we started Greenpeace it was to stop nuclear war and the destruction of human civilisation, that of course is the ""peace"" in Greenpeace. 'The ""green"" is the environment and that's good as well, but they lost the concerns for humans... They have turned, basically, into an evil organisation.' He gave the example of so-called 'golden rice', a crop enriched with vitamin A which supporters say would help millions of the world's poorest people improve their diet. Dr Moore said the fact that Greenpeace opposed the idea showed that they no longer care about people. Dr Moore helped found Greenpeace in 1971 while PhD student in ecology, but he later left the group, claiming it had become more interested in politics than science. He is now a proponent of nuclear energy and is sceptical about sole human responsibility for climate change. Dr Doug Parr, chief scientist at Greenpeace, later shrugged of the criticisms made of his organisation. He said: 'When we do campaigns, we look at influence, we look at impact and we are very, very mindful to incorporate social and economic issues into what we do, because otherwise campaigns won't work. A representative of Greenpeace has said the organisation always considers the social effects of its campaigns . 'There's not going to be some kind of green dictatorship which imposes these decisions on anybody.' The row comes after Pascal Husting, Greenpeace International’s Programme Director, was exposed earlier this year as having commuted the 250 miles between Luxembourg and Amsterdam by plane since 2012. Each trip is believed to have cost Greenpeace £200 and would have generated 142kg of carbon dioxide emissions, it was said. Dr Parr said Mr Husting's behaviour was 'a mistake' and 'should never have happened'. On the organisation's position of golden rice, he said: 'The thing about golden rice is it's a least-favourable option and it doesn't actually exist yet, it's been many years in proposal and... it doesn't work . 'The real solution to this is a proper, balanced diet like the home gardening initiatives in Bangladesh have achieved.' Dr Patrick Moore (pictured in 1977 while still part of the organisation) has now hit out at the activist group .","Co-founder Patrick Moore says organisation doesn't care about people .

"A pensioner who said ‘I’m not Muslim’ when he was asked to remove his shoes at airport security has spent more than six months facing charges for racism. Paul Griffith, 75, pictured, set off the security scanner’s alarm at Stansted airport when travelling to Malaga for a week’s holiday. He removed his shoes as requested, but said: ‘I am not Muslim am I?’ Paul Griffith was on his way to Malaga when airport staff asked him to remove his shoes. His response landed him arrested upon his return to the UK . A security guard accused him of racism and called the police, saying he was upset by the remark. 'One minute I am queuing up to get on a plane and the next I am confronted by two armed policemen. 'They said I had used racist language and took me to an office in the terminal,' Mr Griffith said yesterday. Mr Griffith was allowed to go on his trip but was arrested when he returned. He was charged with causing ‘racially or religiously aggravated harassment, alarm or distress’. 'When I got back I had to wait six hours before they interviewed me again, arrested me and said that was being charged with causing racially aggravated harassment. 'I was photographed, had my finger prints taken and they also took a DNA swab from my mouth. 'Then they said I would have to go to my local police station. When I went to Colchester police station I was told I had been charged with an offence under the Crime and Disorder Act but that I could accept a caution instead. 'I refused to do that - I had done nothing wrong and I wasn’t going to admit to a criminal charge if I wasn’t guilty of any crime.' The CPS failed to substantiate claims by airport staff at Stansted (pictured) that Mr Griffith's comment was threatening or abusive . The 75-year-old was asked by staff at the airport to remove his shoes before he made the comment (file image) Months later he appeared at Chelmsford Magistrates' Court where he pleaded not guilty to the offence. The case was adjourned to last Thursday, but with just 24 hours before appearing, the Crown Prosecution Service suddenly dropped the charge due to lack of evidence. The retired hairdressing salon owner, from Colchester, Essex, yesterday criticised the police for their heavy-handedness. ‘I have never fallen foul of the law before and the whole affair has been a complete waste of police time, the court’s time, my time as well as taxpayers’ money. ‘It has been incredibly stressful – all because I asked a question and apparently dared to use the M word.’ Deputy Chief Crown Prosecutor for CPS East of England, Frank Ferguson said: 'Following receipt of the evidential file a full review of the evidence took place. 'In order to successfully prosecute a charge of racially or religiously aggravated disorderly conduct, we first have to show that the language used was threatening or abusive and in these particular circumstances we could not show that to the high criminal standard required.'","Paul Griffith was stopped at Stansted airport on his way to Malaga .

"An MP will launch an inquiry which accuses the Bureau of Meteorology of manipulating figures on the impact of climate change. George Christensen, member off the Nationals party, claimed the Bureau had 'fudged' records of rising temperatures as well as tampering with older data in order to justify claims of climate change. The member for the seat of Dawson in Queensland used records from a drought in 1896, when temperatures reached 50C in Camden, south-west of Sydney, as well as 43C in Geelong, south-west of Melbourne. George Christensen addressing parliament on Wednesday, when he accused the Bureau of Meteorology of ignoring earlier temperature records to highlight the threat of climate change . Mr Christensen, pictured with Tony Abbott, has accused the Bureau of tampering with data so the past appeared cooler . Speaking in parliament on Wednesday, Mr Christensen said: 'I rise to paint a picture of Camden. A picture where Camden, just to the south-west of Sydney, is sweltering in 50C heat.' He cited that in the summer of 1896 alone, there were 435 instances of heat related deaths. 'The Bureau of Meteorology claims it's getting hotter and hotter. How can last year be the hottest on record if it was hotter back in 1896, 118 years ago?' 'It's relatively simple: the early years are simply wiped from the official record.' Mr Christensen claimed you can find the values he is referring to on the Bureau website, but they are not part of the official temperature record the bureau uses to report on climate change issues. He said the Bureau was also involved in a process of tampering with the raw data so the past appeared cooler than the present. 'Obviously if you drop down temperatures from the past, all the later temperatures will appear warmer even if they are not,' he said. 'We cannot use fudged figures skewed to support a global warming hypothesis. We have a scientific process being tainted at the source.' Mr Christensen said he would use evidence of the Bureau's misconduct  to launch an inquiry this week. Senator Simon Birmingham, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment, told Daily Mail Australia 'the country's climate record and the methods used for analysis by the Bureau were independently reviewed by international experts in 2012 to ensure quality assurance, transparency and communication'' 'The review concluded that the Bureau's data and methods for climate analysis were among the best in the world,' Mr Birmingham said. Mr Christensen said he would use evidence of the Bureau's misconduct to launch an inquiry in Parliament House (pictured) this week .

'The review also recommended that a regular and independent technical forum occur to ensure continuous confidence in and improvement of this dataset. 'These measures should give all Australians confidence that the Bureau is continually striving to deliver the most accurate climate records, based on the best available scientific methodologies.' The news comes as political leaders from around the world are urging Australia to to include climate change on the agenda for next month's G20 summit in Brisbane. Despite the push by the United States and several European countries, Prime Minister Tony Abbott has argued the issue does not fit the economic focus of the event.","George Christensen claimed the Bureau had wiped earlier records .

"Sir Michael Wilshaw said 'good' schools will receive more frequent check-ups to stop them from slipping back into mediocrity . The head of Ofsted yesterday demanded ‘slightly maverick’ head teachers who ‘aren’t afraid to ruffle feathers’ as part of a major clampdown on coasting schools. Sir Michael Wilshaw insisted there was ‘no room for complacency’ amid ‘worrying signs’ that standards in secondary schools are ‘stagnating’. He revealed that ‘good’ schools will receive shorter and more frequent check-ups in future as part of a major shake-up of inspections in England. This will help ensure they don’t ‘slip back into an acceptance of mediocrity’. Up to 60 per cent of England’s schools will undergo ‘light touch’ visits from inspectors every two to three years to stamp out potential coasting. At present, these ‘good’ schools undergo full inspections every five to six years. The proposals, to come into effect from next September, will be published by the education watchdog for consultation today. The shake-up will also enable inspectors to spend more time helping drive up standards in under performing schools. Sir Michael told the Norfolk Annual Head Teacher conference yesterday that the introduction of a ‘requires improvement’ grade to replace ‘satisfactory’ has had a ‘galvanising effect’ on schools. He said: ‘Coasting schools now know that mediocre standards will no longer be tolerated. ‘But I am the first to recognise that Ofsted needs to move towards a more proportionate, risk-based model for inspection which focuses on those struggling institutions that need a greater level of scrutiny and intervention. ‘At the same time, we need to move to a new inspection model which keeps a more watchful eye on good schools so that they don’t slip back but continue to improve. ‘That is why, when we launch our consultation, I will be suggesting frequent but shorter inspections of good schools led by HMI, with a much greater emphasis on professional dialogue.’ Sir Michael insisted that if the country genuinely aspires to a ‘world-class’ label for education ‘then we simply cannot afford to take our foot off the gas’. ‘It’s imperative that we continue to up our game as a nation if we’re to have any chance of competing economically and, just as importantly, if we are going to build a more cohesive society,’ he said. ‘Firstly, we must ensure the improvements of recent years are maintained and that the system does not slip back into an acceptance of mediocrity. This is a key driver for the reforms will be will be consulting on this autumn.’ Sir Michael said the Government was ‘very much looking to ambitious, buccaneering, go-getting school leaders to make the running in school improvement in 2014’. ‘Leaders who show a scornful intolerance towards the type of mediocrity that still characterises too much of our education system - and which until recently was dressed up in the euphemism of ‘satisfactory’,’ he said. Sir Michael added that scrapping the 'satisfactory' grading for schools, and replacing it with 'needing improvement' had a 'galvanising' effect on standards . ‘It very much chimes with my own conviction that the future of education in this country depends on these energetic, dynamic, entrepreneurial, and perhaps slightly maverick leaders who thrive on competition and aren’t afraid to ruffle feathers.’ Meanwhile, Ofsted’s plans for future inspections are also likely to include proposals for more no-notice visits. Last month it was announced that Ofsted inspectors had been sent to dozens of schools across England to conduct snap inspections under the watchdog’s existing powers, amid serious concerns about standards. Schools usually get half a day’s notice of an inspection. But Russell Hobby, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, yesterday warned that sweeping reform of Ofsted was needed. He said: ‘Schools can no longer learn effectively from its (Ofsted’s) adversarial approach. ‘The current model of inspection has reached the end of its useful life and now holds the education system back.’ He added: ‘The current trend of no-notice inspections has to stop. ‘Head teachers have a right and a need to be present during inspection and a small amount of notice is required to make this possible.’","Sir Michael revealed 'good' schools will have regular 'light touch' inspections .

"Debt collectors are chasing thousands of students who have moved abroad without repaying their loans, it was revealed yesterday. About 16,000 British and 7,000 EU graduates are living overseas and in arrears with the Student Loan Company (SLC) – contributing to a projected £330billion debt by 2044. The Government said it had funded a pilot project to extend the ‘use of Debt Collection processes overseas for those seeking to evade their responsibility’. Debt collectors are chasing thousands of students who have moved abroad without repaying their loans, it was revealed yesterday . Ministers are also considering ‘allocating additional resources needed to roll out wider debt collection processes’ abroad. Details of the clampdown were revealed as Ministers yesterday refused demands to hold an ‘urgent’ review of the student loans system. The Commons’ Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) Committee warned in July that the scheme was at ‘tipping point’ because of bungled Government sums and lax debt collection. The Coalition loses 45 pence in every pound it lends to student. In a formal response to the committee, the Government yesterday insisted there was ‘no immediate pressure’ in the system. It admitted that debt recovery ‘becomes difficult when borrowers move overseas without either informing the SLC or establishing a repayment schedule’. Its report added: ‘We are investigating options to make repayment even easier for those overseas, and have funded a pilot project to extend the use of Debt Collection processes overseas for those seeking to evade their responsibility. ‘If this pilot is deemed successful, and cost effective, then BIS will consider allocating additional resources needed to roll out wider debt collection processes. ‘We are also in discussion with several countries to develop mutual processes for identifying overseas nationals who are not making the Higher Education loan repayments which are due.’ Adrian Bailey (pictured), chair of the BIS Committee, said the size of outstanding student debt will increase to more than £330bn by 2044 . The report pointed out that the ‘majority’ of borrowers who are overseas are UK nationals . The SLC already takes ‘targeted action’ to set up repayment schedules for EU borrowers who are ‘more likely’ to move overseas. However, a study from the National Audit Office last November claimed that 42,000 EU graduates are eligible to make repayments but 18,000 – 43 per cent – are failing to do so. Of those, 7,000 are formally ‘in arrears’ and living abroad, while 11,000 remain in the UK without providing earnings information. Some of these may be under the repayment threshold or not in work but no details exist about them. At the same time, 2,928,000 UK students are eligible to make repayments. Of those, 383,000 are failing to provide earnings information and 16,000 are living abroad and in arrears. This non-repayment rate is 13.7 per cent. Graduates must alert the SLC if they plan to leave the country for longer than three months, enabling a repayment schedule to be drawn up. The SLC started using overseas collection agents from 2011 onwards. It passes on account details of non-payers so they can be tracked down, such as through their equivalents of the electoral register. The government pilot project extends these arrangements. A SLC spokeswoman said: ‘Student Loans Company (SLC) has a robust system to pursue borrowers for repayment regardless of their location. ‘A part of this collection process includes engagement with overseas collections agents to ensure all funds owed are recouped. Due to the success of this process, we have worked to secure funding to extend the use of the overseas collection agents.’ Adrian Bailey, chair of the BIS Committee, said yesterday: ‘Under the current student loan system for students residing in England, the Government loses around 45p on every £1 it loans out. ‘The Government’s own estimates indicate the size of outstanding student debt will increase to more than £330bn by 2044. ‘With the prospect of a large potential black hole in the government’s budget figures, it is all the more alarming that the Government has refused to conduct a review of the current student loan system.’","Debt collectors are chasing thousands of students who have moved abroad .

"The Rev Paul Shackerley said he now regrets using inappropriate language on Facebook . A Church of England vicar being investigated by senior clerics after complaints by parishioners that he used 'abhorrent' language and posted the Facebook comment: 'Sin is such fun'. Canon Dr Paul Shackerley, Vicar of Doncaster, is accused of swearing on the social networking site, mocking religious events and moaning about having to go to church on a Sunday. Senior Anglican clerics are probing the allegations after a formal complaint was lodged against Dr Shackerley, who is accused of using a string of four letter words. He also joined a group called ‘I want to get back with my ex...!’...LOL jk...I'd rather s*** in my hands and clap!'. Dr Shackerley, who as priest-in-charge at Doncaster Minster, is one of Yorkshire's most high-profile vicars, posted the comments earlier this year, apparently sparking concern among parishioners. The Facebook extracts have been sent, along with an anonymous letter, to senior clergy, including the Bishop of Sheffield, Dr Steven Croft, and Dr Shackerley's immediate boss, the Bishop of Doncaster. Also copied in to the correspondence are the Lord Lieutenant of South Yorkshire, David Moody, who represents the Queen, elected mayor of Doncaster Peter Davies and the Sheffield Diocesan Secretary. The posts begin at around 7pm on a Saturday and say: ‘I think I will put my feet up. ‘I've done f*** all today other than jazz lesson and visit a friend. I hear the fizz of tonic in my gin beckoning. ‘Alas, I have religion tomorrow. At least I'm not preaching this week. ‘Preaching next week at St Mary Abbotts Kensington though. Best make that a good one eh?’ The comments are ‘liked’ by eight of Dr Shackerley's Facebook friends, including Doncaster Minster's director of mu-sic, Darren Williams, and prompt more foul language in response from a separate contributor. In his next post, Dr Shackerley writes: ‘Stop swearing. There will be others watching in.’ After further conversation he arranges to meet with friends for ‘a drinkie’ in Peterborough on Saturday, March 17, and says he will be driving back to Doncaster that night in time for church the next morning.

Investigation: Dr Shackerley (pictured) issued his apology after meeting with the Bishop of Doncaster, Peter Burrows . A few of Canon Dr Paul Shackerley, Vicar of Doncaster statements on Facebook: . Dr Shackerley also uploaded a photograph of his posing next to a snowman he called Snowy, which is accompanied by a number of messages, including: ‘Forgive my sin of frivolity. Sin is such fun! 'But, I haven't been having inappropriate relationship with snowy, who can longer be called a ""snowman"" in the name of political correctness. 'Has anyone got any ideas about what gender Snowy is? As the Bishop of Sheffield invites, ""answers on a postcard of a few sheets of A4..."" But, he was talking about gospel and mission. I'm talking about Snowy!:-)’ Dr Sharkerley also posted: ‘Piss myself! H, you are so funny!!! It was good to share over lunch yesterday and at the URC Homelessness ""event"". I say ""event"". It was hardly worship, was it? 'I hope you managed to get home okay. It was late by the time the URC and Methodists finished. Good job we are Anglicans eh?’ The letter which accompanies the extracts says: ‘Your priest colleague uses language that most would find abhorrent for a man in his position and pretty distasteful for anyone as a matter of fact. ‘I understand that senior members of the Diocese know of this document, but no action appears to have been taken. ‘His present behaviour makes him totally unfit to serve the Minster or the people of Doncaster, and totally unfit to serve the church at all in the opinion of many Doncaster residents.’ Sin: Revd Shackerley posted this picture of him and a snowman online, accompanied by the message 'Forgive my sin of frivolity, sin is such fun' In an April newsletter to parishioners, Dr Shackerley spoke of the pitfalls of internet sites like Facebook in the wake of the case of a 21-year-old student who used Twitter to racially abuse stricken footballer Fabrice Muamba. He said: ‘I have known employees receive disciplinary and dismissal notices for inappropriate postings.’ The Bishop of Doncaster, Peter Burrows, who issues updates on his own work on Twitter, will be meeting with Dr Shackerley to discuss what had been posted. He added: ‘We are aware of the complaint and we will be investigating it. I think we all know that things like Facebook, Twitter and other social media are immediate ways of communicating 'in the moment'. ‘But we do as clergy need to be very conscious of making the distinction between something that might have what I would call a work focus and something that might have a more personal or private focus. ‘Obviously for clergy these two lives are often not completely separate, but I will be seeing Paul as soon as I possibly can so that we can talk about what has happened in this case. ‘There are a number of quite complex and difficult issues for the church that have been raised by this. ‘They will need to be addressed and we do take seriously the complainants' comments.’","Canon Dr Paul Shackerley of Doncaster Minster investigated by top clerics .

"Most children prefer to play outside rather than watch television but they are restricted to their back gardens by over-anxious parents, new research has revealed. They are being prevented from venturing unaccompanied into the street, local park, woods or any open green space due to families’ safety fears about traffic and ‘stranger danger’. These areas have become ‘out-of-bounds’ for adventurous youngsters even though many would prefer to explore these areas rather than be stuck in front of tablets, TV and computer screens. Eighty-one per cent of children said they preferred to play outside than watch TV (File photo) The study from Eureka! The National Children’s Museum, based in Halifax, West Yorkshire, highlights concerns of an ‘over-active obsession with protecting children from all types of potential harm’. Its report, co-authored by Rebecca Caswell of the museum, said: ‘Parents must be provided with the tools and confidence to allow their children more freedom to play outside or the next generation of children will become even more housebound than the current one.’ The museum surveyed 1,367 adults and 1,456 children aged five to 11 about their views on play. Eighty-one per cent of children said they preferred to play outside than watch TV. However, 59 per cent said they ‘were never allowed to leave the home or garden unsupervised’. Ninety-five per cent of adults said they believed risk in play was ‘beneficial’. But a quarter believed play ‘could be improved by making the world safer’. There are fears from experts that the next generation of children will become even more housebound than the current one (Picture posed by model) These concerns were reflected in the distances parents allowed youngsters to venture. Just under half (49.7 per cent) admitted they did not allow their children to play outside their own homes and gardens alone. Only 0.5 per cent said they let their children explore ‘as far as they want to’. Just 37 per cent allow their sons and daughters to go as far as the end of the street without supervision. Researchers also asked children to pick their three top places to play. These were parks (54 per cent) followed by the garden (45 per cent) and the home (42 per cent). This contrasted with parents’ answers who cited their childhood favourites as the street (46.7 per cent), fields or woods (44.5 per cent) and the garden (39.8 per cent) Sixty-seven per cent of children said they preferred ‘free, unstructured play’ rather than participating in organised games and activities. Of the 25 hours a week average that children spent playing, parents said only 17 per cent of this time was spent with technology. The report, Play For Today, said: ‘What we found was that, contrary to perceptions in the media, children aren’t permanently glued to technology and actually have a preference for playing outdoors. ‘Similarly, their parents really do see play as a fundamental tool to their child’s development and see it as being as important as formal education. ‘However, limited time and anxiety around leaving children to their own devices to play outdoors has meant that the instinctive default for most families is to keep children indoors.’ It added: ‘Free, unbounded, independent play in a variety of outdoor environments such as the street, park, local woods or any open green space is out-of-bounds for many children, unless accompanied by their parents or an adult carer. ‘This is a major concern, particularly given that children are now subject to closer scrutiny over their academic abilities at an even earlier age than previous generations.’ Researchers also asked children to pick their three top places to play. These were parks (54 per cent) followed by the garden (45 per cent) and the home (42 per cent) (Picture posed by models) In other findings, 33 per cent of adults said they did not have sufficient time to play with their children. In July, former children’s minister, Tim Loughton, warned that children spend nearly a year slumped in front of the TV or staring at computer screens by the time they are seven. In a report titled ‘The state our children are in’ for the charity 4Children, the Tory MP cited research by a psychologist suggesting today’s children were at risk of a lifelong dependency on TV and computer screens. Mr Loughton called for a crackdown on the ‘health and safety’ mentality that stopped children taking part in rough and tumble activities. He cited NHS statistics that showed half as many children are being admitted to hospital after falling out of a tree compared to ten years ago.","National Children’s Museum surveyed 1,367 adults and 1,456 children .

"One of the Real Housewives of Miami and her plastic-surgeon husband recently won the right to tear down their historic 1920s mansion, and they spared no time getting on with the demolition. Photos show an excavator razing the beatuiful white spanish-style estate on Tuesday, after years of legal battles with local preservationists. Leonard Hochstein is a local pastic surgeon who calls himself the 'Boob God' and his stay-at-home wife Lisa, 31, has starred on the Real Housewives since its second season in 2012.

Photo shoot: The real housewife posed for a few shots on demolition day . Lisa marked the momentous occasion by sending out a victorious tweet to her 109,000 followers on Twitter, writing: 'I just took the first major chunk out of our star island home in my High heels, I can do anything in heels lol #demolision #bubbye' The Hochsteins purchased the 1925 home as a forecloser in late 2012, paying less than $8million for the property. It was built by Walter deGarmo, Florida's first registered architect. TV star: Lisa Hochstein (left) has been on the Real Housewives of Miami since the second season in 2012 . Stay at home: Lisa does not work. Above, the couple at a restaurant opening in Miami on March 15 . In its place, the Hochsteins will be rebuilding a 20,000-square-foot mega-mansion complete with six bedrooms, seven bathrooms, a home theater, a game room, a wine cellar, five-car garage and a guest house. When local preservationsts found out about the plan, they initially tried to block it by petitioning that the home be historically designated. The move by the Miami Preservation League was eventually thrown out and now the Hochsteins are allowed to start construction on their new home. Falling apart: The Hochsteins show off some of the damaged parts of the decaying home . Coming soon: The 1925s home will be replaced with a 20,000-square foot mansion . Buh-bye! The couple posing outside the home before demolition . Tear-downs have been on the rise in Miami Beach with 53 demolition applications filed between 2012 and 2013. That's more than the seven years combined when there were just 21 applications total. Some homeowners are tearing down their beach-front homes because they lie below the federal flood plain, meaning they have to pay extremely high insurance rates. Another reason is that the land value is often worth much more than the homes itself. For example, the Hochstein's home was valued at $1.2million while the land it lays on is $8.3million. In an interview with the Miami Herald in December 2012, Leanard Hochstein explained why he was tearing down the historic home to make way for something new. 'I'm not trying to make this home a museum,' he said. 'I'm trying to make a home for my family.'","Lisa and Leonard Hochstein bought an historic 1925 mansion in 2012, built by Florida's first architect .

"Levelling the playing field: The NAHT's Russell Hobby said the move would make schooling fairer . Head teachers say pupils from poor families should jump to the front of the queue for places at any school – including those in the independent sector. They say an overhaul of the admissions process is needed to tackle educational disadvantage. The National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) will today publish its Manifesto for Education, which outlines ways to improve social mobility and standards in schools. Other proposals include a cap on teachers’ total weekly working hours and having more frequent, shorter holidays instead of the six-week summer break. The document says that to ‘guarantee a level playing field’, pupils from low-income families should share the same ‘priority’ for places that children in care currently gain in state schools. And it adds: ‘This could include independent schools with charitable status for up to ten per cent of their intake. ‘Independent schools could claim the pupil premium [additional state funding] for these students and all schools should be able to phase in the growth in numbers over time.’ In September it was revealed that half of grammar schools were already overhauling their admissions to admit more poor pupils. Thirty selective schools said they had agreed to give preference to bright children who passed the 11-plus exam and were eligible for free school meals and another 58 were considering the move. Russell Hobby, the general secretary of the NAHT, said: ‘Education is an engine of social mobility but schools and children face an uphill struggle unless all parts of society work together. ‘Schools can lift new generations out of poverty but poverty itself acts as a barrier to their work.’ But Professor Alan Smithers, director of the Centre for Education and Employment Research at Buckingham University, branded the policy as ‘woolly-minded social engineering’. Pushing forward: Half of grammar schools are already admitting more poor pupils (picture posed by models) ‘It’s well intentioned but it does no one any favours,’ he said. ‘The best way to increase social mobility is to identify talent as early as possible and ensure that the pupils irrespective of background get into the most appropriate set or stream.’ And Dr William Richardson, general secretary of the Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference, which represents independent school heads, said its members had been working ‘for many years’ on programmes that promote social mobility. He added: ‘We are as concerned as the rest of society to see the unique qualities and talents of each child nurtured and developed during their schooldays.’ The NAHT also proposes a study of the impact holiday patterns have on pupils and teachers. It suggests more frequent, shorter holidays or a ‘staggered approach across the country on a broad regional basis’.","National Association of Head Teachers launches idea in manifesto today .

"Two academics have highlighted the health benefits of masturbation - and say it can help conditions such as cystitis . It is a subject that has provoked a host of myths, from causing blindness and insanity to the loss of vital organs. Now two academics are on a mission to set the record straight about masturbation - and highlight all the health benefits it can bring. Anthony Santella, a public health scientist at the University of Sydney and his colleague Spring Chenoa Cooper, a senior lecturer, say self-pleasuring can ward off a host of illnesses, from cystitis, diabetes to prostate cancer. They say that 94 per cent of men admit to masturbating, as do 85 per cent of . women - and that it's something even  babies do from the time they are . in the womb. Writing for The Conversation, a website where academics write opinion pieces, they say:  'For women, masturbation can help prevent cervical infections and . urinary tract infections through the process of ""tenting,"" or the . opening of the cervix that occurs as part of the arousal process. 'Tenting . stretches the cervix, and thus the cervical mucous. This enables fluid . circulation, allowing cervical fluids full of bacteria to be flushed . out.' They add that engaging in self-pleasure can also 'lower the risk of type-2 diabetes (though this . association may also be explained by greater overall health), reduce . insomnia through hormonal and tension release, and increase pelvic floor . strength through the contractions that happen during orgasm.' Then there is cancer prevention. Studies have shown that men who regularly have sex may have a lower risk . of prostate cancer - perhaps due to the release of toxins from the prostate gland - and they say that masturbation achieves this same effect. The Australian pair also argue that it . can help prevent depression, due to the 'happy' endorphins produced and . cause a slight hike in levels of the hormone cortisol, which may give . the immune system a boost. It can also help stave off depression, insomnia and boost the immune system, the researchers claim . They add that masturbation is also 'the most convenient method for maximising orgasms' - and that people who orgasm regularly have 'reduced stress, reduced blood pressure, increased self-esteem, and reduced pain'. Last, but not least, they make the point that there's also no risk of disappointing a partner - of the dreaded performance anxiety. And there's no risk of unwanted pregnancies or STIs.","Australian academics say there are numerous benefits of self-pleasuring .

"A New England Patriots locker room attendant who allegedly tried to introduce an 'unapproved' ball into last month's AFC Championship Game at the center of the 'deflate-gate' scandal has now been named and pictured for the first time. An investigation by ESPN identified the attendant who was assigned to the officials' locker room as 48-year-old Jim McNally. Mr McNally has been interviewed by the lawyer who is looking into the allegations the Patriots intentionally used under-inflated footballs. First photo: Jim McNally, 48 (highlighted in top left corner) has been identified by ESPN as the New England Patriots locker room attendant who allegedly tried to introduce an 'unapproved' ball into last month's AFC Championship Game . It's believed McNally has been in charge of the officials' locker room at Gillette Stadium, which hosted the 2015 AFC Championship Game January 18. The Patriots, led by Tom Brady (pictured), beat the Indianapolis Colts . Brady threw three touchdown passes during that game in wet conditions where a firm grip on a slippery ball could have helped . Accused of tampering: New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady is fresh off a big Super Bowl win. Will favorable new Deflate-gate details help bolster his already high spirits? The Patriots worker who became the focus of an NFL investigation after footage showed him carrying game balls into a room before he took them to the field was an elderly gentleman. The room he entered with the balls was a bathroom and he was there for 98 seconds. Both Tom Brady and coach Bill Belichick have adamantly denied any involvement. Eleven of the 12 'Deflate-gate balls' were under-inflated, though only one was two pounds below the required PSI of 12.5 while the others were below by only a small amount. The investigation is ongoing. NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said Friday that 'we have made no judgments.' Now a separate investigation by ESPN is alleging that a locker room attendant was involved in attempted to have an 'unapproved ball' put into play on the field. As soon as the move was noticed, the NFLs vice president of game operations was notified. Source . It's believed McNally has been in charge of the officials' locker room at Gillette Stadium for the last seven years and has worked Patriots games for even longer. The ESPN investigation suggested that McNally tried to give an unapproved football to an alternate official who was in charge of the special-teams footballs. The growing storm over the team's use of illegal balls, which is being referred to as 'deflate-gate,' dominated the buildup to the February 1st Super Bowl. Under NFL rules, game balls must be inflated to between 12.5 and 13.5 pounds per square inch and no alteration is allowed once they are approved. Patriots quarterback Tom Brady threw three touchdown passes during that game in wet conditions where a firm grip on a slippery ball could have helped. Both Brady and Patriots head coach Bill Belichick have professed innocence regarding the deflated ball issue and said they knew nothing about it until the following Monday, after the game. Before every NFL game, footballs are inspected and measured by NFL officials in their locker room before they can be approved for in-game use. NFL officials then place a special mark on each ball so that other officials are aware that it has been inspected and approved. During the game in question, ESPN are alleging that Greg Yette, an official at the game became suspicious when he noticed that a football that McNally handed him did not have the proper markings on it. What was even more alarming was the fact McNally was on the field trying hand him a ball. Locker room attendants usually remain in the dressing room areas and it is rare for them to be assigned ball-handling duties. McNally's alleged involvement in attempting to introduce an unapproved ball into the game caught the attention of the NFL's vice president of game operations, Mike Kensil, who was at the game and sitting in the press box. What is unclear at this stage is McNally's likely motivation for attempting to introduce an impermissible football into the game. Both the official, Yette, and McNally have refused to speak to the press about their specific roles and circumstances on the day. It is also not known if McNally is the same locker room attendant who apparently went into a bathroom with a bag of footballs for 90 seconds before taking them out to the field before the start of the game. Patriots owner Robert Kraft said investigators spent three days at the team's facility during which they were given access to every full- and part-time employee they requested to speak with and every communication device that they wanted to search. Of those balls, reports NFL.com, 10 were likely just slightly under-inflated while only one was a full two pounds per square inch below the 12.5PSI minimum. Inquest: The NFL is investigation into whether the Pats intentionally deflated balls has found that only one of the under-filled pigskins was significantly under the required 12.5PSI . New twist in Deflate-gate: An investigative report from ESPN tells of a locker room attendant who attempted to have an 'unapproved' football used during the game . Patriots coach Bill Belichick has attributed the 11 underinflated game balls to atmospheric conditions and has said the Patriots 'try to do everything right; we err on the side of caution.' Team owner Robert Kraft, in a strong defense of his head coach and quarterback Tom Brady, said: 'I want to make it clear that I believe unconditionally that the New England Patriots have done nothing inappropriate in this process or are in violation of NFL rules.' As the NFL's investigation into 'deflate-gate' continues, the spotlight of suspicion remains firmly fixed on the Patriots with some fans even questioning why New England was allowed to play in the Super Bowl at all. But the Patriots are not stranger to controversy and have developed a reputation as a team not above a bit of skullduggery. In 2007, coach Belichick was fined $500,000 and the Patriots lost a first-round draft pick after an investigation found New England had videotaped an opponent's signals on the sidelines in what became known as 'Spygate'.","Controversy over the deflated balls continues despite the New England Patriots' Super Bowl victory .

"Lena Dunham, creator of the popular HBO series Girls  called Woody Allen a 'perv,' on a panel at the Sundance Film Festival. Dunham spoke about a relationship Woody Allen's character has with a 17 year old in the film Manhattan, and then about the fact he later married his young stepdaughter Sun Yi. 'Woody Allen is proof that people don't think that everything he does in his films is stuff that he does,' she started, 'because all he was doing was making out with 17-year-old girls for years and we didn't say a word about it. And then he did it. A bunch. No one went, 'Oh, Woody Allen is making out with a 17-year-old in the film Manhattan and then lo and behold ...' The Girls creator has said the allegations that Allen sexually molested his estranged daughter, Dylan Farrow, made her 'nauseated.' Scroll down for video . Something to talk about: Dunham gave her two cents on campus rape, abortion, and director Woody Allen. In her recent book 'Not That Kind of Girl' she reveals that she was actually a victim date rape in college . Opening-up: She openly aired her disgust about Woody Allen's allegations of molestation to Mia Farrow . Outspoken:  'In some ways America is at its most puritanical,' Lena Dunham said Saturday at the Sundance Film Festival' Disliked: Dunham has been critical of the director ever since his former girlfriend Mia Farrow and her son tweeted about the Golden Globes tribute to Allen in 2014 . Dunham has been critical of the director ever since his former girlfriend Mia Farrow and her son tweeted about the Golden Globes tribute to Allen in 2014. Of course, Dunham has her own skeletons in the closet, which were not even given a second mention during the discussion. In her memoir, 'Dunham admits to, for no apparent reason, inspecting her one year old sister's vagina. She writes her 'curiosity got the best' of her. In addition, she admitted to bribing her little sister to kiss her on the mouth, 'Basically, anything a sexual predator might do to woo a small suburban girl, I was trying.' Dunham shared the stage with The Mindy Project creator Mindy Kaling, Bridesmaids star and co-writer Kristen Wiig and Orange Is the New Black show-runner Jenji Kohan for a discussion on women in Hollywood. In the end, the conversation was far more wide ranging as they ladies went onto  discuss pushing humor boundaries, as well as rape on college campuses in America. 'In some ways America is at its most puritanical,' said Dunham in response to a question regarding some of the reactions Girls has received. 'The fact is people are forgetting that humor is a tool for debate. That boycott, censorship, shut 'em down approach to humor shows a very basic lack of understanding of what humor can do for us culturally and what it has always done.' Reality check: Dunham say that the character she plays on 'Girls' is also a privileged, intelligent twenty-something writer living in New York. The actress said many viewers assume the two are one and the same . Opinionated: Dunham, 28, who recently published the bestselling memoir Not That Kind of Girl, said the phenomenal popularity of her series Girls has seen her tagged with the dreaded 'voice of a generation' label . Speaking out: The actress ended the talk with her thoughts on the increasingly prevalent issue of sexual assaults taking place in colleges across the country . She also told the audience that she is quite different from her character, Hannah Horvath. 'People equate the words coming out of your character's mouth with a real life philosophy that you don't possess.' The topic then shifted to that of abortion and campus rape. 'The idea that women can't be complete and total citizens until they have control over the destiny of their own bodies is important to me' Dunham said of reproductive rights in America. 'It's not just a political issue, it's a lot about class, race and it feeds into all these other forms of inequality and injustice that exist in our country.' Hollydwood lades: From left, Emily Nussbaum, Kristen Wiig, Jenji Kohan, Lena Dunham and Mindy Kaling attend the ¿Power Of Stories: Serious Ladies' panel during the 2015 Sundance Film Festival . Topical: The Girls star and creator candidly worked in her thoughts on abortion, campus rape, and Woody Allen into a panel at Sundance . Dunham  wrote in her recent best selling memoir Not That Kind of Girl about an assault on her when she was in college. 'One of the reasons it is important to talk about campus assaults is that that these women in positions of incredible privilege are still being forced every day to fight for their truth and that is indicative of the fact that sexual assault is an epidemic and so many people are voiceless. I think campus' are a great place to start because that's where we're being educated and that's where we're told we're going to be safe.' The four women on the panel also weighed in how they broke into the entertainment industry and the challenges they face as its minority gender. All said they realized early on that if they wanted to tell the stories they cared most about, they'd have to take the reins and do it themselves. And they found TV a far friendlier environment for female voices than film. 'There's just a lot more opportunity,' Kohan said. 'It seems like film is really behind.' Even with the success of 'Weeds' and 'Orange Is the New Black,' Kohan said the only scripts she's been offered to write involve 'weddings and moms.' Dunham, too, said after earning acclaim for her first film, 'Tiny Furniture,' she was given opportunities to pen such scripts as 'Strawberry Shortcake.' She wasn't interested, so she created 'Girls.' They hope their current successes help pave the way for other women with Hollywood dreams. All four rely on writing teams populated by mostly women, but they don't count men out. 'You shouldn't have to just limit yourself to one gender,' Kohan said. 'You want to work with whoever is the best at what they're doing.'.

"A father who stabbed his girlfriend and their six-year-old son to death has failed in a legal bid to inherit her full state but will still receive £60,000 worth of assets. Paul Chadwick, 35, was already entitled to half the proceeds of any sale of the bungalow he owned with Lisa Clay, in Bolton-le-Sands, Lancashire, but was also bidding for her half of £60,000, as well as another £20,000 of assets in her name. However, the landscape gardener - who admitted two counts of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility last October - had his claim rejected by Judge Mark Pelling QC at Manchester Civil Justice Centre today. Paul Chadwick, 35, who stabbed his partner Lisa Clay (together above) and their six-year-old son in April last year, had been trying to claim he was entitled to her £60,000 share of the bungalow they owned in Lancashire . Chadwick, who is currently being held at Guild Lodge psychiatric hospital in Preston after being sentenced to an indefinite hospital order for his crimes, submitted a claim to the court for his partner's assets. He claimed that Marks & Spencer employee Miss Clay, 40, would have wished him to inherit the £80,000 and said he was 'very unwell' at the time of the killings on April 9 last year, which he added were 'not by my hands'. Chadwick was calm and composed when he appeared at the trial on Monday to argue that he should be entitled to the balance of Miss Clay's estate. Wearing a crumpled red and white striped shirt and short blue tie, he said: ‘It is not about benefiting. ‘I was unwell. I nearly took my own life. I have got about 20 injuries to myself and stuff. ‘This is to put to the courtroom that I was very unwell at the time. I have been through the worst that I could ever imagine. It can’t get any worse than I already have. ‘I have lost more than any money that can be given to me. I have lost more than that. I have not benefited in any way. I have lost Lisa and I have lost my son Joseph. Money cannot take away from that. ‘Money does not mean anything in life, happiness is the main thing in life.’ The law states that those convicted of murder or manslaughter cannot inherit from their victims or profit in any way from their crimes, but the forfeiture rule can be modified to take into account the conduct of the offender, the deceased and any other relevant material concerned. Chadwick admitted two counts of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility after stabbing his partner Lisa Clay, 40, and their six-year-old son Joseph (together above) at the family home in April last year . Today, Judge Pelling said: 'In my judgment the justice of the case does not require that I modify the effect of the forfeiture rule in the circumstances of this case.' He added: 'While the level of culpability is reduced and even perhaps significantly reduced by the impact of the mental disorder from which the claimant was suffering on 9 April 2013, it was not eliminated or reduced to the level where it could properly be said to be so low that to give effect to the forfeiture rule would be contrary to the public interest.' The estate is destined for Miss Clay's extended family of aunts and cousins. Chadwick had argued that 'small amounts of money scattered thinly' would make less difference than giving him the chance to buy a house, rather than half a house. The killer had attempted to take his own life before the bodies of his partner and son Joseph were discovered at the property on April 9 last year. He was taken to hospital with stab wounds before being taken into custody and later transferred to Guild Lodge, where he has been ever since. In this week's hearing, his barrister Michael Whyatt told the court that Chadwick was a changed man who was hoping to rebuild his life at some point. He said: 'Chadwick has a very, very low level of culpability for what happened. It is a serious offence that he is in treatment (for), not in prison. 'The size of the estate is modest. Small amounts of money scattered thinly are going to make less difference than to give the complainant some potential to rebuild his life after he is released back into the community.' David Gilchrist, representing Miss Clay's aunt, Greta Squires, told the trial that Miss Clay made a will before her death which said her estate should go to Chadwick in the event of her death. But the barrister said that will did not 'contemplate the circumstances of her death'. He said: 'Therefore, as an expression of her wishes it does not really assist the court.' Miss Clay's aunt, Greta Squires, welcomed the ruling. In a statement released by Slater & Gordon solicitors, she said: 'It is our belief that justice has been done. 'We have faced a nine-month ordeal preparing for this case. We have had to relive the harrowing details of Lisa and Joseph's death and listen to Chadwick pleading the victim in court. Judge Mark Pelling QC rejected his claim in a written ruling at Manchester Civil Justice Centre (pictured) today . 'But we were willing to bear this torment to defend the principle that crime should not pay. 'We hope this is the end of this matter and we are able find peace and know that Lisa and Joseph's memory has not been violated by this killer.' The judge noted that Chadwick still has a half-share of the house and also half of the couple's joint bank account. He said: 'While there is no evidence to suggest that the claimant's release is imminent, I have proceeded on the basis that there will come a time when he will be released and will require funds to help him to re-establish his life in the community. 'While it is clear that the claimant has earned his living in the past from semi-skilled self-employed gardening work, I accept that it may be difficult for him to earn his living in that way in the future. 'Whilst these factors weigh in the balance in favour of modifying the effect of the Forfeiture Rule, in my judgement they do not outweigh the other factors to which I have referred.'","Paul Chadwick, 35, stabbed partner Lisa Clay and six-year-old son to death .

"It is 10.15 on a Sunday morning at the Shipwrights council playing fields in Sunderland, kick-off is a quarter of an hour away and there is no sign of the home team. Willow Pond FC, a second division pub side, are locked out of the car park and are getting changed on the roadside. The odd player still wears the ink of a nightclub entry stamp. A woman of about 50 – militant in her approach – marches from Pickersgill House, a sheltered housing scheme nearby. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Julio Arca in action for Willow Pond FC and talk to Sportsmail . Meet Willow Pond FC's new star player - former Sunderland and Middlesbrough midfielder Julio Arca . The Argentine made 177 appearances for the Black Cats during his stay . Rather than the Stadium of Light today, Arca is at the Shipwrights council playing fields . Argentinos Juniors (1999-2001) Apps: 36 Goals: 0 . Sunderland (2001-2006) Apps: 177 Goals: 23 . Middlesbrough (2006-2013) Apps: 180 Goals: 9 . She hollers: ‘Who’s in charge? You can’t leave your cars here, what happens if we need to get an ambulance in?’ It is then that she realises. ‘Bloody hell, how you doing son?’. Julio Arca (pronounced Hoo-lee-o Aaa-ca in these parts) – the city’s adopted son and former Sunderland favourite of 177 appearances – happily engages in conversation. The abandoned cars – Peugeots not Porsches – are not mentioned again. It is now 10.20. In the distance, four aluminous, checked corner-flags emerge from the bushes followed by a group of lads from Royal Marine FC dragging two nets. Game on. Arca – still only 33 and forced to retire earlier this year because of a toe injury – pays his £3.50 subs and races through a warm-up routine, which, for some of his team-mates, does not extend beyond a blast at their goalkeeper, who normally plays in midfield. There are a few nudges and glances from the opposition, they’re about to share a pitch with their Black Cats idol, a ball-playing midfielder who was signed by Peter Reid from Argentinos Juniors for £3.5million as a 19-year-old in 2000. He had captained Argentina’s World Cup winning Under-20 side, which included Fabricio Coloccini, Maxi Rodriguez, Javier Saviola and Willy Caballero. Arca admits that his team-mates don't make the same kind of runs he is used to . The former youth international poses with his team-mates ahead of a crucial game... against Royal Marine FC . Today, though, the players are overweight, the pitch is overgrown and play is overcrowded. Except when Arca has the ball. His first touch is second nature, his final pass never wayward. He is shown due respect. One lad, however, having been outwitted by Arca, tugs on his jersey as he breaks away. He immediately regrets it and apologises. There is a handshake and the perpetrator is all smiles. He’s not going to wash that hand. Those on the sideline seize upon his weakness. ‘Aww, friends, football friends,’ they mock, using the line from The Inbetweeners. The comedy apart, it’s a cracking contest and Arca is its best player, save for one audacious 45-yard lob which buries itself in the bushes and calls for a new ball. Willow Pond win 1-0, they are honest, hard-working and enjoy it from first minute to last. Arca provides the class. Arca was the star of the show as his side won the game 1-0 . Back down to business, Arca admits he enjoys heading to the pub after the matches . Arca was bought for a total of over £5m by Sunderland and Middlesbrough, now he pays £3.50 in subs . And so it is back to the boozer to celebrate, the former Premier League footballer pulling up his barstool among the boys, including workers from car plant Nissan, plumbers, security guards and students. There are two questions for Arca, whose Argentinian wife Valeria is at home a few miles away in Ashbrooke with their boys Mateo, two, and three-month-old Franco. How and why? ‘I know one of the lads, Andy. When I was still playing he always said to me, “You’ll have to play for us one day”,’ he laughs, suggesting the idea was never entertained. ‘Then we came here for a drink about five weeks ago and he asked me again. I wasn’t playing so thought “Okay, why not?”. He got me to sign the forms that day! ‘It was only when I started playing again with these lads that I realised how much I was missing it. ‘You have to adapt and I can’t expect them to run all over. The first few weeks I was looking for a pass and it wasn’t there. I now know what they can and can’t do. But I’ve scored a couple of goals, a free-kick on my debut, and it’s great when you win.’ Still in shape, Arca gets ready for the game against Royal Marine FC . The 33-year-old says he doesn't need the swanky footballer bars to have fun . He continues: ‘My missus wants me in the house with our boys but she is okay about this - she knows how much I love it. Last night my little one did not sleep at all and I was up every two hours, but that’s fine, this isn’t the Premier League anymore. ‘But they are great lads and I’m just one of them. I love it. I’ve been out with them for a few drinks and it’s great fun – no shiny bars like when you’re a footballer, just good old pubs like this.’ Arca moved to Middlesbrough from Sunderland in 2006 and, after 181 appearances, that is where his career was brought to a premature end. ‘I picked up the injury in 2006,’ he reveals. ‘I played with Cortisone injections to take the pain away. As the years went on I was having too many injections and I went for an operation. They tried to correct the position of my toe but it didn’t work out, it was too painful to play. ‘My contract finished in 2013 and I tried rehab for nearly a year but it just didn’t work out. It’s hard to accept at times. My body is still fine and, apart from the foot injury, I could still be playing.’ Arca and his family plan to return to Quilmes – 11 miles south of Buenos Aries - next year, where media work or coaching is the plan. But the North-East will always be his second home. He plans to head back to Argentina with his family for media work or possibly coaching . ‘I have been here nearly 15 years away from my family,’ he says. ‘It’s been great and I would do it all again, no regrets. ‘Everyone has always been friendly with me. I always get people talking to me, but I love that. I’m just a normal lad who was lucky enough to get paid to play football. ‘Now I pay to play, although you do get a free pint if you’re man-of-the-match!’ It was Arca who was involved in the challenge which ended Alan Shearer’s career in 2006. It was innocuous and the Newcastle legend was due to retire the following month in any case. Still, though, the lads from Willow Pond would not let him play in a recent match against a team from Tyneside for fear of reprisal. ‘I get a little bit of a bite from Newcastle fans,’ he smiles, ‘but they’re generally okay with me. Yes, Alan had his last 50-50 with me, but he never blamed me for that, it wasn’t even a tackle really. But the lads here quite like mentioning it.’ Willow Pond FC will be grateful to have his services for a while longer . Arca poses with Sportsmail reporter Craig Hope in the Willow Pond pub after the game . Those same lads are captivated by his tales. ‘I came here as a teenager from a small club in Argentina and was playing in front of 48,000. It was incredible,’ he recalls, enjoying a pint among his new comrades. ‘I could not speak much English but I got involved with the banter. After a few months I went to training with Diego Maradona’s book. I showed Peter Reid the pictures of that goal (dribble against England, including Reid, at Mexico 86) and he wasn’t happy! But he was a great guy and I thank him for bringing me here. ‘I was looking to make that big step to Europe. I took the chance, sometimes you don’t get another one. My mum was upset but my dad understood how important it was. I spent some long nights on my own but I knew what I wanted to do. ‘ . What he has always wanted to do is play football. Sat here in the Willow Pond, that much is obvious.","Julio Arca was asked by a friend to play for pub side Willow Pond FC .

"Whisky is being produced in London for the first time in more than 100 years. The London Distillery Company, based in Battersea, has been granted the capital’s first licence to produce single malt whisky since the early 1900s and yesterday saw its first British spirit flow from the still. The boutique distillery, which has been producing Dodd's gin since the spring of this year, is the first whisky distillery in London since Lea Valley Distillery in Stratford, East London. Whisky is being made in London for the first time in more than 100 . years, thanks to the London Distillery Company, co-founded by Darren . Rock (pictured) The London Distillery Company, based in Battersea, has been granted the . capital¿s first licence to produce single malt whisky since the early . 1900s . The boutique distillery, which has been producing gin since spring of . this year, is the first whisky producer in London since Lea Valley . Distillery in Stratford . The alcohol is to be distilled in a 650-litre copper pot still, which has been named Matilda after founder Darren Rook’s Scottish grandmother. The spirit will be produced during the second distillation and matured in casks for a minimum of three years and one day. At this stage, under UK and EU rules, it can legally be sold as single malt whisky. The spirit will be produced during the second distillation and matured in casks for a minimum of three years and one day . The alcohol is to be distilled in a beautiful 650-litre copper pot still, named Matilda after founder Darren Rook's Scottish grandmother . The distillery is to source whisky’s . three main ingredients, water, malted barley and yeast, from local – . south-east England – sources. The barley will be sourced from Warminister Maltings, Wiltshire, and the yeast from Surebrew in Surrey. The distillery has a capacity to fill up to 100 casks. Whisky has three main ingredients - water, malted barley and yeast – which are aged in wooden casks. According to London Distillery Company co-founder Darren Rook, whiskey production in England dates back to the 1300s. In Scotland, the spirit is known as ‘Scotch Whisky’, and this cannot be produced in any other country. The production of whisky in England used to operate in London and other cities in the UK before ceasing entirely in the early 1900s. However, there has been a recent revival, with a producer in Norfolk, The English Whisky Company, becoming the first to distil the spirit in 100 years in 2009. The first bottles of whisky, which are not yet named, will be released by the London Distillery Company in 2016. ‘It is not widely known that the capital has a great heritage of whiskey production dating back to before Chaucer,’ said Mr Rook. ‘Since meeting co-founder, Nick . Taylor, it has taken just over three years of hard work from the early . concept to get to where we are today. ‘We are really excited to be part of a new chapter in the city’s distilling legacy.’ The distillery is to source whisky's three main ingredients, water, . malted barley and yeast, from local - south-east England - sources . The barley will be sourced from Warminister Maltings, Wiltshire, and the yeast from Surebrew in Surrey, with the distillery based in Battersea . Darren Rook named the 650-litre copper pot after his Scottish grandmother, Matilda . Mr Rook said it was the company's intention to perfect gin and whiskey production, but did not rule out producing further spirits in the future, saying: 'There are definitely more spirits on the horizon.' He added: ‘This is really only the start of the journey as we have some time until the whisky reaches its optimum. ‘We’re aiming to create an historical style of single malt with a great depth of flavour and floral backbone. ‘That said, thanks to our small size and the equipment, we are not limited to one style. One fermentation will fill one cask, so we are able to experiment and create bespoke whiskies.’ The distillery has a capacity to fill up to 100 casks . According to founder Mr Rook, who works alongside head distiller Andrew MacLeod-Smith (right), whisky production in England dates back to the days of Chaucer .

"Trendy teaching methods such as lavishing praise on pupils can be harmful to learning, says a study published today. It warns that many ‘common practices’, such as allowing youngsters to discover key ideas by themselves, are either ‘ineffective or inefficient’. The report from the Sutton Trust education charity outlines a range of popular techniques used in classrooms that are ‘not supported by research evidence’. Trendy teaching methods such as lavishing praise on pupils can be harmful to learning, according to a study published today by an education charity (file pic) Examples include using praise ‘lavishly’, which many teachers believe is an ‘affirmative and positive’ way to encourage low achievers. It points out that a number of studies suggest that the ‘wrong kinds of praise’ can be ‘very harmful to learning’. Research has shown that praise which is meant to boost struggling pupils ‘actually conveys a message of the teachers’ low expectations’ of their ability’. As a result, ‘it can actually lower rather than enhance self-confidence’, the report reveals. The report by Professor Rob Coe and colleagues at Durham University reviewed more than 200 pieces of research. It says another popular technique, ‘discovery learning’, where pupils find key ideas by themselves, is also ineffective. The study says: ‘If teachers want them to learn new ideas, knowledge or methods they need to teach them directly.’ Former education secretary Michael Gove warned such teaching methods were 'sidelining' members of staff from their 'central role in education' Another trendy teaching method is child-centred learning, where pupils are believed to learn best if teachers tailor lessons to their ‘preferred learning style’. The report says: ‘A belief in the importance of learning styles seems persistent, despite the prominence of critiques of this kind of advice.’ However, the evidence is clear that ‘there are no benefits for learning from trying to present information to learners in their preferred learning style’. Likewise, it is untrue that pupils remember best if they are always ‘active’ in lessons, rather than sitting and listening ‘passively’. ‘If you want students to remember something you have to get them to think about it,’ the report says. ‘This might be achieved by being “active” or “passive”.’ Other examples of ineffective teaching practices are encouraging re-reading and highlighting to memorise key ideas. Studies have shown that ‘testing yourself, trying to generate answers, and deliberately creating intervals between study to allow forgetting’ are better. The report also found that grouping pupils by ability makes very little difference to learning, as teachers can go ‘too fast with the high ability groups and too slow with the low’. It said that the two factors with the strongest evidence of improving students’ attainment are teachers’ content knowledge and the quality of instruction. Professor Coe said: ‘Great teaching cannot be achieved by following a recipe, but there are some clear pointers in the research to approaches that are most likely to be effective, and to others, sometimes quite popular, that are not. ‘Teachers need to understand why, when and how a particular approach is likely to enhance students’ learning.’ Former education secretary Michael Gove warned that trendy teaching methods were ‘sidelining’ members of staff from their ‘central role in education’. Last year, Michael Young, emeritus professor of education at the Institute of Education, University of London, claimed that many teachers have an ‘actual fear of knowledge’ and believe it is wrong to correct pupils’ mistakes.","'Common practices' are either 'ineffective or inefficient', experts say .

"A mother has told of her shock at learning her sons were shut in a punishment room for ‘long periods’ at their primary school. Alison Lovett claims Ricky, 12, and Kyle, nine, were often put in the room at Brompton-Westbrook Primary School, which she says isolated Kyle around 50 times. The school, in Chatham, Kent, became the focus of a council investigation after a former employee complained to Ofsted. Yesterday, she described the ‘disgraceful’ way children were dragged ‘kicking and screaming’ to the space. Alison Lovett says her boys were 'locked in a small room for long periods' as punishment at primary school . It came as Mrs Lovett, 37, said her boys were ‘locked in for long periods’ and left to do schoolwork. She said her son Kyle, who is dyslexic, needed staff help. Ricky, who has ADHD, says he was put in the room for whole days as often as twice a week, starting when he was seven or eight. Kyle claims he was put in the room for the first time aged six or seven. Mrs Lovett believed her sons were in a ‘My Space’ area for difficult children, staffed by a teacher. Instead, she says they were alone in a space a metre wide and four metres long with a broken desk. Kyle has described being given five pegs he could exchange with staff for help with work or a trip to the toilet. When the pegs were used up he said he was not allowed out again – or given more help. He said he was not let out for meals. Yesterday Mrs Lovett, who lives in Chatham, Kent, said: ‘They’re locked up like they’re criminals. ‘Ricky can’t be in small rooms any more. It’s deeply affected him. He seems constantly on edge . . . In my eyes that is abuse. I agree with isolation rooms, it helps [children with ADHD] to have somewhere to calm down, but what I don’t agree with is a door being locked.’ Brompton-Westbrook's trustees hired an investigator to look into the claims but insist their punishments meet Department for Education guidelines . Medway Council children’s services found that four members of staff at the school had a ‘case to answer’ for gross misconduct. Both boys have moved schools. The allegations are said to involve at least eight children. But during its investigation, the school became an academy – taking it out of the council’s control. On Monday, the council met with school officials and the Department for Education. A council spokesman said: ‘It is now for the school’s own trustees to decide what to do.’ Local authorities have complained that the independent status of academies makes them difficult to oversee. Academies and free schools, now said to number around 3,500, are independent of local authority control and accountable directly to central government. The system was supposed to strip away bureaucracy hanging over headteachers, but critics have questioned whether Whitehall is able to monitor so many schools. The Local Government Association (LGA) said this summer that the 'two-tier system' was confusing for parents who want to raise issues about schools and allowed complaints to 'slip through the net'. The LGA called for a local trusts to oversee all types of state school, giving parents one single local body to deal with. The Independent Academies Association called the idea 'a step back into the past'. The school’s website calls ‘My Space’ a supervised exclusion area. A spokesman for the trustees said last night that they had noted the council’s suggestions and hired an independent investigator. She added: ‘The trustees are confident that the way the school deals with disruptive behaviour is in accordance with Department for Education guidelines. 'Brompton-Westbrook has a great deal of experience of supporting children with challenging behaviour and is able to use isolation when necessary to protect other children, staff, and to help the child to calm down. ‘The isolation space has a roof light and at the time of the allegation had a door with glass and is a space within a larger teaching area. ‘Rarely was the door shut. There may well have been times when children had to be contained in the area under supervision for their own safety and wellbeing and for the safety of others. ‘We used that space for about three years and in total around 15 pupils will have been isolated there... Pupils are always supervised and have toilet and meal breaks in line with Department for Education guidance.’","Boys were repeatedly put in 'isolation room' at primary school, mother says .

"If your daily commute ever seems like a drag, console yourself with the thought that it is making you younger. According to Einstein’s Theory of Relativity, time slows down as we speed up – meaning Tube travellers, for example, age less quickly. The downside is that the effects are tiny – a typical commute turns back time by just a few millionths of a millionth of a second. Getting younger on the move: Tube travellers age less quickly, but the effects are tiny – a typical commute turns back time by just a few millionths of a millionth of a second . Even a Tube driver would not earn back a whole second by the end of their career. Physicist Shane Bergin, of Trinity College Dublin, said: ‘Time isn’t constant. The faster you travel, the slower the second hand ticks for you. Imagine twins. Both of them are given very accurate clocks. One twin is sent on a train that travels at incredible speeds. 'Time isn't constant': Professor Shane Bergin was speaking at the American Association for the Advancement of Science's conference in San Jose . 'The other remains at home, moving about at a speed far slower than the first twin. When the twin who travelled by train returns home, both twins compare the time on their clocks. Less time will have passed for the twin who took the train, relative to the twin who stayed at home.’ Professor Bergin told the American Association for the Advancement of Science’s conference in San Jose, California, yesterday that such insights would help ordinary people appreciate the beauty of physics. And he pointed out that Tube travellers may not realise that they become lighter when taking the lift up from platform level. ‘You have weight because gravity is pulling you down,’ said the professor. ‘So when you are in a lift and you are being accelerated upwards, you are lighter because you are working against gravity.’ Another of Professor Bergin’s 12 insights was that Tube escalators are made of stardust – because almost everything on Earth is made up of elements formed billions of years ago at the heart of a star. Spewed out into space when the star died, they eventually pulled together to make planets, people - and escalator materials. Professor Bergin has launched the Dart of Physics project to try to popularise the subject.","Einstein's Theory of Relativity states time falls in speed as we get faster .

But it didn't last long for him as he suffered a flat tyre on his car... but at least the wheels didn't come off for the Dutchman . The Man Utd boss also stopped to sign a few autographs for some fans on his way out despite the car troubles . Despite the glowing praise of Everton, Van Gaal still insists he wants United to dominate the Premier League fixture . Van Gaal said: 'I have to say that I like Everton because they want to play football like I want to play football. It shall be a very interesting game. 'I know Manchester United lost to them twice last year so they're a difficult opponent. 'I hope we can dominate the game but they want to dominate the game also. They are more allowed to play on the counter than we are so that's also the difficulty.' Van Gaal will be hoping his car trouble isn't a bad omen for him ahead of Manchester United's clash with Everton this weekend. The Red Devils boss suffered a flat tyre while out and about driving and signing autographs on Thursday. United have several players back in training but Van Gaal has revealed that players like Marouane Fellaini are not yet ready for 90 minutes. 'It's difficult to explain but you can be fit but not match fit, that's the big difference,' he added. Van Gaal has been implimenting some tough training sessions at Carrington, but says he wants his team to play 'the Everton way' Van Gaal says Paddy McNair will play again on Sunday as United still have three central defenders injured . Van Gaal was in good spirits ahead of his latest Premier League encounter and will look to add to his two home Premier League victories . Everton have only won one game this season and are coming off the back of a tricky Europa League fixture against Krasnodar in Russia on Thursday . Wayne Rooney will miss the game this Sunday after being sent off against West Ham after he needlessly hacked Stewart Downing . 'So, for example, Herrera is fit but he can't play because of his rib fracture. He's fit. But he can not play. So, for example Fellaini has trained one week but he's not fit to play 90 minutes. 'We have eight injuries and one red card so nine players are not available to play. 'I believe we still have three central defenders injured so McNair shall play. He's the only player that can play in that right central defender position. I have chosen him last week. 'For a player like him it's very difficult to maintain that level. That is his biggest challenge.' Van Gaal also revealed that he has spoken to executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward about playing midweek exhibition games and has given the go-ahead. Radamel Falcao (left) and Robin van Persie (right) will be looking to build on their striking partnership this weekend . Louis van Gaal says he has spoken to Ed Woodward about midweek friendlies and has given the club the go ahead . He said: 'I agree with that. I said that also. 'We have spoken last week with each other and Ed Woodward so I fully agree. 'I'm used to playing midweeks but I have said in the first three months we have to wait because it's difficult enough for the players to adapt and adjust to the new play organisation and style and they shall honour that also but we shall play midweeks.

"President Barack Obama has been showing an officially-verified collection of 13 graphic videos to lawmakers that depict the horrors of the chemical gas attacks in Syria in behind-closed-door briefings - as he lobbies to win approval for his plan to use military force against the regime of President Bashar al-Assad. So far, support for the president's plan has been sparse, with even fellow Democrats opposing the use of military force in Syria. He is preparing a media blitz for Monday and promised Americans in his weekly address on Saturday that 'This would not be another Iraq or Afghanistan.' CNN first obtained the official White House collection of 13 videos showing the carnage of the August 21 chemical weapons attack near the rebel stronghold of Demascus. The Obama administration told lawmakers in the Senate Intelligence Committee - which last week approved plans to attack Syria - that the videos' authenticity has been verified by the intelligence community. Many of the videos shown to senators . can be found on Youtube. But what makes this footage unique is the fact . that it has been verified by intelligence officials. WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT - SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Horror: The Obama administration has released a series of videos (pictured)of the victims from the August 21 attack, but in today's interview Assad said there is no way to know the video is not a fake . Sarin: the gas used in the August attack causes convulsions, respiratory failure and ultimately death . Verified: The videos of children having convulsions and other atrocities have been verified as authentic by intelligence officials . The videos show the panic that set in as people began experiencing . the effects of chemical nerve agents, specifically sarin gas, which can . cause convulsions, respiratory failure and ultimately death. In one of the more heartbreaking videos, a room is full of what appear to be the lifeless bodies of dozens of children. In another, men are seen foaming at the mouth and having convulsions. In all, 1,429 people were killed in the vicious attack, including at least 426 children. The attack allegedly was carried out by the Assad regime, and U.S. lawmakers are now deciding whether a military response is warranted. Obama added in his weekly address: ""I know that the American people are weary after a decade of war, even as the war in Iraq has ended, and the war in Afghanistan is winding down. That's why we're not putting our troops in the middle of somebody else's war."" Attacks: The chemical gas attacks occurred on August 21 in the rebel strongholds near Demascus and was thought to have left more than 1,000 dead . Tradition: Muslim tradition requires the dead to be wrapped in a religious shroud and buried within 24 hours of death . Former U.N. Ambassador Bill Richardson told the network that the footage could be vital in the Obama administration's quest to convince Congress and the general public that military force against Syria is justified. 'That video will sensitize the American people that this isn't just an . intervention, that this is a military strike to stop that type of . atrocity,' Richardson, a former congressman and former governor of New Mexico, said. Persuasion: Senator Dianne Feinstein is urging all members of Congress to view the video before voting on intervening in Syria . Babies: Of the 1,429 people killed in the attack, at least 426 were children . Senate Intelligence Committee Chairwoman Dianne Feinstein - who last week voted in favor of military intervention in Syria - has seen the shocking videos and wants all members of Congress to watch them before deciding whether military intervention is justified. President Obama prepared for a national address Tuesday as a growing number of lawmakers, including fellow Democrats, opposed the use of force. The American public didn't yet appear persuaded by Obama's argument that action is needed to deter the future use of chemical weapons. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, who met with more than two dozen European foreign ministers on Saturday, insisted that international backing to take strong action against Syrian President Bashar Assad's regime was growing, not receding. Kerry noted that the ministers, who held an informal meeting of the European Union in Vilnius, Lithuania, made powerful statements condemning the attack, and that increasingly there was a sense of conviction that Assad was to blame. Kerry said the U.S. had agreed to provide additional information to those ministers who were not yet convinced that Assad orchestrated the attack. Children lay dying on the floor in a suburb of Demascus after a chemical attack . Symptoms: One of the many symtoms of syrin poisoning is foaming at the mouth and convulsions . The EU endorsed a 'clear and strong response' to a chemical weapons attack but didn't indicate what type of response they were backing. It also said that evidence strongly points to the Syrian government. Still, the EU urged the U.S. to delay possible military action until U.N. inspectors report their findings. The Europeans were divided on whether military action would be effective. Britain's Parliament has voted against military action. France had been ready to act last week but held off when Obama declared that he would seek the backing of Congress. French President Francois Hollande's announcement appeared to catch French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius off guard. Earlier on Friday, Fabius told EU foreign ministers that there was no need to wait for the U.N. report because it would simply confirm what was already known - that the chemical weapons attack had occurred - but would not say who was responsible. Hollande indicated Saturday that the U.N. report could be ready in a matter of days, and he would then be prepared to make a decision on a French intervention. 'I said ... that I wanted to wait for the inspectors' report, which I know will be ready within a very reasonable time period, that is, not that far from the decision of the U.S. Congress,' he told French television after meeting with Lebanese President Michel Suleiman in Nice, France. 'So, at that moment, I'll have all the necessary elements that will let me tell the French people the decision I have made for France.' However, Martin Nesirky, chief U.N. spokesman, insisted that there would be no preliminary report. The report on the Aug. 21 attack will be given to the U.N. Security Council and other member states once the lab analysis is complete, Nesirky said. Rescuers try to help a boy through a convulsion after a syrin gas attack in a suburb of Demascus in August . 'We are not saying when that will be, except as soon as feasible,' he told The Associated Press. 'This is a scientific timeline, not a political timeline.' Kerry traveled Saturday from Lithuania to Paris to meet with French official and representatives of the Arab League. He joined French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius in hailing the EU statement. 'Some don't believe in taking military action ever at all,' Kerry said. 'And some want to wait for one thing or another, but the overwhelming support is moving in the direction of holding the Assad regime accountable.' Kerry added: 'This is growing, not receding in terms of the global sense of outrage of what has happened.' Fabius said if no action were taken, there would be little hope for a political solution to the crisis. Obama and other administration officials were preparing a dayslong push to gain public and congressional support for a strike on Syria. The challenges they faced were apparent Saturday. Sen. Mark Pryor, an Arkansas Democrat, said he would oppose military action, and dozens of people picketed outside the White House against Obama's request. Pryor said in a statement that the administration had not met his criteria for gaining his support: a compelling national security interest, a clearly defined mission with a definitive end, and a coalition of allies. Support: President Obama and Secretary Kerry likely will not be able to get Congressional support for intervention in Syria . 'Unless there's some new information or some new development or circumstance, I just don't see me changing my vote at this point,' he told The Associated Press in an interview. Protesters at the White House chanted 'They say more war; we say no war' and said their picket line marked a line Congress should not cross as it prepared to vote on the issue. 'Punishment is not at odds with a political solution,' Fabius said. 'Bashar Assad will not participate in any negotiation as long as he believes himself to be invincible.' Saturday's developments left both the U.S. and Europeans in a waiting game. While the Europeans awaited the U.N. inspection report, the Obama administration waited to see if Congress would back a use of force. Meantime, administration officials continued to lobby lawmakers by phone to vote to authorize a limited military strike against the Assad regime. The first Senate vote, expected Wednesday, was likely to be on a resolution authorizing the ""limited and specified use"" of U.S. armed forces against Syria for no more than 90 days and barring American ground troops from combat. A final vote in the 100-member chamber was expected at week's end. A House vote is likely the week of Sept. 16. Asked about the American public's uneasiness about getting involved in another conflict, Kerry reiterated his view that the use of chemical weapons in the Syrian conflict was a threat to the U.S. 'This case has not yet been made to the American people for more than a few days and we will continue to make the case to the American people,' Kerry said in Paris. 'This concerns ever American's security.'","The Obama is showing the new footage to members of Congress to drum up support for his plan for military intervention in Syria .

"Oxford University must ‘reserve the right to investigate subjects of no practical use whatsoever’ to aid students’ pursuit of knowledge, its vice chancellor claimed yesterday. Professor Andrew Hamilton defended learning for learning’s sake, arguing that intellectual curiosity can spark off a ‘hundred unexpected developments’. He used his annual Oration to the university’s Congregation - the university’s legislative body - to insist that ‘learning with no apparent practical use’ sometimes ‘yields the greatest benefit’. His comments fly in the face of a Government drive to encourage more students to take up vital STEM subjects needed for the economy such as science, technology, engineering and maths as well as work-based apprenticeships. Oxford University (pictured) must reserve the right to investigate subjects of 'no practical use whatsoever', vice chancellor Professor Andrew Hamilton has said . Professor Hamilton's comments came during his annual Oration to the university’s legislative body . Professor Hamilton said that Oxford was ‘almost defined by its ability to set problems with no apparent solution’. He said: ‘There will be many occasions when we are challenged about the real-world benefits of our work. ‘When someone asks: ‘What is the earthly use of knowing that?’ We should be strong enough, and confident enough to reply: ‘You know, I’ve absolutely no idea what use it might be. But isn’t it fascinating?’’ The vice chancellor cited research by academics in the university’s Department of Earth Sciences, which recently estimated the body masses of 426 species of dinosaur. The team, along with international partners, discovered that those evolutionary lines which reduced fastest in size had the greatest survival success. Professor Hamilton said: ‘There are 10,000 species of dinosaur alive and around us today – only we call them birds. ‘Now, unless you’re a budgerigar wishing to trace your family tree, that information is of precisely zero practical value. Yet it’s brilliant research and, somehow, I feel better just for knowing it.’ Other academics in the Department of Materials have been investigating the relationship between the electrical and optical properties of materials than can change from amorphous to crystalline states. They discovered that a seven nanometre-thick layer of one of these materials was suitable as an extremely high-resolution and flexible screen. Professor Andrew Hamilton also criticized the Government's 'hostile' international student visa regulations . ‘The potential applications are countless – smart glasses, smart windshields, even synthetic retinas,’ said Professor Hamilton. ‘A patent has been filed and the team are in the early stages of exploring the commercial applications. ‘None of this was ever intended – it’s purely a by-product of the drive to know.’ Meanwhile, in the 1920s, two members of Oxford’s English faculty, one from Magdalen, another from Pembroke, ‘would talk late into the night, exploring their mutual interest in Norse mythology’. Professor Hamilton added: ‘From those beginnings, C.S.Lewis and J.R.R.Tolkein both wrote a series of books loved the world over which have inspired film franchises grossing more than $6.5billion at the box office.’ These academics ‘didn’t have an inkling’ that their ‘intellectual curiosity’ could spark such phenomena. However, Professor Hamilton warned that it is ‘still all too rare’ to hear Higher Education described as ‘just about the most important investment a nation can make on behalf of its citizens’. He said: ‘That’s why I have somewhat limited expectation, come the general election, that properly developed policies on higher education (as opposed to vain-glorious point-scoring on past crimes and misdemeanours) will take up much of the politicians’ time or attention. ‘That’s sad – because it is exactly the sort of issue on which a real effort to find a new, meaningful consensus between the parties would be of immense benefit – benefit, of course, to the students and to the universities of the future, but also … hugely beneficial to the public good.’ He also attacked the Government’s tightening of student visa regulations, which he believes is directly harming UK interests. He said: ‘Wherever I travel in the world, particularly in China and India, one question persists. ‘Why has the UK adopted a visa system so hostile to student entry? I do my best to answer but, frankly, the question baffles me as well. ‘For the first time in decades, the number of international students at our universities has dropped, most markedly from India. Why are we doing this to them – and to ourselves?’ Nobel Prize winner, John O’Keefe, also warned yesterday (tues) that the British government’s policies on immigration and animal research were risking the country’s scientific standing. The US-born neuroscientist won the prize for rat research into the brain’s inner ‘GPS system’. He said immigration rules were ‘a very, very large obstacle’ to hiring the best scientists, and animal testing rules could prevent vital research.","Oxford University must retain right to teach subjects of no practical benefit .

"Poor pupils will be allowed to jump the queue for places at all primary and secondary schools in England, the Government has confirmed. Ministers have torn up admission rules that forbid selection on the basis of family finances. This will let state schools give low income youngsters top priority in return for extra cash as part of a flagship policy by Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg. Pupils from low income families will be allowed to jump the admission queue under a new Lib Dem policy . The shake-up comes despite critics warning of ‘large numbers of children being unable to access their local school. The revised School Admissions Code will come into force in December. It allows primaries and secondaries to give ‘admission priority’ to children eligible for the Pupil Premium – extra money to encourage them to take in more disadvantaged youngsters. At present, only free schools and academies can do this. In addition, primaries will be able to give priority for reception places to disadvantaged youngsters who attend their nurseries. There will be no legal requirement for schools to change their admissions criteria. Mr Clegg’s Pupil Premium is worth £1,300 per primary school pupil and £935 for secondary school children. More than half of England’s 163 state grammars have already indicated they plan to rewrite admissions criteria to give priority to poorer pupils. The Government launched a consultation on the proposed changes in July, leading critics to warn of a potential ‘detrimental impact’ on some families. The Department for Education said: ‘This change…will provide all schools who wish to use it with a practical means to support the most disadvantaged in society.’ It added: ‘Many respondents were in agreement with the principle of this change, but some expressed concerns that schools would be required to adopt it, or that it would lead to large numbers of other children being unable to access their local school. The new plan is part of a new flagship Lib Dem policy by leader Nick Clegg . ‘As stated in the consultation document, there will be no requirement for admission authorities to include such a priority in their admission arrangements. This will be an option open to schools, who may adopt it if they wish.’ In a further change, the government is making it clear to schools that parents of summer-born children can ask for them to start reception classes at five – a year later than usual. Education officials must consider each request and state reasons for refusal. Professor Alan Smithers, director of the Centre for Education and Employment Research at Buckingham University, yesterday accused the government of ‘continually meddling’ with school admissions. He said: ‘Favouring pupils from low income homes means that other pupils will miss out on their local schools. ‘Quite why schools should be guided to prioritise poor children over, say, high ability children is not at all clear. ‘If I were a parent with a particular school in mind who couldn’t get a place because of this, then I would be very upset indeed.’ Neil Leitch, chief executive of the Pre-School Learning Alliance, has previously warned that parents of eligible Pupil Premium children may ‘feel under pressure’ to enrol them in a school nursery early instead of a childminder in order to gain priority for reception places. He said he was concerned about the ‘potentially detrimental impact this could have on children and families’. Last year’s annual report from the Office of the Schools Adjudicator said that the ‘practice of some primary schools of giving priority for admission to the reception year to children who have attended particular nursery provision has been found to be unfair to other local children’.","Children from low income homes will be allowed to jump the queue for places .

It is like he’s here for a long time. ‘If you ask him now if he regrets the move, I’m sure he’d say no. If you ask him if he’d choose a different option, he’d say no. And if you ask him where he thinks he’ll be in five years, he’d say he sees himself here in five years. He is Chelsea.’ Despite the protracted and unsavoury manner of Fabregas’s Arsenal departure in 2011, Wenger insisted ‘he is a person I love’ and called for fans to give him a ‘respectful’ reception. Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho is hopeful noise from the Blues fans will drown out '3,000 red fans' The Spanish midfielder has scored one goal and picked up seven assists since the start of the season . But Wenger also claimed it was his decision to ignore Fabregas — and the buy-back option Arsenal held — once he learned he was willing to leave Barcelona. Wenger’s call was shaped by the £42million signing of Mesut Ozil as a replacement, although the Arsenal manager also indicated that Chelsea had wrapped up a £30m deal by the time he was aware of his former captain’s availability. Wenger even suggested that the deal had been agreed ‘in early 2014’. Asked if Fabregas wanted to return to Arsenal, Wenger said: ‘Certainly, yes. I don’t want to make a big story of that because you have to accept that. When he left, we bought Ozil. We were not in need of offensive players. ‘Cesc, when he looks back at his career, will find that Arsenal and myself had a very positive influence. I have no personal animosity against Fabregas.

"A suspected contract killer - described by his defense attorney as 'likeable and polite' - has confessed to investigators that he carried out up to 40 murders in a career spanning decades, according to a prosecutor. Jose Manuel Martinez, 51, has been charged in central California with killing nine people, but he told investigators he carried out many more while working as an enforcer for a Mexican drug cartel, according to Errek Jett, the district attorney in Lawrence County, Alabama. Mr Jett said they believe Martinez because of the details he gave investigators. Accused: Prosecutors are calling Jose Manuel Martinez a contract killer and have charged him with murdering nine people in three counties . October 21, 1980: David Bedolla, 23, of Lindsay. The victim was shot while driving his vehicle to work with his wife, brother, and brother-in-law. The shooting took place between Lindsay and Strathmore in Tulare County.October 1, 1982: Sylvester Ayon, 30, and the attempted murder of 17-year-old G. G., who were both shot while working on a ranchnear the Santa Ynez area off Refugio road (Santa Barbara County). G.G. survived the shooting while Sylvester Ayon died from multiple gunshot wounds.October 19, 1982: 22-year-old Earlimart resident Raul Gonzalez (Tulare County). The victim was last seen at his home on October 19, 1982. Two days later his body was located by ranchers off Fountain Springs Road, east of Porterville. He had been shot and stabbed multiple times.April 8, 1995: Domingo Perez, 29, of Earlimart, CA (Tulare County). The victim was reported missing by family members on April 8, 1995. His body was located in an orange grove just north of Richgrove in Tulare County on May 23, 1995. He had been shot multiple times.February 14, 2000: Martinez is charged with the murder of 56-year-old Santiago Perez of Pixley (Tulare County), who was shot to death in his bed in the early morning. The victim’s four minor children were home at the time of the shooting.February 15, 2007: Jose Alvarado, 25 (Kern County). The victim was located on a dirt access road outside of the town of McFarland in Kern County. He had been shot multiple times.March 23, 2009: Juan Bautista Moreno, 52 (Kern County). The victim was located in an orange grove south of Elmo Highway near McFarland in Kern County. He had been shot multiple times.September 30, 2009: Joaquin Barragan, 45, of Earlimart. The victim was located on the bank of Deer Creek canal just east of Earlimart by ranchers working the area. He had been missing since September 27, 2009. Mr. Barragan suffered multiple gunshot wounds. February 7, 2011: Gonzalo Urquieta, 54, of Earlimart. The victim was located in an orange grove just outside of the town of Richgrove, CA. He had been missing since February 5, 2011. Mr. Urquieta was shot multiple times. Source: Office of the District Attorney County of Tulare . Martinez told investigators that he had been working as an enforcer since the age of 16. 'It’s how he fed his family, is how he explained it,' Marion County, Alabama, Sheriff's Det. T.J. Watts told CNN in June 2013. 'And if he didn’t do the job, someone else would do it.' Martinez was arrested last year shortly . after crossing the border from Mexico into Arizona and sent to Alabama, . where he awaits trial on one murder charge. Once word got out, a steady . stream of investigators from across the country came to question . Martinez, Mr Jett said. Defense attorney Thomas Turner, who represents Martinez in that lone case, said his client is eager to start a June trial in Alabama, so he can return to California. Turner said Martinez maintains his innocence to the charge there and doesn't seem to be a hardened killer. 'I've found him to be polite and a likable individual,' Mr Turner said. 'He has a good personality as far as talking with him.' Prosecutors in California say otherwise. Martinez targeted victims in Tulare, Kern and Santa Barbara counties between 1980 and 2011, said Tulare County Assistant District Attorney Anthony Fultz, who filed charges Tuesday. Investigators have released details of their case, saying six of the victims were killed in Tulare County, two in Kern and one in Santa Barbara. They ranged in age from 22 to 56, investigators said. One man was shot dead in 1980 driving to work in the morning, while two men were shot in 1982 working on a ranch, one surviving. The same year, another man went missing before being found two days later by ranchers shot and stabbed to death. Yet another was found in 2000 shot to death in bed with his four children at home. In addition to the nine murder counts, Martinez was charged in California with one count of attempted murder and the special circumstances of committing multiple murders, lying in wait and kidnapping. Four murder charges include the allegation he committed the crime for financial gain, the criminal complaint says. The California charges would make Martinez eligible for a death sentence, if he is convicted. Martinez has lived on and off in Richgrove, a small farming community in Central California about 40 miles north of Bakersfield. He's being held in Alabama, awaiting trial in a 2013 slaying, and Mr Fultz said he's also wanted in Florida on suspicion of two killings there in 2006. Mr Fultz declined to comment on any connection Martinez may have with drug cartels, saying he did not want to damage the case at this early stage. Fultz said that too will remain under investigation. Mr Fultz said he is confident Martinez committed at least the nine killings he's charged with, but he has heard higher figures from across the nation. 'We're actually not sure what the full scope is,' Fultz said. 'It will depend upon what the investigation shows.' Martinez has spent brief stints in state prison following a 2007 conviction on theft and drug charges, according to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. Acting Tulare County Sheriff Mike Boudreaux said his deputies came in contact with Martinez while investigating a rash of home-invasion robberies in late 2012 and early 2013. Life of crime? Martinez claims to have been in a Mexican drug cartel. Such organisations are renowned for their violence, with this picture showing an arsenal of 204 weapons seized from the cartel 'Los Zetas' Martinez was at a home they searched and was questioned by Sgt. Christal Derington, but not considered a suspect. From his cell in Alabama, Martinez requested a meeting with Derington, who flew across country three times, because Martinez said 'he wanted to talk to her,' Mr Boudreaux told The Fresno Bee. The cases in California came together, he said. 'As a result of Detective Derington's initial investigations and interviews, we began working on new leads,' Mr Boudreaux said. 'While this case has been filed, there is plenty of work to be done.' Meanwhile, Martinez's mother told the Los Angeles Times on Wednesday that she was completely overwhelmed by the news of her son's alleged crimes. 'This is hard for me - really hard,' Loreta Fernandez said in Spanish. 'I'm still shaking. I'm not in a condition to deal with this.' Fernandez told the paper that the last time she spoke with her son was in June, when he was detained while crossing the Mexican border because there was a warrant for his arrest in Alabama. She said she didn't believe he committed the murders. 'All I can say is God bless him and that not everything he's saying is true,' Fernandez said.

Men are also paying for fewer enhancements than in the past – perhaps because the pinched and pulled metrosexual look is no longer in fashion. BAAPS members carried out 45,406 operations last year – almost 5,000 fewer than the previous year. Some 41,364 of the ops were carried out on women – a 9 per cent fall. This was driven by a 23 per cent drop in the number of breast enlargements. In 2014, just 8,609 women had the operation – compared with 11,135 in 2013. And many of those that did have the op choose smaller implants that gave a more natural look. With celebrities such as Jordan, who made her name on the strength of her surgically enhanced bust, also down-sizing, the days of ‘pumped up’ cleavage seem to be numbered. The number of women having nose jobs, tummy tucks, brow lifts and ear corrections has also fallen. Fall: The number of procedures undergone by women in 2014 was 9 per cent less than 2013 . However, there has been a 10 per cent increase in the amount of liposuction done. Some 4,042 men had cosmetic surgery last year – a 15 per cent drop on 2013. Strikingly, the figures for all ten most popular ops fell or remained static. Nose jobs, the most popular procedure for men in 2013, fell by 30 per cent. And the number of operations to reduce male breasts or ‘moobs’ dropped by 10 per cent. Eyelid surgery, in which tired, puffy and overhanging skin is removed, is now the most top reason for men going under the knife – but even it is less in demand than in the past. The lack of male interest has been attributed to changing tastes, with the primped and preened metrosexual look falling out of fashion and manly, rugged races growing in popularity. Surgeons say that women too are taking a more natural approach. Rajiv Grover, former president of BAAPS, said: ‘Aesthetic preferences evolve naturally over time. ‘2014 saw men sporting bushy beards and women bushy eyebrow, as well as a number of “enhanced” celebrities downgrade their implant sizes. ‘In cosmetic surgery, the natural, less-is-more look is definitely on the rise, as patients opt to be “tweaked” rather than “tucked”.’ However, they admit that people are also much more safety conscious. Jackie Lewis, a consultant plastic surgeon at the Cromwell Hospital, in London, said that the breast implant scandal ‘really did frighten people’. As a result, prospective patients are doing more research into the potential risks. Mrs Lewis said: ‘I think people are much more aware of the things that could possibly go wrong. ‘People are a lot more informed and sensible now, which is a good thing.’ BAAPS members do around a third of Britain’s cosmetic surgery, so the true number of operations carried out in 2014 will be around 140,000.","Surgeons say breast implant scandal made women think more carefully .

"A school inspector accused of ‘inappropriate copying and pasting’ in his reports has been dropped by Ofsted. David Marshall produced identical or near-identical sections in his assessments of schools over three years while working as a lead inspector for Tribal, a private contractor used by the education watchdog. But Ofsted said it would no longer work with Mr Marshall – who has also been suspended by Tribal – in response to a damning report about his inspections. Concerns were raised with Tribal over similarities in Mr Marshall's reports in 2012, but Tribal insisted they were accurate. Ofsted has now said it will not work with Mr Marshall 'as a result of new evidence' In one example, he used identical wording to describe the maths teaching at three schools he inspected in 2012. Another three schools inspected between 2012 and 2014 had almost identical wording about the support given to new pupils, the investigation by education newspaper Academies Week found. Ofsted’s chief operating officer Matthew Coffey said concerns were raised with Tribal over the similarities in some of Mr Marshall’s reports in 2012. Tribal reviewed his work and insisted it was accurate – but Ofsted has now said it will not work with Mr Marshall ‘as a result of the new evidence brought to our attention’. Mr Coffey added: ‘The professionalism of our workforce and accuracy and quality of all Ofsted inspection reports is our highest priority. Ofsted takes very seriously any allegations of plagiarism or inappropriate copying and pasting in reports.’ As a senior inspector, Mr Marshall conducted around 60 school assessments over the past three years in the South-East and South-West. He has also been the headmaster of two primary schools and has 13 years of ‘extensive experience of inspection’, according to a biography that appeared on Tribal’s website but has now been removed. His dismissal comes just a month after two Ofsted inspectors were suspended for the same offence. At the time, Ofsted’s director of schools Mike Cladingbowl said: ‘Cutting and pasting has happened in the past and we’ve taken action. But I’m pretty confident it’s not routine.’ Some examples of the identical parts in David Marshall's reports that were given to various schools . Robert Peal, an honorary research fellow at the think-tank Civitas and author of a recent report into Ofsted, said: ‘The most basic of computer programmes could be set up to scan new reports, and ensure that this lazy, cynical behaviour by lead inspectors is caught out. The fact that this doesn’t happen just goes to show how contracting out inspections to public-service providers has led to a reduction in quality.’ Ofsted announced this year that it would stop using outside contractors, with all inspectors managed in-house from next year to ensure better quality control. Mr Peal praised the decision, adding: ‘One can only hope that when this does happen, such instances of “cut-and-paste” reporting will become a thing of the past.’","Inspector David Marshall dropped after accusations of copying and pasting .

"Although I'm a beauty lover first and foremost, I also adore my fashion. Some of you may be aware I actually have my own clothing collection with Lipstick Boutique. I'm particularly proud of my latest collection – there's an array of pieces to suit different body shapes, styles and occasions, from glam gowns to more comfortable, casual pieces which are perfect for everyday wear. I recently did a shoot to showcase the collection. I didn't want to go too overboard with my make-up so as not to detract attention from the pieces themselves, so opted for a sleek graphic eye line paired with a summery pop of colour on the lips. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . For her Lipstick Boutique shoot Binky opted for a Sixties-inspired beauty look . Here's how to achieve the look in just a few quick steps: . BEAUTIFUL BASE . First, I prepped my skin with the Guerlain Meteorites Base Perfectrice Pearls. The light diffusing particles in this luxurious primer help correct uneven complexions and provide skin with an illuminated glow. I followed this up by applying Clarins Everlasting Foundation, the medium coverage formula disguises blemishes like a dream while still offering a fresh-faced finish. Living up to its name, this foundation won't budge all day if topped with the right powder, making it my ideal choice for photoshoots or a night out. To set this in place, I brushed a light dusting of Too Faced Primed and Poreless Powder across my face. Binky wanted her make-up to be quite subtle so as not to detract from her clothes . SLIM AND SCULPTED . Next onto contouring: I used the Daniel Sandler Sculpt and Slim Palette to chisel my cheekbones and give my skin a gorgeous shimmery glow. FELINE FLICK . I opted for a simple yet sexy feline flick on the eyes using the Guerlain Liquid Eyeliner. Liquid eyeliner can be tricky to apply, but I find the easiest method to be shutting your eye and stretching out the lid with a finger. Binky opted for a simple yet sexy cat eye flick and paired it with a muted pink lip to keep her look suitable for day wear . Gently dot the eyeliner across the upper lash line, slightly flicking it out towards the outer corner. Once you have your basic shape, build the line up slowly and extend the flick to your preferred size. Make sure you work the eyeliner right into your lash line for a clean, sleek result. I wore individual false eyelashes on the shoot to accentuate my peepers, but if you don't have any to hand, apply generous lashings of Too Faced Lash Injection mascara to give your lashes a similar voluminous flutter. Binky recommends applying a translucent powder to ensure your make-up stays put . PINK POP . Finally, I slicked a coat of Dior Trianon Rouge Lipstick in Rose Crinoline – a gorgeous coral pink tone – over my lips. The creamy yet super long-lasting formula is perfect for occasions where you want your lippy to last without drying out your pout, and the vivid hue complements the simple graphic eye line beautifully. Et voila! A simple and sexy look that works equally well for work or play. You can get all the products I wore on the shoot from Escentual.com.

"Manchester United believe an Old Trafford return for Cristiano Ronaldo next summer will prove almost impossible, it emerged on Friday. United supporters are praying their former hero comes back from Real Madrid to end his career with them next summer. However senior Old Trafford sources told Sportsmail that they believe the cost of bringing the World Player of the Year back to the club will in all likelihood prove prohibitive for a player who will be halfway towards his 31st birthday by the start of next season. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Ronaldo return to United could cost £60m . Real Madrid superstar Cristiano Ronaldo has been linked with a move back to Manchester United . A United fan group flew this 'Come Home Ronaldo' banner over Real's win over Villarreal last weekend . It emerged last week that Ronaldo’s representatives were asking for £20million a year in wages when the Portuguese star was touted around in the summer of 2013. Add a transfer fee of about £60m to that and the cost of the deal becomes clear. A United source said today: 'Ronaldo will always be loved here. 'But if you look at the numbers and his age than you have to ask if it really could be made to work. 'We are not at all sure it can.' Ronaldo made his name at Manchester United, signing in 2003 before moving to Real six years later . Ronaldo celebrates winning the 2008 Champions League in Moscow with Sir Alex Ferguson . VIDEO Ronaldo return to United could cost £60m . Matches: 290 (2003-09) Goals: 117 . Honours: 3 x Premier League . 1 x FA Cup, 2 x League Cup . 1 x Champions League . 1 x FIFA Club World Cup . United believe that their best chance of buying Ronaldo back was actually last summer when he made it clear to them that he was unhappy with life at Real. Club insiders believe that had former manager Sir Alex Ferguson been in charge then the deal may well have happened. A new United team would then have been built around him. As it was, David Moyes was in the first stages of his own short reign at that point and ultimately United believe they were led on by the Ronaldo camp as he tried to engineer a new contract at the Bernabeu. The Portuguese forward celebrates scoring for Real in the Champions League this week . Ironically, it is that deal – eventually signed last September – that now makes it so difficult to bring Ronaldo back to the club where he first came to the world’s attention. With Ronaldo contracted now until 2018, Real president Florentino Perez holds all the cards in terms of dictating a fee for the club’s prize asset.

"From food to houses, it appears there is very little that a 3D printer can’t be used for. And now a hacker in Berlin has built a website that lets people design their own sex toys, as well as 3D print them out. Users can create different shapes, as well as adjust the height, curviness, colour and angle of the toys to produce a 3D computer model. One hacker in Berlin has built a website (picutred) that lets people design their own sex toys, and print them out. Users can create different shapes, as well as adjust the height, curviness, colour and angle of the toys to produce a computer model . The website shows a basic shape of a sex toy. Users can click on points on the outline of the 2D model to transform its shape. A 3D model changes according to their design tweaks. Users can change the height, width, curviness, angle and the colour of the sex toy as well as other options. It is possible to create bizarre shapes. A box displays statistics about the toy including how much silicon is needed to print it out. In theory, users could print out their design themselves. If they do not have a high quality 3D printer, the site lists places in Berlin that can help. This can be printed on a public 3D printer, or reserved for printing at home. Ikaros Kappler used programming language Javascript and 3D library Three.js to build his ‘extrusion/revolution generator’. Users of the website are greeted with an outline of a basic sex toy and can manipulate different points on the 2D drawing to change its shape to suit their preferences. The height, width, curviness, angle and the colour can be altered by selecting various options to create strange shapes, the likes of which may not be on offer at places such as Ann Summers. A design immediately appears as a colourful rendered 3D model to reflect the changes made to the initial basic shape. A small box on the right-hand side of the generator displays information about the design, such as the toy’s height, weight and volume, so that the amount of silicon to make it can be calculated. While most people do not have a sufficiently advanced 3D printer at home that can handle piping silicon, the tool does, in theory, allow anyone to print out a sex toy of their own design, Geekosystem reported. Users of the website tool are greeted with an outline of a basic sex toy (pictured) and can manipulate different points to change its shape to suit their preferences . While most people do not have a sufficiently advanced 3D printer at home (stock image) that can handle piping silicon, the tool does, in theory, allow anyone to print out a sex toy of their own design . The website suggests a number of Hackerspaces in Berlin that could help – if someone is brave enough to ask for assistance. The generator also lets people order a mould and a silicon toy, or just the mould itself, but the people involved in the idea warn: ‘The software and the silicone casting is still somewhat experimental. Results may vary.’ The cost of 3D printers is falling all the time, but many affordable consumer offerings only allow people to print objects made from crude ‘strings’ of molten plastic - meaning the result is not smooth or professional looking. However, high-end printers are being used to make prosthetic limbs, plaster casts and even kidneys and 3D printed tumours. Giant versions of the machines are currently being used to created £3,000 bungalows in China, for example, and the technology could revolutionise kitchens too. A PancakeBot created in Sweden earlier this year can 3D print interesting pancake designs, while another machine creates piped snacks made from crushed insects.

"When Jose Mourinho wants something, Chelsea’s manager comes into his own. The capture of Cesc Fabregas from Barcelona was no exception. The moment he was tipped off that the Catalans’ sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta had told Fabregas he could leave the Nou Camp, Mourinho went to work at breathtaking speed. He flew to Spain to meet Fabregas days after Barcelona’s final La Liga game of the season against Atletico Madrid on May 17. The Spain midfielder was blown away by the gesture. Jose Mourinho (left) pulled out all the stop to acquire the signature of Cesc Fabregas (above) Fabregas has scored one goal and bagged seven assists in a blue shirt so far this season . Mourinho made Fabregas feel special again, a wanted man after three largely frustrating years in the shadow of his great friend Lionel Messi. These grand gestures are Mourinho’s speciality. Getting the personal treatment from a coach who has won titles in Portugal, England, Italy and Spain — and twice lifted the Champions League — usually does the trick. Famously, Mourinho met Ashley Cole in London’s Royal Garden Hotel in January 2005 (without Arsenal’s permission) and also gave Steve Sidwell a tour of his Georgian townhouse in Eaton Square when the player left Reading in 2007. It works every time. This summer, Chelsea’s manager, who had decided to return to the family home in Portugal instead of travelling to the World Cup, wanted his transfer business done early. Blowing the league title, when Chelsea were in with a chance of winning it until his proud unbeaten home record was taken by Sunderland, had irritated him. Mourinho’s pitch to Fabregas, the promise of a position of his own in Chelsea’s midfield and the prospect of being the link man for Diego Costa, convinced him to return to London. Fabregas talks to Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger (right) during a pre-season tour in 2004 . Fabregas learned his trade under Wenger and soon became the Gunners club captain . Fabregas listens to his mentor Wenger back in February 2011 . During the summer, Mourinho used the imminent signing of Diego Costa (left) to seduce Fabregas . By then he knew that Frank Lampard would leave Stamford Bridge after 13 years and Fabregas could be the main man for Chelsea for the next five years. Lampard was earning £150,000 a week in his final year at Chelsea and his departure had left a big hole in the budget. Chelsea could easily afford Fabregas’ salary demands. Mourinho was familiar with Arsenal’s buy-back clause, the agreement reached with Barcelona in 2011 when he returned home in a deal worth £35million. Knowing that Arsenal traditionally move slowly on transfers, Mourinho believed he had time. The biggest threat was Manchester City. Fabregas had scored against City in the Champions League last season, opening the scoring at the Nou Camp when Barcelona ran out 2-1 winners in the second leg of the knockout stage. City declared their interest but believed Fabregas would wait until after the World Cup in Brazil before deciding about his future. Manchester United were keen too, but also waited while Louis van Gaal was leading Holland to the semi-finals in Brazil. Mourinho took full advantage. As early as January this year, when rumours began to circulate that Fabregas would be leaving Barca, Chelsea’s technical department started to log his performances. Mourinho, using a specially designed app on his iPad, was monitoring his targets as the season came to a close. Chelsea’s manager loves that device. Frank Lampard's (above) exit left a big hole in Chelsea's budget, meaning they could afford Fabregas . Fabregas has had several run-ins with Lampard, including this incident in the 2007 Carling Cup final . The Spaniard spent a difficult three years at Barcelona, playing in Lionel Messi's (left) shadow . Chelsea's only concern was the delicate issue of Fabregas's relationship with his girlfriend, Daniella Semaan . Scott McLachlan, Chelsea’s head of international scouts, had delegated different members of staff to travel to every Atletico Madrid fixture. Ostensibly they were present to monitor the form of Thibaut Courtois, but it also gave cover for their pursuit of Costa. Suddenly, Fabregas was also on the list of players routinely monitored by Chelsea. A dossier was built up, a picture of his playing career and personal life as they weighed up the possibility of spending £40m, along with a five-year contract worth £160,000 plus bonuses. On the field he ticked every box. Off the field there was the delicate issue of his relationship with his girlfriend, Daniella Semaan. Her ex-husband, Elie Taktouk, is based in London and he dragged Fabregas’ name into a complicated divorce settlement in the capital’s Court of Appeal last year. It has been far from amicable. That messy divorce was Chelsea’s only concern, but from the moment Fabregas became available, Mourinho decided he was his man. After Fabregas met Zubizarreta a few days after Barca were beaten to La Liga by Atletico Madrid, he was free to leave. Fabregas (left) celebrates Andre Schurrle's second half goal against Manchester City last month . The 27-year-old keeps the ball away from Loic Remy (right) during Chelsea's training session on Friday . As if Sunday’s Fabregas reunion isn’t intriguing enough, John Terry and Alexis Sanchez also have previous. Terry was sent off for kneeing the Barcelona forward, now at Arsenal, which ruled him out of Chelsea’s Champions League win in 2012. Mourinho met Fabregas in Spain, talking to the midfielder for hours about his future and his role in the Chelsea team. Fabregas had become frustrated at the Nou Camp and was never really considered a true Barcelona player by the hardcore supporters. They saw him as a homegrown talent who left the legendary La Masia academy in 2003 for buttons and it had cost the Catalans £35m to bring him home. To them, it didn’t make sense. For his part, Mourinho told the player that his work at Arsenal was done and that Chelsea would dominate domestic football in this country. Wenger, remember, has never beaten one of Mourinho’s teams. John Terry (left) was sent off for kneeing Alexis Sanchez during a Champions League semi-final in 2012 . Fabregas takes on the Sporting Lisbon defence during Chelsea's 1-0 win on Tuesday night . That day, Fabregas agreed to join Chelsea and accept the consequences from the Arsenal fans who once idolised him. On June 12, 2014, the day before Spain’s opening game against Holland at the World Cup, Chelsea announced his arrival on a five-year deal. Wenger has always insisted that he decided not to activate the clause in Fabregas’ contract that gave Arsenal first refusal when he decided to return to London. Yesterday, though, when Arsenal’s manager was asked ‘ultimately, whose decision was it (not to return)?’ he answered emphatically: ‘Cesc Fabregas’.’ The reality is that Mourinho had outmanouevred him.

"These photographs may look like they have been duplicated, but together they give a rare and extraordinary 3D view of the First World War. The rare pictures are among the few in existence showing the devastating battles and the appalling conditions soldiers suffered between 1914 and 1918 in this way.

The key: All the images require a stereoscope - which makes the eyes cross and the two images will then diverge into one to create a 3D photograph . The historic collection of 100 3D photos were taken along the Western Front, including at the Battle of the Somme, the Battle of Arras, and Ypres. Away from the front line there are also images of the Prince of Wales, Army commanders discussing plans of attack as well as buildings and streets devastated by fighting. But there is also a twist, because although most are genuine battlefield shots, others were produced as propaganda to show the war was going well. Experts say some claiming to be from the first battle of Ypres, are . thought to have actually been taken on a training ground in Britain. The collection is being sold at auction . tomorrow in Cirencester. Trench life: Seaforths soldiers sit in trenches while under fire from snipers, with their mascot at the feet .

Royalty: The Prince of Wales, who would one day be King, briefly, in the garden of the chateau which was his HQ in France during the conflict . Chris Albury, an auctioneer who specialises in historical documents, said: 'It's not often you find 100 images like these together in a complete collection. 'What is quite interesting is that there are some that appear to be actual battle field images which were actually photographed on a training ground because there are no bodies with wounds or any evidence of artillery present. 'No individual with a stereo camera would have been so close to an assault where the enemy was climbing over the sandbags. 'It's actually evidence of the First World War media spin, which is quite fun really.' Back home: A Zeppelin shot down near Colchester towers over a nearby farmhouse near the Essex county town . The auctioneer at Dominic Winters in Cirencester, Gloucestershire, added: 'Looking through a Stero-viewer at the images would have been quite sensational at the time because you couldn't have felt much closer to the action while being in the safety of your own drawing room.' The pictures, which form the complete first volume of a Realistic Travels' history of the Great War, are believed to be part of a larger set designed for a stereoscope. Five further volumes were produced and a complete series contains 600 stereoviews. Although showing the same image left and right when layered on top of each other underneath the scope, they form a unique three-dimensional view. The set of images, which Mr Albury believes are among the best he had seen from the period, are expected to sell for between £150 to £200 when they go under the hammer today .","They look like duplicates, but using a stereoscope the photos merge to create a stunning 3D image .

"Arsene Wenger has insisted it was his choice not to re-sign Cesc Fabregas despite the Chelsea midfielder angling for a move back to north London. The Gunners had first refusal on their captain after he left to join Barcelona in the summer of 2011. But Wenger turned down the chance to move for the the Spaniard, allowing rivals Chelsea to swoop in a £30million deal last summer.

Fabregas' girlfriend Daniella Semaan took to Instagram to share a family snap ahead of his big game on Sunday and posted the words: 'I live for you and you and you'. When asked if Fabregas’s first choice was a return to Arsenal, Wenger replied: ‘Certainly, yes. But when he left we bought Mesut Ozil. We have Santi Cazorla, Jack Wilshere and we were not in the need to buy offensive players.' Arsenal face Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Sunday and Wenger admitted he still ‘loves’ the Spain star, who spent eight years with the north London club. He also called on the travelling Arsenal supporters to give their former captain a warm reception. Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho is hopeful noise from the Blues fans will drown out '3,000 red fans' The Spanish midfielder has scored one goal and picked up seven assists since the start of the season . Wenger said: 'Cesc will have a great career because he is a great player. We had a very positive influence on his career. After that, I hope everyone feels we had a positive influence.

"At first glance, it looks uncannily like an image of the human brain. But in fact, this is the death of one of the first stars in our Universe. Researchers say the death throes of these early stars were unique as they exploded as supernovae and burned completely, leaving no black hole behind, but instead spewing out chemical elements into space that eventually formed our Universe. This image is a slice through the interior of a supermassive star of 55,500 solar masses. It shows the inner helium core in which nuclear burning is converting helium to oxygen, powering various fluid instabilities, which form the swirling lines. This 'snapshot' from a simulation shows one moment a day after the onset of the explosion, when the radius of the outer circle would be slightly larger than that of the orbit of the Earth around the sun. To model the life of a primordial supermassive star, Chen and his colleagues used a one-dimensional stellar evolution code called KEPLER. This code takes into account key processes like nuclear burning and stellar convection. They found that primordial stars between 55,000 to 56,000 solar masses live about 1.69 million years before becoming unstable due to general relativistic effects and then start to collapse. The images look similar to scans of a human brain . As the star collapses, it begins to rapidly synthesize heavy elements like oxygen, neon, magnesium and silicon starting with helium in its core. This process releases more energy than the binding energy of the star, halting the collapse and causing a massive explosion: a supernova. To model the death mechanisms of these stars, Chen and his colleagues used CASTRO—a multidimensional compressible astrophysics code developed at Berkeley Lab by scientists Ann Almgren and John Bell. Certain primordial stars—those between 55,000 and 56,000 times the mass of our Sun, or solar masses—may have died unusually, the team concluded. Astrophysicists at the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) and the University of Minnesota came to this conclusion after running a number of supercomputer simulations at the Department of Energy's (DOE's) National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC) and Minnesota Supercomputing Institute at the University of Minnesota. They relied extensively on CASTRO, a compressible astrophysics code developed at DOE's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory's (Berkeley Lab's) Computational Research Division (CRD). Their findings were recently published in Astrophysical Journal (ApJ). First-generation stars are especially interesting because they produced the first heavy elements, or chemical elements other than hydrogen and helium. In death, they sent their chemical creations into outer space, paving the way for subsequent generations of stars, solar systems and galaxies. With a greater understanding of how these first stars died, scientists hope to glean some insights about how the Universe, as we know it today, came to be. 'We found that there is a narrow window where supermassive stars could explode completely instead of becoming a supermassive black hole—no one has ever found this mechanism before,' says Ke-Jung Chen, a postdoctoral researcher at UCSC and lead author of the ApJ paper. 'Without NERSC resources, it would have taken us a lot longer to reach this result. 'From a user perspective, the facility is run very efficiently and it is an extremely convenient place to do science.' To model the life of a primordial supermassive star, Chen and his colleagues used a one-dimensional stellar evolution code called KEPLER. This code takes into account key processes like nuclear burning and stellar convection. And relevant for massive stars, photo-disintegration of elements, electron-positron pair productionand special relativistic effects. The team also included general relativistic effects, which are important for stars above 1,000 solar masses. They found that primordial stars between 55,000 to 56,000 solar masses live about 1.69 million years before becoming unstable due to general relativistic effects and then start to collapse. As the star collapses, it begins to rapidly synthesize heavy elements like oxygen, neon, magnesium and silicon starting with helium in its core. This process releases more energy than the binding energy of the star, halting the collapse and causing a massive explosion: a supernova. To model the death mechanisms of these stars, Chen and his colleagues used CASTRO—a multidimensional compressible astrophysics code developed at Berkeley Lab by scientists Ann Almgren and John Bell. These simulations show that once collapse is reversed, Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities mix heavy elements produced in the star's final moments throughout the star itself. To model the life of a primordial supermassive star, Chen and his colleagues used a one-dimensional stellar evolution code called KEPLER. This code takes into account key processes like nuclear burning and stellar convection. These images show the simulation in action, tracking the spread of chemical compounds. The researchers say that this mixing should create a distinct observational signature that could be detected by upcoming near-infrared experiments such as the European Space Agency's Euclid and NASA's Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope. Depending on the intensity of the supernovae, some supermassive stars could, when they explode, enrich their entire host galaxy and even some nearby galaxies with elements ranging from carbon to silicon. In some cases, supernova may even trigger a burst of star formation in its host galaxy, which would make it visually distinct from other young galaxies. 'My work involves studying the supernovae of very massive stars with new physical processes beyond hydrodynamics, so I've collaborated with Ann Almgren to adapt CASTRO for many different projects over the years,' says Chen. 'Before I run my simulations, I typically think about the physics I need to solve a particular problem. I then work with Ann to develop some code and incorporate it into CASTRO. It is a very efficient system.' To visualize his data, Chen used an open source tool called VisIt, which was architected by Hank Childs, formerly a staff scientist at Berkeley Lab. 'Most of the time I did my own visualizations, but when there were things that I needed to modify or customize I would shoot Hank an email and that was very helpful.' Chen completed much of this work while he was a graduate student at the University of Minnesota. He completed his Ph.D. in physics in 2013.","Primordial stars between 55,000 and 56,000 times the mass of our Sun died unusually .

"Roy Hodgson asked his players to fly back and think of England as they returned to their clubs with homework assignments after Monday’s 2-0 win in Switzerland. Hodgson and his coaching team are determined not to lose any positivity from that result before next month’s European Championship qualifiers against San Marino and Estonia. Jack Wilshere has been sent back to Arsenal with video clips of Andrea Pirlo and Javier Mascherano, both experts in the midfield holding role he played for the first time in Basle. Tactical battle: Roy Hodgson's decision to set his players up in a diamond formation proved to be a good one . Clear instructions: Hodgson has told his players to study certain players and the diamond formation . Pass master: Hodgson wants Jack Wilshere to play in a similar role to what Andrea Pirlo does for Italy . Others have been encouraged to think about their specific roles in England’s new formation and to stay in touch with Hodgson’s coaching team, who know that some — like Wilshere and captain Wayne Rooney — may fill different roles for their clubs. Wilshere said: ‘We’ve got to do our homework because we don’t get long together. ‘I’ll have to learn in that role but that formation is going to be the way forward and we’ll only get better at it.’ After five winless games and a poor World Cup, spirits have been lifted by two wins in six days — especially by the game in Basle, when Hodgson used a midfield diamond for the first time. The England boss now wants his squad to be more forceful with their opinions and has introduced players-only meetings where the new generation have their say. Rooney said: ‘Players speak who wouldn’t (if) coaches are there.’ Captain fantastic: Wayne Rooney led his side to victory in his first competitive game as England skipper . VIDEO England players stepped up - Hodgson . Second in command: Chelsea centre back Gary Cahill will wear the armband when Rooney is unavailable . Hodgson believes his forums will not only see players take responsibility off the field but encourage them to do so during a match. In Basle, Hodgson’s three most experienced starters — Rooney, Joe Hart and Gary Cahill — all led by example. Chelsea centre half Cahill was told he will be the captain if Rooney is ever unavailable, with Hart third in command. Cahill said: ‘Against Norway was the first time I’d worn the armband. I know it was the last few minutes of a friendly but it still meant a hell of a lot to me.’ Monday’s success also strengthened Hodgson’s hand as he hit out at Harry Redknapp on Tuesday. The QPR manager claimed players no longer want to play for England after the 1-0 win over Norway but Hodgson said: ‘The thing about these players is they all have a burning desire to play for England. That theory that players care more about their club sides is nonsense. They care about both — as they should.’ Unfair criticism: Hodgson has hit out at QPR boss Harry Redknapp for suggesting England players do not care about representing their country . After beating the Swiss — on paper their most difficult opponents — England are already looking at potential training camps in France, for the Euro 2016 finals. Hodgson is determined not to repeat the World Cup blunder of having a hotel 90 minutes away from the training facilities. The FA released a statement on Thursday after England fans in Basle chanted ‘**** off Scotland, we’re all voting yes’ in reference to next week’s referendum. England play Scotland in a friendly at Celtic Park in November and the FA are keen to distance themselves from political issues. Adrian Bevington, managing director of Club England, said: ‘We are working closely with the Scottish FA and taking all usual security precautions. We were pleased that the Wembley fixture in 2013 passed peacefully with over 20,000 Scotland fans adding to the atmosphere of respectful rivalry.’","England's players returned to their clubs with homework assignments .

"All Britons living in Scotland will automatically become 'Scottish citizens', even if they were born in England, Wales or Northern Ireland under Alex Salmond's plans for independence. Anyone classed as 'habitually resident' will become eligible for a Scottish passport, along with all Scots living around the world. Mr Salmond insists there will be no need for border controls with England, but Labour's Ed Miliband has signalled border guards and passport checks would have to be considered to control immigration. Scroll down for video . UK passport holders living in Scotland would 'automatically' become Scottish citizens but will not have to take a Scottish passport under Alex Salmond's plans for independence . People with UK passports will not be forced to switch to a Scottish alternative if voters back indepdence in the historic referendum on Thursday. But it would be up to the UK government to decide if someone can have dual citizenship between Britain and Scotland. Britons living in Scotland and Scots living anyehwere in the world 'will automatically be considered Scottish citizens', under Mr Salmond's plans. This will include British citizens who hold dual citizenship with another country. Other people will be able to register or apply for Scottish citizenship on independence based on 'clear criteria'. All Scottish citizens will have the right to acquire a Scottish passport, although there will be no requirement to hold one. Mr Salmond also hopes for an independent Scotland to join Common Travel Area (CTA) which dates back to the 1920s and allows free movement between the UK, Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. The official white paper for independence states: 'We plan to remain part of the CTA which means that there will be no border controls, and you will not need a passport to travel to other parts of the UK, Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man.' However, Mr Salmond also wants to have a more relaxed immigration policy than that adopted by Westminster, raising the prospect of Scotland being used as a back door route into the UK. The SNP plans to lower the current financial maintenance thresholds and minimum salary levels for entry to Scotland, and to reintroduce a 'post-study work visa'. It means it would effectively have a more open immigration policy than the rest of the UK, requiring controls at the border. The changes would take effect from 24 March 2016 when Scotland would formally become an independent country. Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond, canvassing in Dyce, Aberdeen today, has insisted UK citizens will not have to take a Scottish passport . Mr Salmond pictured speaking with Kyle Bertram, who will be one tomorrow, and mum Shirley McGettigan has rejected claims from No campaigners that there would need to be border checks to enter and leave England . At the weekend Mr Miliband said the only way to maintain an open border was to reject independence. 'If you don't want borders, vote to stay in the United Kingdom,' the Labour leader said in an interview with today's Scottish Mail on Sunday. Asked whether that would mean him introducing border guards and passport checks if he was Prime Minister, Mr Miliband warned: 'It would have to be looked at.' And Mr Miliband's spokesman added last night: 'The last time I looked there were two sides to the border - and we would be in charge of one of them. It would be up to us, not Mr Salmond, to secure our northern border.' A spokesman for Yes Scotland said: 'Existing UK passports can continue to be used as normal until they expire. People will travel freely over the border between Scotland and England just as they travel freely from Northern Ireland to Ireland. 'Scotland will negotiate its ongoing membership of the EU in the 18 months between the referendum and Independence Day in March 2016 - as Professor Charlie Jeffrey has pointed out: ""The overwhelming body of expert opinion is that Scotland's EU membership will be uninterrupted."" 'So no queuing at airports will be necessary.' Mr Salmond's White Paper on independence set out who would get automatic Scottish citizenship and who would have to apply . Passport please: Our artists' impression of a road border between England and Scotland post-independence . Earlier this year Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael accused the SNP of having 'two fundamentally contradictory propositions'. 'First of all they say we can be part of the CTA, which [would be] an open border between Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom, and at the same time they say they will have a widely divergent immigration policy. 'You can have either of these things, but you cannot have them both. My challenge to the Scottish Government is to explain which of these it is going to be.' Mr Carmichael said the SNP's immigration proposals are 'radically different' and would be 'incompatible' with the CTA. It means travellers heading south could be forced to pull over and undergo lengthy Calais-style identity checks on 21 roads that cross the border, including the A1, A68 and M74. Rail passengers would also need to prove they had a right to enter the country before boarding a train leaving from Glasgow, Edinburgh or Aberdeen for England, in a similar time-consuming regime to Eurostar journeys from France. A UK Government analysis paper, launched in January, also revealed that lorries and vans could be inspected at the English border if Scotland becomes independent amid fears of alcohol and tobacco smuggling.","All UK citizens living north of the border will 'automatically' become Scottish .

"Steven Fletcher had not scored a goal since December and Sunderland had not won a league game since May — but the Scotland striker put both things right on Saturday with a clinical double in a fine all-round display. The 27-year-old forward was also the creator of his team’s opener, scored by Connor Wickham. Only a few weeks ago Fletcher’s manager Gus Poyet dropped the forward from his squad entirely in the hope that it might motivate him. VIDEO Scroll down for reaction from both managers .

Referee: Neil Swarbrick (Lancashire) The move paid off in short order. Sunderland’s five points from five draws in six games before Saturday were starting to look like the returns of team that had forgotten how to get across the line. This victory had the instant effect of putting the spring back in Poyet’s step. ‘Now we can say we’ve lost one in seven,’ he beamed. ‘It’s a great feeling,’ Poyet said. ‘I’m very pleased for the players. It was very important for them to win. 'I’m very pleased for Fletcher because I know how hard it was for him to be left out of the squad. He didn’t like it but he worked hard.’ Stoke arrived in search of a first Premier League win at Sunderland, but a consolation goal by Charlie Adam to make it 1-1 was their only reward. Manager Mark Hughes said: ‘That wasn’t great from us. 'We didn’t defend correctly or with any sense of purpose. We didn’t create enough, either. ‘We want to be viewed as a consistent team at this level and we can do a lot better than that.’ This match did not promise the goals it delivered, both sides having scored a paltry five this season in six games. But in starting with an adventurous, three-man attack — Fletcher flanked by Wickham to his left and Will Buckley to his right, Poyet showed intent. Sunderland were ahead inside five minutes, Fletcher collecting a throw-in down the right-hand side. He ran to the byline and fired across goal to Wickham, who steered home with his head while leaning backwards.

"A previously unknown virus linked to obesity and diabetes has been discovered - and researchers say it lives in the gut of more than half the world's population. Called crAssphage, it infects one of the most common types of gut bacteria, Bacteroidetes. The researchers first noticed the virus in a computer simulation - then found it was present in more than half the people they tested. Scroll down for video . Called crAssphage, it infects one of the most common types of gut bacteria, Bacteroidetes (pictured) The virus is as old as humans, it is believed. The researchers first noticed the virus in a computer simulation - then found it was present in more than half the people they tested . The researchers were using results from previous studies on gut-inhabiting viruses to screen for new viruses. In the DNA fecal samples from 12 different individuals, they noticed a particular cluster of viral DNA, about 97,000 base pairs long, that the samples all had in common. When Edwards and his colleagues checked this discovery against a comprehensive listing of known viruses, they failed to find a match. The researchers then screened for the virus across the database of the National Institute of Health’s Human Microbiome Project (HMP), and Argonne National Laboratory's MG-RAST database, and again found it in abundance in samples derived from human feces. The research appears today in Nature Communications, after Robert  Edwards, a bioinformatics professor at San Diego State University stumbled upon the discovery by accident. The researchers were using results from previous studies on gut-inhabiting viruses to screen for new viruses. In the DNA fecal samples from 12 different individuals, they noticed a particular cluster of viral DNA, about 97,000 base pairs long, that the samples all had in common.

The researchers then screened for the virus across the database of the National Institute of Health’s Human Microbiome Project (HMP), and Argonne National Laboratory's MG-RAST database, and again found it in abundance in samples derived from human feces. To prove that the viral DNA they discovered in their computer data actually exists in nature, fellow SDSU virologist John Mokili used a technique known as DNA amplification to locate the virus in the original samples used to build NIH’s database. 'So we have a biological proof that the virus they found with the computer actually exists in the samples,' Mokili said. This was a new virus that about half the sampled people had in their bodies that nobody knew about. 'It’s not unusual to go looking for a novel virus and find one,” Edwards said. 'But it’s very unusual to find one that so many people have in common. 'The fact that it’s flown under the radar for so long is very strange.' The discovery could lead to a new understanding of obesity . The fact that it’s so widespread indicates that it probably isn’t a particularly young virus, either. 'We’ve basically found it in every population we’ve looked at,' Edwards said. 'As far as we can tell, it’s as old as humans are.' He and his team named the virus crAssphage, after the cross-assembly software program used to discover it. Bacteriodetes bacteria live toward the end of the intestinal tract, and they are suspected to play a major role in the link between gut bacteria and obesity. What role crAssphage plays in this process will be a target of future research. Further details about crAssphage have been difficult to come by. It’s unknown how the virus is transmitted, but the fact that it was not found in very young infants’ fecal samples suggests that it is not passed along maternally, but acquired during childhood. The makeup of the viral DNA suggests that it’s circular in structure. Further laboratory work has confirmed that the viral DNA is a singular entity, but it’s proven difficult to isolate. 'We know it’s there, but we can’t capture it quite yet,' Edwards said. Once the virus is isolated, he hopes to delve into its role in obesity. The virus might also be used to prevent or mitigate other diseases affected by the gut such as diabetes and gastroenterological maladies. Once these processes are better understood, Edwards envisions one day the possibility of personalized medicine based on this virus. 'This could be a key to personalized phage medicine,' he said. 'In individuals, we could isolate your particular strain of the virus, manipulate it to target harmful bacteria, then give it back to you.'","crAssphage infects one of the most common gut bacteria, Bacteroidetes .

"At first glance this picture shows a typical scene from the plains of the Masai Mara in Kenya as some Thomson's gazelles stand in front of the beautiful backdrop. But look again and you notice there is a certain nervousness about them and with good reason. If you look really hard you can see a well-camouflaged cheetah stalking them from behind. Scroll down for video . Can you see it? At first glance the gazelles stand in front of a beautiful backdrop but there is a reason why they have a certain nervousness about them . The amazing shot of the camouflaged big cat and subsequent chase was taken by wildlife photographer Richard Costin who was tracking the predator for a few days. Mr Costin, 32, from Kent, said: 'The cheetah stopped in its tracks and looked intently into the distance. 'Experience had taught us what this meant. It had spotted some potentially vulnerable prey, gazelles in some longer grass than they ought to be. 'Although cheetahs have amazing acceleration, gazelles can run for longer so if the cheetah can't get close before it charges it can be outrun. The cheetah's tail sticks out from the plains of the Masai Mara in Kenya after stalking its way up to gazelles and pouncing . The cheetah appears from the plains and gives chase after the gazelles. Photographer Richard Costin took this action shot of the case . The amazing shot of the camouflaged big cat and subsequent chase was taken by wildlife photographer Richard Costin who was tracking the predator for a few days . 'Luckily, the gazelles had wandered into some long grass so it took about five minutes to stalk its way up to them before pouncing.' However, after the successful hunt and less than an hour's eating, the cheetah was chased away from its kill by a hyaena. Mr Costin, who takes photography workshops to the Masai Mara, added: 'We had seen it stalk and hunt unsuccessfully a couple of times, but this time it killed one of the gazelles. 'Cheetahs often have to eat as quickly after a kill as they can as you can see, once word gets around there is a kill, something stronger turns up - in this case a hyaena. Did you spot it? If you look closely a well-camouflaged cheetah stands behind the gazelles staking them out before it pounces .

"Nico Rosberg sealed what could prove to be a crucial pole position ahead of Sunday's Japanese Grand Prix as he beat Mercedes team-mate and title rival Lewis Hamilton into second. The German put in two fast runs in the final 12-minute qualifying session to claim an eighth pole of the season as he looks to close the three-point gap Hamilton holds at the top of the championship standings. Qualifying positions could end up being vital if the poor weather conditions, caused by the closing-in Typhoon Phanfone, hit the track as expected on race day. Nico Rosberg will start Sunday's Japanese Grand Prix on pole position after finishing fastest in qualifying . Rosberg's qualifying position could prove crucial if poor weather conditions hit the track as expected . Williams took third place courtesy of Valtteri Bottas, who has been the closest to the Mercedes pair for much of the weekend so far. There was hardly anything to separate the Mercedes cars in the opening two qualifying sessions as they both pushed hard. Hamilton was quicker in Q1, albeit by just 0.060 seconds, with Rosberg setting the pace in Q2 with an even smaller gap back to his team-mate. The top three qualifiers Lewis Hamilton (left), Rosberg and Valtteri Bottas (right) wave to fans in Suzuka . But Hamilton, who had crashed out late on in final practice, had no answer to his rival in the final and most telling session as Rosberg, who expressed his disappointment on missing out on pole in Singapore with a cry of 'damn it' over his team radio, was much happier this time out. The gap between the title contenders was less than two tenths with the Mercedes locking out the top two spots for every session of the weekend. Bottas could not push the Mercedes but will be happy to sit third, with team-mate Felipe Massa just behind in fourth. Hamilton and Mercedes team-mate Rosberg locked out the top two spots for every qualifying session . Fernando Alonso, who looks to be moving on from Ferrari with Sebastian Vettel set to step in, took fifth and was over eight-tenths quicker than team-mate Kimi Raikkonen - who was 10th, having had a new power unit installed before qualifying began. Vettel's departure from Red Bull was confirmed on Saturday morning and he had a poor session, only able to seal ninth place having had problems in free practice. The sister Red Bull of Daniel Ricciardo qualified sixth, with the McLaren pair of Kevin Magnussen and Jenson Button also quicker than Vettel. Both Rosberg and Hamilton are now preparing for what looks increasingly like being a wet race, with the former of the opinion that rain could increase their margin over the chasing pack. Sebastien Vettel, whose departure from Red Bull was confirmed on Saturday, was only able to seal ninth place . 'I'm here to try and win and it was a great day today,' said Rosberg. 'It is only one step on the way but it was a real pleasure today because the car is so amazing to drive. 'We are as prepared as we can be - we are expecting it to be wet. The last time we experienced the wet was in Spa when we were really quick, if it rains it could be even better for us.' Hamilton (left) praised the speed shown by Rosberg . Hamilton praised the speed shown by Rosberg and admitted he was not quite hooked up for the session. 'Nico was extremely quick today,' he said. 'I did the best I could, my guys did a fantastic job to rebuild my car after I binned it. Today, I just wasn't really feeling it, I was still fast but Nico was fantastic. Tomorrow is the day you get the points and I'm looking forward to the tricky weather.' Jean-Eric Vergne, who is still without a drive for next season as things stand, was the first man outside the top 10 - with the Toro Rosso driver missing out by 0.2 seconds. His team-mate Daniil Kvyat will be driving for Red Bull next season but the 20-year-old Russian could only reach 13th, with Sergio Perez's Force India separating the Toro Rosso duo. Nico Hulkenberg struggled to 14th with the Saubers of Adrian Sutil and Esteban Gutierrez 15th and 16th respectively. It was a disappointing qualifying session for Lotus - who lost both cars in Q1 as Pastor Maldonado and Romain Grosjean were pushed into the knock-out zone by two impressive late laps by the Sauber pair. Maldonado will start at the back of the grid after being handed a 10-place grid penalty after fitting a sixth engine of the season, with his lowly qualifying performance meaning five of those penalty places will be carried over to the Russian Grand Prix next weekend. Marcus Ericsson has looked quicker than his Caterham team-mate, as well as the Marussia cars, and he once again beat all three of his nearest competitors and will start 18th. Jules Bianchi is the lead Marussia as he out-qualified Max Chilton, with the home favourite Kamui Kobayashi sandwiched in-between the duo in the second Caterham.

"You'd be forgiven for thinking this incredible picture is an artist's impression of a planet forming around a star. But it is in fact the most detailed real image of a planet's birth ever taken, revealing a phenomenon astronomers could only theorise about a few decades ago - and one that could help explain how the solar system formed. The planet-forming disc surrounds HL Tau, a sun-like star around 450 light-years from Earth in the constellation Taurus. Scroll down for video . Pictured is the best image ever of planet formation revealing multiple rings and gaps that herald the presence of emerging planets as they sweep their orbits clear of dust and gas . The image was taken as part of the testing and verification process for the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array's (Alma) new high-resolution capabilities. Alma, located in Chile, uncovered never-before-seen features in this system, including multiple concentric rings separated by clearly defined gaps. 'These features are almost certainly the result of young planet-like bodies that are being formed in the disk,' said Alma Deputy Director Stuart Corder. 'This is surprising since HL Tau is no more than a million years old and such young stars are not expected to have large planetary bodies capable of producing the structures we see in this image.' An artist's impression of a planet-forming disc. Newly formed planets can be seen traveling around the central host star, sweeping their orbits clear of dust and gas. These same ring-link structures were observed recently by ALMA around the young star HL Tau . All stars are believed to form within clouds of gas and dust that collapse under gravity. Over time, the surrounding dust particles stick together, growing into sand, pebbles, and larger-size rocks, which eventually settle into a thin protoplanetary disk where asteroids, comets, and planets form. Once these planetary bodies have enough mass, they dramatically reshape the structure of their natal disk. Alma's highest receivers sit on a plateau some 16,500ft (5,000 metres) above sea level. The secret to Alma's incredible resolution comes from two factors: height and distance. The observatory's highest receivers sit on a plateau some 16,500ft (5,000 metres) above sea level. This is far above most of Earth's atmosphere and water vapour, which obscures observations. Astronomers working in Alma's facility at 9,500 feet (2,900 meters) must use supplemental oxygen for extended stays. The system currently comprises about 50 functional antennas. When the array is finished, there will be 66 of these receivers that can be moved as far as 16km (9.9m) apart. The antennae capture astronomical signals from the sky individually, then combine their results in a supercomputer to get precise information about where the signals come from. Researchers say it is similar to how we use our two ears to locate sounds around us, but on a universe-size scale. This high-resolution not only lets Alma observe young planetary systems, but also pin down hydrogen and life-building blocks in gas clouds. The array can also track the evolution of galaxies. They fashion rings and gaps as the planets sweep their orbits clear of debris and shepherd dust and gas into tighter and more confined zones. The new Alma image reveals these striking features in exquisite detail, providing the clearest picture to date of planet formation. Its new high-resolution capabilities were achieved by spacing the antennas up to 9.3 miles (15km) apart. HL Tau's surroundings, as seen by Hubble. HL Tau is a sun-like star around 450 light-years from Earth . Images with this level of detail were previously only seen in computer models and artist concepts. 'This new and unexpected result provides an incredible view of the process of planet formation,' said Tony Beasley, director of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO). HL Tau is hidden in visible light behind a massive envelope of dust and gas. Since Alma observes at much longer wavelengths, it is able to peer through the intervening dust to study the processes right at the core of this cloud. This is an artist's impression of a young star surrounded by a protoplanetary disc in which planets are forming . 'This is truly one of the most remarkable images ever seen at these wavelengths,' said NRAO astronomer Crystal Brogan. 'The level of detail is so exquisite that it's even more impressive than many optical images. 'The fact that we can see planets being born will help us understand not only how planets form around other stars but also the origin of our own solar system.'","Image is of planet-forming disc surrounding sun-like star, HL Tau .

"While the international community debates what to do about Syria, evidence of the use of chemical weapons dating back 1,700 years has surfaced. British archeologist Dr Simon James believes 20 Roman soldiers may have been killed by lethal poisonous gas during a Persian attack on their fort at Dura-Europas in Eastern Syria during the 3rd century. If true, it would be one of the earliest documented incidents of chemical weapons. Poisoned: This skeleton provides evidence of one of the earliest chemical weapons attacks in Syria . The soldiers met their fate in a narrow space in around 256AD, according to a statement by the University of Leicester academic in 2009. Speaking at the time, Dr James said: 'For the Persians to kill 20 men in a . space less than two metres high or wide, and about 11 metres long, . required superhuman combat powers, or something more insidious. 'I think the (Persians) placed braziers and . bellows in their gallery, and when the Romans broke through, added the . chemicals and pumped choking clouds into the Roman tunnel. 'The Roman . assault party were unconscious in seconds, dead in minutes.' Dr James was alerted to the evidence by mineral residue near the bodies. He concluded the gas was created by adding a compound of burnt bitumen and sulfur to fire. Fumes: An archeologist from the University of Leicester believes Roman soldiers were gassed by Persians . Speaking to Discovery News in 2009, Dr James said: 'These provided the vital clue. When ignited, such materials give off dense clouds of choking gases.' He also rediscovered the body of a Persian soldier, the man who probably ignited the poisonous weapon. He added: 'He . lingered too long to ensure it was alight, and was himself overcome by . fumes from the bitumen and sulfur he used to start the blaze.' Earlier this week Adrienne Mayor, a research scholar in classics and history of science at . Stanford University, told Discovery News that chemically . enhanced accelerants had been documented in even older battles, including the 429 BC Peloponnesian War. But the Persian attack may represent one of the first documented instances of soldiers purposefully producing toxic fumes.

"Shawnda Rush suddenly awoke one morning in April 2005 with no memory of the 30 years she had lived. The woman, who has MS, suffered a traumatic bout of amnesia and though she remembered her own identity she was at a loss at who the child and man were in her Virginia home, she told the Washington Post. She is now speaking out about the ordeal that tore apart her marriage and how she has had to rely on reading her personal journals, watching TV and perusing Facebook to learn how to talk and interact with others as an adult. Pressing on: Shawnda Rush, right, with her daughter, Shaylin, are now moving forward after the traumatic memory loss in April 2005 . The Virginia woman looked at her toddler . daughter and husband in April 2005 with absolutely no hints of who they . were or how she knew them. She did not immediately realize what was going on and it took her a few days to divulge to her own mother, Marsha Rush, what was happening. Her daughter Shaylin was just a . 19-month-old when her mother's amnesia struck. Though she was too young . to realize what was going on, Shaylin has grown up often hearing her . mother say, 'I don't remember' - a phrase the little girl has come to . mimic. The child did learn of her mother's shocking memory loss when she was nearly 4-years-old. Sudden loss: Shawnda Rush says she has relied on watching TV, reading through her old journals and using Facebook to relearn how to interact as an adult . Rush says she watched soap operas and talk shows, in particular 'George Lopez,' to re-learn how to talk. 'I also want people to understand that's how I've had to learn. I don't . know any life any other way, because I lost my memory. People had the . opportunity to come out of the womb and go through school and learn . friendships and stuff. I lost all that,' she told the Post in 2012. She also used her daughter's math homework to learn basic fundamentals . and had to be taught again how to use a cell phone and manage her check . book. An avid journal writer in her past life, Rush was able to read about her . past lives and her experiences beforehand based on those diaries. She went to physical therapy to gain her strength and also underwent speech therapy to develop her vocabulary. 'Just like I didn’t know how to pump gas, I didn't know how to use a . debit card, I couldn’t do any of that stuff. So I had to learn,' she said. Through the ordeal, it became increasingly apparent that her marriage was in trouble and ultimately she and her husband of three years decided to divorce. Ordeal: Shawnda Rush, 38, of Winchester, VA suffers from memory loss after being diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) on July 4, 2004 . Comfort: Rush has found comfort in her faith and often reads from her Bible for hours at a time in the bathroom of her Winchester, VA home. Her daughter, Shaylin, now aged 9, (left), plays games on her phone . The science behind her condition is still a mystery. She had been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in July 2004 after she . began experiencing symptoms of the neurological disorder like vision . loss and numbness. Then began the onset of cognitive problems like forgetfulness, confusion, . feelings of helplessness and loss of vocabulary. She began taking more than 10 medications and her body became weak and she could no longer continue her normal routine. Neurologist Avindra Nath, who treated Shawnda at Johns Hopkins Hospital . in Baltimore, said that amnesia is a rare occurrence in multiple . sclerosis patients. Other doctors told the Post that her sudden memory loss could have been . caused by the combination of the drugs she was prescribed but Dr Nath . doubted the medication could have had that kind of impact. Doctors still are not sure what altered her memory to such a degree.",Shawnda Rush is telling her story after waking up one day with no memory of the past 30 years .
"Fashion brand American Apparel was last night attacked for an ‘abhorrent’ advertising campaign featuring provocative images of models posing as schoolgirls. One advert for a miniskirt from its Back to School range was labelled ‘underage pornography’. In the photo a model is seen from behind, bending over with her legs and part of her buttocks and underwear on display. The company also sells a range of crop tops called ‘Lolita’, a reference to the controversial novel by Vladimir Nabokov about an older man’s sexual infatuation with a 12-year-old girl. Under fire: American Apparel has come under fire after posting a provocative 'Back to School' advert on Instagram. Above, a girl named Em tweets a photo of the advert (left), which she claims 'fuels Lolita fantasies' The American Apparel website, which is aimed at young people, sells a collection of clothing and accessories under the heading School Days. It features the tagline: ‘Your first assignment is to dress accordingly.’ Pictures show models in thigh-skimming skirts and midriff-revealing tops standing beside school lockers. Yesterday, a children’s charity called the advertising disgraceful and asked parents to stop their children from buying the items. Peter Bradley, from Kidscape, said: ‘It’s something we find abhorrent. It’s about using underage pornography to sell products and the sexualisation of children, which cannot ever be justified. ‘A School Days campaign is aimed at children under the age of 16. ‘Would the company’s board members let their daughters wear these miniskirts?’ Mr Bradley added: ‘I would like to see parents not allow their daughters to buy such clothes.’ 'Underage porn': On Instagram, one girl, using the handle 'wordjamming', wrote: 'Never thought @americanappareluk would need to resort to porn to sell. Underage porn nonetheless. Shameless' Outraged: Meanwhile, another, dubbed 'aislingkie', declared: 'Objectifying much @americanappareluk . For sale: The miniskirt shown in the advert is pictured in American Apparel's High Street Kensington store . Another advert: American Apparel has recently released its 'Back to School' lookbook, featuring a range of models posing in school settings. Above, two girls pose in front of lockers while wearing leather skirts . Of the image looking up a model’s skirt, he said: ‘It’s a provocative photograph, verging on soft porn. How can it in any way be connected with “School Days”?’ The Back to School photograph, which was posted on the brand’s UK Instagram account, has now been taken down. Similar images that appeared on the company’s website also appear to have been removed. As well as the tartan tennis skirt they advertised, the collection features a range of items that are inappropriate for school wear, including crop tops, nail polish, high heels and a leather miniskirt. Conservative MP Caroline Nokes, who is chairman of the all-party parliamentary group on body image, said: ‘The images used by American Apparel are completely inappropriate, especially when used under the strap line of School Days. 'The images serve only to objectify and sexualise women and I feel American Apparel are being extremely irresponsible with their desire to be “controversial”.’ Dressed up: In the lookbook, the retailer tells students: 'Your first assignment is to dress accordingly.' Above, three models pose next to sports stands, with one dressed in a cropped top and a pleated miniskirt . 'Inappropriate for school': Twitter user Sarah Redington said: 'American Apparel with these 'back to school' basics. At what high school do those clothes pass dress code? Not mine' Students: This photo from the campaign features three models dressed in short skirts and long white socks . Controversial: On August 5, American Apparel posted a tweet advertising a miniskirt named 'Lolita Mini' Critics of the campaign were quick to express their disgust at the photograph on social media. Many deemed it sexist and said it objectified women. One Twitter user wrote: ‘American Apparel – their “back to school” skirts fuelling Lolita fantasies and rampant sexism aplenty.’ Simon Revington said: ‘The @americanapparel Back to School campaign is in poor taste. It’s borderline softcore porn. Clumsy concept sends wrong msg.’ Another Twitter user tweeted: ‘American Apparel’s latest advert is horrendous. ‘I understand “sex sells” but not when it’s “back to school”. Who on earth came up with that?!’ One female Instagram user said: ‘Never thought @americanappareluk would need to resort to porn to sell. Underage porn nonetheless. Shameless.’ It is the latest upset to hit the fashionable clothing company after its founder Dov Charney was sacked in June amid a flurry of scandals. And this is not the first time it has faced controversy over its unusual advertising. In March, it met with a storm of criticism for an advert published in a magazine that featured a topless ex-Muslim model with the words ‘Made in Bangladesh’ printed across her chest. Last year, the retailer was labelled ‘sexist’ and ‘sleazy’ for advertising a unisex shirt using half-naked women alongside a group of fully clothed male models. The business now has 10,000 employees and 249 stores in 20 countries, including the US and the UK. American Apparel did not respond to requests for comment last night. Last month, it emerged that the founder of American Apparel has been rehired as a 'strategic consultant'. Dov Charney, 45, was sacked in June with the board citing his alleged misuse of company funds and role in disseminating nude photos of . an ex-employee who filed a case against him in 2011. But just three weeks after he was forced out, he was taken back on as a paid consultant - on the same large salary of $832,000. Rehired: Dov Charney, 45, who founded American Apparel, has been rehired as a 'strategic consultant' In a statement, American Apparel said the Canadian businessman, who founded the company when he was 20, would serve in the role until the end of an investigation into the claims against him. It added: 'Based on the findings of the investigation, the committee . will determine if it is appropriate for Mr. Charney to serve as CEO or . an officer or employee of American Apparel.' The former employee at the centre of the allegations sued Mr Charney in 2011 for $260 million after she claimed he forced her to be his 'sex slave.' The case was thrown out in 2012 but the alleged victim was then subject to an online campaign to discredit her. Mr Charney is facing claims he allowed a member of staff to impersonate and post naked photos online of the former employee.","American Apparel posted advert of one of skirts on Instagram yesterday .

"This is the Kurdish fighter who has been battling jihadists since he was teenager and is desperate to get back into Syria to stop Islamic State militants from taking the border town of Kobane. Delkhwaz Sheikh Ahmad, a father-of-two, is currently living in the Turkish town of Suruc after fleeing there with his wife and sons. But the 22-year-old is hoping to sneak back across the border into Kobane to help with the fight to stop the town falling to ISIS jihadists. Scroll down for video . Delkhwaz Sheikh Ahmad, bottom left, poses with other Kurdish fighters on the outskirts of Kobane. Mr Ahmad has been fighting jihadists since he was a teenager and is desperate to get back into Syria to defend the under-siege town . Mr Ahmad said there are many Kurdish fighter, such as those pictured who want to defend their land . The father-of-two pictured recently with a female comrade, first started fighting when he was a conscript in Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's army . He said: 'It is hard, but we will get back in because our friends are there. We have to get inside, even if there is hardship, we will get inside.' Mr Ahmad was a conscript serving his military service in Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's army when the Syrian revolution broke out three years ago. During the conflict, the Syrian Kurd, who was only a teenager at the time, was seriously wounded in Daraa, while fighting rebels. The bullet that hit him narrowly missed his heart, and he was sent to his home village of Metina to recover. Mr Ahmad and his brother approach the Syrian/Turkish border on motorcycles on the outskirts of Suruc to try to sneak back into Syria . So far the men have been unable to make the crossing and they have been stuck in Turkey, despite wanting to fight . But his injury didn't stop his desire to fight and soon after returning home he joined a local self-defence force, who were protecting the village. The force then ended up fighting against four separate rebel groups, which included the Western-backed Free Syrian Army, the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, the Raqqa Brigade and ISIS. His militia eventually joined the main Kurdish militia, the People's Protection Units, also known as YPG which joined forces with the Raqqa Brigade. The YPG are now embroiled in a fierce fight for the town of Kobane and he has already lost two cousins and many of his friends in the conflict. The 22-year-old evacuated his family, including his wife Siham and two sons, to Turkey after ISIS began to advance in September . His sons Dilyar, left, and Ibrahim, right, are currently in Suruc with their mother and Mr Ahmad visits them every few weeks . As ISIS then started to advance closer to Kobane, and fearing for his family's safety he evacuated his wife Siham and their two sons three-year-old Ibrahim and Dilyar, two, to Turkey last month. They now live with his brother in Suruc across the Turkish border but Mr Ahmad stayed behind to help defend Kobane. Every few weeks, he takes a couple of days to cross the border into Turkey to visit his family. But with the crossing closed, he is now stuck in Turkey and desperate to get back to Kobane with several other fighters. He explained: 'We just want to defend our lands, our towns, our villages, where Kurdish people are.' The family members gather around and share breakfast before the men head towards the border to try to enter Kobane . While stuck in Turkey, the 22-year-old checks his phone to keep up to date on what is happening in Kobane before he returns . However, Turkey is not expected to send troops or aid to the Kurdish fighters who are defending Kobane due to a decades-long dispute it has waged against a Kurdish guerrilla group linked to the city's defenders. The fighters in Kobane are affiliated with the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which both Turkey and the U.S. consider a terrorist organisation. Turkey has openly said it is blocking Turkish Kurds from joining the fight in the town. Neither Turkey nor the Syrian Kurds are said to be enthusiastic about joining ranks if Turkey sends army troops to Kobane. Further complicating the issue, the U.S. said it has begun talking directly to the Kurdish fighters' political wing in Kobani - a diplomatic move that could stretch tensions with Turkey even farther. A Turkish government official on Friday said Ankara does not oppose action that is intended to weaken ISIS. 'Turkey is part of the coalition against ISIL,' said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authoriSed to make public statements. The Syrian Kurdish fighter said: 'It is hard, but we will get back in because our friends are there. We have to get inside, even if there is hardship, we will get inside . Meanwhile the U.S. military has continued to launch airstrikes around Kobane in a bid to stop ISIS taking the strategic border town. Yesterday they confirmed that six airstrikes hit Syria overnight with targets including ISIS petroleum storage tanks and a pumping station. The sites hit are central to the militants ability to resupply their forces and generate revenue. But despite the airstrikes and the resistance by the Kurdish forces, the Pentagon has warned it may take time to overcome ISIS. Rear Admiral John Kirby said: 'This isn't going to get solved through 18 airstrikes around a particular town in a particular place in Syria. 'It's going to take a long time.'","Delkhwaz Sheikh Ahmad is desperate to help defend the town of Kobane .

"Blue star Lee Ryan unleashed a foul-mouthed tirade at police officers before urinating on the floor of a police cell after he was arrested for drink driving, a court has heard. But he blamed his meltdown on the torrent of online abuse he received in the wake of his controversial appearance on Celebrity Big Brother. The All Rise singer was handed a £3,325 fine and banned from the roads for two years after admitting failing to provide a specimen and causing £120 of criminal damage. Arriving at Ealing Magistrates' Court this morning, the Celebrity Big Brother star, was flanked by his bandmates Duncan James, Simon Webbe and Antony Costa. Scroll down for video . Blue star Lee Ryan has today pleaded guilty to criminal damage and failing to provide a specimen after being arrested last month . Ryan is seen leaving the west London court after he was fined £3,325 and banned from the roads for two years . The 30-year-old singer arrived at Ealing Magistrates' Court this morning flanked by band mates Antony Costa, Simon Webbe and Duncan James . Ryan had been out celebrating the birthday of bandmate Duncan James hours before he was arrested in Ealing and taken to Acton police station . The court in west London, heard Ryan had been out partying to celebrate his best friend and bandmate Duncan James's birthday on the night of his arrest. Officers spotted Ryan swerving erratically at 5.30am on April 11 as he drove his female friend's Audi A3 on the Uxbridge Road in Ealing. There was an empty bottle in a pocket by the driver's seat and he stank of alcohol and slurred his words as he got out of the driver's seat. Majit Mahal, prosecuting, said: 'Officers could immediately smell alcohol from Mr Ryan's breath and his eyes appeared glazed. 'Asked if he had consumed some alcohol that night, Mr Ryan said ""Yes, a few"". 'Officers then noticed that there was an empty bottle in the pocket of the driver's seat. When Mr Ryan exited the vehicle, he was obviously unsteady on his feet, his speech was slurred.' He was in such a 'drunken state' that officers took him straight to the police station. Ryan's bandmates Antony Costa (left) and Duncan James (right) leaving Ealing Magistrates' Court today ahead of Simon Webbe (centre back) Ryan was stopped by police after they spotted him driving his friend's Audi A3 erratically through Ealing. Stock photo . But he refused to take a breath test to see if he was over the limit and repeatedly swore at officers, branding one a 'c***'. Mr Mahal said that when officers warned Ryan he would be prosecuted if he did not provide a specimen, he replied 'F*** off'. Ryan then shouted: 'F*** off, f*** you, you f****** c****, f*** off.' The slurring star became aggressive to officers and was marched to a cell at Acton police station where he urinated and was sick all over the floor. When officers returned later they saw urine trickling under the door into the hallway. Quizzed over why he soiled the cell, Ryan replied 'I didn't realise there was a toilet here'. 'Officers could immediately smell alcohol from Mr Ryan's breath and his eyes appeared glazed' - Prosecutor Majit Mahal . Asked by the officer 'Do you do this at home?', he said 'Yes I do, f*** off you c****'. In a police interview later that day, Ryan told officers he had drunk a vodka and tonic and a rum and Coke, but thought he was ok to drive. He told officers he was on antidepressant medication and antibiotics, which he blamed for his state. Mr Mahal said: 'He believed his drink may have been spiked, because normally he would have been fine. 'Officers explained to Mr Ryan that his conduct towards officers had been abusive and he was challenged about the language he used. 'Mr Ryan said he had no memory of the conduct or the words he is alleged to have used.' Ryan pleaded guilty to the charges, but defence lawyers blamed the troubled star's outburst on the stress he has been under since he left the Celebrity Big Brother house in January this year. Peter Ratliff, defending, told the court: 'There can be no doubt that decision (to take part in Celebrity Big Brother) was a mistake. 'When he left the Big Brother house he felt that some of the print media had turned against him. 'He was subjected to visceral and unpleasant attacks in the media.' He said Ryan had received '140 pages of Twitter abuse - abuse that in another era would be unfathomable. He received death threats. He received abuse from members of the public.' The singer had been left 'shattered' by the stinging criticism and that goes 'some way in prompting this crash in his behaviour', Mr Ratliff said. On the night of the outburst he had become 'genuinely upset' after a woman approached him and 'called him an arsehole and asked him if he was that prick from the telly', the court heard. Mr Ratliff said the Ryan, who is heavily in debt, is 'disgusted' at his actions. The singer, who suffers from depression, had seen doctors at the Priory hospital and a Harley Street clinic in the months just before the incident. And he checked into residential rehab clinic Capio Nightingale hospital in Marylebone, west London, afterwards. Wearing a three-piece dark grey suit, white shirt and black tie with his blond hair quiffed, the singer nodded as his sentence was read. He was supported in court by all three members of Blue, who wore black suits and sat in the public gallery at the back of court. Ryan (left) was arrested in the early hours of . April 11 after a night out with band mate Mr James. He was arrested on . suspicion of failing to provide a specimen and criminal damage . Ryan was told his two-year driving ban would be cut to 18 months if he completes a drink-driving course. In a statement released after the sentencing, the singer thanked his fans for their support. It said: 'Lee respects the court's decision today and takes full responsibility for his actions. 'This has been an important lesson for Lee as he works towards a healthier and happier new chapter in his life.' Speaking shortly after the arrest, a . Met Police spokesperson told The Sun: ‘Police stopped a car after . officers witnessed it being driven erratically. The driver was arrested . on suspicion of drink driving and taken into custody. ‘He was subsequently further arrested on suspicion of possession of Class A drugs and criminal damage.' A . Met Police spokesman told MailOnline: 'A 30-year-old man was arrested . with possession of Class A drugs on the same night, he was bailed to a . date in June.' Lee was previously banned from driving and was fined £2,250 as a consequence of drink driving in 2003. On . 31 December 2007, he was arrested for an assault on a taxi driver in . Oxted, Surrey. He was released on bail until February 2008. In . August of 2010, Ryan was charged with assault after allegedly hitting . his then fiancee Samantha Millar. The charges were later dropped, and . the couple separated. Ryan found fame in 2000 with Blue, who went on to sell 3.3 million albums and a million singles in the UK, and was recently involved in a love triangle during Celebrity Big Brother. In the last year Blue reportedly made just £77 despite the release of a new album and a nationwide tour . Blue have reportedly made just £77 in the last year which saw them release a new album and go on a nationwide tour. The . company of the band made £80 in 2013 compared to £3 the year before, . according to The Sun. But despite the abysmal profit, Blueworld Touring No. 1 Ltd is still allegedly £1,566 in debt. ‘The figures are embarrassing,’ a music industry source told Dan Wootton of The Sun. ‘Especially with their recent TV exposure.’ Blue . reunited on the ITV series The Big Reunion, where they joined other . noughties bands like B*Witched, Atomic Kitten, 5ive and Liberty X on a . nationwide tour. In their . heyday, the band had three number one singles and reportedly earned a . whopping £80 million, but the boys admitted they squandered it. A representative for Blue told . MailOnline: 'Blue World Touring No.1’s account is dormant and no longer . in use. Therefore this is completely unreflective of Blue’s earnings. 'We . can confirm that the debt that is shown in this account relates to an . internal transfer between the parent company and Blueworld and not any . third party. 'This sum has now been reconciled internally in the latest set of accounts and is no longer in existence.' Last year, Simon declared himself bankrupt just a few weeks after his bandmate Duncan had. Blue rose to fame in 2000, and went on to sell 3.3million albums and one million singles across the UK .","Lee Ryan arrived at Ealing Magistrates' Court flanked by Blue bandmates .

"A council spent a staggering £200,000 on a hunt for a notorious internet blogger known as ‘Mr Monkey’ after he insulted local councillors. The anonymous writer referred to councillors as ‘Pudgy Face’, ‘Miss Piggy’, ‘King of Sleaze’ and ‘The Fat Mackem Hobbit’ as he promised to ‘expose the truth’ behind their alleged lies. Despite the internet troll abandoning the blog in 2009, the north east council have only just called off the manhunt - having spent the last five years searching for him. South Tyneside Council in Tyne and Wear launched the search after insisting it had a 'duty of care' to protect employees from malicious accusations made by a blogger known as 'Mr Monkey' South Tyneside Council launched the search after insisting they had a ‘duty of care’ to protect their employees from malicious accusations made online. They immediately hired Washington DC lawyers McDermott, Will and Emery, to try and trace those responsible - all funded by the public purse. But after spending more than £214,000 on the search for Mr Monkey, town hall bosses have now decided to drop the hunt. Last night the council investigation was branded a 'ludicrous' waste of money. Andy Silvester, a spokesman for the Taxpayers Alliance, said: 'Pursuing this claim at the expense of hard-pressed taxpayers was ludicrous and the investigation has wasted thousands of pounds. Good sense has finally prevailed, but taxpayers have had to foot a massive bill in the meantime.' The Mr Monkey blog first appeared in 2008 where defamatory comments were made about Council leader Iain Malcom, Labour colleague Cllr Anne Walsh, the late Tory and UKIP councillor David Potts and council regeneration boss Rick 0'Farrell. In the blog – which at its prime was getting over 4,000 hits a day – Mr Monkey used nicknames for the workers as he went on to label them ‘f***wits’, ‘lazy’ and ‘scheming, lying, cheating and corrupt w******’. The council suspected there was also a connection between several twitter accounts and 'Mr Monkey' and, as a result, the courts in California forced Twitter to hand over private account details of some of its users . Nicknames included Miss Piggy, Pudgy Face, Cleadon Plonky, Chuckle Brothers, Mammy's Boy’, King of Sleaze and The Fat Mackem Hobbit. Mr Monkey’s aim was to ‘focus on political news and gossip in South Tyneside… and leave no stone unturned in an attempt to expose the truth’. He accused some of the leaders of vote rigging, claiming expenses for ‘piss ups’, and documented their alleged drunken misadventures and dodgy affairs. The blog also had a ‘T*** of the Week’, and detailed private information about the potential parliamentary candidates, as well as commenting on their fashion sense. In 2009 he became aware of workers at the council trying to silence him, to which he responded: ‘It seems senior councillors and a handful of council officers have become so obsessed with Mr Monkey’s Blog that they’ll stop at nothing to close it down.’ The blogger alleged that council officers tried to censor the blog by barring access to it from council owned computers. Employees of the council were said to have asked legal action to be taken against the anonymous blogger but Mr Monkey said the executive of the council originally refused this action, which left them feeling ‘angry’ and ‘frustrated’. Mr Monkey added: ‘Imagine what the public would say about a council who spends hundreds of thousands of pounds of taxpayers money chasing a monkey and all because the Chuckle Brothers can’t face the prospect of being labelled as a couple of scheming, lying, cheating and corrupt w******.’ Defamatory comments were made on the 'Mr Monkey' blog - which received about 4,000 visits a day, about council leader Iain Malcom (right) and UKIP councillor David Potts (left), as well as various other councillors . In July 2009, for exact reasons . unknown, Mr Monkey said after causing ‘mayhem in the corridors of power’ he would no longer be posting any new material on the blog. He said he had spent months agonising over whether to retire, but had finally decided to spend more time with his family. But despite no blog posts appearing on the site since, council bosses continued to spend taxpayers money on trying to find him. At some point in 2009, the council instructed the American lawyers to try to find out those responsible, insisting it had a ‘duty of care’ towards its staff. The firm produced an 18-page dossier in July 2011 which said Mr Monkey was most likely a two-man operation and that libel action would be ‘highly successful’ if pursued through the UK or US courts. The case was taken to the US, because that is where WordPress, the online publishing platform for the blog, is based, and the council wanted to unmask the person behind the site. 'Pursuing this claim at the expense of . hard-pressed taxpayers was ludicrous and the investigation has wasted . thousands of pounds.' - Andy Silvester, Taxpayers Alliance . The council suspected there was also a connection between several twitter accounts and Mr Monkey. As a result, the courts in California ended up forcing Twitter to hand over private account details of some of its users - but it did not lead them to the mystery blogger. On June 17, the council abandoned its legal action after a Freedom of Information request was submitted asking about the current bill. They wrote to the courts in the US and the case was dismissed. A council spokesman said: ‘The council took legal action because it has a duty of care to protect its staff and officials from the kind of harassment and intimidation caused by this malicious and libellous blog, which, if left unchallenged, would have seriously damaged the reputations of innocent people. ‘Since the council initiated the action in 2009, the libellous comments have stopped and there have been no new postings on the blog. ‘Taking legal action attracted some criticism, but as a council we felt it was our duty to mount this challenge in order to protect people from cyber-bullying and harassment. ‘We stand by this principle.’","Notorious internet blogger known only as 'Mr Monkey' insulted councillors .

"Gunners hit for SIX on Wenger's 1,000th game as Gibbs is mistakenly sent off after Oxlade-Chamberlain's handball . Even after schoolyard squabbles about Christmas cards, telescopes and specialists in failure, nothing could have stung Arsene Wenger quite like that 6-0 defeat at Chelsea. The fact that it came in his 1,000th Arsenal game when the pre-match clamour had all been about an incredible milestone only amplified the insult. ‘Not a bad day, a horrendous day,’ said Wenger on Friday, as memories were rekindled against his will. ‘It was a massive disappointment; the lowest point of the season. We never forget that day.’ Arsenal are back at Stamford Bridge on Sunday when the Barclays Premier League’s unbeaten teams collide and Cesc Fabregas appears in blue against the club he left three years ago to join Barcelona. VIDEO Scroll down to see Sportsmail's 18-year celebration of Arsene Wenger at Arsenal . Arsene Wenger has described the defeat as 'horrendous' ahead of his side's trip to Stamford Bridge . Andre Schurrle is mobbed by his  team-mates after scoring Chelsea's second with just seven minutes gone . Kieran Gibbs was mistakenly shown a red card by referee Mark Clatternburg with only 15 minutes gone . Jose Mourinho has lost just three of his 32 Premier League games against Manchester City, Manchester United, Liverpool and Arsenal . The Cesc factor is the latest thread to a rivalry which has crackled with animosity since the day Jose Mourinho arrived in London and made it his personal mission to undermine the ‘Invincibles’. Within a year, he had seized the title as a storm raged around their contrasting footballing ideologies and economic differences of their clubs, peppered with childish insults, snubbed handshakes and unacknowledged Christmas greetings. ‘When you give stupid people success if makes them more stupid,’ tutted Wenger. The feud was quickly revived when Mourinho returned to the Premier League after a six-year absence and branded Wenger a ‘specialist in failure’ because of nine years without a trophy. Jose Mourinho (left) gestures to his team as Wenger looks frustrated during the 6-0 thrashing . Arsenal players stand dejected as the Chelsea team celebrate their sixth goal of the game . ‘It was a consequence of something else,’ said Mourinho, who made the comment in reaction to an inference from Wenger that the Chelsea boss was afraid to declare his team in last season’s title race because he was afraid to fail. ‘I didn’t get an apology. I don’t apologise,’ he added. ‘My feeling is to get over it and move forward. ‘You don’t need to apologise. Intelligent people don’t need that. Let’s go to another match with big responsibility for both of us. We manage two big clubs in London and we have a responsibility not to win but to give a good match for the fans.’ Wenger celebrated his 18-year anniversary at Arsenal earlier this week with a win against Galatasaray . He described his relationship with Wenger as ‘correct’ and ‘normal’ and offered his congratulations on his 18 years Arsenal, after the anniversary on Wednesday. ‘An amazing achievement,’ said Mourinho. ‘Congratulations to him and the club. It’s not possible because he’s a manager of quality, but it’s a philosophy of the club.’ These two managers seldom pass a compliment to one another without darkening its edge. It is as if they spit on their palms before shaking hands or apply a ‘Kick me’ sticker with a slap on the shoulder. On Fabregas, Mourinho teased about him coming ‘home’ and his ‘love’ for the ‘blue village’. How Arsenal fans react at the Bridge would be up to them, he said, but noted how Chelsea’s travelling fans had applauded Frank Lampard after he scored against them for Manchester City. He dismissed the 6-0 win as ‘once in a lifetime’ and hailed Wenger’s unbeaten season in 2003-04 as something never to be repeated. ‘I don’t see in modern football with the competitiveness of the Premier League a team being champions without defeat,’ said the Chelsea boss. ‘In my opinion that will stay in history as the last time.’ Mourinho has the upper hand over Wenger - the latter is yet to win in their 11 previous head-to-heads . The Chelsea boss doesn't expect Chelsea to repeat last season's 6-0 win against the Gunners . From north London came similar noises of forced admiration from Wenger, now armed with another FA Cup win but the fact he has never beaten Mourinho must stick in the craw when they meet. ‘They had fantastic teams,’ said the Arsenal boss. ‘Their defence, led by John Terry, Petr Cech and others, always have good defensive records. Let’s not forget Chelsea won the Champions League on good defensive stability. ‘This has nothing to do with individual confrontation. It is about team performance. I believe we have a good opportunity to change recent history that has been negative for us. In life you must always think you are there to change what happened before, or you are fatalistic. Cesc Fabregas (above) will be playing against his former club as he lines up with Chelsea on Sunday . Wenger admitted they had has 'never seen a player adapt as quickly' as Diego Costa (above) On Wenger’s side is news that Didier Drogba, scourge of his teams on so many occasions during the last decade, is out with an ankle injury. Less encouraging, is confirmation that Diego Costa will start despite the problem with his hamstrings. Costa has eight goals this season and Wenger dubbed him ‘a killer’ in front of goal. ‘I’ve never seen a player adapt as quickly,’ he admitted, although he has Danny Welbeck fresh from a hat-trick in Europe. It will be decided on the pitch but their professional rivalry will bristle again on the touchline. Just as it did in March, when Wenger watched the horror of his 1,000th game unfold and Mourinho celebrated Chelsea’s sixth goal like a vandal spray-painting his own message on the milestone.

"The Miami Dolphins ran in five touchdowns to thrash the Oakland Raiders 38-14 in a one-sided NFL International Series contest in front of over 83,000 fans at Wembley on Sunday. Miami quarterback Ryan Tannehill completed 23 of his 31 passes for 278 yards and two touchdowns while running back Lamar Miller added two more in a crushing victory. Cornerback Cortland Finnegan also went in for a touchdown as Miami ended their run of two straight defeats and recorded their first win since they beat New England in week one. Lamar Miller gets into the end zone for the Miami Dolphins' second touchdown of a dominant second quarter at Wembley Stadium . Wembley pulled out all the stops before the game with Def Leppard and the Oakland Raider chealerders 'Raiderettes' entertaining fans before the game . Raiders quarterback Derek Carr got his Oakland offence off to a great start with an excellent first drive of ten plays resulting in a touchdown . Brian Leonhardt celebrates after the Raiders score on their first possession as they try and end their long losing streak . Oakland, meanwhile, remained winless in 2014 and sit bottom of the AFC West after four straight defeats. Running back Maurice Jones-Drew was passed fit to play for Oakland after recovering from a hand injury sustained on the opening day of the season. For Miami, quarterback Tannehill retained his place - despite a public spat with coach Joe Philbin earlier in the week - but running back Knowshon Moreno (elbow) and centre Mike Pouncey (hip) were both among the Dolphins inactives. Manchester born offensive tackle Menelik Watson led the Raiders onto the field at a packed Wembley in the first of three games in London this season. Sebastian Janikowski adds the extra point to put the Oakland Raiders seven points ahead with just five minutes on the clock . Mychal Rivera sprints down the line before being knocked out of bounds by Dolphins' Brent Grimes as the Raiders started the game well . Dolphins quarterback Ryan Tannehill began to find his range in the second quarter, as Miami picked up 21 unanswered points . The Raiders offense came into the game ranked last in the league with just 37 points in their three matches so far this season. But, after receiving the ball from kick-off, Oakland marched all the way down the field to score a touchdown on their opening drive. The very first play of the game saw Raiders quarterback Derek Carr hit wide receiver James Jones for a 30-yard gain. Oakland maintained that momentum and, on the 10th play of the 74-yard drive, Carr found tight end Brian Leonhardt in the end zone with a three-yard pass for a touchdown. Miami’s offense responded immediately with a score of their own as Caleb Sturgis kicked a 41-yard field goal. Despite the absence of Moreno, the Dolphins rushing game came into this contest ranked No 7 in the league. Lamar Miller’s 21-yard run moved Miami into Oakland territory and Sturgis came out to kick the field goal after an eight-play, 47-yard drive. Dolphins quarterback Tannehill also started to find his range, and he hit Mike Wallace with a 13-yard touchdown pass at the beginning of the second quarter as Miami took a 10-7 lead. Tannehill makes a gesture to the sidelines as he started to drive his offence forward against the hapless Raiders during the Wembley showdown . Derek Carr was given little time in the pocket as his offensive line's protection crumbled under pressure from the Dolphins . Lamar Miller strolls in for his first touchdown as the Dolphins took complete control against the winless Oakland Raiders at Wembley . VIDEO Dolphins heading in the right direction - Tannehill . It was an impressive start from Tannehill after he came under fire from head coach Philbin following their 34-15 defeat by the Kansas City Chiefs last weekend. His pass to Wallace at the end of an eight-play, 91-yard drive was his ninth completion in his first 11 throws for 112 yards. Oakland, meanwhile, were struggling to move the chains and Miami had the ball back very quickly after Carr was sacked just outside his own end zone, forcing a Raiders punt. The Oakland defense had no answer to Miami, and the Dolphins extended their lead to 10 points as they marched down the field once again for another touchdown. Miller continued to lead Miami’s rushing game and, on 4th and 1 at the Raiders 13-yard line, the 23-year-old carved through Oakland’s defense and went all the way to the end zone. The signs were ominous for the Raiders and they were forced into yet another quick punt on their next drive. Even when Jarvis Landry fumbled the punt return for Miami to hand Oakland possession just short of midfield, the Raiders offense still couldn’t capitalise and were forced to punt again. Dion Sims celebrates his touchdown reception during a near-perfect second quarter for the Dolphins which produced 21 unanswered points . Tannehill continued to torment the Raiders defence, making 14 straight completions to create a big half-time lead for the Dolphins . By the time the cheerleaders were entertaining the Wembley crowd again at half time the Dolphins led 24-7 over the Raiders . But Miami were having no such problems and Tannehill threw his second touchdown pass of the night just before half-time as he found Dion Sims with an 18-yard reception. Despite starting at their own 10-yard line, the Dolphins marched 90 yards in just nine plays and little over four minutes to extend their lead to 24-7 at half-time. It was a near perfect first half for the Dolphins and Tannehill had 17 completions from his 19 passes for 204 yards and two touchdowns. Oakland, meanwhile, picked up just one first down in a hapless second quarter and were immediately on the back foot after half-time as Miami received the ball from kick-off. Derek Carr came under increasing pressure as the Raiders failed to score in the second corner for the fourth time in four games this season . There was precious little to cheer for the Raiderettes at Wembley but the cheerleaders did their utmost to lift their team's spirits . No Raiders players are able to get anywhere near Lamar Miller as he walks into the end zone for his second touchdown of the night, the Dolphins' fourth . It looked like more of the same as Miller picked up some big gains on the ground to take Miami into the red zone once again. But Oakland were given a reprieve when Miller dropped the ball one yard shy of the end zone, forcing a much-need turnover and keeping the score at 24-7. The Raiders required a scoring drive to pull themselves back into contention, but what they got was another turnover. Carr threw a loose pass and was picked off by Miami cornerback Brent Grimes, who returned the ball all the way to the three-yard line. That left Miller with the simple task of walking into the end zone untouched for his second touchdown to hammer another nail into Oakland’s coffin. Brent Grimes celebrates after making an interception for big yardage as the Oakland Raiders' game collapsed during the second half . Cortland Finnegan takes advantage of a fumble on the snap to race away from replacement quarterback Matt McGloin to score another Dolphins touchdown . Raiders head coach Dennis Allen pulled Carr out and brought in Matt McGloin in an attempt to get his offense moving. But a miscommunication on the snap led to a fumble and Miami cornerback Finnegan recovered the ball before returning it 50 yards all the way for another touchdown. And it didn’t get any better for McGloin or the Raiders on their next drive as the quarterback’s pass was tipped and intercepted by safety Jimmy Wilson. Miami thought they had their sixth touchdown when Tannehill threw a short pass to Daniel Thomas, but his score was ruled out for offensive pass interference. It mattered little, as did Tannehill being intercepted by TJ Carrie, as the game was already over after three quarters. McGloin salvaged some pride for the Raiders as he hit Andre Holmes for a 22-yard touchdown midway through the fourth quarter, but the Wembley crowd had already began trickling out of the stadium by that stage. Finnegan celebrates with his Dolphins teammates after extending their lead to 31 points on a night of complete domination . Andre Holmes jumps to make a catch with Will Davis in close proximity but the Oakland offence was never able to get any real momentum going . Dolphins head coach Philbin said: 'We really haven't played a complete 60-minute game and we haven't played great early in games. After the first score that we gave up, I thought our team settled in and played really well. 'There are a lot of things we will take a look at. We played well but there are a lot of things we could do better.' On quarterback Tannehill, Philbin added: 'He played very well. He had a good rhythm, good tempo, good command and was very decisive. He threw the ball accurately, made some good decisions and played a very good game.'","Brian Leonhardt puts Raiders ahead early on with 3 yard reception from Derek Carr .

"A devoutly Christian player for the NFL has made his views known on allowing gays to play American Football, just weeks before the League is about to introduce its first openly gay player. Kirk Cousins, quarterback for the Washington Redskins made some unfortunate comments when asked about the appointment of gay footballer Michael Sam, who will likely be drafted in May. “There are a lot of teammates in my locker room right now who may not have a homosexual lifestyle, but they have sins, too. So I don’t say they can’t help us win. Nobody’s perfect,' said Cousins. Scroll down for video... Conflicting views: Washington backup quarterback Kirk Cousins said Friday that he'd welcome a gay teammate into the locker room but then said 'nobody's perfect' What does he really think? Washington Redskins quarterback Kirk Cousins says he'd welcome an openly gay teammate, but some are questioning the sincerity of his remarks . He went on: 'To that degree, we'd welcome them into our locker room and say come help us win, and hopefully I can love him like Jesus and hopefully show him what it means to follow Jesus.' Cousins was also asked about having a gay teammate in a May 2013 interview with MLive, shortly after NBA player Jason Collins had come out. At the time, Cousins called it a 'very, very sensitive issue' and that he hadn’t given it a lot of thought. Cousins' comments came just weeks after former Missouri defensive lineman Michael Sam came out as gay in interviews with The New York Times and ESPN. Although there may well be plenty of homophobic comments in the locker room, it appears many players have not yet learned to keep their thoughts to themselves. Sam publicly came out following the college football season. Change: The National Football League said it plans to increase efforts to promote tolerance of sexual orientation inside locker rooms in wake of Missouri defensive lineman Michael Sam¿s announcement that he is gay. Sam is expected to become the first openly gay player in the league¿s 94-year history this season. Although his Missouri teammates knew of his sexuality during the fall, a public debate has been raging  concerning gay athletes in locker rooms, particularly in the NFL. It's not just Cousins who has aired such views, earlier this week, it was reported an anonymous Redskins player said, 'I think some guys would kind of shy away from him a little bit' if they had a gay teammate, 'but for the most part, he’d be accepted.' Outsports' Jim Buzinski was among those who were critical of Cousins' statements. 'People like Cousins seem well-meaning and he would like to think he's only full of love,' he wrote. 'But his assumption that homosexuality equals . imperfection and sin is insulting, as is his desire to proselytize.' Cousins: 'From a football standpoint, if the guy can help us win, come help us win,' Cousins, a devout Christian, said. 'Now, there are a lot of teammates in my locker room right now who may not have a homosexual lifestyle, but they have sins, too. They¿re not perfect. So I don¿t say they can¿t help us win. Nobody¿s perfect.' Cousins, who made his comments during an appearance at Michigan¿s North Pointe High School, went on to say: 'To that degree, we¿d welcome him into our locker room and say come help us win, and hopefully I can love him like Jesus and hopefully show him what it means to follow Jesus.' The National Football League said it plans to increase efforts to promote tolerance of sexual orientation inside locker rooms. Discussions of sexual orientation are not unheard of in NFL locker rooms and it is an accepted fact among players that there are already gay men in the league, according to a veteran. One player said he previously played alongside a gay teammate in high school and that it was a non-issue. 'We all knew, but he was just one of the guys,' the player said to CBS Sports. 'From what I remember, nobody gave him any crap about it.' Kirk Cousins: Last week, CBS cited an anonymous player who said that he could think of a handful of Redskins players who might have a difficult time with an openly gay teammate .","Cousins: There are a lot of teammates in my locker room right now who may not have a homosexual lifestyle, but they have sins too .

"Former Formula One driver Andrea De Cesaris has died following a motorbike accident on Rome's ringroad, Italian media reported on Sunday. De Cesaris, who was 55, raced for a host of teams including McLaren in 208 starts between 1980 and 1994 but never won a Grand Prix.

"Bus operator Abellio flew to Poland to recruit 50 new drivers claiming they could not find any suitable British candidates' A UK bus operator flew bosses to Poland to recruit 50 new drivers despite there being 2.6million people on the dole in the UK. Abellio, a subsidiary of the Dutch state rail operator, claimed it could not find suitable British candidates to work on routes in central and South West London. The firm went on a massive recruitment drive in former Soviet country to expand its workforce. They claimed that there were 'no suitable' Britons. But a current employee at the transport giant said he knew a number of friends who had been interviewed for the posts - and turned down. 'The Routemaster will soon be back in . the capital. What a shame if British drivers miss out on the chance to . drive it,' the driver, who wished to remain anonymous, told the Sun. An . Abellio spokesman said: 'In order to supplement recruitment in the UK . we held an open day in Poland where 51 experienced bus drivers were . recruited. 'We are not aware of any occasion where a suitable candidate has been turned away.' The Polish drivers, some of whom have . already started work, will be paid £10.60 an hour for the first two . years at which point it will increase to £11.50. There are currently 2.64 million unemployed people in Britain. Critics would suggest that any number of these would have been suitable candidates to drive the iconic buses. The revalation comes as it was revealed that 160,000 Britons have missed out on employment because work was taken by foreigners. Anybody fancy a job driving buses? A coach load of migrants from the Western Polish town of Zychlin prepare to make the journey to the UK several years ago. Perhaps now they're driving a Routemaster (file picture) For every four migrant workers who come to the country from outside the EU, one British job is lost, the experts said. The Migration Advisory Committee also . criticised the way ministers have used the potential impact on Gross . Domestic Product, or GDP – the total size of the economy – to decide . whether large-scale immigration was desirable. Professor David Metcalf, chairman of . the MAC, said it had led ‘inexorably’ to ‘pro-immigration’ policies . because more migrants will logically expand the economy. He called on ministers instead to consider the impact on schools, hospitals, congestion, crime rates and house prices. It follows a contrasting report by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research which said the number of immigrants coming to the UK had little or no impact on the number of unemployed. The MAC report found that house prices and rents are being pushed up by the number of migrants coming to the UK. It added that migrants will inevitably contribute to the demand for public services, commit crime and generate congestion in the same way any increase in the UK-born population would. However, the report concluded that migrants from inside the EU, including Eastern Europe, have ‘little or no impact on the native employment rate’.","2.46million Britons on the dole... but company still goes abroad for workers .

"Aston Villa manager Paul Lambert refused to shake Jose Mourinho's hand on Saturday because the Chelsea boss left before the full time whistle. Chelsea were leading 3-0 when Mourinho decided to beat the traffic and walk down the Stamford Bridge tunnel, but the 'Special One' halted to say his goodbyes to Lambert and assistant manager Roy Keane first. Instead, Lambert snubbed the 51-year-old's prematurely out-stretched hand and pointed to his watch to tell the former Real Madrid and Inter Milan manager that time wasn't quite up yet. Aston Villa manager Paul Lambert refused to shake Jose Mourinho's hand on Saturday . Lambert couldn't understand why Mourinho was leaving the Stamford Bridge arena before full-time . Assistant manager Roy Keane was in no mood to get involved in any pleasantries either . It was more of an acknowledgement than Keane offered, though, as the stern former Manchester United midfielder simply ignored him.

"Roy Hodgson has called Arsenal defender Calum Chambers up to the England squad after John Stones withdrew because of an ankle injury he suffered in Everton's 2-1 defeat at Manchester United. Stones is set for a spell on the sidelines because of suspected ankle ligament damage, which occurred in the dying minutes of Sunday's game at Old Trafford. As a result, the Everton centre-back will not report for England duty on Monday ahead of the Euro 2016 qualifiers against San Marino and Estonia. VIDEO Scroll down for Roy Hodgson's view on Chambers England squad status . Arsenal defender Calum Chambers (left) is closed down by Chelsea's Cesc Fabregas on Sunday . Everton's John Stones is stretchered off during the Premier League clash with Manchester United on Sunday . Defender Stones lies on the Old Trafford pitch awaiting treatment after suffering an ankle injury . The Football Association (FA) confirmed on Sunday night that Chambers has been drafted into the senior squad from the Under-21s to replace the former Barnsley defender. A statement from the FA read: 'Following John Stones' injury this afternoon the player will not report to St George's Park for England duty tomorrow. 'England manager Roy Hodgson has subsequently called up Calum Chambers, who was previously due to report for the Under 21s team.' Stones' injury is a blow to Hodgson, who handed the Everton centre-back his first competitive England start last month against Switzerland. Although San Marino and Estonia are among the weakest footballing nations in Europe, the England boss would have viewed the upcoming double-header as a perfect opportunity for the young defender to gain more international experience. Hodgson is already without injured defenders Kyle Walker, Glen Johnson, Jon Flanagan, Chris Smalling and Phil Jones for the games, which take place on Thursday and Sunday respectively. Chambers goes in for the ball with Chelsea's Andre Schurrle (right) at Stamford Bridge on Sunday . Stones, who left Old Trafford on crutches with a protective boot on his left leg, will be out of action for some time, according to the club. A post on Everton's Twitter feed read: 'Martinez confirms Stones has injured his ankle ligaments and will be assessed over the next 48 hours.' Everton boss Roberto Martinez then said in his press conference: 'John Stones has a problem with his ankle. It will be at least a few weeks (until he recovers). 'I don't expect John to be fit for next week. 'It is such a massive blow because he plays with an incredible arrogance. We will assess him in the next 48 hours.' Chambers received his first senior call-up for the double-header against Norway and Switzerland last month. England manager Roy Hodgson takes in the Premier League match between Chelsea and Arsenal on Sunday . The teenage defender was originally selected for the Under-21 squad this time around as they have an important play-off against Croatia, but Hodgson feels he needs the player for next week's senior games instead. Chambers' former Saints team-mate Luke Shaw will report for Under-21 action even though he hobbled off in the second half of United's victory on Sunday. The 19-year-old, who has three senior caps, received a kick to the knee during the match at Old Trafford, but he feels fit enough to join up with the Young Lions. Shaw said: 'It's not a bad injury - it's a dead leg on my knee. Chambers made his England debut in the friendly against Norway at Wembley last month . 'I felt it in the first 20 minutes when I got caught, but it carried on during the game so I thought it was probably best to come off before it gets any worse. 'I spoke with the doctor and obviously the manager as well, and both feel it's best that I do go [with England Under-21s] as it's not an injury that is going to keep me out. 'Hopefully, I should be training in the next couple of days and can get another two games of 90 minutes.'","England manager Roy Hodgson has called up Arsenal defender Calum Chambers .

"Ancient discovery: aria Pereira was found in the remote north-west Brazilian state of Acrel . A woman who claims to be 120-years old has been discovered in Brazil. The indigenous Maria Lucimar Pereira would become the world's oldest living person - by six years - if the findings in the remote north-west Brazilian Amazon state of Acre are true. At present American Besse Cooper, who was born on August 26, 1896 - making her nearly 115-years old - is regarded as the oldest in the world. Though Mrs Pereira could be the rightful owner of her crown. Staff for Brazil’s National Institute . of Social Security (INSS) have said that they found the elderly lady . during routine checks of state birth records. The . birth certificate says she was born on September 3, 1890, which means . that - if it is accurate - she will easily be the oldest person on the . planet. According to that birth certificate she is 120 years, nine months and 25 days old. Put another way, she has been on the planet for an amazing 44,128 days. And, indeed, she is not too far away from becoming the oldest person ever to have lived. Proof: Maria Pereira's birth certificate . Jeanne Calment, who died in August 1997 and claimed to have met artist Vincent van Gogh (1853-1890) in Arles - where she lived - is believed to be the oldest ever person. The French lady reached the grand old age of 122 years and 164 days and claimed that her longevity was down to a life of leisure and tennis. On the all-time list, Mrs Pereira - though unverified - would sit almost 18 months ahead of current second-place, American Sarah Knauss, who died in December 1999 aged 119 and 97 days. Mrs Pereira, who is said to have 10 children and 22 grandchildren, is indigenous, and has reportedly lived almost all of her life on the remote reserve, where the nearest town being Feijo (population 32,261). Proud family: Maria is looked after by her many relatives in the village . When the social workers checked her birth certificate they radioed the isolated indigenous community where she resides - there is no mobile reception - and organised to have her brought to the nearest town to confirm her identity. According to friends and relatives, she is from the kaxinawa indigenous ethnic group, and speaks only a few words in Portuguese, the language used in the South American country.

"A pill usually used to treat epilepsy, could give adults the learning powers of a child (illustrated), according to new research . A pill usually prescribed to treat epilepsy, could give adults the learning powers of a child, according to new research. Valproic acid, which is a key ingredient in drugs used to treat the disorder, could help adults revert to a more porous state of learning so that they are more able to learn new skills. The study demonstrated the power of the ingredient by helping a group of adult males learn to become pitch perfect. The skill, which is only possessed by around one in 10,000 people and enables singers to hit notes precisely, is usually taught from a young age, The Week reported. However, Takao Hensch, a professor of molecular and cellular biology at Harvard University, has proved it can be taught to adults too. He studied valproic acid, which is used to treat a variety of mood disorders to enable adult males aged between 18 and 27 to become pitch perfect. His real aim was to see if the ingredient can make it easier for grown-ups to learn new skills and absorb information. 'It's a mood-stabilizing drug, but we found that it also restores the plasticity of the brain to a juvenile state,' he told NPR. The men who took part in the experiment had no musical training as children and were asked to perform online tasks to train their ears. After two weeks of the exercises, they were tested on their ability to differentiate tones to see if the training had more effect than it typically does for men of their age. Valproic acid, which is a key ingredient in drugs used to treat mood disorders, could help adults revert to a more porous state of learning so that they are more able to learn new skills like children (pictured) The pill seemingly enabled the group to acquire perfect pitch, suggesting that they had become more open to learning new skills than their peers. Professor Hensch told the radio station: ‘It's quite remarkable since there are no known reports of adults acquiring absolute pitch.' In the future, it is possible that the research could help adults learn languages and new skills at a faster speed than is typical at a later stage in life. However, side effects need to be studied on a cellular level and Professor Hensch warned: ‘it is a process that one probably would not want to tamper with carelessly’. The study demonstrated the power of the ingredient by helping a group of adult men learn to become pitch perfect (stock picture). The participants had no musical training as children and were asked to perform online tasks to train their ears and were found to acquire the skill faster than men who had not taken the drug .","Harvard University professor believes Valproic acid could help adults revert to a more porous state of learning .

Now the stunning Edwardian mansion, which had a price tag in the region . of £100million, and boasts a library, cinema, gym and wine cellar, is . available for what the estate agent calls a ‘more realistic’ £65million. It’s still fantasy money to most of us. After all, the price-drop figure . alone is of lottery-winning proportions, enough to buy a portfolio of . more than 200 average-priced British properties. But in the world of the mega-rich, Heath Hall is now apparently . something of a bargain. So, what do you get for your money? Firstly, the . benefit of £40million in renovations, completed by owner Andreas . Panayiotou, the property magnate who bought Heath Hall in 2006. Accessories: As well as an indoor swimming pool, Heath Hall boasts a sauna and a snooker room . Cinema: The pricey house is perfect for cinephiles, as it boasts its own private screening room . Grounds: The home is set in 2.5 acres of land and is near the wilderness of Hampstead Heath . Imported: The exquisite marble used in the bathrooms of Heath Hall came from Italy . It . may be hard for most of us to imagine how a house could be worth . £65million, but Heath Hall combines giant scale with the most opulent . luxury. The mansion has . 14 bedrooms, each with its own bathroom, while the master bedroom has a . steel-lined panic room attached in case the super-rich owner is . targeted by burglars or kidnappers. Its . six reception rooms are decorated in Italian marble and seven different . types of wood, while the hall and library are lined with oak. When . it comes to relaxation, Heath Hall boasts a 'leisure complex' featuring . a swimming pool, gymnasium, sauna, steam room and jacuzzi. For the sporty-minded resident, the house has a snooker room and outdoor tennis courts. And . the more sedentary variety of billionaire would doubtless appreciate . the private cinema and climate-controlled cellar with space for more . than 600 bottles of vintage wine. Although . the home was built in 1910, it features some distinctively modern . touches - instead of light switches rooms are equipped with . touchscreens, and it is possible to control the building's electrical . systems using an iPad. The grounds of Heath Hall occupy 2.5 acres, which apparently makes the garden one of the largest in North London. The makeover has left the house, on The Bishops Avenue in Hampstead, . North London, as one of the capital’s finest homes. As well as 14 . bedroom suites, and 12 bathrooms, the house has six reception rooms, a . drawing room, dining room, family room, sun room and snooker room. The cellar can hold 600 bottles of wine and has its own climate-control . temperature system and the gym comes with a steam room, sauna and . swimming pool. Twelve types of Italian marble and seven types of wood were used for the . bathrooms while the snooker room, office, bar, library and grand . staircase are all made of the finest oak. The master-bedroom has a . steel-walled dressing room that doubles as a panic room for the . occupants to retreat to in an emergency. The house’s entire electrical . system can be controlled by iPad. If you ever tire of the interior, you could always step outside and . wander through the 2.5acres of gardens. Heath Hall was originally built . for sugar magnate William Park Lyle in 1910. The Bank of China took over the property in the 1950s and housed its . staff on bunk beds. When Mr Panayiotou bought it seven years ago, he . decided the first thing the 19,000sq/ft property needed was a little . extra room. His £40million renovations added an extra 8,000 sq/ft and . employed 120 tradesmen. Heath Hall is currently the most expensive property for sale on the open . market. It’s the least you could expect for a house in The Bishops . Avenue, also known as Billionaires’ Row. Grant Alexson, from Knight . Frank, which is marketing the property, said: ‘The £65million price is . more realistic. It is not a bargain, but there is no house like it. It . is beyond ambassadorial, it is the sort of home which is perfect for . kings or princes.’ Exclusive: The Bishops Avenue is known as 'Billionaires Row' because of its super-wealthy residents . Bedroom: This is just one of the 14 luxurious suites in the £65million house built in 1910 . Relaxing? The restoration of the extraordinary house required 120 workmen . Heath Hall may be the most valuable home on the market, but Central London is full of houses worth £1million or more. And while some of warned that London house prices have formed a bubble, they are still continuing to rise, with prices in the most exclusive areas up by six per cent in just one month. The average home in Kensington & Chelsea now costs £2.32million, up 6.2 per cent on a month ago, with Westminster properties up 5.8 per cent to £1.58million. The soaring prices have been blamed on the collapse in the value of the pound, which makes British real estate much more attractive to foreign buyers whose wealth is denominated in dollars, euros, rubles or yuan. Across London as a whole, the average house price is £496,298 - up 1.9 per cent in a month and nine per cent more than a year ago.","Heath Hall is the most valuable house currently on the British market .

"Shamed former CIA Director David Petraeus has offered an apology over his affair in an email to a friend, saying Friday night that he was ‘deeply sorry’ for the pain he’s cause the nation and his own family, it was revealed today. Petraeus’ long-time friend told the Washington Post that the retired general was extremely sorry over his extramarital affair, allegedly with his biographer, Paula Broadwell. His apology comes as reports show that Petraeus' career could have imploded Broadwell allegedly sent threatening e-mails to another woman she suspected of being too close to him. In fact, the as-yet unidentified woman could be the key to the entire scandal unfolding after it was claimed she contacted the FBI for protection after receiving frightening emails. Agents traced the threats to Paula Broadwell. Scroll down for video . A Woman Scorned? It is being claimed that the affair between David Petraeus and Paula Broadwell emerged after she sent threatening emails to Ms Kelley . However, it is claimed that Broadwell . was using Petraeus' own Gmail account to send the emails and when the . FBI began to investigate an obvious national security issue instead . uncovered explicit messages between the two sent from the decorated war . hero's own account - indicating an affair. Three senior law enforcement officials with knowledge of the case told the Washington Post that when Petraeus's name was raised in connection with the threatening emails the FBI thought that security had been breached. Beginning their investigation into how the Director of the CIA's personal email had been hacked, the FBI agents instead uncovered evidence that he and 40-year-old Broadwell were involved in an extramarital affair. FBI investigators first interviewed Petraeus about what they had found two weeks ago and informed him that no criminal charges would be brought and no-one is thought to have discussed the possibility of his resignation. But, according to the Washington Post, after an investigation Justice Department officials were unclear what to do next, because no crime had occurred nor breach of security. 'Affair': Paula Broadwell (right) allegedly hacked the personal email account of David Petraeus to scare off a woman she suspected of being too close to the retired general. They contacted James Clapper, the Director of National Intelligence and told him they had compromising material about the Petraeus. Clapper in turn spoke to Petraeus and advised him to resign. 'Director Clapper learned of the situation from the FBI on Tuesday evening around 5 p.m.,' the intelligence official said to the Washington Post. 'In subsequent conversations with Director Petraeus, Director Clapper advised Director Petraeus to resign.' Director Clapper also added that he did not see the need for an internal investigation by the CIA, citing it as 'a very personal matter, not a matter of intelligence.' On Wednesday evening, Director Clapper went to the White House and on Thursday morning President Obama was informed. Later on Thursday, Petraeus arrived to see the President and offered his resignation, which was accepted on Friday. The Washington Post has also reported that in an email message to a friend, Petraeus apologised for his actions. 'He was deeply sorry for the pain he has caused his family,' the friend said. 'He also noted how much he loved his job at the agency. He said he really relished the intellectual challenge there.' 'Other woman': Paula Broadwell, left, is married . and has two children. Petraeus has been married to his wife Holly, . pictured right, for 37 years, and they also have two children . Close: Broadwell first met Petraeus when he visited Harvard University, where she was a student . Broadwell did not respond to voice mail or email messages seeking comment. Broadwell's biography, 'All In: The Education of General David Petraeus,' was written with Vernon Loeb, a Washington Post editor, and published in January. Lawmakers from both parties joined Obama in praising Petraeus. Obama said in a statement that Petraeus had provided 'extraordinary service to the United States for decades' and had given a lifetime of service that 'made our country safer and stronger.' CIA Deputy Director Michael Morell will serve as acting director, Obama said. Morell was the key CIA aide in the White House to President George W. Bush during the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks. 'I am completely confident that the CIA will continue to thrive and carry out its essential mission,' Obama said. West Point Graduate: Broadwell, pictured here in Afghanistan, has more than a decade of U.S. military service . Broadwell, pictured with Lt Col. Steve Grenier in Gizab, writes opinion pieces on leadership . The resignation comes at a sensitive time. The administration and the CIA have struggled to defend security and intelligence lapses before the attack that killed the U.S. ambassador to Libya and three others. It was an issue during the presidential campaign that ended with Obama's re-election Tuesday. The CIA has come under intense scrutiny for providing the White House and other administration officials with talking points that led them to say the Benghazi attack was a result of a film protest, not a militant terror attack. It has become clear that the CIA was aware the attack was distinct from the film protests roiling across other parts of the Muslim world. Morell rather than Petraeus now is expected to testify at closed congressional briefings next week on the assault on the consulate in Benghazi, which occurred on the 11th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. Petraeus, who turned 60 on Wednesday, has been married for 38 years to Holly Petraeus, whom he met when he was a cadet at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, N.Y. She was the daughter of the academy superintendent. They have two children, and their son led an infantry platoon in Afghanistan. Awkward: Holly Petraeus (left in white) and Paula Broadwell sit in the front row during the CIAconfirmation . hearing of US Army General David Petraeus . Close: Broadwell first met Petraeus when he visited Harvard University, where she was a student . Oath of office: Petraeus was sworn in last September by Joe Biden with his wife Holly at his side . The retired general told his staffers in a statement that he was guilty of 'extremely poor judgment' in engaging in the affair. 'Such behavior is unacceptable, both as a husband and as the leader of an organization such as ours.' At FBI headquarters, spokesman Paul Bresson declined to comment on the information that the affair had been discovered in the course of an investigation by the bureau. Petraeus, who became CIA director in September 2011, was known as a shrewd thinker and hard-charging competitor. His management style was recently lauded in a Newsweek article by Broadwell. The article listed Petraeus' 'rules for living.' No. 5 was: 'We all make mistakes. The key is to recognize them, to learn from them, and to take off the rear view mirrors - drive on and avoid making them again.' Petraeus, in his email, told his CIA employees that he treasured his work with them 'and I will always regret the circumstances that brought that work with you to an end.'

Glory Days: David Petraeus is America's . best-known general and arguably the most consequential Army leader of . his generation. Here he salutes troops in Afghanistan in 2011 . The director of national intelligence, James Clapper, said Petraeus' departure represented 'the loss of one of our nation's most respected public servants. From his long, illustrious Army career to his leadership at the helm of CIA, Dave has redefined what it means to serve and sacrifice for one's country.' Other CIA directors have resigned under unflattering circumstances. CIA Director Jim Woolsey left over the discovery of a KGB mole, and director John Deutch left after the revelation that he had kept classified information on his home computer. Before Obama brought Petraeus to the CIA, he was credited with salvaging the U.S. war in Iraq. 'His inspirational leadership and his genius were directly responsible - after years of failure - for the success of the surge in Iraq,' Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said Friday. President George W. Bush sent Petraeus to Iraq in February 2007, at the peak of sectarian violence, to turn things around as head of U.S. forces. He oversaw an influx of 30,000 U.S. troops and moved troops out of big bases so they could work more closely with Iraqi forces scattered throughout Baghdad. Petraeus' success was credited with paving the way for the eventual U.S. withdrawal.","Details of Petraeus' affair with Paula Broadwell emerged when she allegedly hacked into his email account to send threatening messages to another 'paramour'

"The first live hamstring transplant in Europe – in which a mother donated her tendon to repair her injured daughter’s knee – has been performed by British surgeons. The success of the operation paves the way for a new approach to treating the common problem of damaged knees. Erin Howett, 11, injured her knee during a skiing session on a dream family holiday to Lapland in 2011. ‘At first we weren’t too worried,’ says her mother Penny, 37. ‘Erin has a high pain threshold and was happy to ski again straight away once the medics had checked her over. She was limping a bit, but not in distress.’ A mother's gift: Erin Howett, 11, from Basingstoke, Hampshire, can ski again thanks to her mother Penny, 37 . It was only a couple of weeks later and back at home in Basingstoke, Hampshire, that Penny asked her doctor to take a look at Erin’s knee, which was still swollen and painful. They were immediately referred to consultant orthopaedic surgeon Adrian Wilson at Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, who diagnosed her with a torn anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) – a very common knee injury. The ligament runs diagonally from the front of the shin to the back of the thigh and helps control the knee’s rotation. Injuring the ACL seriously affects limb stability. It is thought to happen to one in every 600 people each year. ‘An increasing number of young people are suffering this injury,’ says consultant knee surgeon and ACL specialist Paul Trikha, a colleague of Mr Wilson at Ashford and St Peter’s NHS Hospital in Surrey. ‘They are increasingly taking to contact sports or skiing, which are high-risk activities for such injuries.’ The most popular option for ACL reconstruction is using the patient’s own hamstrings, taking tendons from the back of their thighs to create  a new ligament. The largest one is  left behind to maintain hamstring function. How the operation was done . The other option is an allograft, in which ligaments are transplanted from a deceased donor. Using living parental (or other family member) tissue, first attempted in Australia 20 years ago, means there is no risk of rejection. In August Erin and Penny were admitted to North Hampshire Hospital where they were operated on in separate theatres under general anaesthetic. An inch-long incision was made a little less than an inch below Penny’s inside knee, and the hamstring – like a ribbon of smoked salmon – was removed from where it anchors to the bone. This procedure took between six and eight minutes. The hamstring was then folded into four and stitched together to form a new ACL using a technique introduced to the UK by Mr Wilson. It was packaged up and immediately transferred to the adjacent theatre to be transplanted into Erin. Using minute keyhole incisions, Erin’s damaged ACL was removed. Holes were drilled in the femur and tibia (bones in the leg) and the donated graft was then threaded through her knee cavity. The graft was fixed to the bones with tiny metal buttons which sit in the drilled holes. The whole procedure took about an hour. ACL reconstruction is rarely performed on children because of the risk of growth abnormalities and deformity, as well as the increased challenges of surgery due to their smaller anatomy. The condition is traditionally managed with a leg brace and physiotherapy. But with increasing numbers of ACL injuries, doctors are keen to find an effective treatment. The two surgeons say better education of GPs and A&E doctors is also needed, as the diagnosis is often missed in the early stages. ‘Such injuries are generally not seen by a specialist until three to 12 months after they occur,’ says Mr Wilson. ‘By this time the patient is likely to have suffered a secondary injury.’ It took 18 months after the accident for Erin to have the operation as a special licence was required for the live tissue donation. But the results have been remarkable. ‘Erin wasn’t in pain, but the first couple of days were a struggle as she didn’t believe that she could straighten the leg again after 18 months of pain and being unable to,’ says Penny. Now, less than three months after surgery, Erin’s leg is almost back to normal. ‘She wasn’t lucky at all to have a knee injury,’ says Penny, ‘but she was very lucky to have those two doctors working on her.’","Erin Howett, 11, injured her knee while skiing in Lapland in 2011 .

"Academic achiever: Dr Philip Elliott suffered a number of career knock-backs in the weeks leading to his death . An academic jumped off scaffolding to his death when he was only able to find a job in a call centre after finishing his doctorate, an inquest heard today. Dr Philip Elliott, 31, who had recently completed a PhD in physics at Reading University, was seen on the sixth floor of an apartment block in west London just after 11am on January 27 this year. Police tried to call him down but he fell from the property in Cromwell Street, Kensington, an hour later, the hearing was told. Westminster Coroner's Court heard Dr Elliott - who was also a qualified engineer and was described as a 'high academic achiever' - had suffered a number of career knock-backs in the weeks leading to his death. His landlord of seven years Harry Duphnath said the most recent he knew of was in December last year. In a statement read to the inquest Mr Duphnath said: 'I was aware Philip had started a job with Southern Electric - I think in a call centre - which wasn't what he aspired to. 'He mentioned being frustrated at work and unhappy about being there and had started looking for other jobs and going for interviews. 'The last one was the week before Christmas in 2012. 'I saw him ironing his shirt getting ready for the interview. 'While I was there he checked his emails and he had one which said the interview had been cancelled. 'He was a bit low about that, but he wasn't angry. He said that he would plod on and keep going.' The landlord said he received a text message from Dr Elliott on January 24, three days before his death, apologising for not doing some tidying up. It read: 'Sorry. I've had a terrible time the last three weeks. Thanks for your patience. I can't explain how stressful it's been, but I appreciate it's not your fault.' Mr Duphnath said him and his wife Sonia were 'utterly shocked' to hear Philip had taken his life days later. Low: The coroner could not say for certain if Dr Elliott meant to take his own life and said his actions could have been a 'cry for help' Det Con David Gadsby, of the Metropolitan Police, said a resident in the block where Dr Elliott died reported hearing footsteps on the roof at 9.30am that morning, but thought nothing of it and went back to bed. An hour-and-a-half later a motorist driving past the building called police expressing concern a man might be preparing to jump. Officers arrived within five minutes but were advised not to talk him down as it was too dangerous to get out onto the scaffolding. Paramedics who were already on the scene tried to revive him but the science mad graduate was pronounced dead from multiple injuries at 12.10pm. Westminster Coroner Darren Stewart said he could not be sure beyond reasonable doubt that Dr Elliott meant to take his own life as it could have been a 'cry for help.' Recording a narrative verdict, he explained: 'It is clear he was a high academic achiever in science, having achieved a PhD from the University of Reading, but he had not been able to get a job for some time. Dr Philip Elliott was seen on the sixth floor of this apartment block in west London on January 27 before he fell, Westminster Coroner's Court heard (pictured) 'He took work which was perhaps not entirely suited to his skill sets in that he was working in a call centre. 'However, it shows Dr Elliot was committed to gaining employment and to progressing in his life. 'What is clear from the evidence is that he received a number of blows to his confidence in terms of jobs he aspired to which were either unsuccessful or withdrawn. 'It is clear that this had an impact on his general morale, and on the 27th of January 2013 Dr Elliott climbed up on to some scaffolding in Cromwell Road, Kensington. 'Officers decided not to try and talk Dr Elliott down as it would have been dangerous to them and to him. 'Sadly, shortly thereafter, Dr Elliott made a gesture with his arms and appeared to dive towards the ground striking the pavement.' He added: 'Police enquiries revealed no indication Dr Elliott's actions were planned or that he had intended to take his life, nor is there any evidence to suggest Dr Elliott was subject to any mental health care. 'Whilst perhaps disappointed and suffering from a degree of depression due to his lack of work opportunities he was otherwise a fit, intelligent young man who had achieved well at university. 'It makes the outcome of what occurred on January 27 2013 all the sadder due to that. 'I am not satisfied on what has been presented before me as to be certain Dr Elliott intended to take his own. It is entirely possible this could have been a cry for help.' None of Dr Elliott's family attended the inquest in central London, but they have since set up a remembrance page in his memory.","Dr Philip Elliott recently competed a degree at Reading University .

"Calls are growing for an investigation into Channel 4’s controversial drama, Ukip: The First 100 Days, after nearly 2,000 viewers complained about its ‘biased’ portrayal of what life might be like under Nigel Farage’s party. The spoof, which mixed scripted scenes with archive footage, suggested Britain would be gripped by race riots and mass unemployment if Ukip came to power. Ofcom received about 20 complaints before it aired on Monday night and more than 1,650 afterwards. Scroll down for video . Complaints: Calls are growing for an investigation into Channel 4’s controversial drama after nearly 2,000 viewers complained about its ‘biased’ portrayal of what life might be like under Nigel Farage’s party . The programme mixed scripted scenes with archive footage and suggested Britain would be gripped by race riots and mass unemployment if Ukip came to power . Channel 4 also received more than 250 comments, although the state-owned broadcaster did not say how many of those are negative. John Hemming, Liberal Democrat MP for Birmingham Yardley, said last night that Channel 4 had abused its position as a public service broadcaster. He wants the broadcasting regulator to investigate why it was allowed to be shown. ‘Channel 4 and the BBC are not supposed to be biased – though we all know they tend to be biased,’ he said. ‘If Britain left the European Union we would probably end up in the EEA [European Economic Area], and we should reflect that. 'It is misleading to exaggerate the situation. I would be shocked if Ofcom did not investigate.’ UKIP: First Hundred Days showed investors such as Airbus pulling out of Britain, after the country quit the European Union – one of Mr Farage’s key election promises. The economy crashed and thousands of workers immediately lost their jobs, in Channel 4’s dystopian vision, sparking protests and riots around the country. Gerard Batten, UKIP MEP for London and party general election candidate for Romford, slammed the depiction as ‘bile and vitriol’. Chaos: The economy crashed and thousands of workers immediately lost their jobs, in Channel 4’s dystopian vision, sparking protests and riots around the country . UKIP: First Hundred Days showed investors such as Airbus pulling out of Britain, after the country quit the European Union – one of Mr Farage’s key election promises . ‘Political debate is one thing, and having a debate where people can put another point of view, or even a factual documentary about a political party. But this wasn’t that. ‘I’m not quite sure what you would describe it as apart from a piece of bile and vitriol from our political opponents, who don’t happen to be in a political party, they’re in a TV channel and don’t have to go through the inconvenience of running for office.’ Viewers took to Twitter to express their fury: ´This is so biased from a mainstream media [organisation], it makes me furious - and I don´t even support UKIP,’ one said. Another wrote: ‘I’m no UKIP fan, but this hatchet job Channel 4 is doing on them is quite anti-democratic and quite outrageous.´ . Ukip’s leader Nigel Farage tweeted: ‘Looks like 100 Days of Ukip may well have backfired on Channel 4. A biased, partisan depiction of the only party that Believes in Britain.’ Douglas Carswell, who became Ukip’s first elected MP last October, said: ‘We are doing a great deal of work in the key seats that Ukip is focused on winning and the Channel 4 mockumentary reinforces the view amongst those voters that we are presided over by a smug, arrogant, out-of-touch commentariat class. ‘The mockumentary was supposed to damage Ukip but I think it’s reinforced the sense of cultural alienation and I think it makes people more likely to vote for Ukip against the cartel in Westminster.' Ukip’s leader Nigel Farage tweeted: ‘Looks like 100 Days of Ukip may well have backfired on Channel 4. A biased, partisan depiction of the only party that Believes in Britain' Channel 4’s head of documentaries, Nick Mirsky, said a ‘lot of research’ had gone into the film and he thought it was ‘fair’. A spokesman for the broadcaster added that it had stuck to Ofcom’s rules to be ‘fair, accurate and duly impartial’. ‘This rise of UKIP’s electoral support is one of the biggest political phenomena in recent years and this is reflected in The First 100 Days, which used policies and statements made by the party and its members to create a fictional future where the party is in power,’ it added. ‘Channel 4 has a role to encourage debate and engage viewers in political issues – and the schedule will include a broad range of programming in the build up to the election including news and current affairs investigations, a party leader debate and a major new political drama on the formation of the coalition government.’","Calls are growing for a probe into Channel 4's Ukip: The First 100 Days .

"It has hardly been a smooth ride, from the theft of cars to hackers stealing an early script - filming for the new Bond film Spectre has been hit by a string of disasters. And yesterday it emerged the curse of Bond had struck again, after two crew members were injured in a car crash on set in Austria. According to a source, filming was put on hold when one of the crew members was hit at high speed by a racing car during a stunt.

And a relative of one of those injured in the crash said: ‘They were filming in Innsbruk [Austria] and the driver of the stunt car, a racing car, lost control. 'The car crashed into someone, wedging them between the pavement and the car. And they had to be helicoptered to a hospital. ‘Another person was injured and was taken to a different hospital. The crash also damaged lots of the filming equipment, so none of the footage can be used.’ The crash is the latest disaster to hit Spectre since filming began at the end of last year. Setbacks have included the theft of nine cars, hackers stealing an early version of the script and Daniel Craig, who is portraying Bond for the fourth time, spraining his knee while filming a fight scene at Pinewood Studios in London. In recent days plans to shoot a funeral scene in a Rome cemetery were scuppered after a Christian confraternity banned the team from filming. Behind the scenes: Filming for the new Bond movie is expected to continue tomorrow following the car crash . And they have also been blocked from shooting a chase scene at the Quattro Fontane site, where there are four 16th-century baroque fountains. Last night filming had been put on hold to deal with the car crash. The cast and crew are thought to have been relocated to Rome, where filming it due to commence tomorrow. According to a source, Bond bosses have got around the issue with the cemetery, which was to be the first Rome location, by agreeing to create a set nearby. Among the material being shot in Rome is a car crash scene, which will see some of the city’s most famous streets shut down, with 800 security guards primed to accompany residents around the neighbourhood. Spectre is the 24th film in the Bond franchise. It is due for release in October. Last night a spokesman for the film said: ‘There was an accident on set today. Two crew members were taken to hospital, one has been released and another is being treated for a leg fracture.’","Two crew members injured in car crash on set during filming for Spectre .

"Private schools are ditching GCSEs in record numbers in favour of tougher qualifications based on the old O-level, figures published today show. They are increasingly turning to International GCSEs, which are seen as better preparation for A-levels despite government reforms to conventional exams. The number of independent school entries for IGCSEs leapt by 18 per cent this summer to 152,170 – accounting for 38.7 per cent of Year 11 exam entries. In 2010, just 11.1 per cent of private school exam entries were for IGCSEs. Exams: Private schools are ditching GCSEs in record numbers in favour of tougher qualifications (file picture) GCSE entries, in comparison, fell from 274,183 last year to 242,181, according to exam data from 552 members of the Independent Schools Council. More than 400 ISC schools had pupils taking at least one IGCSE. The country’s top private school for GCSEs this year, North London Collegiate School, has ditched English literature GCSE altogether in favour of an AS-level in the subject. Deputy head Matthew Shoults said the school always wanted students to ‘take the specifications that are not going to hamper them intellectually and not going to make them jump through hoops’. At Cheltenham College, pupils study IGCSEs in maths, English language and literature, science, history, geography and modern languages alongside GCSEs in other subjects. This year, the 111 pupils passed 34.9 per cent of exams at A* and 64.5 per cent at A or A*. Six pupils achieved ten or more A* grades. Duncan Byrne, the school’s deputy head, said: ‘We believe that the specifications for IGCSE are more academically rigorous. ‘IGCSE, particularly in mathematics and sciences, contains content which is more challenging, and which prepares students better for further study.’ Chairman: Barnaby Lenon, chairman of the Independent Schools Council, said there had been a period of ‘turbulence’ for GCSEs, and schools ‘felt confident sticking with what they knew' IGCSEs were primarily developed for schools overseas. They became favoured by private schools in the UK because they featured less coursework and more emphasis on exams taken after two years, like the old O-levels. Their format was echoed in former education secretary Michael Gove’s reform of conventional GCSEs which featured less coursework, bite-sized modules being replaced with traditional end-of-course exams and new curbs placed on resits. English GCSEs were also subject to major reform, with scores in speaking and listening tests no longer added to the final grade to combat inflated teacher assessment. In the next three years, entirely new GCSEs will be introduced, existing A* to G grades replaced by numbers 1 to 8 and league tables completely revamped. Barnaby Lenon, chairman of the Independent Schools Council, said there had been a period of ‘turbulence’ for GCSEs, and schools ‘felt confident sticking with what they knew, less affected by some of the changes’. He said schools may also wait and see what the reformed GCSEs were like, adding: ‘But, obviously, if the new GCSEs are felt by independent schools to be rigorous and a good preparation, there’s no reason why schools won’t switch back.’ The ISC statistics also show that 32.7 per cent of papers were awarded A*s, up from 32 per cent last year. Some 60.6 per cent of entries were graded A* or A, a rise from 60.4 per cent last year. More than 100 leading schools – including Eton, Harrow and Westminster – have opted out of the ISC tables amid claims they distort education and give parents an incomplete picture.","Private schools are ditching GCSEs in favour of tougher qualifications .
