"(CNN) -- The legendary rock band KISS becomes the next big act to make an extended stop in Las Vegas. The group, which is in the middle of a summer tour with Def Leppard, will play nine nights in The Joint at the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino Las Vegas in November. ""What happens in Vegas will not stay in Vegas, not if we have anything to do with it,"" KISS co-founder Gene Simmons said. ""We intend to blow the roof off the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino."" The Vegas miniresidency is a first for KISS, which is celebrating its 40th anniversary as a band. Extended stays in Las Vegas are proving profitable for a growing list of music acts, including Olivia Newton John and Britney Spears. Both singers have filled Vegas venues for weeks at a time this year. Britney Spears kicks off Las Vegas casino residency . KISS, known for its fireworks and over-the-top energy and volume, ""will unleash its signature elaborate set designs, jam-packed set list, intense pyrotechnics and much more for nine of the biggest shows in KISS performance history,"" the Hard Rock news release said. While KISS usually plays for tens of thousands of fans in arena and stadium shows, the Vegas shows will be much more intimate, with less than 4,000 seats. The schedule includes three shows a week for the first three weeks of November. Simmons, 64, and Paul Stanley, 62, have been with the band since it formed. Eric Singer first joined as drummer in 1991 and lead guitarist Tommy Thayer was added 12 years ago. Emotional night at Rock Hall of Fame Induction .

"(CNN) -- A day after 20 million gallons of water gushed out of an old, broken water main, UCLA had quite a mess on its hands Wednesday -- and it still was trying to figure out how big. Hundreds of vehicles were waterlogged and stranded. A famous basketball court might be ruined. ""We're nowhere near (figuring the cost) yet,"" UCLA Assistant Vice Chancellor Kelly Schmader said near the north side of campus, not far from where workers still were trying to stanch residual leaks in the damaged underground Los Angeles water pipe. ""Some of the facilities that have water in them, we're not able to make damage assessments yet."" The juncture of a 93-year-old water pipe and a 58-year-old pipe burst under famed Sunset Boulevard on Tuesday afternoon, city officials said, with the ensuing geyser sending an estimated 20 million gallons of water shooting into the sky and streaming into nearby open areas and buildings -- notably parts of the UCLA campus just to the south. No one was injured, but damage to some campus parking garages and athletic facilities was ""substantial,"" Schmader said. Water rushed into two underground parking facilities, he said. The school said Wednesday afternoon that 960 vehicles were still trapped inside. Those vehicles that aren't trapped appear to have some level of water damage, Schmader said. Most of the autos belonged to UCLA students, faculty and staff members who were on campus for the end of the summer session. ""I went back to my car to try and leave, and they told me that I couldn't leave the structure because it was flooded,"" a woman told CNN affiliate KTLA. ""And I walked to the side that was flooded, and I thought, 'So there goes my car.' "" Swift-water rescue crews with boats had to ferry away several stranded people Tuesday, and at least three motorists were rescued from the garages. A section of Sunset Boulevard remained closed Wednesday. City councilman Joe Buscaino said the goal was to have the road reopened by Friday. Workers pumped and pushed water out of the damaged facilities. At UCLA's Pauley Pavilion, the recently renovated home of the school's basketball, volleyball and gymnastics teams, 8 to 10 inches of water had collected on the Nell and John Wooden Court, the hoops surface named for the 10-time NCAA title-winning basketball coach and his wife. Water covers volleyball courts . Video from KTLA showed workers using machines and squeegees to dry the court and push water out of the arena. ""The court is showing signs of buckling and expansion right now. Whether we'll be able to save that court, I don't know,"" Schmader said. UCLA athletic director Dan Guerrero said in a written statement that he was confident the arena and court will be ready by the time basketball season begins in late October. The flooding comes just two years after UCLA completed a $136 million renovation of the arena. The John Wooden recreation center and the Arthur Ashe Student Health and Wellness Center were without power because their transformers, like the vehicles, were submerged in the parking garages, Schmader said. The J.D. Morgan Center, which houses the college's athletics hall of fame, also was waterlogged, with workers piling strips of wet carpet outside. UCLA academic and residential halls were not affected, and classes continued Wednesday. It's not clear what cause the burst. But it happened at a very bad time for the city and state. Drought-stricken California recently passed statewide water restrictions, and Gov. Jerry Brown declared a drought emergency in January. ""Unfortunately, we lost a lot of water -- around 35,000 gallons a minute -- which is not ideal in the worst drought in the city's history,"" Los Angeles City Councilman Paul Koretz said. ""So we ask everybody to try harder to conserve water."" Repair work on the pipe won't be completed Wednesday, but thanks to water rerouting, no one was out of water service because of the break, said Jeff Bray, superintendent of the city's Department of Water and Power. About 1,000 gallons a minute were still leaking from the pipe Wednesday afternoon, said Jim McDaniel of that agency. CNN's Sonya Hamasaki, Holly Yan, Steve Almasy and Stella Chan contributed to this report.","UCLA says 960 vehicles stranded in underground parking garages .

"(CNN) -- Bagpipes aren't a sound one readily associates with Greece. Yet along with the menacingly slow beat of a drum, they're the soundtrack of one of the country's more unusual historic tours. A small group, illuminated by gas lanterns, is standing at the foot of a medieval moat at the entrance to one of Europe's best-preserved medieval cities and a UNESCO World Heritage site -- the Old Town in Rhodes. A guide dressed as one of the Knights of Saint John is leading the tour, dredging up some of the island's more sinister history, including how Sultan Suleiman the Great used fallen bodies from his own army to cross the moat during the 1522 Siege of Rhodes. Experiencing the 'new' Greece . Perhaps even more surreal than this somewhat kitsch historical re-enactment is the fact that it was conceived by one of the island's most exclusive resorts: Lindian Village (Rhodes; +30 22440 35900; rooms from $213; Medieval Mystery Tour $203 per person). This year, the property launched a series of unique offerings under the heading ""Experience Greece."" Other excursions include a fishing expedition on a caique (a traditional wooden fishing boat), beauty treatments performed with natural Greek products (yogurt, honey and lemon) and wine tastings from small vineyards in the surrounding Dodecanese islands. Mariza Sviriadis, the hotel's managing director, says the idea came to her during the six-year economic crisis that brought much of the country to its knees. ""The whole of Greece, it was like a small war,"" she tells CNN. While many properties on the island reacted by pushing out all-inclusive packages -- essentially keeping tourists indoors and away from local businesses in dire need of cash -- Sviriadis decided to take the opposite approach. She launched ""Experience Greece"" to get guests out of the hotel, and to promote sites that, though deserving, had remained under the radar for far too long. ""I wanted to show that there was more to Greece than that, and more to Greece than feta cheese,"" she says. ""The crisis forced us to change the way we were thinking, and to get creative. Before, we could be a bit arrogant. Now, we have to be the best."" Nothing to lose . Sviriadis isn't alone. Throughout Greece, the recession is changing tourist offerings, giving them a new slant. ""The crisis is the best thing that happened to me,"" says Tina Kyriakis, founder of Alternative Athens (+30 6948 405 242; tours from $60 per person). Kyriakis worked in marketing for a multinational corporation before she was laid off in 2010. Two years later, she launched her own tourism company. Like Sviriadis, she noticed that tour offerings in Athens had been stuck in a rut. ""I looked around at what existed in Athens in terms of tourism and it was all very standard, very stereotypical, all 'ancient Athens',"" she says. ""There is so much more to Athens than just the ancient part. ""It's a very complicated city and you have to get under its skin to understand it and appreciate it. So that was the concept."" In addition to its quirky walking tours (among the most popular are a graffiti tour and a guided walk through the ""enchanted forests"" outside the city), the company pairs visitors with Athenian gourmets, who host four-course supper clubs in their apartments. She now hosts two tours a day, attracting up to 25 visitors at a time. If it weren't for Greece's economic slump, she says she might never have found the courage to start the venture. ""It was the kick in the butt I needed. I could either go back to the corporate world, which doesn't have a future in Greece any more, or I could do this. ""So I just jumped in and did it, because there was nothing I could lose."" Beyond the package vacation . There are many regions in Greece that package tour operators miss, regions that are only recently starting to find their voice. The island of Milos is a case in point. Sure, it's home to Phylakopi, a bronze-aged settlement that lays claim to being one of Europe's oldest cities. It also possesses a history of mineral extraction that would set any geologist's heart aflutter and is where the Venus de Milo was uncovered. Yet it has been largely overlooked by tour operators, low-cost airlines and visitors alike. ""We're not that kind of destination. We have small family-run hotels that focus on service and quality rather than volume,"" says Antonis Mallis, who runs boutique travel agency Travel Me to Milos (+30 22870 41008; packages from $40 per person per day). ""We don't have hotels where you can go in and sell, sell, sell. ""That's why tour operators don't like us that much. We're a headache. Mallis started his company in 2011 after leaving a lucrative position at an insurance company to return to his home island. ""The majority said, 'are you crazy? You're leaving a very good, well-paying job for something like this?'"" Mallis recognized that Milos had a lot to offer travelers: ancient thermal baths, underwater caves, an old pirate lair, third-century catacombs decorated with Christian murals. He also recognized that no one was talking up the island's assets, or making them accessible. ""It's easy to go online and get a cheap room. It's not easy to get in-depth knowledge of a destination. ""If someone contacts us, we can tell them where to go, or which way the wind is blowing that day."" Mallis supplies more than weather updates. His specialty is archeology and geological tours, which highlight some of the island's incredible scenery. He's also teamed up with other vendors on the island to offer a range of sailing and hiking expeditions. He recently introduced cooking lessons that showcase the island's local cheese and produce. ""As a young boy, I'd remember seeing the odd, small German group walking around the island, but that was it. Now, we have something more organized, we're reaching more markets, and we're seeing progress,"" he says. Other tours . Other examples of off-the-beaten path experiences abound, many introduced by local companies launched in the last few years. Eumelia .

"(CNN) -- This might sound like a legal conundrum: . A Florida jury has pronounced George Zimmerman not guilty of murdering Trayvon Martin. But a court could still hold him accountable for the death. Martin's family so far has only commented that it wants the public to respect the Florida court's verdict. Two options, however, are available: A civil suit, or a civil rights suit. Though they sound similar, they are very different. A civil suit allows one party to seek monetary damages against another for causing physical or emotional harm, regardless of the outcome of a criminal trial. A civil rights suit involves criminal charges for violating someone's civil rights, which are protected under federal law. Feds are asked to act . Civil suit . Take what happened to O.J. Simpson 17 years ago. After a criminal court acquitted him of charges in the 1994 killing of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson, a civil court held him responsible in 1997 for her ""wrongful death."" It ordered him to pay her family more than $33 million in damages. Various courts then stripped Simpson of every asset they could get their hands on. Wrongful death is easier to prove than murder or manslaughter. A defendant can be held liable, even if he or she didn't intend to cause the victim's death, according to Florida law. Simple negligence is enough, if it results in death. Did Zimmerman act negligently, when he exited his vehicle to pursue Martin on foot while carrying a gun -- although a 911 operator told him not to? Would the 17-year-old still be alive if Zimmerman had not done so? Those are questions a lawyer for Martin's family would be sure to ask in a wrongful death suit. Martin's family has so given no indication so far of wanting to pursue an additional suit. But someone else has. Trayvon's dad: My heart is broken, my faith is not . Civil rights suit . The NAACP is pushing the U.S. Department of Justice to file a civil rights suit. They accuse Zimmerman of racial profiling that led to Martin's death -- an allegation that Zimmerman, his family and his supporters have denied. Analysis: The role that race played . ""The most fundamental of civil rights -- the right to life -- was violated the night George Zimmerman stalked and then took the life of Trayvon Martin,"" the group said. NAACP President Benjamin Jealous told CNN's ""State of the Union"" on Sunday that remarks made by Zimmerman and people who live in his Sanford, Florida, neighborhood had sparked the group's concern. ""When you look at (Zimmerman's) comments, and when you look at comments made by young black men who lived in that neighborhood about how they felt especially targeted by him, there is reason to be concerned that race was a factor in why he targeted young Trayvon,"" Jealous said. The NAACP leader's allegations drew sharp criticism Sunday from Robert Zimmerman Jr., who argued that FBI interviews have already shown that his brother isn't racist. ""I don't think (Jealous) does anything for civil rights by perpetuating a narrative that has now been proven false. ... They've investigated I think about three dozen of his closest friends and acquaintances. And there is not any inkling of racism. In fact, there's evidence to show the opposite,"" he said. ""I would encourage them to cool their jets, give everyone some time to kind of process what's going on. Agitation doesn't help us. It doesn't do anybody any good right now."" The Rev. Jesse Jackson told CNN's ""New Day"" on Sunday that his Rainbow PUSH Coalition also wants the Justice Department to look into possible civil rights violations in the case. ""There's a Trayvon in every town,"" he said. ""That's why the Department of Justice has a role to play, to look at this pattern, because equal protection under the law remains elusive."" The Justice Department did not respond directly to the NAACP demand. It has a separate federal investigation going on. ""Experienced federal prosecutors will determine whether the evidence reveals a prosecutable violation of any of the limited federal criminal civil rights statutes within our jurisdiction, and whether federal prosecution is appropriate in accordance with the department's policy governing successive federal prosecution following a state trial,"" it said in a Sunday statement. It's a legal path that worked in the case of Rodney King, whom Los Angeles police officers clubbed down in 1991 after a car chase. The beating of the African-American man was caught on video and later aired on news broadcasts. When a criminal court failed to convict the white officers of police brutality, riots ensued in Los Angeles over alleged racial discrimination. The Justice Department filed a civil rights suit against the officers, alleging racial profiling, and two were convicted in 1993 as a result. A court sentenced them to 30 months in federal prison. CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet and Jessica Yellin contributed to this report.","NEW: The Justice Department says it has an ongoing civil rights investigation .

"(CNN) -- The phone call was short, and not at all sweet. ""Do you weigh more than 160 pounds?"" the voice on the other end asked Karyna Douglass. ""Yeah, I know I do,"" she replied. And that was it. Douglass' call to the local Navy recruiting center lasted less than five minutes. ""I felt horrible,"" she remembers. ""I thought maybe I could change that. I didn't realize how big I actually was."" It was on a whale-watching trip to celebrate her 22nd birthday that Douglass first toyed with the idea of joining the military. She noticed her fellow passengers on the boat were really enamored with the Coast Guardsmen patrolling nearby. At the time, Douglass was working a part-time job in Portland, Oregon. She wasn't having any luck getting student loans to go back to school and was having serious issues with her family. To deal with it, she turned to food, eating fast food during the day and binging on candy when she got home at night. Chocolate was her drug of choice. Sometimes with a side of ice cream. ""I was realizing that the people who you thought were going to be there for you weren't at all,"" she says. ""I felt trapped."" The 5-foot-7 22-year-old weighed 300 pounds. After the painful phone call, Douglass started running every night around her neighborhood. A few months later she went to the Navy recruiting center in person. As she was about to enter, an Army recruiter from the next office over called out to her. It was the first time Douglass had ever seen a soldier up close. ""I just sort of stared,"" she says with a laugh, as the recruiter told her about their morning workout program for potential enlistees. She dragged a friend to the first training session. They started by running laps, then moved on to push-ups. Douglass left shortly after the warm-up. ""It doesn't sound like much now, but at that point, oh my God, it made me throw up,"" she says. The friends went to get milkshakes to make themselves feel better. It was two weeks before Douglass gathered the courage to go back. No one from the Army called her. Her friend didn't push. ""I just thought, if I'm really serious I have to give it a shot."" She worked out with the group every day that week, Monday through Thursday. It was hard, but she realized she could do it. Douglass started waking up at 4 a.m. every day to take a bus to the group's morning workout. They run 2.5 to 4 miles, and then she heads to the gym before going to work. On Tuesdays and Thursdays she takes the bus back for an afternoon workout of jumping jacks, mountain climbers and push-ups. She also overhauled her diet, cutting out fast food, fried food and soda, and limiting her candy intake. Every week she tries a new diet to keep it interesting -- one week she avoids carbohydrates; another week she skips meat. A year and three months later, Douglass has lost 110 pounds. She was sworn into the Army on December 12. ""I fell in love with their world,"" she told CNN affiliate KPTV. ""I fell in love with the bonds that I created with these people. I fell in love for what they stand for."" It wasn't always easy. There were days when she would call Sgt. Cody Baker, the Future Soldier Leader, and quit. ""I would go months without losing weight. It was so frustrating,"" she says. ""I remember ... just saying, 'I can't do this. I'm never going to be small enough.'"" But Baker never gave up on her. Neither did Douglass' friends and roommates, who encouraged her to stay on track. Today, Douglass is ""literally a walking Army billboard."" Her clothes, her room and her accessories are all advertisements for her new family. She's looking forward to basic training, and plans to drop another 20 pounds. Her advice to others who want to lose weight? Lie to yourself. ""You love this feeling. You love being tired. You love being sore. Because in the end, you will.""

"Washington (CNN) -- Vice President Joe Biden faces a very delicate task this week as he makes a diplomatic visit to East Asia in hopes of turning down the volume on an increasingly noisy territorial tug of war. The spotlight also provides Biden with an opportunity to remind people why Barack Obama chose him as his running mate and to tout his strong suit as he's mentioned as a possible presidential candidate in 2016. Biden promises to press China on airspace dispute . Biden has decades of experience in international relations. He served as chairman or the ranking Democrat of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee from 1997 until he left Congress in 2008 following Obama's victory. ""This trip, if nothing else, reinforces the notion of why Joe Biden was put on the ticket in the first place and has emerged as one of the best vice presidents in history,"" Larry Rasky, a longtime senior political adviser to the Democrat, told CNN. ""He was equipped for this job before he got there. He's not going to China for that reason, of course, but it certainly doesn't hurt."" ""It's definitely his wheelhouse. He has the relationships, the global credibility. There's no on-the-job training necessary."" Biden flies in to diplomatic turbulence in Asia . The long-planned trip, which was originally to focus on economic issues, comes as tensions in East Asia are on the rise. ""The Vice President's trip comes at an important time for the country and therefore it makes him that more relevant and reminds Americans of his longtime role in the Senate and his experience with foreign policy,"" Stuart Rothenberg, editor and publisher of the non-partisan Rothenberg Political Report, told CNN. China's air defense zone: What you need to know . Biden's first stop was Tokyo, where longtime ally Japan and the United States are pushing back against China's recent declaration of a restricted flight zone over parts of the East China Sea that include some islands claimed by both China and Japan. In a meeting on Tuesday with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Biden said the United States was ""deeply concerned by the attempt to unilaterally change the status quo in the East China Sea."" Biden reaffirmed that ""the United States looks to our alliance with Japan as the cornerstone of stability and security in East Asia, and we are fully committed to our announced strategy of rebalancing as well in the Pacific,"" according to a White House transcript of the meeting. And in an interview with the Ashai daily newspaper, Biden rejected concerns that the United States may not have staying power in the region, saying ""economically, diplomatically, militarily, we have been, we are, and we will remain a resident Pacific power."" The White House highlighted Biden's experience in global diplomacy on Monday. ""He has an excellent relationship with the leaders of all three countries and he will underscore how important it is to avoid actions that raise tensions and to prevent miscalculations that could undermine peace, security and prosperity in the region,"" White House Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters. In Japan, Biden promises to press China on airspace dispute . ""This is an opportunity for Vice President Biden to raise our concerns directly with policy makes in Beijing and to seek clarity in regarding the Chinese intentions in making this move at this time. It's also an opportunity for us to confer with our allies, Japan and the Republic of Korea, both of whom are directly affected by China's actions,"" Carney added. Rasky said the most important thing for Biden right now, as it relates to any possible White House run in 2016, is to continue to serve as a strong No. 2. ""The main thing that the Vice President has to do is do his job, and do it well,"" Rasky added. Biden has not said whether he'll make a third run for the Democratic presidential nomination following unsuccessful bids in 1988 and 2008. ""I can die a happy man never having been president of the United States of America. But it doesn't mean I won't run,"" Biden said in a July interview with GQ magazine. His trip in September to Iowa, the state that traditionally kicks off the presidential primary and caucus calendar, sparked more speculation about his ambitions. Biden, who went to the Hawkeye State to headline Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin's annual steak fry, a must stop for Democratic White House hopefuls, joked, ""It's amazing when you come to speak at the steak fry, a whole lot of people seem to take notice. I don't know why the hell that is."" Most of the speculation about possible 2016 Democratic candidates is focused on whether former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will run again. All polling suggests Clinton would be the immediate and overwhelming frontrunner for the nomination if she does. The most recent national survey on a potential Democratic field came from CNN/ORC International two weeks ago and indicated that 63% of Democrats and Independents who lean towards the Democratic Party said Clinton was their early choice for the nomination, with Biden second at 12%. CNN 2016 poll: Clinton favored for Democrats . But how would the race for the Democratic nomination shape up if Clinton forgoes another run for the White House? Hillary Clinton and the sisterhood . If that's the case, the poll suggested that 43% of Democrats would support the Vice President, with freshman Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts at 17%, and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo at 15%. Of course, polls conducted this early in an election cycle, far before any possible contenders have declared their candidacy, are partially a reflection of name recognition. And Biden of course, has a lot of name recognition. Crossfire: Support for Biden, Christie in 2016 . While the headlines this week from Biden's trip will add to that name recognition and further beef up his foreign policy and commander-in-chief credentials, Biden has a problem if Clinton runs again. ""Clearly, Joe Biden is not an amateur when it comes to U.S. foreign policy, but unfortunately for him former Secretary of State Hillary's Clinton's experience in that realm trumps his,"" Rothenberg added.","Asia trip gives Biden opportunity to remind people why Obama chose him as running mate .

"(CNN) -- When it comes to competing on ""The Bachelorette,"" you can't blame a guy for trying. And try runner-up Nick Viall did -- by slipping a letter to Andi Dorfman after she had selected contestant Josh Murray to receive her final rose. Following Monday's finale in which Dorfman dumped Viall, much was made about the letter he had written to her after their breakup. The letter has now gone viral after the show posted it on its Facebook page. In it, Viall pours out his feelings for Dorfman. ""You lit me up,"" he wrote. ""You made me feel those things that people go a lifetime to find, and I feel like I made you feel the same."" Viall continued, ""I fully realize that in the end I could have been wrong about what we had. While it's hard to accept, I totally realize that it's a possibility. With that being said, when I think about the relationship that we had, very few things in my life have felt more real."" Not at all awkward, given that Dorfman is now engaged to Murray, right? Viall let it be known that if that relationship doesn't work out, Dorfman still has a shot with him -- though he made no promises about a happy ending. Rather, he said, he was ""not going to say that if by some miracle you changed your mind and were willing to give us a shot that we would definitely make it. I don't know that."" ""I think that if we were willing to trust each other, be totally vulnerable with one another, and follow our hearts, we would have a great chance,"" Viall wrote. ""What I could promise you is that if we did make it, we would be anything but good. It would be exciting, sometimes even hard, but definitely great."" The Chicago-based businessman has proven to be a contestant who is willing to share. During the ""After the Final Rose"" ceremony, Viall appeared to break the unspoken ""Bachelorette/Bachelor"" code of revealing that he and Dorfman had been intimate during their fantasy suite time. At least Viall ended his letter on a hopeful note. ""I realize I have to move on and I mean it when I say that if you're truly happy with your decision and I haven't been a thought on your mind, then I want that happiness to continue for you,"" he wrote.

"(CNN) -- The string of attacks at the University of Florida in the past two weeks has sparked terrible memories of a week in August 1990 that sent a tsunami of fear through the student population and the city of Gainesville. Unlike the most recent attempted assaults around campus, the victims in 1990 didn't have a chance. For five students that year, assaults ended in dismemberment and death. The first attack happened the Sunday before school started. Gainesville police were called to check on two students in their apartment. When they arrived, the scene horrified them. Both Christina Powell and Sonja Larson had been stabbed to death, one of them mutilated, her body posed in a sexually explicit manner. Within 72 hours, five students were fatally stabbed, the crime scenes staged for dramatic effect. Police soon surmised Gainesville had a serial killer in its midst and it appeared University of Florida students were his targets. I was a freshman back then and remember students being pulled out of school by their parents, who feared their children would be the killer's next victim. The killer was entering students' apartments, usually through sliding glass doors, as people slept. Police said he was likely stalking his prey and was very meticulous, staging crime scenes and cleaning them up to avoid detection. There was a sense that no one was safe at night. Every day the killer roamed free and gruesome details surfaced, a wave of fear swept across the city. Gun stores began selling out, students traveled in groups or left campus entirely. The university even offered to reimburse tuition for those too afraid to return. Eventually, we all learned and memorized the names of the five students killed: Sonja Larson, Christina Powell, Christa Leigh Hoyt, Tracy Paules and Manny Taboada. After Taboada was killed, fear increased, because it became clear men would not be spared and were just as vulnerable. By the time the killer was caught and about to go to trial, I was nearing graduation. It happened that as a student journalist working at the university television and radio station, I ended up covering the trial. I was among those allowed to view the crime scene photos that were entered into evidence. I have never been able to get those scenes out of my head. The worst: a picture of a victim's body on a bed with her severed head staring down from a bookshelf. It is the stuff of nightmares. They were haunting, purposely theatrical photos that were pornographic in nature due to the positioning of the bodies. All of them seemed to be scenes from a horror film too gruesome to make. ""I was here then,"" University of Florida Vice President of Student Affairs Dave Kratzer said of those difficult days in 1990. ""This community came together, unified and I really think that the closeness that was forged during that terrible time really is what you are seeing today."" This is a campus that never forgets. Long after serial killer Danny Rolling confessed to the killings and was executed by the state in 2006, a memorial to the five students he killed remains.","A serial killer struck the University of Florida campus in 1990 .

"(CNN) -- When I was a child, a pale specter used to call our house most evenings, eager to chat with my doctor father about her myriad medical concerns. We called her the ""White Bread Lady,"" a moniker she earned for one particularly inane call in which she panicked to my father after consuming white bread. She wasn't breaking out in hives or having any adverse effects to the bread. No, she was just concerned that some future illness could befall her given that one particular dietary decision. Although we all laughed at the time, it was with a bit of shifty-eyed shame. Because most of us (including if not particularly the illustrious Ehrlich family) have lurking within us our very own ""White Bread Lady,"" ready to convince us that each cough, sniffle and less-than-nutritious meal might be a detriment to our health. And, naturally, that White Bread Lady looms even larger when we can type our worries into a search bar and unlock a bevy of potentially distressing information. Yup, so quoth Google, we all have cancer. According to a recent report from the Pew Research Center, 80% of Internet users have looked up health information online. While that practice can be beneficial in some respects, the abundance of (variably valid) information online can turn us into e-hypochondriacs. (Or, worse, can lead us to neglect getting the care we need.) Read on for five mistakes -- courtesy of a selection of health-care professionals -- that people make when diagnosing themselves online. Searching blind . Your eye is twitching like an overly caffeinated college student sitting behind a pretty girl in lecture hall, twirling his pencil and hoping to catch a whiff of her lovely shining hair. You type ""eye twitch"" into Google and come up with a really rad website that explains that this newfound spasm is actually an indication that your third eye is fixing to open, revealing to you wonders untold. You are the chosen one. Too bad that this trove of ""medical information"" is actually some dude's fan-fiction site. Long wait at the doctor's office? Blame the patients . Sure, the above is an extreme example, but, as Dr. Kevin Pho of KevinMD.com pointed out, ""There's a lot of bad information on the Web and information that can be dangerous."" Especially if you're not considering who put up that information in the first place. Pho urges users to favor Web addresses ending in .org and .edu when looking for reputable health-care info, and to check who is funding the collection of that information. ""There's so much information from organizations trying to sell products or push their agenda on the Web,"" he said. He suggests turning to sites like Mayo Clinic as well as troves of information curated by doctors (like Pho's own website) when trolling the Web for info. And, of course, if a site mentions trolls and third eyes, one should definitely press on. Flailing in forums . If there's one thing people like to do online, it's talk about their problems -- especially mundane things like coughs and headaches and their babies' various and sundry discharges. And, it seems, we're pretty interested in reading about the health issues of others, too. According to that Pew study, 23% of social-network users have followed a friend's health experiences online, and 34% of Internet users have read about someone else's medical issues on newsgroups, websites or blogs. That's all well and good; sharing experiences with others is enriching! Unless the people you're sharing with are idiots. Case in point: Here's a Yahoo Answers thread in which folks are discussing whether you can make a pregnancy test out of bleach and Pine-Sol. (Spoiler alert: You can't.) ""You can easily fall into that rabbit hole and find some forum that really isn't relevant but maybe sounds kind of close,"" warned Craig Monsen, co-founder of symptom-checker app SymCat and fourth-year medical student at Johns Hopkins University. On the other hand, ""sometimes you'll stumble on exactly the right forum where someone has your same exact problem, and their solution does help."" Doctor-turned-kayaker fights malaria in Uganda . ""Health-care forums are definitely another tool that individuals can use in order to crowdsource a diagnosis based on their symptoms,"" added Dr. Natasha Burgert of KC Kids Doc. ""I think that these can be a really powerful tool not only for discussing potential diagnosis or symptom relief but also finding a forum of individuals in which you can discuss emotional and psychological parts of an illness and develop a wonderful online support community."" The trick is to be wary about the issues being discussed in forums and how germane they are to you. And, you know, if people start talking about homemade remedies fashioned from bleach, maybe click off and see a doc. Getting emotional . You know that game ""6 Degrees of Kevin Bacon""? There should seriously be a version of that called ""6 Degrees of Cancer"" -- as in, when looking up your symptoms online, how long does it take to deduce that you have a life-threatening disease instead of, say, a simple cold? According to Burgert, the root of this whole ""worst-case scenario"" thing is getting too emotional. ""For most intents and purposes, when you're looking for online health information, it's about yourself or a family member,"" she said. ""When you're looking through that lens, it's very hard to keep emotional distance. So you can read about a diagnosis that either makes you very scared or calms your fears -- and that's the path you'll continue down, whether it's correct or not."" Burgert suggested using online symptom checkers simply to ""understand possible diagnoses, find some initial steps for relieving the symptoms and determine if this is something that needs further evaluation or that can be managed at home."" SymCat and Mayo Clinic's symptom checker let you type in what you're experiencing and unearth a spectrum of diagnoses and suggestions for when to seek a doctor's aid. Your doctor's website might also have such a tool. Voila, you just increased your separation from cancer by at least a couple of degrees. Keeping mum around MDs . ""I think, traditionally, many physicians are a little apprehensive when that stereotypical patient comes to their office with big stacks of printouts from the Internet,"" Pho said. ""But I think more and more doctors are accepting it. Personally, I think that transparency of information is helpful in a way."" Translation: Help your doctor help you. If you're worried about a particular medical situation and did some research to help narrow down what's ailing you, share that info with your physician. ""I really appreciate when patients bring in information that they found online, because it allows me to guide my instruction and plan based on their true concerns,"" Burgert said. ""People get scared when they get sick and hurt, and they want to use multiple sources of information to help themselves. The Internet adds to that physician's expertise in order to do that."" Study: Fainting may have genetic link . Pho suggests using tracking apps (Bloodnote and Tap & Track are a few examples) to keep tabs on blood pressure, weight, heart rate and other areas that are of particular concern to you and your MD. ""These apps and sites give patients so much data about themselves that they never had before,"" he said. And a log is useful to your doctor, who can scan for abnormalities and patterns that you may have missed. Remember, though, knowing how to use the Internet doesn't make you a doctor. Google doesn't count as a second opinion. If you're unhappy with your doc's diagnosis, go get one the traditional way. Putting off the inevitable . If your ailment isn't going away, all the symptom-checking and Mayo Clinic-ing in the world isn't going to help you. Make a doctor's appointment. Like, right now. Sites like ZocDoc make it super easy (and free; doctors pay to be listed) to set up an appointment ASAP, so no whining that you'll have to wait two weeks to see a doc and maybe by then ""it"" will have gone away. Unless, of course, ""it"" is that white bread you just ate. In that case, please stop calling my dad.","According to a Pew report, 80% of Internet users have looked up health info online .
Sites like Mayo Clinic and others curated by doctors are safer .
It's better to be cautious in online forums of non-experts .

"(CNN) -- The mayor of Cambridge, Massachusetts, said she is going to meet with the city's police chief to make sure the scenario that caused the arrest of a prominent black Harvard University professor does not happen again. Harvard University professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. says he and his attorneys are considering further actions. ""This suggests that something happened that should not have happened,"" Cambridge Mayor E. Denise Simmons said on CNN's ""American Morning."" ""The situation is certainly unfortunate. This can't happen again in Cambridge."" Harvard scholar Henry Louis Gates Jr. was arrested last week at his home after a confrontation with an officer investigating a possible break-in, according to a Cambridge police report. Cambridge authorities on Tuesday dropped disorderly conduct charges against Gates. Responding to a reporter's question on Gates' arrest, President Obama said Wednesday night the Cambridge police ""acted stupidly.""  Watch Obama's reaction » . Obama defended Gates while admitting that he may be ""a little biased"" because the professor is a friend of his. ""But I think it's fair to say, No. 1, any of us would be pretty angry; No. 2, that the Cambridge police acted stupidly in arresting somebody when there was already proof that they were in their own home; and, No. 3 ... that there's a long history in this country of African-Americans and Latinos being stopped by law enforcement disproportionately.""  Was the professor profiled? » . The incident shows ""how race remains a factor in this society,"" Obama said. Obama's remarks are being questioned by Senate Republicans, whose campaign arm is paying for a Web ad asking whether it is appropriate for the president to say Cambridge police acted stupidly. The ad will run on the Drudge Report. ""This isn't taking sides between the police officers and Mr. Gates,"" said Brian Walsh, spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee. ""It is the issue of whether it is appropriate for the president of the United States to be weighing in and taking sides before, by his own admission, all the facts are known."" White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said Thursday that Obama doesn't regret his comments. Obama ""was not calling the [arresting] officer stupid. The situation got out of hand,"" Gibbs said. Gates said on Wednesday that although charges were dropped, he will keep the issue alive. ""This is not about me; this is about the vulnerability of black men in America,"" Gates told CNN's Soledad O'Brien. Gates said the mayor called him to apologize. Simmons, Cambridge's first black female mayor, confirmed that she apologized to Gates.  Watch how the mayor is handling the incident » . Gates said he'd be prepared to forgive the arresting officer ""if he told the truth"" about what the scholar called ""fabrications"" in the police report. The officer, Sgt. James Crowley, told CNN affiliate WCVB-TV in Boston, Massachusetts, on Wednesday that he will not apologize. ""There are not many certainties in life, but it is for certain that Sgt. Crowley will not be apologizing,"" he said. Crowley wrote in the Cambridge police report that Gates refused to step outside to speak with him, the police report said. When Crowley told Gates that he was investigating a possible break-in, Gates opened the front door and exclaimed, ""Why, because I'm a black man in America?"" the report said. The report said Gates initially refused to show the officer identification but eventually produced a Harvard identification card, prompting Crowley to radio for Harvard police. Gates is director of Harvard's W.E.B. Du Bois Institute for African and African American Research. ""While I was led to believe that Gates was lawfully in the residence, I was quite surprised and confused with the behavior he exhibited toward me,"" Crowley said, according to the report. iReport.com: ""Shame"" on Gates . Gates was arrested for ""loud and tumultuous behavior in a public space"" and was released from police custody after spending four hours at the police station. Gates said Wednesday that he and his attorneys were considering further actions, not excluding a lawsuit. Gates said that although the ordeal had upset him, ""I would do the same thing exactly again."" Earlier this week, a prosecutor dropped the charge against Gates and the Police Department recommended the matter not be pursued.","Cambridge, Massachusetts, mayor says she'll talk to police chief about arrest .

"San Diego (CNN) -- When the worlds of federal bureaucracies and public schools collide, what results is often a teaching moment for all involved. The Obama administration has unleashed two Cabinet departments to get tough on teachers and other school personnel who -- through so-called ""zero tolerance"" policies -- often refer disciplinary cases to police. What concerns folks at the Justice and Education departments is that African-American and Latino students might be singled out for suspension and other forms of discipline, in ways that could amount to outright racial and ethnic discrimination. Their proposed solution is called the Supportive School Discipline Initiative, which seeks to limit student suspensions and expulsions and provide ""alternative best practices such as restorative justice, peer mediation and positive behavioral supports."" The initiative was unveiled in 2011. But last week, the administration went so far as to lay out specific guidelines for states and even individual school districts. The administration will propose $50 million in grants to more than 1,000 schools to train teachers and staff in strategies aimed at improving student behavior and improving the climate of schools. Upon hearing all this, memory takes me back to a junior high school in a small, largely Mexican and Mexican-American farming town in Central California, where I found myself, in the years after college, trying to support my writing habit by working as a substitute teacher. I had a long-term assignment, about three months, teaching a ""special education"" course that was being misused as a dumping ground for rowdy and disruptive kids with behavioral problems. Almost all the kids in the class were Hispanic. The regular teacher, a 60-something woman with a kind disposition and white hair, was in poor health and on a prolonged absence. One day, I was looking for a lesson plan in the teacher's desk and ran across some diary-like notes that the teacher had written -- probably in case she needed them someday. Her problem kid was an angry 13-year-old Hispanic young man named ""Martin."" They apparently had a running conflict, and, one day, the teacher had scribbled down in her notes: ""Martin called me a white @#$%&, and said he was going to hurt me."" Welcome to the real world of public schools in America, which bears no resemblance to what they teach you at schools of education or university-run teacher credentialing programs. When students such as Martin act up or get out of line, they have to be disciplined. They have to get in trouble, pay a price and be taught that they simply can't go through life disrupting their environment and threatening authority figures. We can debate what the punishment should be, but there have to be consequences. No ""if's,"" ""and's"" or ""but's."" It's for his own good. Let's say you give him a pass. What's going to happen the first time he's on the street and mouths off to a cop? Also, note the part about how Martin allegedly called this nice, elderly woman ""a white @#$%&."" From my experience, that's also very common. We'll hear advocates for students talk about how teachers sometimes harbor prejudices against students, and there is no doubt that this is true. But we don't hear much about what happens when the shoe is on the other foot. Go into any inner-city high school in America, and you'll hear African-American and Hispanic students using racial slurs when talking about teachers and administrators. It goes with the territory. This isn't to say that there isn't any discrimination in the doling out of school discipline, or that this isn't a subject worthy of more study. They might well be, and it certainly is. Yet, this initiative could also backfire on the administration by micromanaging our schools, undermining the authority of teachers and teaching African-American and Latino students to see themselves as victims. Besides, throwing two Cabinet departments at the problem is a serious case of overkill. How is this for a new approach? If we really want to help students who get in trouble, why don't we stop meddling in the schools and start dealing with those societal factors -- such as poverty, despair and broken homes -- that help these young people get into trouble in the first place? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette.","Ruben Navarrette: Obama administration has targeted ""zero tolerance policies""

"(CNN) -- Three people were killed and several more were wounded in a shooting at a town supervisors' meeting in eastern Pennsylvania, officials said Monday night. Earlier, Pennsylvania State Police said four people were killed, but later revised that number. The shooting broke out around 7:30 p.m. ET at the Ross Township building in Saylorsburg, about 75 miles north of Philadelphia, Monroe County Emergency Management Director Guy Miller told CNN. Police identified the suspect as Rockne Newell of Saylorsburg. Newell was among those shot and was being treated at Pocono Medical Center Monday night. Police said exactly how he was shot is under investigation. State police Lt. Robert Bartel said Newell had an ongoing dispute with officials involving the condemnation of his property and issues with his sewer. Bartel said it's not clear whether Newell knew any of the victims shot. Ross Township's three-member Board of Supervisors meets the first Monday night of the month at the township's municipal building. Monroe County Commissioner Suzanne McCool said it was ""the quietest township in Monroe County."" ""They are never in the newspaper,"" McCool said. She said she knew of no controversial issues before the supervisors. ""They are the only township in Monroe County that hasn't had a tax increase in many, many years,"" she said.

"(CNN) -- Looking for a vacation that will shock all five of your senses? Anthony Bourdain can help. Season 4 of ""Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown"" starts in the fall. In the meantime, here are seven ideas drawn from some of his best adventures. Brave a bullfight in Spain . Bourdain paid a visit to La Marquesas Ranch, the private bullring of star matador David Fandila -- who is professionally known as El Fandi. El Fandi, one of the world's top bullfighters, is as known for his courage as he is for his flashy antics in the ring. You probably won't get personal pointers from El Fandi, but just witnessing this spectacle can be breathtaking. Although many consider bullfighting an art, the sport is not without controversy. Many are morally opposed to what they consider taunting and brutally slaughtering an animal in a very public arena. The ethical debate is a hot-button issue frequently debated in Spanish Parliament . ""To see Spain, to see it straight, to understand it at all, you should probably peek -- if only through spread fingers -- at that most Spanish of traditions, bull fighting,"" said Bourdain. ""There is no denying the terrible beauty of a very complex tradition. The matadors were the original rock stars, the very ideal of masculinity, male beauty and grace."" You may never set foot in a bullring, but you can shout ""Â¡OlÃ©!"" from the sidelines if you find yourself in Spain. The bullrings in Granada, Ronda and Madrid will get you started. Sing the blues in Mississippi . Before he started traveling around the world, Anthony Bourdain admits that he never would have considered visiting Mississippi. But his dim view of the very Deep South soon widened into a love for a very special part of his own country. Especially what he considers the United States' ""most powerful and persuasive export and gift to the world"": The blues. Mississippi's poverty means regular renovations generally aren't a top priority. But the rustic atmosphere is part of the Delta's charm. Many places where the blues are performed look exactly the same today as they did more than a half-century ago. ""The blues, rock 'n' roll, R&B, soul and funk, all came out of this place. One state. Mississippi,"" said Bourdain. If you feel like venturing to the Delta this summer, check out Po' Monkey's and other spots along the Mississippi Blues Trail and stop at The Senator's Place for soul food nibbles. Getting to know the Mississippi Delta . Take a gamble in Sin City . If you're willing to peek behind the facade, you can experience Bourdain's Las Vegas -- a Sin City remarkably void of Elvis impersonators, migraine-inducing bright lights and spinning reels of slot machine fruit. When Bourdain visited Las Vegas in Season 3, he experienced a city that few people see. He saw the polar opposites of the spectrum: From the ultra-exclusive Villa at Caesars Palace and a nightclub whose patrons drop thousands of dollars on drinks in a single evening, to a local tavern and an eatery dripping with old Vegas charm far, far off the beaten path of the Strip. ""Sinatra and the mob are gone, but there remains, still, a certain sentimental attachment to the way things used to be. There were rules then. A way that things were done. And when they weren't done, there was always the desert and a hole in the ground,"" Bourdain said. If you want to roll the dice on a different kind of experience, try local favorites like the Huntridge Tavern, the Bootlegger Bistro, Lotus of Siam and Raku. 10 things you didn't know about Las Vegas . Go gun-slinging out West . With a stunning landscape and big open sky, many people gravitate to the state some refer to as the Land of Enchantment. A large Native American population, a hippie influx that began in the 1970s and the largest Hispanic population per capita in the United States give New Mexico a unique American cultural blend. It was in New Mexico that Bourdain explored the Western cowboy mystique. With its relaxed gun laws, target shooting is an option for a fun outing with friends. Some children receive rite-of-passage rifles the same way other kids get baseball bats. ""We are a gun culture. The expression of American power and identity has always been the lone cowboy with a gun. That goes deep. This is the heart of the American dream. Love it or hate it, this is it,"" Bourdain said. Get a taste of New Mexico's culture -- with care. The Shooting Range Park is operated by the City of Albuquerque, providing ""an alternative to illegal firearm practice on our mesas, open spaces and vacant areas,"" according to its website. 10 things to know before visiting New Mexico . Sleigh ride in St. Petersburg . Lovely weather for a sleigh ride may be a few months off, but it's never too early to plan ahead. Bourdain traveled to Russia and filmed an episode with his longtime friend/drinking buddy Zamir Gotta. At one point, they toured the wintry terrain outside of St. Petersburg on a traditional troika, a sleigh pulled by a team of three horses. Bundled in blankets and sipping vodka from flasks, they rode through the countryside where the city's wealthiest residents have their country homes, or dachas, and Emperor Paul built his 18th-century home. ""The rest of Russia is very, very different than Moscow,"" Bourdain said. ""I mean (in Moscow), you drive around, and it's like Bentley, Ferrari, Maserati, you know. You go to buy a pair of shoes, you pick up a Bentley on the way out."" Near Saint Petersburg, you can experience a more traditional side of Russia with a troika ride -- flasks optional. Try rides in Pavlovsk Park or through the grounds of Catherine Palace. Ride a human-powered Ferris wheel in Southeast Asia . In the very first episode of ""Parts Unknown,"" Bourdain explored Myanmar. While the government has relaxed some of its hold of the Southeast Asian nation, it's still controlled by a military regime. At one of the evening street fairs in Yangon, Bourdain happened upon a human-powered Ferris wheel. Powering the wheel requires its operators -- flip-flop-clad local teenage boys -- to move quickly through the structure, making it turn with the weight and momentum of their bodies . An ""absolutely insanely dangerous, closely choreographed process,"" Bourdain said. If, unlike Bourdain, you'd like to give a human-powered Ferris wheel a whirl, the rides can be found at night markets and street fairs throughout Southeast Asia and southern India. Take a midnight train goin' anywhere . The night train to St. Petersburg is one of the most fun things to do in Russia, Bourdain said. Rolling through dark, snow-covered birch forests, he and Zamir enjoyed caviar, pickled herring, and of course, vodka. In stark contrast, he also took the night train to Myanmar's ancient capital of Bagan. The 20-plus hour journey (it was supposed to take 10) intermittently picked up terrifying speeds on a train where derailments, known as ""rail-slips,"" are quite common. ""Six hundred kilometers of what will turn out to be kidney-softening travel by rail ... So really the question on this end of the journey is: Come back on the train, or fly back in a coffin?"" he joked. For Bourdain, night trains leave a lasting impression.","Follow in the footsteps of Anthony Bourdain with these travel ideas .

"(CNN) -- Facebook games will have to reveal any in-app charges and will no longer be allowed to give players bonuses for ""liking"" their pages under new rules rolled out for developers this week. The changes were part of a new version of the platform developers use to build games and other apps and share them with Facebook users. The developers will have 90 days to comply with the new rules. So-called ""freemium"" games and other apps have become a popular choice for developers using Facebook or other platforms, like Apple's iOS and Google's Android mobile operating systems. Instead of paying for an app up front, players may download a game for free. In most cases, they can then play a basic version of that game, but get access to new content or in-game items that help their progress by paying. In addition to being arguably deceptive, this approach also has brought attention through several cases in which children have unknowingly racked up thousands of dollars worth of charges by making purchases in games that their parents didn't realize allowed that option. ""If your game includes mandatory or optional in-app charges, explain this in your app's description,"" Facebook's new rule reads. The curb on encouraging ""likes"" appears to be an effort by Facebook to keep developers from artificially inflating the popularity of their games. On Facebook, a page's popularity is judged, in part, by the number of likes, posts, comments and shares it gets. More popular pages rank higher in the site's search results and are shown to more users. It's not uncommon for games to offer players extra in-game items for liking their page. But intentionally pumping up a page's popularity is a problem Facebook has been working to control. In the worst case scenario, ""like farming"" is being done by someone who shares content with no other purpose than to make it go viral. Once the page has gotten lots of likes, the owner can strip it down and change it to a page promoting a product or service or even sell it to someone else on black-market sites. Facebook has worked to crack down on that practice with tools including one that devalues any post that specifically asks users to like or share it. Facebook: Get Messenger app or else .

"Washington (CNN) -- Monday marks the 50th anniversary of the Supreme Court's landmark ruling in Gideon v Wainwright in which the justices unanimously affirmed a constitutional right to a lawyer for criminal defendants too poor to afford one. Much has been written about the case, which overruled an earlier decision and forced states to create taxpayer-funded public defender offices. Movies and documentaries have also been made. Clarence Gideon was charged with breaking into a Panama City, Florida, pool hall on June 3, 1961. The place was vandalized and money stolen from a cash register. A witness later claimed he saw Gideon leaving the business at 5:30 a.m. with a wine bottle and money in his pocket. Based on that, he was charged with petty larceny and breaking and entering. He was denied a court-appointed lawyer in state court, represented himself and was convicted. Here are some of the key moments of the case in the words of those involved: . ""Mr. Gideon, I am sorry, but I cannot appoint counsel to represent you in this case. Under the laws of the state of Florida, the only time the court can appoint counsel to represent a defendant is when that person is charged with a capital offense. I am sorry, but I will have to deny your request to appoint counsel to defend you in this case."" -- Trial judge. Gideon, to the trial judge: ""The United States Supreme Court says I am entitled to be represented by counsel."" -- Bay County, Florida, courtroom, August 4, 1961. ""Gideon seemed a man whose own private hopes and fears had long since been deadened by adversity -- a used-up man, looking (15) years older than his actual age of (52). He appeared gaunt, a stooped 6 feet, 140 pounds."" He spoke ""in a slow, sad, defeated voice."" -- Anthony Lewis, author of ""Gideon's Trumpet,"" a 1964 book about the case. An appeal to the Florida Supreme Court was denied, so he launched another. ""I, Clarence Earl Gideon, claim that I was denied the rights of the 4th, 5th and 14th amendments of the Bill of Rights."" -- Gideon's 1962 handwritten petition to the Supreme Court. ""It makes no difference how old I am or what color I am or what church I belong too [sic] if any. The question is I did not get a fair trial. The question is very simple."" -- Gideon's petition. ""I think Betts vs. Brady [the 1942 precedent] was wrong when it was decided. I think time has made that clear. And I think that the time has come that the correct rule, the civilized rule, the rule of individualism, the rule of due process must be stated by this court."" -- Abe Fortas, the court-appointed attorney and future Supreme Court justice who argued Gideon's appeal before the high court, January 15, 1963. ""I believe that this case dramatically illustrates the point that you cannot have a fair trial without counsel. Indeed, I believe that ... a criminal court, is not properly constituted ... under our adversary system of law, unless there is a judge and unless there is a counsel for the prosecution and unless there is a counsel for the defense. Without that, how can a civilized nation pretend that it is having a fair trial? -- Fortas in his oral argument. ""In our adversary system of criminal justice, any person haled into court, who is too poor to hire a lawyer, cannot be assured a fair trial unless counsel is provided for him. This seems to us to be an obvious truth. ... The right of one charged with crime to counsel may not be deemed fundamental and essential to fair trials in some countries, but it is in ours. From the very beginning, our state and national constitutions and laws have laid great emphasis on procedural and substantive safeguards designed to assure fair trials before impartial tribunals in which every defendant stands equal before the law. This noble ideal cannot be realized if the poor man charged with crime has to face his accusers without a lawyer to assist him."" -- Justice Hugo Black, writing the March 18, 1963, Supreme Court opinion. ""In the decades since this remarkable case-- and Gideon's retrial, at which he was found not guilty-- public defender systems have been established in some states and strengthened in others. Additional court actions have expanded the right to counsel in juvenile and certain misdemeanor cases. And our nation has made significant strides in fulfilling the promise of Gideon - and ensuring quality representation for more of those who need it. ""Yet, despite half a century of progress -- even today, in 2013 -- far too many Americans struggle to gain access to the legal assistance they need. And far too many children and adults routinely enter our juvenile and criminal justice systems with little understanding of the rights to which they're entitled, the charges against them, or the potential sentences they may face. In short, America's indigent defense systems exist in a state of crisis. -- Attorney General Eric Holder at Friday's 50th anniversary event. ""I will not be proud of this biography. There will be no cause of pride, nor will it be the absolute truth. I cannot remember or desire to remember that well. Also, being only a human being, I will try, though I know I cannot to justify myself through this outline."" -- Clarence Gideon.","Landmark Supreme Court case affirmed the right to a lawyer for criminal defendants .

"(CNN) -- Last Saturday, Sarah Palin stood before the huge crowd at the 2014 National Rifle Association annual meeting and condemned liberals for coddling terrorists. She loaded her speech with religious metaphors, claiming that true leaders would put ""the fear of God in our enemies."" She said, ""They obviously have information on plots to carry out jihad. Oh, but you can't offend them, can't make them feel uncomfortable, not even a smidgen. Well, if I were in charge, they would know that waterboarding is how we baptize terrorists."" Palin's invocation of forced baptism shocked both conservatives and liberals, inspiring few defenders. Christian commentators, in particular, focused on her link between torture and baptism. On Wednesday, the National Religious Campaign against Torture released a powerful condemnation of the speech. To Palin, the organization's executive director wrote, ""Your statements play into a false narrative conveying that somehow, the conflict between the United States and the terrorist cells is a conflict between Christianity and Islam, or Islam and 'the West.' "" The group's letter to the NRA, signed by 17 faith leaders from many different religions and denominations, reads, ""For Christians, baptism is a profoundly holy act. It is in stark contrast to the abhorrent act of waterboarding. Equating baptism to an act of torture like waterboarding is sacrilegious -- and particularly surprising coming from a person who prides herself on her Christian faith."" But it's not actually all that surprising. Palin's public rhetoric relies on crafting existential binaries between ""us"" and ""them,"" creating a kind of sacred empowered victimhood among her listeners. She draws from the language of militant Christianity to claim the status of both persecutor and persecuted. This is not an accident, and I do not believe she will repudiate her remarks. I'm an historian. While people of faith such as the National Religious Campaign against Torture are concerned about blasphemy, I worry about history. When powerful Christians such as Palin start speaking about forced baptism to a cheering throng, they evoke, intentionally or not, some of the worst episodes in Christian history. Here's one. On Valentine's Day 1349, the citizens of Strasbourg, Germany, rose up against the Jewish population of their city. The Chronicle of Mathias of Neuenburg describes it as follows: . ""And so, on the following Saturday (February 14), the Jews were conducted to the cemetery to be burnt in a specifically prepared house. And 200 of them were completely stripped of their clothes by the mob, who found a lot of money in them. But the few who chose baptism were spared, and many beautiful women were persuaded to accept baptism, and many children were baptized after they were snatched from mothers who refused this invitation. All the rest were burnt, and many were killed as they leaped out of the fire."" This is just one of the many examples of forced baptism of Jews and Muslims under threat of massacre. Notice the specifics. The Jews were forced into a building, stripped, robbed and burned alive. Their only pathway out was through baptism and rape. As parents died, babies were taken from their mothers to be baptized. The church condemned these practices, but if someone went into a church and was baptized, even under threat of death, it counted. Such issues led to the terrible excesses of the Spanish Inquisition in which forcibly converted Jews and Muslims were held under constant scrutiny and suspicion. When Palin stood before the huge crowd of mostly white people, she told her audience to be afraid and to be prepared for civilian violence. She spoke about ""that evil Muslim terrorist Maj. (Nidal) Hasan ... his Allah Akbar (sic) praising jihad."" She said, ""Ammo is expensive, don't waste a bullet on a warning shot."" She divided the world between ""us"" and ""them,"" with no room for dialogue. At one point she pretended to apologize for saying all liberals were hypocrites, then joked, redrawing the divisive line, ""I'm kidding, yes they are."" Finally, she said, ""If I were in charge,"" and paused to let crowd cheer. Then, with great deliberation, she linked a torture method that makes the sufferer feel like they are dying to the ritual of Christian inclusion. The crowd went wild. ""Thank God,"" she said, ""more and more Americans are waking up."" I don't read her invocation of a deity as accidental. For Palin, this is a holy struggle. Last Sunday wasn't the first time Palin used rhetoric invoking one of the worst chapters of Christian history. In January 2011, in the wake of the Gabrielle Giffords shooting in Arizona, she and some right-wing defenders used the term ""blood libel"" to describe those linking the shooting to Palin's martial rhetoric. (She had used on her website a map with cross hairs on Giffords' district). Blood libel refers to the medieval myth that Jews murdered Christian children in religious rituals and baked their blood into matzos for Passover. It's a myth that has resulted in massacres of Jews for centuries. I appreciate the efforts of the National Religious Campaign against Torture and others to contest this language in public. We can't pretend, though, that Palin's invocation was an aberration or that her status as a failed politician makes her irrelevant. The crowd was cheering; then they went into the exhibition hall to buy weapons. Sarah Palin and her followers want it both ways. They are the persecuted chosen people of God, targeted by lies and threatened with violence by those who do not share their faith. They are also the Christian triumphalists, ready for a Day of Reckoning in which all will be converted or destroyed. This is not a joke or an accident. This is not new rhetoric. And it never ends well.","Sarah Palin told NRA meeting, ""Waterboarding is how we baptize terrorists""

"Washington (CNN) -- For Washington, Christmas could come early. Or it could not come at all. The deal to end the government shutdown in October included a new deadline -- come up with a plan to fund the government by December 13 -- or risk another partial government shutdown next month. Well, December 13 is Friday and House and Senate negotiators don't yet have a deal. And that's not the only thing Congress has to work on before the House is supposed to leave town, also on Friday, and the Senate at the end of next week. The budget . The talks, led by Wisconsin Republican Rep. Paul Ryan and Washington Democratic Sen. Patty Murray, are working to formulate a spending bill for the remainder of fiscal 2014, which ends next September 30. Current funding for the government runs out in mid-January around the same time as billions in new automatic spending cuts -- known as sequestration -- are set to hit. Insisting that negotiators reach a deal, House Speaker John Boehner said last week that he ""told everybody in the room (the GOP caucus) we are done at 11 a.m. on December 13."" Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, who sits on the House and Senate negotiating panel, said Sunday on ABC's ""This Week"" that he's ""hopeful"" a deal would be reached by the end of this week. Unemployment benefits . An estimated 1.3 million long-term unemployed will be cut from federal jobless benefits by the end of the year. Another 850,000 could fall off the rolls within the first three months of 2014, according to the National Employment Law Project. That's unless Congress extends, for the 12th time since 2008, the federally funded Emergency Unemployment Compensation program. It provides benefits once a jobless worker's state benefits expire. A 'do-nothing' Congress? The unemployment extension could be included in budget talks, adding another challenge that Republicans and Democrats have to overcome. While the second-ranking Democrat in the Senate said he hopes extended unemployment benefits are included, he noted on Sunday that such a step won't necessarily be a sticking point for his party in budget negotiations. ""No, I don't think we've reached that point where we've said, 'This is it -- take it or leave it,'"" Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, said on ""This Week"" when asked if his party would demand it be included budget talks. While many Democrats want an extension, Republicans are opposed. Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul said an extension of jobs benefits harms the unemployed. ""I do support unemployment benefits for the 26 weeks that they're paid for. If you extend it beyond that, you do a disservice to these workers,"" he said on ""Fox News Sunday."" Farm Bill . The Farm Bill, which sets national food policy, is two years overdue. Congress has been passing short-term extensions instead of the usual five-year plan, but key negotiators now say a short-term fix is not an option. Washington gridlock risks $7 milk . If lawmakers fail to pass a Farm Bill, the economic impact for ordinary Americans could be quite severe. The price of milk would more than double to an estimated $7 per gallon as government subsidies expire. The cost of food overall would go up, with supports for commodities, such as corn and wheat, also running out. Another huge factor: food stamps. The Farm Bill authorizes spending for that program as well. House Republicans want to drop 3.8 million people from those rolls next year -- about 8% of recipients - while Senate Democrats aren't keen on those cuts. But they would likely have to agree to some reductions for a deal to be reached. Food stamp spending is currently . Some 47.6 million people, or nearly 15% of the population, get food stamps, according to September federal data. In 2007, only 26.3 million, or 8.7% of the population, received them. The 'Doc Fix' For doctors, the holidays are a stressful time if they see Medicare patients. That's because their reimbursements are caught up in political wrangling and budget negotiations. It's called the ""doc fix"" and they would see a 24% reduction in their reimbursements if Congress fails to act. While there is bipartisan support for doctors to receive payments in full, there is plenty of disagreement between the two parties on how to pay for the costly program. Washington could still screw up your holidays . The latest estimate from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found the ""doc fix"" would cost $138 billion over the next decade. While that's far lower than the $316 billion the CBO projected the previous year, it's still hard to find that much money lying around. The House announced a path forward but the Senate has not. It's unclear how this issue will be resolved. If Congress fails to fully reimburse them, doctors have threatened to stop seeing Medicare patients. That's not a viable option as more and more baby boomers sign up for Medicare every day. Iran sanctions . Despite administration objections, members of Congress are working to pass new sanctions on Iran. The White House is opposed, saying they would undermine an interim deal with Iran meant to halt its nuclear program. A Senate source familiar with the discussions told CNN Capitol Hill Producer Ted Barrett that senior Senators from both parties are nearing agreement on a plan that would prohibit Iran from enriching any uranium. One source said ""the (Obama) administration's preference is for us to do nothing,"" while another said ""they're fighting us tooth and nail."" Kerry sees hope of progress for Iran, Israel . Even if a deal is reached, it's not clear that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid would defy President Barack Obama and bring the package to a vote. Presidential nominations . The Senate is back in town for the first time since it changed the rules to allow a simple majority to confirm Presidential nominations instead of the previous 60-vote threshold. They are expected to clear a backlog of appointments. The first vote is expected on Patricia Ann Millett to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Other nominees likely to come up for a vote before the end of the year include Robert Wilkins and Cornelia Pillard, also for the D.C. court, Janet Yellen to head the Federal Reserve, Jeh Johnson to be Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security and Democratic Rep. Melvin Watt of North Carolina to run the Federal Housing Finance Agency. Defense bill . Senators also will return to legislation that sets policy goals and spending targets for the military. The Defense Authorization measure has passed the House but is moving slow in the Senate because of the numerous amendments that receive a vote -- common procedure for that legislation. While the Senate is scheduled to be in town for two weeks, it must hurry since the House is set to leave on Friday. CNN's Ted Barrett, Deirdre Walsh, Dana Davidsen and CNNMoney's Jeanne Sahadi contributed to this report .","Congress has made a habit of working until the last minute to meet fiscal deadlines .

"(CNN) -- If you want to earn big bucks as a sportsman then Europe is the place to be. Playing American football, baseball or basketball in the United States has often been thought of as the way to earn top dollar, but not any more, according to a new survey. So if you are a star in need of a bumper pay rise then hotfoot to Manchester City, which is the best paid team in global sport, according to Sporting Intelligence's Global Sports Salaries Survey for 2014, compiled in association with ESPN The Magazine. According to the report, which looked at 294 teams in 15 leagues in 12 countries across seven different sports, the average first-team player to ply their trade at the English Premier League club earns $8,969,407 per year, or $172,488 per week. American baseball outfits New York Yankees and Los Angeles Dodgers are ranked second and third -- with annual salaries of $8,882,746 and $8,603,482 respectively -- but six of the top 10 teams surveyed are from Europe. The Yankees held the coveted top spot in 2010, when the inaugural survey was conducted, with its players earning an average of $7.89 million per year. However, Europe is now the dominant force after Barcelona ousted the Yankees in 2011, with an average of $8.2 million per year, before holding onto the position for the following year. By 2013, City had become the best paid team in global sport -- and their players' salaries show no sign of stagnating. ""The perception in the past has always been that sports players in America can earn the major bucks,"" Sporting Intelligence editor Nick Harris told CNN. ""But what this survey shows is that actually Europe can also pay those big bucks and has the ability to compete with America."" Perhaps the biggest misconception when it comes to wages in sport is that NFL players take home some of the heftiest pay packets. Although that may be true to some extent -- Drew Brees of the New Orleans Saints made the top five of Forbes' ""World's Highest Paid Athletes"" list last year -- the reality is that the majority of players are not so lucky. ""In the NFL, each team has about 100 players, with around 53 on their active roster, yet only two or three or so will earn $20 million a year. The rest will be paid $400,000 to $1 million a year,"" Harris said. ""The majority of people, if you ask them which sport have the best paid teams, will say NFL because of the Super Bowl and College Football -- it's huge. ""But most don't know that is not the case as not everyone is well paid. The majority are not. ""This is the reason Sporting Intelligence started this survey. To compare different sports and demonstrate these misconceptions surrounding the different sports."" Bumper TV deal . In contrast, City have the cash to be able to afford to pay the majority of their players a higher wage, rather than just a select few. However, the NBA is the highest paying league as a whole -- 441 players at 30 teams in the 2013-14 season each earned an average of $5 million per year -- with the MLB in third. The English Premier League, meanwhile, sits fourth, with Spain's La Liga languishing in ninth. Why, then, the dominance of European football clubs when it comes to paying their players? ""Billionaires help fuel wages,"" Harris said. ""Roman Abramovich has spent around$1.67 billion since arriving at Chelsea in 2003, while there has been a net spend of $1.67 billion on transfers and wages at Manchester City since Sheikh Mansour's arrival in 2008. ""As for other Premier League clubs, TV money has driven wage inflation. It has done so in elite European football and in England since the early 1990s and particularly in the last decade. And it is continuing to rise."" Last year the Premier League sold its broadcasting rights to Sky and BT in a record-breaking deal worth around $4.98 billion, while overseas TV deals brought in another $3.35 billion. That in turn allowed City to pay the likes of Yaya Toure and Sergio Aguero so handsomely, while making its first-team players the best paid in sport.","A new survey finds Manchester City is the best paid team in global sport .

"(CNN) -- Don't let McDonald's new ""Dollar Menu and More"" distract you. Although an order of McNuggets might cost more than a buck now, the truth is that the Dollar Menu was never a bargain. In reality, whether you eat the fries or not, fast-food companies such as McDonald's actually shift billions of dollars in hidden costs onto taxpayers every year. How? These costs flow directly from their business model of low wages, nonexistent benefits and limited work hours, which force millions of fast-food workers to rely on public assistance to afford basic necessities such as food and health care. To see this business model in action, take a look inside the employee break room at many McDonald's restaurants, where you might find a poster displaying information for a 1-800 ""McResource"" hotline designed to offer counseling to employees who need financial, housing, child care or other help. In a recent exchange on the McResource hotline, documented in a newly released video, an employee who has worked at McDonald's for 10 years -- yet earns the Illinois minimum wage of $8.25 per hour -- is urged to find additional support for herself and her two children by paying a visit to nearby food pantries, applying for food stamps and signing up for Medicaid. In other words, rather than sitting down with their employees to address the reality that the company's pay scales are just too low -- and that even long-term employees can't get by on their small paychecks -- McDonald's has decided to coach its workers on how to enroll in public safety-net programs to supplement their poverty-level wages. (McDonald's called the video an inaccurate portrayal of the resource line.) In total, this business model of low wages and no benefits at the 10 largest fast-food companies costs taxpayers an estimated $3.8 billion each year, according to a recent report by the National Employment Law Project. At McDonald's, the company's low-wage jobs cost taxpayers an estimated $1.2 billion a year -- twice as much as any other fast-food company. Public safety-net programs such as the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (commonly known as ""food stamps"") and Medicaid are crucial programs for alleviating poverty and promoting economic security in the United States. That is precisely why we cannot afford to let multibillion-dollar companies drain the resources of these programs by paying poverty-level wages to millions of their workers. The good news is that over the past year, thousands of workers in the fast-food industry have begun organizing and staging strikes in dozens of cities across the country, calling for a living wage and the right to form a union. These demands should be taken seriously. All Americans -- even those who have never worked in fast food or have no plans to eat fast food -- need to recognize that the low-wage fast-food industry poses significant costs to all of us each year. Fast-food workers should have the ability to bargain collectively for higher wages and better working conditions. Giving workers a voice at the workplace will ensure a fairer, more democratic workplace, while keeping in check the irresponsible business model of CEOs tapping the public safety net for billions in subsidies each year as they continue to pay poverty-level wages. At the same time, Congress should pass a long-overdue increase in the federal minimum wage, which has remained stuck at just $7.25 per hour -- or $15,080 a year -- for the past four years. Although many companies will continue to pay as little as they can get away with, raising the minimum wage to $10.10 per hour, as proposed in the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2013, would boost wages for 30 million workers, generating $32 billion in new economic growth as higher wages power greater consumer spending. A fairer fast-food industry that provides higher wages, promotes greater economic growth and spares taxpayers billions in costs every year sounds like a real value worth fighting for. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jack Temple.","Jack Temple: Fast-food companies shift costs of their low pay onto taxpayers .

"(CNN) -- More than six weeks after Flight 370 disappeared, Malaysia's prime minister says his government is still not prepared to declare it -- and the 239 people on board -- lost. ""At some point in time I would be, but right now I think I need to take into account the feelings of the next of kin -- and some of them have said publicly that they aren't willing to accept it until they find hard evidence,"" Najib Razak told CNN's Richard Quest in an exclusive TV interview. Still, he said, it is ""hard to imagine otherwise."" Najib also announced that his government will release a preliminary report next week on the plane's disappearance. The report has already been submitted to the United Nations. A month ago, Najib announced that, based on satellite data from Inmarsat, investigators had determined the plane's ""last position was in the middle of the Indian Ocean, west of Perth. This is a remote location, far from any possible landing sites. It is therefore with deep sadness and regret that I must inform you that, according to this new data, flight MH370 ended in the southern Indian Ocean."" That same day, Malaysia Airlines sent a text to relatives of the passengers saying ""we have to assume beyond any reasonable doubt that MH370 has been lost and that none of those onboard survived."" In the interview Thursday with CNN, Najib called it ""a bizarre scenario which none of us could have contemplated."" How could a plane that was supposed to head toward Beijing end up ""half-way toward Antarctica?"" he said. Najib said he repeatedly asked the investigators whether they were sure, ""and their answer to me was, 'We are as sure as we can possibly be.'"" Some relatives of those on board and analysts have criticized Malaysia's handling of the investigation, accusing the government of hiding or poorly communicating information. Asked whether his country had bungled the search, Najib stressed that authorities had faced an ""unprecedented"" situation that would have been a struggle for any country to handle. ""Some of the things, we did well. We were very focused on searching for the plane. We didn't get our communications right, absolutely right, to begin with. But I think toward the later part, we got our act together,"" Najib said. ""So I'm prepared to say that there are things we did well and things that we didn't do too well."" That's one thing an investigation team will look at, he said. ""We're prepared to look into it,"" he said, ""and we're prepared for this investigation team to do its objective assessment."" The night of the flight's disappearance, a military radar picked up a plane traveling across the Malaysian Peninsula. Najib said he believes there was someone monitoring the radar, ""but the interpretation was done after the event."" It was not known whether the plane was MH370, he said, and no planes were sent up to investigate ""because it was deemed not to be hostile."" It ""behaved like a commercial airline, following a normal flight path,"" he said. The vanishing of Flight 370 is ""very, very different"" from the 1997 crash of a SilkAir flight and the 2009 loss of an Air France flight, Najib added. ""This is totally unprecedented."" There have been only ""pings"" and ""handshakes"" to go by, he said. ""That we have analyzed. That is all we have."" Families' next step: Demanding answers from Boeing .

"Washington (CNN) -- Twelve survivors of the shooting that gravely wounded former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and killed six others met Wednesday with Attorney General Eric Holder to seek his support for stricter enforcement of gun sale checks and tighter requirements on gun sales. The group of survivors from the Tucson, Arizona, shooting is working with New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and others with Mayors Against Illegal Guns to combat gun violence. Ken Dorushka, one of the survivors, said Holder ""seemed to be very supportive of what we're trying to do."" The Arizona contingent hopes to get President Obama and Gov. Mitt Romney to present plans for ending gun violence. Neither party has wanted to discuss gun violence during the campaign. Dorushka acknowledged the National Rifle Association has enormous political clout, and his group faces an uphill task. The Justice Department confirmed the attorney general met with the group for about an hour, but would not discuss what was talked about. The Arizona delegation submitted to Holder hundreds of thousands of signatures in support of the campaign. ""The meeting was positive and constructive,"" said Holder spokeswoman Tracy Schmaler. The group of survivors who met with Holder did not include Giffords, but did include Roxanna Green, the mother of 9-year-old Christina-Taylor Green who was killed in the January 8, 2011, shooting spree. Jared Lee Loughner has pleaded guilty in the shooting. 19 months after mass shooting, ex-Rep. Giffords moves back to Tuscon . Also among the survivors in the delegation was Bill Badger, who like Giffords was shot in the head. Badger was able to knock Loughner to the ground and helped hold him down until police arrived. The group supports the Fix Gun Check program pushed by Sen. Charles Schumer of New York. The program calls for closing the ""gun show loophole,"" which gun control advocates have long demanded. Dorushka said an estimated 40% of gun sales occur at gun shows, flea markets and backyard sales, where unlicensed gun dealers are not required to perform background checks on prospective purchasers. Giffords continues a slow recovery at home. She resigned her congressional seat on July 25. Loughner pleaded guilty in a deal with federal prosecutors to 19 counts of murder and attempted murder. He will not receive the death penalty, but is expected to serve life in prison after he is formally sentenced on November 15.","12 survivors of Tuscon shooting meet with attorney general .

"(CNN) -- At least 355 people have been killed in flooding caused by intense monsoon rains across northern India and Pakistan over the past few days.

Thousands more have been stranded. Army units equipped with helicopters and boats have rescued 20,000 people in India's Jammu and Kashmir state, India's Ministry of Defence said Monday.

"(CNN) -- An American student is in critical condition after undergoing two operations after chimpanzees tore at his body in front of tourists at a South African animal sanctuary, a hospital spokeswoman told CNN on Tuesday. Andrew Oberle, a primatology student from the University of Texas at San Antonio, was being treated at a Johannesburg hospital after two chimps attacked him Thursday, spokeswoman Robyn Baard said. ""He went though a 6-hour procedure of which doctors cleaned out his wounds and now it's a case of wait and see, and just to keep him sedated and comfortable for now,"" she said. Oberle had been at the Jane Goodall Institute's Chimp Eden since May, according to Eugene Cussons, the facility's managing director. Oberle was at the sanctuary, near Nelspruit, South Africa, for the second time after training and volunteering there in 2010. His training included an explanation about ""no-go"" areas, spaces for animals where people are not supposed to go. Witnesses to the attack said that Oberle went into a no-go area because he seemed to want to remove a stone close to one of the animals that could have been picked up and thrown around, Cussons told CNN. Oberle crossed one barrier and approached a second one, which is a main fence with 24 strands of electrical wiring, Cussons said. Two male chimps grabbed Oberle and tried to drag him under the fence, but were not able to yank him into their enclosure. Zookeeper killed by wolves in Sweden . Cussons said he estimates the attack lasted 15 minutes. At some point, people tried to stop the chimps, and Cussons shot two rounds in the air to see if that might get them to retreat, he said. One of the chimps then charged at Cussons, he said. Cussons shot that chimp in the abdomen, he told CNN, and it seemed to shriek as a kind of signal to other chimps that there was a more powerful threat present. The chimps then backed off, he said. Oberle was rescued and transported for medical care. None of the 13 tourists, most of them from local areas, were harmed, officials said. The chimp that was shot had an operation at the Johannesburg zoo to repair damage to his small and large intestines. Hospital spokeswoman Baard declined to discuss the nature of Oberle's wounds. She said the student's parents had requested privacy, adding that they are ""quite traumatized."" The sanctuary, which is featured in the Animal Planet program ""Escape to Chimp Eden,"" remains closed and its staff is receiving counseling, executive director David Oosthuizen said. There are no plans right now to euthanize the chimps involved in the attack, said Dries Pienaar, who is leading the investigation into the incident. He works for a parks agency that makes sure zoos, sanctuaries and breeding projects comply with the law. Pienaar told CNN that his preliminary findings are that human error is to blame, but he cautioned that his investigation is not complete and that he wants to interview Oberle. He hasn't spoken to all of the tourists yet, either. Chimp Eden was established as a home for rescued chimpanzees. Many of the primates have suffered ""horrible injuries and abuse from humans,"" according to the sanctuary. Neville Pillay, head of animal behavior at Wits University, said that violence in chimpanzees is not at all unusual. ""Chimpanzees are known to be violent, and they can kill other animals. And male chimpanzees are particularly strong,"" he said. Dave Salmoni, an expert in large predators for Animal Planet, said abused and captive chimpanzees can be particularly dangerous, likening the chimps to troubled prison inmates. ""Now this is a very nice prison, but it's a prison nonetheless,"" he said Monday. ""And that's why you can see a lot of acting out behavior, and in some cases, with chimpanzees, they act out just because they can."" Oberle was passionate about studying chimpanzees, his friend Anthony Reimherr told CNN affiliate KXAN. He said it was ""intriguing"" to listen to Oberle when he spoke about the animals. ""It's just something that he loved to do, and I think it's something that he'll always continue to do,"" Reimherr said. Laboratory chimps get new lease on life .

"(CNN) -- Sen. Larry Craig said he ""overreacted and made a poor decision"" in pleading guilty to disorderly conduct after his June arrest following an incident in a Minneapolis, Minnesota, airport bathroom. A police mug shot of Sen. Larry Craig after he was arrested at the Minneapolis-St. Paul airport in June. Tuesday, in his first public statement on the arrest, the Idaho Republican said he did nothing ""inappropriate."" ""Let me be clear: I am not gay and never have been,"" said Craig, who has aligned himself with conservative groups who oppose gay rights. With his wife by his side, Craig said he is the victim of a ""witch hunt"" conducted by the Idaho Statesman newspaper. ""In pleading guilty, I overreacted in Minneapolis, because of the stress of the Idaho Statesman's investigation and the rumors it has fueled around Idaho,"" he said. ""Again, that overreaction was a mistake, and I apologize for my misjudgment.""  Watch Craig say he did nothing wrong » . He added: ""I should not have kept this arrest to myself, and should have told my family and friends about it. I wasn't eager to share this failure, but I should have done so anyway."" A police officer who arrested him June 11 said Craig peered through a crack in a restroom stall door for two minutes and made gestures suggesting to the officer he wanted to engage in ""lewd conduct."" Craig's blue eyes were clearly visible through the crack in the door, Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport police Sgt. Dave Karsnia wrote in the report he filed. ""Craig would look down at his hands, 'fidget' with his fingers, and then look through the crack into my stall again,"" Karsnia wrote in documents accompanying the arrest report. Craig said the officer misinterpreted his actions. After he was taken for questioning, the police report says, Craig pulled out a Senate business card and asked the officer: ""What do you think of that?"" Before the senator spoke in Boise, Idaho, Tuesday, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican from Kentucky, informed Craig the leaders of his own party were calling for an ethics investigation into what they termed a ""serious matter,"" a Senate Republican leadership aide told CNN. The aide said senators, who discussed the matter by phone, were especially concerned about the business card allegation. The GOP leadership consists of McConnell, Assistant Minority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi, Conference Chairman Jon Kyl of Arizona, Policy Committee Chair Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas, and Senatorial Committee Chair John Ensign of Nevada. ""Due to the reported and disputed circumstances, and the legal resolution of this serious case, we will recommend that Senator Craig's incident be reported to the Senate Ethics Committee for its review,"" the group said in a statement. ""In the meantime, Leadership is examining other aspects of the case to determine if additional action is required,"" the statement said. Craig, 62, pleaded guilty August 8 to a misdemeanor disorderly conduct charge in the incident, according to Minnesota criminal records. The senator said he ""chose to plead guilty to a lesser charge in the hope of making it go away. I did not seek any counsel, either from an attorney, staff, friends, or family. That was a mistake, and I deeply regret it."" On Tuesday, Craig announced that he has retained an attorney. The officer wrote he was on a plainclothes detail in the restroom because of citizen complaints and arrests for sexual activity there. Karsnia wrote that when the person occupying the stall beside him left, Craig entered it and blocked the door with his rolling suitcase. ""My experience has shown that individuals engaging in lewd conduct use their bags to block the view from the front of their stall,"" the officer said in his report. The senator then tapped his right foot, ""a signal used by persons wishing to engage in lewd conduct,"" Karsnia wrote, and Craig ran his left hand several times underneath the partition dividing the stalls. ""The presence of others did not seem to deter Craig as he moved his right foot so that it touched the side of my left foot, which was within my stall area,"" the officer's report said. When the police interviewed him later, the senator said that ""he has a wide stance when going to the bathroom"" and that was why his foot may have touched the officer's, the report said. Craig also told police that he had reached down to the floor to pick up a piece of paper, the officer wrote. ""It should be noted that there was not a piece of paper on the bathroom floor, nor did Craig pick up a piece of paper,"" Karsnia wrote. ""During the interview, Craig either disagreed with me or 'didn't recall' the events as they happened."" After Craig ran his hand underneath the partition wall three times, Karsnia held his police identification down by the floor so the senator could see it, the report said. ""With my left hand near the floor, I pointed towards the exit. Craig responded, 'No!' ""I again pointed towards the exit. Craig exited the stall with his roller bags without flushing the toilet,"" Karsnia wrote. The senator initially resisted the officer's request to go to the police operations center, he said, but finally did. There, he was read his Miranda rights, interviewed, photographed, fingerprinted and released, the report said. The Capitol Hill newspaper Roll Call first reported the arrest Monday. In a statement released Monday evening, Craig denied inappropriate conduct and said he regrets his guilty plea, which he entered without having an attorney present. ""At the time of this incident, I complained to the police that they were misconstruing my actions. I was not involved in any inappropriate conduct,"" he said. ""I should have had the advice of counsel in resolving this matter. In hindsight, I should not have pled guilty. I was trying to handle this matter myself quickly and expeditiously."" Craig paid a $500 fine when he entered his guilty plea in Hennepin County Municipal Court in Bloomington, Minnesota, according to state criminal records. In his petition to enter a guilty plea, Craig acknowledged that he ""engaged in (physical) conduct which I knew or should have known tended to arouse alarm or resentment."" He also was required to stipulate in the statement that he would ""make no claim that I am innocent of the charge to which I am entering a plea of guilty,"" the document said. On Tuesday, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington filed a complaint with the Senate Ethics Committee, asking that the senator's conduct be investigated. The group, which largely targets Republicans, asked the committee to probe whether Craig ""violated the Senate Rules of Conduct by engaging in disorderly conduct,"" a statement said. ""If pleading guilty to charges stemming from an attempt to solicit an undercover officer in a public restroom is not conduct that reflects poorly upon the Senate, what is?"" asked Melanie Sloan, the group's executive director, in a statement. Sloan is a former U.S. attorney in the Clinton administration's Justice Department. Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-California, chairwoman of the Ethics Committee, declined to comment on whether an investigation would be conducted. Her office noted the committee's work is generally confidential. A Senate aide familiar with Ethics Committee practices said ethics rules do not specifically require a member to disclose pleading guilty to a misdemeanor. But the rules require the panel to look into a matter and determine whether an investigation is appropriate once a formal complaint is lodged. Craig resigned Monday night as a Senate liaison for former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney's presidential campaign. Romney's son Josh canceled a trip to Idaho on Tuesday. Craig, Idaho's senior senator, is married with three grown children and nine grandchildren. A former rancher, he was first elected to the Senate in 1990 after serving a decade in the House of Representatives. His seat is up for re-election in 2008. Last fall, Craig's office publicly denied assertions by Internet blogger Mike Rogers that the senator is gay. Craig's office dismissed speculation about the senator's sexuality as ""completely ridiculous."" In 1982, Craig denied rumors he was under investigation as part of a federal probe into allegations that lawmakers on Capitol Hill had sexual relationships with congressional pages, saying the ""false allegations"" made him ""mad as hell."" He was never implicated in that investigation, which led to ethics charges against two other congressmen. In recent years, Craig's voting record has earned him top ratings from social conservative groups such as the American Family Association, Concerned Women for America and the Family Research Council. He has supported a federal constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage, telling his colleagues that it was ""important for us to stand up now and protect traditional marriage, which is under attack by a few unelected judges and litigious activists."" In 1996, Craig also voted in favor of the Defense of Marriage Act, which denies federal recognition to same-sex marriages and prevents states from being forced to recognize the marriages of gay and lesbian couples legally performed in other states. Craig also has opposed expanding the federal hate crimes law to cover offenses motivated by anti-gay bias and, in 1996, voted against a bill that would have outlawed employment discrimination based on sexual orientation, which failed by a single vote in the Senate.

"(CNN) -- A Massachusetts congressman called on the federal government Tuesday to distribute potassium iodide pills to Americans living near nuclear reactors, a preventive step one expert warns might do more harm than good. Rep. Ed Markey wants the federal government to distribute doses of the compound -- which can be used to block the thyroid gland's absorption of radioactive iodine -- to every household within a 20-mile radius of a U.S. nuclear power plant ""in recognition of the probability that rapid evacuation during a nuclear meltdown will be difficult and time consuming."" Markey, D-Massachusetts, said the battle to halt a suspected meltdown at a Japanese plant should spur the Obama administration to action. ""Despite more than 30 years of clear and unequivocal evidence that potassium iodide protects people, especially young children, who are most vulnerable, from cancer-causing releases of radioactive iodine that would occur if a nuclear disaster occurred, the nuclear industry has continued to fight its use,"" Markey said at a press conference. A 2002 law calls for the U.S. government to make stockpiles of potassium iodide available to states and local governments in preparation for a possible nuclear accident, but the congressman said the provision has not been enforced. ""The Japanese nuclear disaster is the reminder we need that the law should be followed, and American children should be protected in the event of another nuclear meltdown here on U.S. soil,"" Markey said in a statement issued by his office. The congressmen urged potassium iodide be stockpiled in schools, hospitals and other places within the 20-mile radius. Markey is the ranking Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee and a former chairman of the Energy and Commerce subcommittee on the environment. He was a leading critic of BP during last year's massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, pushing the oil company to release more information about the disaster. Since the crisis at a Japanese power station that followed the March 11 earthquake and tsunami, he has called for a safety review of U.S. nuclear plants. Markey said Tuesday he plans to introduce legislation to overhaul nuclear safety. The bill imposes a moratorium on new reactor licenses until ""new safety requirements are in place."" The bill, he said, would require reactors to have backup power supplies and systems that can withstand ""earthquakes, tsunamis, strong storms and long power outages."" But Dr. James Cox, a radiation oncologist at Houston's MD Anderson Cancer Center, called Markey's potassium iodide proposal ""a well-intentioned but bad idea."" ""The idea of trying to protect people and trying to prevent illness is always a good idea,"" said Cox, a CNN consultant. But he said the pills carry side effects that might be worse than low doses of radiation -- and they have ""very little likelihood"" of being used, ""except by people who might be so anxious that they might use them inappropriately."" Radioactive iodine is among the contaminants released from the earthquake-damaged Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in northern Japan, where crews have spent more than two weeks trying to prevent meltdowns in three of its six reactors. Potassium iodide blocks the absorption of radioactive iodine isotopes by filling the thyroid with the benign iodine compound, stopping the thyroid from absorbing radioactive iodine. This reduces the risk of cancer from exposure. Its use is recommended for children in particular, because they would have a higher risk of thyroid cancers, but it doesn't protect against radiation from other elements -- nor does it protect any other organs from radiation exposure. The supplement disappeared from some store shelves in California this month after trace amounts of radioactivity were picked up by sensors on the U.S. Pacific Coast, even as California's emergency management agency warned residents against taking it. ""It is not necessary given the current circumstances in Japan,"" the agency said. ""It can present a danger to people with allergies to iodine, shellfish or who have thyroid problems, and taken inappropriately, it can have serious side effects."" Cox said that ideally, if a nuclear accident happened, health departments would tell people in the affected areas when they should take a dose of the compound. But having potassium iodide at hand can be a problem as well. ""Because just like people are running out and trying to hoard these pills, that anxiety might lead them to take the medication when they are told there is some detectable amount of iodine-131 in the atmosphere, when it's not enough of a concentration to be health concern."" Irwin Redlener, director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University, said his main message is the United States should be prepared for a potential disaster. ""Americans shouldn't take it (potassium iodide) now because Americans are not, at the moment at risk, so they should not take it now,"" Redlener said. ""This should not be an advisory for people to go out and stockpile potassium iodide themselves necessarily.""

"(CNN) -- This is a game with intriguing story lines: David against Goliath. Master against apprentice. Determination against precision. This is a game the U.S. can't afford to lose. This is a game that will be ""massive."" ""There's no other word to say (it),"" said U.S. coach Jurgen Klinsmann. At noon ET Thursday, the United States soccer team takes on the soccer behemoth Germany in the globe's biggest sporting spectacle, the World Cup. Chances are, that for those 90-some minutes, your office will get little work done. Your co-workers will huddle by the TVs in the break room. Your bosses will likely be away at long ""lunches."" And you, who was perfectly content going through life blissfully unconcerned about soccer, will feel a little left out. Well, fear not. Here's a cheat sheet to make you an insta-pundit on this crucial showdown. Follow the live blog . Why you should care . The eyes of the world are on the U.S. America can't very well be the world's super power and be mediocre at soccer. This is its chance to go toe-to-toe with the second-best team in the business: the ruthlessly efficient Germany. When the tournament began, the luck of the draw placed the U.S. team in the so-called ""Group of Death."" The boys, led by Clint Dempsey aka ""Captain America,"" survived Ghana, beating them 2-1. Then, they almost slayed powerhouse Portugal. Almost -- but for a last-minute header that torpedoed their lead. That game ended in a 2-2 draw. Now, the only thing standing between this group stage and a sweet spot in the next round is Die Mannschaft,  German for ""The Team."" ''The United States is known to give everything they have in every single game,"" Klinsmann said. ""We have that fighting spirit."" Why you should worry . Here's one reason: The two teams have met nine times; Germany's come out on top six of those times. Here's another: In the last seven World Cups, Germany has always won its its third game. This is its third. Gulp! Here's a third: Team USA's last game was in Manaus, a notoriously hot and muggy field in the Brazilian jungle. Every other team that played in that giant sauna lost their next matches. Why you shouldn't worry . Because the same man who was responsible for transforming Germany into a lean, mean fighting machine is now the U.S. coach. Klinsmann took the German national team all the way to the World Cup semifinals in 2006. More importantly, he changed the way the Germans played. He turned a defense-minded squad into hungry goal-seekers. He's instilled those same traits on the U.S. team. ""We know how dangerous Team USA can be if we only play at 90% and not take them seriously,"" said German player Mesu Oezil. Need more? Germany may have peaked. The team decimated Portugal in its first game, but looked sluggish against Ghana. The U.S. was potent in its first match; even better in its second. Need a third? The last time the teams met -- in a ""friendly"" in June of last year -- USA beat Germany 4-3. A ""friendly"" match is a game arranged between teams outside tournament competition. Who you should watch . Germany's Thomas Muller. He is one of only two players who've scored a hat trick in this tournament -- that's 3 goals in one game. (The other is Switzerland's Xherdan Shaqiri.) Hat tricks are rare -- and a true measure of a striker's prowess. On the U.S. side, Clint Dempsey won't disappoint. He scored the sixth-fastest goal in World Cup history when he plowed one in 29 seconds into Team USA's opener with Ghana. He took a foot to the face, broke his nose -- and returned in the game against Portugal to score again. Expect a comeback from Michael Bradley. He's been a disappointment so far. He kept losing the ball during the Ghana match. And even though he was much, much better in the second U.S. outing, it was he who lost the ball that led Portugal to tie the game. He'll be looking to redeem his reputation as ""Il Generale"" (the General), a nickname Italian fans bestowed on him when he played for the club, Roma, for his ability to take charge and score goals. Who won't be there . Reliable goal scorer Jozy Altidore, who strained his hamstring in the opener. He sat out the Portugal game and has to sit out this one too. What should you ignore . Any talk of the two teams conspiring to settle for a tie. If the U.S. and Germany play to a draw, both advance to the second round. This has led some soccer fans to grouse that given Klinsmann's close relationship with the German coach, the two may strike some sort of backroom deal. Joachim Loew was Klinsmann's assistant when he coached the German national team. The two are now close friends. Also, Team USA's roster is stacked with five German-Americans who will now go head-to-head with the same players they grew up with. But both coaches have rejected any talk of colluding. ""'I don't think that we are made for draws,"" Klinsmann said after the Portugal encounter. ""'I think both teams go into this game and they want to win the group.'' Loew is equally dismissive. ""When you want to draw, it never works. It's impossible,"" he said. ""Always, the aim is to win the match."" What should the U.S. do . In Tim Howard, the U.S has one of the best goal keepers in the world. But he will be tested big time by a relentless German attack. So, the U.S. has to try and go for an early goal, like it did with Ghana. Aside from an incredible morale boost, it's better than trying to keep Germany at bay for 90 minutes. How can the U.S. advance . There are several scenarios. The obvious is to beat Germany outright. Team USA would get three points for the victory, giving it seven. No other team in the group can match that, so the Americans go through to the next stage. It goes through even with a tie. That gives both five points. But if the U.S. loses, things get complicated. It'll then depend on the outcome of the other Ghana-Portugal game, which will be going on at the same time. Portugal wins by a narrow margin, USA still comes second in the group and goes through. That's because Portugal is way down in the point count. But if Ghana wins by two or more, it'll be the Africans and not the Americans who advance -- making this the third World Cup in a row where Ghana eliminates Team USA. Who will win . Expect a desperate scramble to score a first goal. Whoever scores first gets the edge. However, if the game is still scoreless, say, in the 60th minute, expect both Germany and the U.S. to pull back and settle for a draw. 5 things: What to watch for today .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Michael Jackson's mother told jurors she filed a wrongful death lawsuit against AEG Live ""because I want to know what really happened to my son."" Katherine Jackson, likely the final witness as her lawyers conclude their wrongful death case against the pop icon's last concert promoter, began her testimony Friday and will conclude it Monday in a Los Angeles court. ""The most difficult thing is to sit here in the court and listen to all the bad things they say about my son,"" Jackson testified. The 83-year-old matriarch of the world's most famous entertainment family sat on the front row in the small courtroom for most of the 51 previous days of testimony. ""A lot of the facts that have been said are not the truth,"" she said. She said contrary to what an AEG Live executive wrote in an e-mail as Jackson prepared for his comeback concerts in 2009, her son was not lazy. But she especially objected to an e-mail from AEG parent company's general counsel that called Jackson ""a freak"" on the same day his company's top executives were going to his house to sign the ""This Is It"" tour contract. ""He's not here to speak for himself,"" his mother said. She said she would ""try my best"" to speak for the pop icon. Jurors leaned forward and listened closely during Jackson's testimony and as her lawyer showed them video of her son performing as a child. The lawsuit filed by Katherine Jackson and on behalf of the singer's three children contends AEG Live is liable for the death of Jackson because it hired, retained or supervised Dr. Conrad Murray. The doctor was convicted of involuntary manslaughter. AEG Live argues it was Jackson, not their company, who chose and controlled Murray, who admitted giving Jackson nightly infusions of a surgical anesthetic the coroner ruled killed him. Its executives had no way of knowing about the dangerous treatments Murray was giving Jackson in the privacy of his bedroom, AEG Live lawyers contend. ""Why are you here?"" Jackson lawyer Brian Panish asked Katherine . ""Because I want to know what really happened to my son,"" she said. ""And that's why I am here."" Panish asked Jackson how it made her feel to have been asked probing and personal questions about her family by AEG Live lawyer Marvin Putnam during a dozen hours of deposition testimony. ""It makes me feel real bad, because my son was a very good person,"" she said. ""He loved everybody, he gave to charity, he was in the Guinness Book of World Records for giving to charity."" Putnam faces the challenge of not appearing unkind to Katherine Jackson while also trying to discredit her testimony. ""Forget it,"" she said as she stopped before answering Putnam's question about why she initially included, and later dropped show director Kenny Ortega as a defendant in her lawsuit. ""Forget what ma'am?"" Putnam asked. Jackson remained silent for about a minute, staring back at Putnam. Would it help to reread the question, he asked. ""No, it wouldn't be helpful,"" Jackson answered curtly. The judge finally ordered the question stricken from the record because the answer involved privileged discussions with her lawyers. Jackson returned to the stand after the lunch break but she told the judge she was tired after just a few more minutes of questioning by Putnam. The judge sent jurors home two hours early and will allow Katherine Jackson to resume her testimony Monday morning. If jurors decide that AEG Live is liable in Jackson's death, they could award damages based on the loss of the mother's and children's relationship with him and the amount of money he was unable to earn because his life was cut short. The wrongful death trial is about to get a lot uglier, if defense lawyers live up to the promise of their opening statements. AEG Live lawyers this week brought up the child molestation charges against Jackson and the 2002 incident in which the pop star ""dangled"" his infant son on a Berlin hotel balcony. Touring till 66? Paris Jackson made another appearance in the trial this week -- via a video of her deposition in March. Jurors saw a clip of AEG Live lawyer Putnam asking the 15-year-old what her father told her about his ""This Is It"" tour: . Putnam: ""Did he explain to you how long the tour was going to last?"" Paris: ""I assume a long time since it was a world tour, but those usually last a long time"" Putnam: ""How did you understand it was a world tour?"" Paris: ""Because he told us."" Putnam: ""What did he tell you?"" Paris: ""That we were going around the world on tour."" Certified public accountant Arthur Erk, who has managed and audited the business affairs of many top artists, testified Wednesday that he is ""reasonably certain"" that Jackson would have performed 260 shows around the world as part of his ""This Is It"" tour. He would have earned $890 million over the three years of concerts in Europe, Asia, South America, North America and Australia, Erk said. Jackson would have earned at least $1.5 billion from touring, endorsements and sponsorships had he not died preparing for his comeback tour, Erk said. AEG Live's unprecedented sellout of 50 shows scheduled for London's O2 Arena in 2009 and 2010 proved there was ""pent-up demand"" to see Jackson live, despite controversies that had tarnished his reputation in the years since his last tour in 1998, Erk said. An e-mail from AEG Live CEO Randy Phillips said fans bought all 750,000 tickets put on sale for 31 shows in March 2009 in just two hours. Enough buyers were registered to sell out another 100 shows, Phillips wrote. ""Dude, we're going to sell out a ridiculous amount of tickets,"" AEG Live Co-CEO Paul Gongaware wrote in an e-mail. ""We've got to get Mikey to add more shows."" Jackson's manager quickly approved another 19 shows, bringing the total to 50. ""Ten million tickets for the rest of the world? They would have gobbled up those tickets in seconds,"" Erk said. AEG Live lawyer Sabrina Strong challenged Erk's estimate, asking if any other act has ever made as much money on a tour. ""No,"" he said. ""This would have been a record-breaking world tour."" Jackson would have done another 195 shows over four more world tours before retiring from the road at age 66, Erk predicted. Putnam called Erk's estimates ""a creation, a fabrication"" which suggests Jackson would have made more after age 50 that he did in the three tours during the ""height of his fame."" Jackson never intended to perform after the 50 shows in London, Putnam said. AEG Live showed jurors a video clip of Katherine Jackson's deposition, in which she said her son would joke that he ""didn't want to be moonwalking on stage at 50."" ""Michael said that quite a few years back and he was joking,"" his mother explained in her testimony Friday. ""I thought it was funny and most of us said things like that. I used to think 50 was very old."" In fact, Jackson was 50 when he signed a three-year contract with AEG Live for his comeback tour, which would have likely included his famous moonwalk dance steps as he performed ""Billie Jean."" ""We announced that we're going to have one tour in London, that's what was announced, and it was called 'This Is It,' meaning in London, this show is it,"" he said. ""This show is it. This is the last thing he's ever going to do. As a result of this being his final performance ever, to be at the O2 in London, there was enormous response, understandably, and therefore we sold 50 shows."" With the Jackson case ending -- which Putnam called ""ridiculous"" -- ""now we're going to start to show what actually occurred here,"" he said. No Conrad Murray testimony . AEG Live's defense team confirmed Wednesday that they would not be calling Murray to testify. ""I have no intention of calling him myself, unless it's requested, your honor,"" Putnam said, replying to the judge's question about his plans. Until now, AEG Live lawyers have suggested they might call Murray, who is serving a four-year jail sentence for involuntary manslaughter, to the witness stand. Murray's lawyer gave the Jackson and AEG Live lawyers a sworn statement from the doctor before the trial began stating that he would invoke his constitutional protection against self-incrimination by refusing to answer questions if subpoenaed. See you in September . Jurors, who were told when the trial started in April that it could end sometime in August, appeared unfazed when Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Yvette Palazuelos told them this week that it is likely to extend into mid-September. Putnam estimated this week that he needs about 30 days in court to present his defense after the plaintiffs rest. The jurors often have laughed and smiled in reaction to testimony and the interplay between Jackson lead lawyer Brian Panish, the judge and the AEG defense team. For example, when Palazuelos ordered Panish to turn around and face the bench while AEG attorney Sabrina Strong cross-examined Erk, jurors seemed amused. Panish, whose seat was just in front of Strong's lectern, had been looking directly up at her at close range. There were no laughs in the hallway after court on Tuesday when Panish and Putnam exchanged words. The two lawyers were standing about 15 feet apart, each talking to reporters, when they began directing their words at each other. The court clerk interrupted the heated conversation, threatening to summon deputies. Palazuelos lectured the lawyers in her chambers the next morning and imposed new rules that bar them from speaking to journalists in the hallway.","Jackson matriarch Katherine Jackson: ""A lot of the facts that have been said are not the truth""

"(CNN) -- ""High School Musical"" star Ashley Tisdale is now Mrs. Christopher French. The 29-year-old actress married French, the lead singer of the band Annie Automatic, on Monday. According to E!, Tisdale and French followed in the footsteps of stars like Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie and Neil Patrick Harris and kept their ceremony relatively private. The reported 100 guests in attendance are said to have been shuttled to the wedding's private venue from a different location in an attempt to keep the nuptials under wraps.

"(CNN) -- Our Labor Day weekend trip around the ""Inside Politics"" table included GOP jitters over Kansas, the 2016 impact of President Obama's immigration deliberations, progressive worries about Elizabeth Warren's hawkish foreign policy views, and Republican angst about a research project that was designed to help but may have done more harm then good. 1. As Democrats look for 2014 ""steals,"" there's no place like Kansas? We talked for months about how GOP Sen. Pat Roberts of Kansas was hardly a top performer in his primary race against a tea party challenger. But Roberts survived, and so the first reflex was to say, OK -- it's Kansas. Lock that Senate seat in for the GOP. Not so fast. A number of top Republican strategists who have seen the latest research say it is now hardly a sure thing. These strategists are furious with Roberts personally, and even more so with a campaign team they say has not risen to the challenge. So there is mounting pressure on the other Kansas senator, Jerry Moran, who just happens to lead the National Republican Senatorial Committee. I'm told leading GOP voices are pushing the NRSC to get more aggressive, including pushing for a shakeup in the Roberts campaign team. And in the GOP super PAC community, there are conversations that it might become necessary to spend money in a state that no one thought would be -- or should be -- on a 2014 list of potential Democratic pickups. It's important because the GOP needs a gain of six seats to win the Senate majority; if it lost a Republican-held seat, it would have to win another Democratic seat to net six. And while the GOP super PACs are seemingly flush with money, the 65-day clock to Election Day will force choices -- and if there need to be sudden investments in Kansas, a few GOP challengers in other states could see their outside help shrink. 2. Maybe not all knowledge is good . The GOP has a gender problem. So the GOP did some research on its gender problem. Makes perfect sense, right? Well, Politico's Maggie Haberman took us inside a Republican debate on that very question. Maybe if this private research by Crossroads GPS and the American Action Network had stayed private, it would be viewed as helpful. But Haberman's Politico colleagues got hold of it and outlined how some women view the GOP as intolerant or stuck in the past. Let the recriminations begin. ""This infuriated a number of Republicans, who privately said -- and some of them less privately -- they thought this was completely undermining, they couldn't understand the purpose of this, that this is at cross ends to what the GOP is trying to do in the final couple of months of a very difficult midterm,"" said Haberman. 3. A ""waveless"" GOP win? Amy Walter of the Cook Political Report says her analysis suggests Republicans cannot count on a big midterm wave this year -- like the one they enjoyed in 2010 or the one Democrats rode to midterm gains in 2006. But no wave doesn't necessarily mean no wins; Walter says it is still more than within reason -- and reach -- that we'll see the Republicans get the net gain of six Senate seats they need to capture the Senate majority. ""What we have come to find, every election, is that you don't see it coming until Election Day, but one side or the other, almost always, the races break disproportionately their way -- 55, 60, 65%,"" said Walter. ""So that's more of the question than waiting for a big fat wave to hit us the day after Labor Day."" 4. Immigration pressures on Democrats and 2016 field . The White House promises some executive actions on immigration, though there are now indications more controversial decisions might be pushed back until after the November election. As we await final word, Bloomberg's Lisa Lerer highlighted jitters among some Democrats in tight races this year but also said any Obama action this year would put pressure on the 2016 class of Republican presidential contenders. ""Last week, Rand Paul was in Guatemala,"" said Lerer. ""He said it was part of his annual medical mission trip, but he brought his political staff, reporters and a film crew with an aerial drone."" Lerer also pointed out that New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie is taking his second trip out of the country as governor next week and the destination is -- Mexico. 5. Liberal worries about Warren . Liberals love when Elizabeth Warren goes after big banks and pushes her populist economic views. But Nia-Malika Henderson of The Washington Post reports that some progressives are now getting a bit wary -- coming to the conclusion that on some big foreign policy questions, the Massachusetts senator sounds, disturbingly to them, a lot like Hillary Clinton. ""She essentially said that Israelis have the right to defend themselves and in the question of sort of civilian casualties, she essentially says that, well, it's Hamas' fault because they have put rocket launchers next to schools and in hospitals,"" said Henderson. So over these next weeks, Democrats will watch to see what Warren says about Syria and ISIS and what she does on her trip to Israel in November.","A number of top Republican strategists say a GOP win in Kansas is now hardly a sure thing .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Israel harvested organs from bodies in the 1990s without permission of family members, the former head of a state-run forensic laboratory said in a newly released interview. Government officials acknowledge that the practice happened, but emphasize that it ended years ago. In an interview in 2000, which was released to an Israeli TV channel and broadcast over the weekend, Dr. Yehuda Hiss -- who was once head of the Abu Kabir forensic institute -- discussed the practice. ""We started to harvest corneas for various hospitals in Israel,"" Hiss said in the interview on Israel's Channel 2 network. ""Whatever was done was highly informal. No permission was asked from the families,"" he said. Hiss said the harvesting also included heart valves, skin and bones. He was speaking to an American researcher, who recently gave the tape to the Israeli network. An Israeli Ministry of Health spokeswoman, Einav Shimron-Grinboim, issued a statement saying the practice discussed in the report was ""an old story that ended years ago"" and that in the vast majority of cases, the actions were done to Israelis, including soldiers. Procedures were not clear at the time and have since been clarified, she said. None of the practices led to charges, she said. The report said organs were at times also harvested from Palestinians and foreign workers. In the interview, Hiss was asked about the legality of such practices. ""It wasn't clear,"" he said, adding that he thought families were supposed to be asked for permission. After getting permission from family members to perform an autopsy, ""we felt free"" to harvest organs, he said. Organs were not harvested if it was believed relatives might discover it, he said, adding that in some cases glue was used to close eyelids to hide missing corneas. The report included a statement from the military, the Israel Defense Forces, saying the activity ceased a decade ago. The report also described how for years the Abu Kabir institute, ""supplied not just tragic passing announcements but also news about organs donated for transplants which saved the lives of hundreds of patients."" The report comes four months after a different allegation about organ harvesting in Israel. An opinion piece published in a Swedish newspaper in August suggested the Israeli army kidnapped and killed young Palestinians to harvest their organs in the 1990s. The writer, Donald Bostrom, told CNN he had no proof that Israeli soldiers were stealing organs, and that the purpose of his piece was to call for an investigation. The article triggered a dispute between Sweden and Israel. While the Swedish Embassy distanced itself from the report, the country's foreign ministry refused to condemn it, saying Sweden has a free press. Israeli Finance Minister Yuval Steinitz called it ""an anti-Semitic blood libel against the Jewish people and the Jewish state."" It was after hearing about that uproar that American anthropologist Nancy Scheper-Hughes, a professor at the University of California at Berkeley, decided to release the tape of the interview she conducted with Hiss in 2000, Israel's Channel 2 reported. Scheper-Hughes told the network that she does not believe Israel murdered Palestinians for organs. But the admission of harvesting organs, including skin, at times from Palestinians, struck her, she said. ""The symbolism of taking skin out of a population that is considered to be the enemy and using it for skin for the military, that's something that -- just in terms of symbolic weight -- has to be reconsidered,"" she told Channel 2. The forensic institute at Abu Kabir, where Hiss still works, received complaints about improper practices regarding organ harvesting that culminated in an investigation and a change of management. The current manager, Assaf Harofe Hospital, issued a statement saying, ""The committee which examined the said matters have determined that there were purely managerial malfunctions, but as a result of their findings Professor Hiss lost his position as the manager of the institute."" Managerial responsibility was changed and new procedures were put in place, the statement said. Hiss could not be reached for comment. Earlier this year, there was another unrelated controversy involving Israel and organs. In July, U.S. authorities charged a New York man with trying to arrange the private sale of a kidney from a donor in Israel. CNN's Kevin Flower and Guy Azriel contributed to this report .","Israeli Ministry of Health: Practice is ""an old story that ended years ago""

"(CNN) -- Could a floating dome that can house up to 10,000 people be a model for future living? Russian architect Alexander Remizov thinks so -- and his prototype design, called ""The Ark,"" bears more than a passing resemblance to the classic children's toy, the Slinky. Remizov believes his Ark, designed to be constructed from timber, steel and high-strength ETFE plastic, could be adapted for all kinds of environments and put to a number of different uses, including emergency housing -- its prefabricated structure should allow it to be constructed quickly -- and hotels. He's even suggested a variation with a honeycomb-style hull that can float. After completing a Masters degree looking at non-polluting settlements, Remizov decided to pursue that theme with his architecture firm Remistudio and design a modern building that would be in harmony with the environment. He says that he took a holistic approach to the problems of providing power to The Ark, working with colleague Lev Britvin on energy solutions to keep it in balance with the environment. A wind power generator that runs through the center of the building would provide power while the outer surface would be covered with transparent solar panels. If the Ark was built on water, as Remizov suggests, he says it could also utilize thermal water energy. ""The form of a dome promotes the formation of turbulences of air, strengthening the work of wind generators,"" wrote Remizov in an email to CNN. ""Inside the building, the dome form promotes accumulation of warm air in the top part of a building,"" he continued. ""This heat will be transformed to other kinds of energy and collects also in thermal accumulators."" While still on the drawing board, Remizov believes The Ark could be used for many purposes from apartments to offices and hotels, and be built on different scales to house between 50 and 10,000 people. The way in which the Ark could be assembled from ready-made structures would reduce the cost of construction, suggests Remizov, who estimates that it would be comparable to the cost of energy-efficient ""green"" buildings. ""Lightweight materials, such as coating film, light design of the foundation, no insulation due to the presence of the buffer zone, reduce the weight structures, which would lead to cheaper construction,"" he said.","The Ark is designed to be a multi-use environmentally friendly building .

"(CNN) -- The pings detected by the crew aboard an Australian navy ship in the southern Indian Ocean have given those searching for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 renewed hopes of finding the missing plane. Australian officials leading the search said the signals picked up Sunday were consistent with those transmitted by an aircraft's flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder. But the officials warned that they still need further evidence, such as a visual sighting of wreckage on the seafloor. ""There are many steps yet before these detections can be positively verified as being from missing Flight MH370,"" Angus Houston, the head of the Australian agency coordinating search operations, said Monday. Here's an explanation of what the next phases are in the underwater hunt for traces of the passenger jet. Do searchers have enough pings to figure out where they're coming from? No, not yet. The Ocean Shield, an Australian navy ship that's slowly towing a pinger locator through the water, is going back and forth over the area where it twice picked up a signal Sunday. ""The focus is on trying to reacquire the acoustic signal they had 24 hours ago,"" said Commodore Peter Leavy, who is coordinating military contributions to the search. As of Monday morning, the high-tech pinger locator, supplied by the U.S. Navy, hadn't redetected the pings, officials said. ""Probably for the next 24 hours, Ocean Shield will continue its runs back and forth over the area,"" Houston said. Why is it crisscrossing the same area? The aim is to use triangulation to pinpoint the location of whatever is transmitting the pings, according to Cmdr. William Marks of the U.S. 7th Fleet. ""For us in the Navy, this is kind of our bread and butter,"" he told CNN. The crew of the ship does this by towing the pinger locator along a series of intersecting lines across a relatively small area of ocean. If the sound is picked up along three different lines that cross at the same point, ""that's a pretty positive indication of where the signal's coming from,"" Marks said. But it's a slow and painstaking business. By the end of its runs Tuesday, Ocean Shield expects to have thoroughly covered only a 3-mile-by-3-mile box, according to Leavy. Each run across the area takes the ship seven to eight hours. That's because it's moving slowly -- at about 3 knots (3.5 mph) -- and because turning around with the huge length of cable that's dragging the pinger locator through the ocean depths is a delicate, drawn-out process. What happens if they pick up another signal in that area? At that point, they will deploy an unmanned underwater vehicle that's on board the Ocean Shield, the Bluefin-21. The vehicle, also from the United States, is able to generate maps of the bottom of the ocean and ""determine if there's something unusual on the seafloor, like aircraft wreckage,"" said Houston. ""In the event of finding something unusual, the autonomous vehicle will come back to the surface and will then be fitted with a camera,"" he said. ""And hopefully, we would then be able to pick up imagery."" But one potential problem is that the water in the area the Ocean Shield is searching is about 4,500 meters (14,800 feet) deep, the limit of the Bluefin's range. ""We're right on the edge of capability,"" Houston said. If the area of the seabed where the pings are coming from is any deeper, then the search crews would need remotely operated vehicles that can go even farther down. Houston said officials are looking into what other vehicles could be deployed, if needed. What if they don't pick up another signal? If the pings the Ocean Shield's crew have detected are from Flight 370, they could cease at any moment. The batteries powering the locator beacons on the missing plane's flight recorders could already have expired. At the very most, they could last another week or so. Without another signal, the members of the search team will have to take a look at what information they have been able to gather. ""If we're unable to fix the location, the people who are out there have to do an analysis of everything they've got and make an assessment of whether they would deploy the underwater vehicle in the most likely area,"" Houston said. ""I would anticipate that's what will happen: The underwater vehicle will be deployed and continue the work,"" he said. But that would mean searchers have far less precision than they would hope to have when searching waters so deep. ""If we have a large area of uncertainty, it will take several days to actually cover what would appear to be a fairly small area,"" Houston said. ""Things happen very slowly at the depths we're dealing with.""","An Australian navy ship is expected to keep searching a small area into Tuesday .
It is trying to regain a signal that it picked up Sunday that could be from Flight 370 .
If it detects the pings again, it will deploy an underwater vehicle that can look for wreckage .
Without a new signal, the possible area will be larger and take longer to search ."
"(CNN) -- There's a great story about Democratic icon Ted Kennedy. When he was first running to succeed his brother John in the Senate, he was attacked for being a child of privilege. It was true. Kennedy had nannies and nursemaids and private schools. He'd hobnobbed with ambassadors and princes and popes. So the story -- perhaps not even true, but what the heck -- is that young Teddy was campaigning outside a factory in the predawn chill. As he shook hands with the working men, one stopped him and said, ""So you're young Kennedy? They say you haven't worked a day in your life."" To which Kennedy shrugged and answered, ""I suppose that's true."" And the man replied, ""You ain't missed a thing."" Democrats have a tradition of electing aristocratic populists. Franklin Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy were patricians. And one of the senior Democrats in the Senate today is as rich as a Rockefeller. His name is Jay Rockefeller. Since 1977, first as governor of West Virginia, then senator, he has been elected and re-elected by the coal miners and farm families of West Virginia. So the current hyperventilation over Hillary Clinton's comments about her relative wealth and her lucrative book and speaking deals misses the point. Voters want to know what's in her heart and what's on her mind, not what's in her wallet. Clinton was already wealthy when she ran for president in 2008. Yet in the primary in Pennsylvania -- a bastion of blue-collar voters -- she bested Barack Obama by 12 points among voters earning between $30,000 and $50,000 a year, according to CNN exit polls. FDR, JFK, Jay Rockefeller and all the other wealthy Democrats were seen as champions of working people. Same with Clinton. All her life, she has been a tireless advocate for the middle class and those struggling to get into the middle class. From her days at the Children's Defense Fund to her advocacy for the rights of women and girls around the world, Clinton has a consistent record of fighting for middle-class economics and middle-class values. As an adviser to the super PAC that hammered Mitt Romney's business record, let me explain why Clinton's case is different. The issue was never how much money Romney had; it was how he made that money. When you amass a megafortune in part by taking over companies, loading them with debt, plunging them into bankruptcy while paying yourself millions -- well, folks don't like that. And when Romney combined that Gordon Gekko image with an agenda that included cutting taxes for the rich and making Medicare a voucher program, voters got the sense that he was not on their side. There is a dichotomy of elitism. Republicans' downfall is economic elitism. For generations they've been seen as the party of the rich. Democrats don't have that problem. Their Achilles' heel is cultural elitism: the sense that they value highfalutin' Ivy League degrees more than practical experience; that they look down their noses at folks who go to church, hunt and fish, and salute the flag. Both are caricatures, to be sure. But as a Democratic strategist I am always more worried about cultural elitism than a Democrat's wealth. And remember: George W. Bush had degrees from both Harvard and Yale but was seen as a down-home guy you could have a beer with. There's no doubt that this is a populist moment. Americans worry about the collapse of the American Dream and the shrinking of the middle class. If Clinton runs on an agenda of empowering working people -- with an increase in the minimum wage, equal pay for women, student debt relief, increased availability of child care, prekindergarten, and an end to tax breaks for corporations that ship jobs overseas -- few voters will care how fat her bank account is.","Paul Begala: Democrats have tradition of electing aristocratic populists like Kennedy, FDR .

"(CNN) -- It's still not clear what the future holds for Nittany Lions football after a child sex abuse scandal implicated top Penn State officials and placed a former assistant coach behind bars. That was the message from National Collegiate Athletic Association President Mark Emmert, who spoke with PBS in his first public comment on the matter during an interview broadcast Monday. Emmert said he doesn't want to ""take anything off the table"" regarding NCAA-imposed penalties, adding that he'd ""never seen anything as egregious as this in terms of just overall conduct and behavior inside a university."" ""What the appropriate penalties are, if there are determinations of violations, we'll have to decide,"" he said. New Sandusky accusations date back to1970s . The possibility for the so-called ""death penalty"" -- meaning the potential cancellation of some state grants, recruiting activities and up to two football seasons -- has since drummed-up questions of whether Penn State will lose a huge revenue generator just as analysts predict a flood of lawsuits following Jerry Sandusky's conviction and a scathing internal review. ""They are going to get pounded in civil litigation,"" said CNN legal analyst Paul Callan, after a university-funded report blamed school officials for empowering Sandusky to continue his abuse. The 267-page review -- led by former FBI Director Louis Freeh -- implicated ousted university president Graham Spanier, fired head coach Joe Paterno and ex-administrators Gary Schultz and Tim Curley, whose attorneys blasted the findings, calling the report a ""lopsided document"" that lacked access to critical witnesses. More storms looming for Penn State in wake of Freeh report . Oral arguments for pretrial motions against Curley and Schultz are scheduled for the morning of August 16 in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. The two men are charged with lying to the grand jury and failing to report child sexual attacks. Sandusky, meanwhile, is awaiting sentencing on 45 counts of abuse. But attorneys for Spanier said in a statement Tuesday that Freeh investigators ignored ""the conclusions of a far more independent and thorough investigation of Dr. Graham Spanier conducted simultaneously by federal officials responsible for our national security."" ""Dr. Spanier has for some time held a top secret security clearance in connection with his work with the federal government. This clearance required a re-review when the Sandusky matter surfaced in November,"" the statement said. ""Federal investigators then conducted a four-month investigation of their own in which they interviewed many of the same individuals the Freeh group interviewed and other relevant individuals Freeh did not interview. At the conclusion of the investigation the government reaffirmed Dr. Spanier's clearance."" The ex president's attorneys then blasted Freeh -- who offered no comment Tuesday in response to the accusations -- for not mentioning that investigation in his report. Read the report here (PDF) Meanwhile, the scandal's potential for further repercussions seems to be on the minds of many in the football-dominated town of State College. ""I think it's crazy to make the students suffer,"" said Tierra Briscoe, a 21-year-old senior. ""What about the seniors?"" she asked rhetorically. ""It's unfair that they have to suffer for other people's actions."" The NCAA imposed similar sanctions against Southern Methodist University following a payments-to-athletes scandal in 1987, forcing that school to give up the following football season. And while Paterno earned an almost cult-like following among Penn State fans during his 61 years of coaching, vestiges of his legacy have gradually disappeared after Freeh's report determined that Paterno could have done more to stop the attacks and may not have told the grand jury all that he knew. On Tuesday, Brown University -- where in 1950 Paterno earned a English Literature degree -- approved a decision to permanently remove his name from the school's annual award for outstanding male freshman athlete, in place since 1993. The school is also currently reviewing his status as a part of Brown's Athletic Hall of Fame, where he was inducted in 1977. At State College, student organizers changed the name of a popular camp-out ahead of football games from ""Paternoville"" to ""Nittanyville,"" while on a famous local mural, a halo painted above the image of the former head coach was removed. Airborne banner: Take down Paterno statue . Name changes also took hold at the Nike headquarters in Beaverton, Oregon, with the firm's president announcing earlier this month that it would swap out the name of the Joe Paterno Child Development Center, a child care facility at the company's headquarters. And while no decision has yet been made on the fate of the famous Paterno statue that stands outside Beaver Stadium, a small plane flew over campus Tuesday carrying a banner that read, ""Take the Statue Down or We Will."" Others, however, continue to show support for their old coach, who died in January from lung cancer. ""I think his statute needs to remain where it is,"" Briscoe said. ""He built up half our school, and was not only a coach. He was a philanthropist."" The school's board of trustees, whose firing of Paterno prompted student protests, also showed its support for the former coach while pledging reforms and vowing to hold the school more accountable. Last week, the board made it made clear that it would back a lucrative retirement deal the university made with Paterno in the same month that he testified to the grand jury. The woman who stood up to Joe Paterno . ""Contracts are contracts,"" board of trustees chair Karen Peetz said Friday during a trustee meeting in Scranton, Pennsylvania. ""And no, there's no plan to (change) that."" According to the university website, Paterno's amended contract -- which now benefits his estate -- was finalized in August 2011 and totaled $5.5 million in payouts and benefits, which included a $3 million bonus and title as head football coach emeritus if he retired at the end of the 2011 season. The package, which was published online in April, also included a $425,000 head coach bonus, $900,000 in television and radio revenue, $250,000 in debt forgiveness, use of the university's luxury box, use of the school's hydrotherapy equipment and $1,000 monthly payment to Paterno's wife for the rest of her life, among other benefits.

"(CNN) -- The Army sergeant accused of leading his men to kill innocent Afghan civilians kept a personal body count of skull tattoos and associated with white supremacists online, according to interviews conducted by military investigators. Staff Sgt. Calvin Gibbs and four soldiers under his command have been charged with murder in the deaths of three civilian men in Afghanistan. And CNN has learned the Army is also re-examining a 2004 shooting that involved Gibbs in Iraq in which three members of a family were killed. After his May 11 arrest in Afghanistan, Gibbs showed investigators a tattoo on his lower left leg depicting crossed pistols and six skulls. He told investigators the skulls were a way to keep track of his kills in both Iraq and Afghanistan, according to investigative interview notes shown to CNN. And a soldier under his command told investigators Gibbs ""associates with skinheads online,"" the investigative notes show. The soldier, who is not charged, told investigators the skinheads ""are worse than most gang members I have ever met."" Gibbs is among 12 soldiers from the Army's 5th Stryker Brigade who have been charged in a military investigation stemming from their service in Afghanistan. In addition to the five, including Gibbs, who are charged with premeditated murder, seven more soldiers face charges ranging from conspiracy and interfering in a military investigation to drug use, specifically smoking hashish while in Afghanistan. The Afghanistan killings took place between January and May, when members of Gibbs' platoon admit they were heavily smoking hashish, some of it laced with opium, according to investigators. According to investigative documents made available to CNN, Gibbs collected human fingers from his victims. Also, the Army has accused members of Gibbs' platoon of possessing photographs of victims. Gibbs' attorney has declined comment on the allegations, saying he is still reviewing the case. When contacted at her home, a woman who identified herself as the sergeant's mother also refused to comment. On Army interrogation tapes obtained by CNN, members of Gibbs' platoon say they fear him. ""I take that man very seriously,"" said Spc. Adam Winfield, who also faces premeditated murder charges. ""He likes to kill things. He is pretty much evil incarnate."" Winfield added, ""I have never met a man who can go from one minute joking around, then mindless killings. I mean, he likes to kill things."" Eric Montalvo, an attorney for Winfield, told CNN his client ""is not guilty of premeditated murder."" The Army did investigate a fourth killing in Afghanistan involving a man who approached the platoon and refused to follow orders to stop and lift up his shirt. Soldiers fired after the man refused to heed warnings to stop -- which were yelled in Pashto, a commonly spoken language in Afghanistan, according to documents provided to CNN. And CNN has learned the Army is now re-examining Gibbs' record in Iraq, where he was involved in the killing of an Iraqi family in the summer of 2004. According to an Army report on the incident, U.S. troops on foot in the northern city of Kirkuk opened fire on a car that approached them, swerving, from behind. Troops feared the vehicle was a possible car bomb, the report states. When the shooting stopped, two adults and a child were dead and another child was wounded, the report states. CNN's Courtney Yager, Kathleen Johnston and Scott Zamost contributed to this report.","Staff Sgt. Calvin Gibbs is one of five soldiers charged with killing Afghan civilians .

"TUOL SAMBO, Cambodia (CNN) -- Van Thy says the government evicted her from her home in the Cambodian capital and trucked her and others out to a town an hour away where she now lives in a hot green metal shed with no running water and dim prospects. Many Cambodian AIDS patients and their families have been relocated to this community outside Tuol Sambo. Before the move, she had a job as a dishwasher, but now the 36-year-old woman is unemployed, penniless and her health has taken a turn for the worse. She has AIDS like many of the others in the 40 AIDS-affected families that were resettled here. ""We were called for a meeting and when I got there, a lot of trucks were already prepared. There was no meeting. They told us to prepare our stuff for moving out,"" she said, her voice trembling as she detailed her departure from the Phnom Penh shantytown she called home for nine years. ""Everybody cried the day we left."" As Cambodia emerges from the 1970s Khmer Rouge genocide and decades of conflict, evictions for development purposes have become a hot issue, with rights groups and upset villagers living on desirable land launching protests in recent years. But what sets the families apart at Tuol Sambo is that they have AIDS. ""The problems that this community face are not unlike problems that people face throughout the country,"" said Kathleen O'Keefe, an independent consultant focusing on HIV/AIDS and land issues. ""What has made these problems extreme is that they have been isolated and treated as a community"" and their relocation has added ""additional problems, like real health risks of many immune compromised people living far too close together. This place would be a health risk to healthy people."" This is the second relocation for many of these families. They had been living in a shantytown in the Cambodian capital, an area called Borei Keila that was across the street from a hospital where they received medical care and where they could find jobs to earn $1.25 or $1.50 a day. O'Keefe said they had lived dispersed throughout the community but were forced to move into one building there in 2007 when the area started to undergo development. ""They were segregated into a green building, which very quickly became known as the ... AIDS village,"" O'Keefe said. ""This AIDS colony in Tuol Sambo is the second time they are being even further isolated ... it's been an extremely traumatic situation for them."" O'Keefe said most of the families that were moved to Tuol Sambo told her they have lost their jobs, their health is worsening due to a lack of clean water and food, and they face discrimination from their new neighbors because of their illness. ""We feel very ashamed to go outside, they look like they [are] discriminating against us,"" Van Thy said. Phnom Penh Deputy Governor Mann Chhoeun said those who were relocated got a plot of land, a house and $275. He also noted they were provided rice, electricity and said, ""when the water supply can be connected to this area, then we can connect it for these people."" Mann Chhoeun said the people were illegally squatting in the Phnom Penh shantytown, but they were not forcefully evicted. ""They proposed to go ... because living in that area (their previous shantytown) they had floods and they have no proper business to do in there, so that's why they proposed to us to go there,"" he said. ""They think that when they go there (to Tuol Sambo), they can own the land, they can own a house and they can make some business or something like that."" He also said he did not believe there was discrimination in the area, ""but there is some feeling when they (people) learn that someone has been living with HIV/AIDS."" Van Thy said her new home has brought many challenges and a recent blood test showed that her CD4 count -- a marker of decreased immune function that is often used to demonstrate how well anti-HIV drugs are working, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -- had gone down. She said the doctor told her she needed to eat more, but she said having little money means eating less: ""It means that my health is getting worse,"" she said. The water in their new home is from a well and is undrinkable unless it is boiled or purified. ""We are patients, we need some clean water,"" she said. ""They said the water cannot be drunk, just for using to wash clothes and things like that."" Another man, Chheang Toma, takes the temperature inside his green shed at noon every day. On average, it is 35 degrees Celsius (95 degrees Fahrenheit) but one time spiked up to 50 Celsius (122). ""This area is very difficult,"" he said. ""I am always sick, and I always have a headache. The weather is so hot even my son has gone to the clinic two times already."" Home care specialist, Oum Vicheth, has been working with this community since 1998 and holds a clinic at Tuol Sambo once a week. He said the move ""has strongly affected them."" ""This is a long-term effect, not a short-term one, because medicine alone cannot help them. It combines with other factors like food, eating enough, sleeping enough and a good environment, so all this can help make their health stable,"" he said. ""The problem is right now that what these people are facing is about their food, about their sleep and about the heat. It's very hot. Sometimes this affects the quality of the medicine they keep."" Chheang Toma said his son, who is in first grade, heard that parents of local children told them not to play with him because he has HIV. ""He just told me that he wanted to play with those children but when they saw him they just run away,"" he said. ""I know right now some parents they just learning and understand about us, and they start to tolerate, but some others keep us in isolation -- like they still look at us, treating us very bad by not coming very close and not making friends with us."" Oum Vicheth said he was providing health care to the villagers as a way to bring them closer to the group, and they have held meetings with them about how HIV is contracted. ""There was very little thought given to integrating the community into the larger resettlement area of Tuol Sambo,"" said Tony Lisle, the UNAIDS country coordinator for Cambodia. ""By basically settling the community in one contiguous place it opens the community up to discrimination."" The U.N. team in Cambodia also ""was disappointed that the relocation was carried out before the site was made habitable"" and monitors would visit the site in late August, Lisle said. Teng Kunthy, secretary-general of the Cambodian government's National AIDS Authority, said the Tuol Sambo group's worries were about the housing, not their health care, since he said they still had good access to treatment, including home-based care, medicine and the help of charities. He said the housing situation could not be changed overnight, but it would improve ""step by step,"" and he also noted Tuol Sambo was an area the municipality wants to develop. ""The municipality has a plan for the future,"" he said. ""I asked the government to explain to them (the Tuol Sambo residents), to provide more information to them."" He also noted there was ""no serious discrimination"" in Cambodia against people with HIV/AIDS, but that the AIDS authority would try to ensure any such problems did not arise in the future. Back at Tuol Sambo, people think of the future and how they will make ends meet. One man in the community who has AIDS lost one job in the move but still has part-time work. He said things have improved with their new neighbors. ""When we first arrived here, the villagers around the area just said look at AIDS people living here and so they did not allow their children or relatives to come and play in this area and they don't talk to us. But now after seeing the home care specialist,"" things seem to be getting better with them, he said. Still, he and his friends from the old shantytown are not happy with their new lives. ""We are living with disappointment,"" he said.","Many of the people relocated by government to Tuol Sambo have AIDS .
They used to live in a shantytown near a hospital, their jobs .
Government says they were illegal squatters, they provided them money, services .
People say they have lost jobs, income, getting sick, lack clean water ."
"(CNN) -- It may have seemed like a good idea at the time but Mahiedine Mekhissi-Benabbad's bizarre celebration in the home straight of the men's 3,000m steeplechase at the European championships has cost him dear. Approaching the final barrier, the Frenchman had the race and gold medal in the bag, having enough time in hand to showboat by stripping off his running vest before putting it into his mouth and waving to the crowd. Fans in the Letzigrund Stadium in Zurich jeered as he crossed the finishing line clear of his teammate Yoann Kowal in eight minutes 25.30 seconds -- his third straight victory in the event at the championships after 2010 and 2012. The 29-year-old had the presence of mind to put his top back after the finish, but the damage was done. He was initially shown a yellow card as a warning by an official, but an appeal by Spain on behalf of fourth placed athlete Angel Mullera led to his disqualification. His French team lodged a counter-protest but that was rejected, with Mekhissi-Benabbad disqualified under IAAF competition rules 143.1, 143.7. -- relating to clothing and numbers. Mullera was promoted to the bronze as result of the ruling. ""I find that the protest lodged by the Spaniards is anti fair-play,"" Ghani Yalouzsa, the technical director of the French athletics federation, was quoted by AFP. But the double Olympic silver medalist is no stranger to controversy. After winning his 2012 Euro gold in Helsinki he was criticized for shoving a mascot who offered him a gift. The year before, Mekhissi-Benabbad was involved in a punch-up with French teammate Mehdi Baala at the 2011 Monaco Diamond League meeting, trading blows while they were still on the track and earning a five-month suspension from their federation.","French runner stripped of European gold in bizarre incident .

"(CNN) -- Justin Rose became the first English golfer in 43 years to win the U.S. Open on Sunday as Phil Mickelson failed to conjure up a 43rd birthday present for himself. The American finished as runner-up at the tournament for the sixth time, while the 32-year-old Rose ended his long wait for a major title as he triumphed by two shots after a tense final round in Pennsylvania. Mickelson needed to birdie the last hole to force a playoff -- which no-one had managed during the final round -- but he ended up dropping a shot and tying for second with Australia's Jason Day. World No. 3 Rose, who moved to Britain from South Africa as a five-year-old, launched himself onto the golf scene when he finished fourth at the 1998 British Open as the leading amateur. However, he missed the cut in his first 21 tournaments as a professional and took time to find his way after losing his father and mentor Ken to cancer in 2002. ""You saw me look to the heavens, with it being Father's Day -- I was just trying to remember my dad,"" Rose told reporters. He became the second first-time major winner this season, following Australian Adam Scott's victory at April's Masters, as he made up a two-shot deficit on Mickelson going into the final round. Mickelson made a terrible start, with two double-bogeys either side of a birdie within his opening five holes, and Rose had a share of the lead with Day at the halfway stage. Mickelson regained the lead with a superb eagle at the par-four 10th, but Rose bounced back from a bogey with birdies at 12 and 13 before dropping back to level with his rival. However, Mickelson paid for a poor shot at 15 as he dropped back to two over and Rose responded with pars at 17 and 18 -- the latter chipping from off the green with a three-wood to give himself a tap-in for an even par round of 70. That left Mickelson needing to produce the kind of putting heroics that Rose displayed against him in last year's decisive singles match at the Ryder Cup at Medinah, but the left-hander will have to wait another year to win his national tournament -- having also been bridesmaid in 1999, 2002, 2004, 2006 and 2009. ""Very heartbreaking,"" Mickelson said. ""This is probably the toughest for me."" World No. 1 Tiger Woods endured his worst performance at the U.S. Open since turning professional as he closed with 74 to be 13 over for the tournament -- his highest score when making the halfway cut. ""There's always a lesson to be learned in every tournament whether you win or lose,"" said Woods, who had been seeking his fourth U.S. Open win and 15th major overall. ""I'll look back at the things I did right and the things I did wrong. I did a lot of things right. Unfortunately I did a few things wrong as well.""","Justin Rose wins the U.S. Open at Merion by two shots from American Phil Mickelson .

"Coalinga, California (CNN) -- A California state panel on Wednesday denied parole for Sirhan B. Sirhan, saying the convicted assassin of Robert F. Kennedy hasn't demonstrated an understanding of the ""magnitude"" of his crimes. Commissioner Mike Prizmich of the California Board of Parole Hearings told Sirhan that he failed to meet the state's criteria for suitability for parole and added that he failed to seek self-help program and his behavoir was immature. In response, Sirhan sought to interrupt Prizmich, who admonished the inmate. Prizmich, however, said Sirhan would be eligible for parole again in five years. ""At this hearing, you're interrupting me time and time again, demonstrating a lack of control and impulsitivity,"" Prizmich told Sirhan. Sirhan made his first appearance before a California parole board since 2000, supported by two psychologists' reports saying he no longer poses a threat to society, his attorney said. ""While Sirhan Sirhan's statements at his parole hearing will likely be the source of continuing public interest due to the infamous nature of the crime, there is little he can say that is likely to sway the parole board and convince them that he deserves to be released from prison,"" said Robert Mintz, a former federal prosecutor. Weisel, who shared with CNN his prepared statement to the parole board, said he was hit by a stray bullet in the abdomen ""on that terrible evening"" a quarter past midnight on June 5, 1968, after Kennedy had just won the California primary in his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination. Now 73, Weisel, of Healdsburg, California, was an ABC News associate director at the time of the shooting. ""I'm advised that two reputable psychologists, one representing the state of California and the other from Harvard University, have concluded, after examining him -- Sirhan Sirhan -- that if he is granted parole, he would not be a threat to himself and others, and the community at large. If this is a fact and the board is inclined to grant him parole after him being in prison for nearly 43 years, I would not be opposed to the decision,"" Weisel said in a telephone interview with CNN. Dahle declined to comment on Weisel's statement or on the psychologists' reports to the parole board, but he said Weisel's scheduled appearance would mark the first time during Sirhan's imprisonment that a surviving witness voiced no objection to his possible parole -- at least since 1970. Prior to 1970, ""there's no record of the proceedings and I don't know if anyone showed up,"" Dahle said. ""It's fairly unusual. It's not common,"" Dahle added with respect to victims attending a parole hearing and not objecting to the prisoner being released. ""We don't get many, at least in cases in Los Angeles County -- where we get victims or victims' next of kin coming to cases. It's an expensive proposition."" Wednesday will mark Sirhan's 14th parole hearing. It's scheduled to be held in the Pleasant Valley State Prison in Coalinga, California, which is 200 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles. Members of the Kennedy family and their representatives didn't return messages or e-mails seeking a comment. Sirhan's attorney, William Pepper, an international human rights attorney and a barrister with offices in New York and London, said he and Sirhan were ""very grateful"" for Weisel's statement. Sirhan was convicted of killing Kennedy and wounding five other people in the shooting in the kitchen pantry of the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles. The hotel was later razed and a public school now occupies the site. He was convicted of first-degree murder and five counts of assault with attempt to commit murder. Four of those five surviving victims are alive, including Weisel. The others are Paul Schrade, a Kennedy family friend and former UAW Union regional leader; Ira Goldstein, a former radio journalist; and Elizabeth Y. Evans, a friend of the late Pierre Salinger. A Palestinian Christian who was born in Jerusalem and whose parents brought him and his siblings to America in the 1950s, Sirhan killed Kennedy because of statements the New York senator made about the United States sending fighter jets to aid Israel, prosecutors argued during Sirhan's 1969 trial. In 1968, Senator Kennedy, who was a younger brother of assassinated President John F. Kennedy, is whose administration he also served as attorney general, was a leading contender for the Democratic presidential nomination against Vice President Hubert Humphrey and Sen. Eugene McCarthy. Kennedy was shot only minutes after a hotel ballroom speech televised live to American household, in which he claimed victory over McCarthy in the California primary. The shooting, in the hotel's kitchen pantry, was not captured by any cameras. Sirhan was the only person arrested in the shooting. Sirhan has Jordanian citizenship but never became a U.S. citizen, so if the parole board were to release him, he would be deemed an illegal immigrant and deported to Jordan, where he has extended family, his attorney said. Sirhan's younger brother, Munir, 63, continues to live in the southern California community where the Sirhan family siblings were raised, Munir Sirhan said. Sirhan Sirhan ""has maintained a good relationship with his brother and he would love to live with this brother in Pasadena, but that's very unlikely because of his immigration status,"" Pepper said. Daniel Brown, an associate clinical professor in psychology at Harvard Medical School, has submitted a statement to the parole board after interviewing Sirhan for 60 hours over a three-year period, Pepper said. ""The report is part of a sealed file, but I can say that Sirhan does not have any violent tendency that should be regarded as a threat to the community,"" Pepper said. Brown's report ""confirms Sirhan's legitimacy of the loss of his memory,"" including in the pantry during the shooting and in moments of his life in the year prior to the Kennedy slaying, Pepper said. ""Sirhan has at various times taken responsibility (for the Robert Kennedy assassination), but the actual fact is that he doesn't remember what happened in the pantry at all. But because everyone around there told him he did it and he had a pistol and he did fire that pistol, he came to believe that he was actually guilty,"" Pepper said. Sirhan shows no sign of mental illness and has demonstrated remorse for the shootings, Pepper said. Sirhan has been ""free of any disciplinary rulings against him"" in prison, Pepper said. ""He's said no day of his life goes by where he doesn't have remorse and deep regret that this took place and the role he played in this thing,"" Pepper said. ""He's not schizophrenic or psychotic, and he has not shown any history of violence during incarceration."" Pepper said he became Sirhan's pro bono attorney in the fall of 2007 after he learned of the results of an audio analysis conducted on a sound track of the Kennedy shooting. The audio recording, made 40 feet away from the crime scene by free-lance newspaper reporter Stanislaw Pruszynski, is the only known recording of the gunshots in that June 1968 assassination. Pepper said he believes the Pruszynski recording is evidence showing that there was a second gun firing in addition to Sirhan's Iver-Johnson handgun. The tape was uncovered in 2004 by CNN's Brad Johnson, who had the recording independently examined by two audio analysts, Spence Whitehead in Atlanta, Georgia, and Philip Van Praag in Tucson, Arizona. Johnson reported on their separate findings for CNN's Backstory in June 2009. But the parole board won't hear arguments on the second-gun evidence, Pepper said. Rather, the parole panel will focus on Sirhan's suitability for parole, he said. The Pruszynski recording ""clearly showed that 13 shots were fired in the pantry, and Sirhan's gun had only eight shots, so it definitely means there was a second shooter,"" Pepper said. But Weisel, joined by authorities who have dismissed the second-gun assertion, said he was convinced that Sirhan was a lone gunman. ""I've seen so many theories after 43 years. Please -- I think you can have a conspiracy in a dictatorship and some countries, but I don't think so in a democracy or our country where there is freedom of speech,"" Weisel said. However, another shooting victim sees it differently than Weisel: Schrade. He is a Kennedy friend who was shot in the forehead while standing immediately behind Robert Kennedy in the pantry. In 2008, Schrade, now 86, told CNN that he believes evidence clearly shows Sirhan was not the only person who fired shots in that assassination. ""We have proof that the second shooter was behind us and off to our right. Sirhan was off to the left and in front of us,"" Schrade told CNN anchor Adrian Finighan. Schrade declined to comment to CNN this week about Wednesday's scheduled parole hearing for Sirhan. In a 2006 interview on CNN's Larry King Live, Weisel recounted how Kennedy and he were shot. ""Well, I was right behind Bobby. We were following him to go downstairs and speak to another group of people. And I was going with our cameraman down to show him where to plug in. And so we followed Bobby, and the shooting started,"" Weisel said. He said after Kennedy was struck three times, he was shot once in the stomach. Dahle, the deputy district attorney, said Sirhan wasn't present at his last two parole hearings, in 2003 and 2006, which Dahle attended. Pepper said he was chairman of Kennedy's citizens campaign in Westchester County, New York, during his successful 1964 bid for the U.S. Senate, and Pepper's duties included taking Kennedy's sisters and mother to political events. He said he was also a volunteer in the successful 1960 presidential campaign of Kennedy's brother, John Kennedy. In 1999, Pepper represented the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King's family in a wrongful death lawsuit concerning King's April 4, 1968, murder and successfully persuaded a Memphis, Tennessee, jury to find Lloyd Jowers responsible as an accomplice in the King assassination. If Sirhan is denied parole, Pepper said he would consider appealing the matter to the courts. Sirhan was initially sentenced to death, but three years later that sentence was commuted by California courts to life imprisonment plus six months to 14 years in prison, to run concurrently.","Sirhan Sirhan will not be eligible for parole again for five years .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- First came the iPhone. Then, there was the ""iFart"" flatulence noise download. Now, there's ""Pull My Finger"" -- and next could come the lawsuits. A Florida-based company has accused a Colorado competitor in federal court of trademark infringement and unfair business practices over the phrase ""Pull My Finger."" The dispute began after the makers of iFart began using phrase ""pull my finger"" in advertisements for their products. Air-o-Matic, based in Jacksonville, Florida, and Colorado-based InfoMedia, Inc., both offer a range of competing software applications, or ""apps,"" that subscribers can download into their multitasking cell phones. Users can make calls, listen to music, browse the Internet and play games on the devices. Individual ""apps"" cost a dollar and up, and can be used to get directions, read restaurant reviews and make funny noises. Enter the flatulence sound app, which both companies offer to customers. Air-o-Matic says its app, ""Pull My Finger"" has a unique brand identity that its competitor has infringed. It wants $50,000 from Infomedia to settle the dispute and may sue in federal court. In a formal complaint filed in a Denver, Colorado, federal court, however, InfoMedia says the phrase is a common ""descriptive"" term used in its advertising and cannot be trademarked. The company wants a judge to step in now, before any lawsuit is filed, and allow it to continue to use the phrase. According to InfoMedia's legal filing, its iFart app ""boasts a number of unique features including a built-in security system designed to aurally surprise and discourage iPhone theft. iFart also features a ""Sneak Attack"" function using a timer that emits the sound of flatulence when it goes off, the company says, and can also be used as a prank to an unsuspecting person. Joel Conn, founder of Infomedia, said on his own blog that his app is a ""cultural phenomenon."" The company claims there are about 75 different flatulence simulation software applications. There was no word on when a judge might rule on the complaint.","Company files complaint over use of ""pull my finger"" for iPhone application .

"(CNN) -- Golf's governing bodies have ruled that the use of controversial anchored putters will be banned from 2016, following several months of consultation that drew strong U.S. opposition to the planned change. The United States Golf Association (USGA) and the R&A on Tuesday ratified the decision by changing golf's rulebook, despite formal complaints from the U.S. PGA Tour and the PGA of America. Professional golfers now have until January 1, 2016 to adapt their putting style to comply with the new regulations. Adam Scott was the latest major winner to use an anchored putter -- where the top of the club rests on the belly or another body part -- on his way to a sensational playoff victory at the Masters in April. American Keegan Bradley was the first player to capture a major using a long putter at the 2011 PGA Championship, with compatriot Webb Simpson, winner of the 2012 U.S. Open, and last year's British Open victor Ernie Els of South Africa following suit. Golf's global rule-makers explained in a statement: ""Rule 14-1b, which was proposed on November 28 2012, has now been given final approval by the USGA and The R&A following an extensive review by both organizations. ""In adopting Rule 14-1b, the USGA and The R&A have concluded that freely swinging the entire club is integral to maintaining the traditions of the game and preserving golf as an enjoyable game of skill and challenge. ""The essence of the traditional method of golf stroke involves the player swinging the club with both the club and the gripping hands being held away from the body. ""The concept of intentionally immobilizing one end of the golf club against the body ... is a substantial departure from that traditional understanding of the golf swing."" Before introducing the ban, the USGA and the R&A first wanted a three-month period for comments to be made amid strong opposition from the U.S. PGA Tour and the PGA of America. In response to the ban, the U.S. PGA Tour said it acknowledged the decision and thanked the USGA for hearing its voice during the long discussions. It added that it would now consider whether to implement the ruling during competitions under its jurisdictions on U.S. soil. The PGA of America said it was ""disappointed with this outcome"" but acknowledged the openness of the forum. ""We do not believe 14-1b is in the best interest of recreational golfers and we are concerned about the negative impact it may have on both the enjoyment and growth of the game,"" it said in a statement, adding that its board will meet in late June to ""decide how best to proceed."" The European Tour, the LPGA and the Ladies European Tour have all supported the new regulation. World No. 1 Tiger Woods had also backed the ban, with the 14-time major winner calling for the ruling to be implemented ""as soon as possible."" The use of ""belly"" or ""long-handled"" putters fixed to the body has sparked debate in golf for the last two seasons. The sport's governing bodies accepted that their decision won't please every player who takes to the green using such a club. ""The anchored method of stroke has been a subject of controversy within the golf community for quite some time,"" the joint statement said. ""Many individuals and organizations feel strongly about the anchoring issue, and there is no single outcome that will please all."" Meanwhile, Europe's Ryder Cup captain Paul McGinley announced Tuesday that he will have three wildcard selections for next year's match against the United States at Gleneagles, Scotland. That will mean nine automatic places are on offer through qualifying results, as opposed to the 10 under his predecessor Jose Maria Olazabal last year. U.S. captain Tom Watson reduced his wildcard selections from four to three earlier this year.","Golf's governing bodies ban use of anchored putters from start of 2016 .

"(CNN) -- As high-tech reality TV goes, it's hard to top Sunday's riveting leap from the stratosphere by Austrian daredevil Felix Baumgartner. It took courage and skill, to be sure. But the technology required to get a guy well on his way to outer space, then allow him to plummet safely back to Earth, deserves some credit, too. From the one-of-a-kind Red Bull Stratos capsule to a pressurized space suit engineered specifically for the jump to a ""smart"" parachute designed to deploy if Baumgartner had spiraled out of control, the jump debuted tech that organizers say could contribute to the science world in other areas. After space jump, what's the next big stunt? Here is a look at some of the most interesting gadgetry used during the record-breaking leap: . The capsule . At 2,900 pounds, the Stratos weighs in at slightly more than a modern Volkswagen Beetle. It's made of a fiberglass and epoxy ""pressure sphere,"" the same kind of steel alloy (chromium-molybdenum) cage used in racecars, a foam-insulated fiberglass shield that protected Baumgartner from temperatures as low as -70 degrees Fahrenheit and a base covered in ""crush pads"" designed to handle 8 Gs of impact pressure. The suit . Engineers on the project say Baumgartner's spacesuit-style uniform could serve as a model for the future of space travel and exploration. The fully pressurized suit was tested to withstand temperatures as high as 100 degrees Fahrenheit and, more importantly in Baumgartner's case, as low as -90 degrees Fahrenheit. Why was the 3.5 pounds of pressure in the suit important? Because, according to the Stratos team, tissues in Baumgartner's body could have turned to gas and expanded while he was above 62,000 feet. Not good. The most innovative aspects of the suit, however, might have been those designed for mobility and vision. A skydiver needs the ability to move around more quickly than, say, an astronaut tethered to the outside of the international space station. The Stratos suit was modified to allow more mobility and a system of mirrors increased visibility. A hockey puck-sized controller is programmed to adjust pressure based on the suit's current altitude and a new kind of rotating, locking ring attached the helmet and gloves to the rest of the suit. Baumgartner's helmet was an 8-pound composite mold attached to a pair of oxygen cylinders during his descent. Its visor was equipped with an integrated heating unit to prevent fogging and icing. Chest pack . The nerve center of Baumgartner's gear was a chest pack where most of the high-tech gadgetry he'd need to complete, and document, the jump was stored. Data recorders inside it reported his altitude, speed and location to mission control to help them monitor his progress and whereabouts. The pack also contained a GPS beacon to make him easier to find. The voice transmitter and receiver that connected to his helmet were in the chest pack, as was an HD camera with a 120-degree view. Cameras . That chest pack camera wasn't the only one devoted to documenting the historic leap. Still and video cameras were designed specifically for the mission by Jay Nemeth of FlightLine Films. Nemeth is one of a handful of photographers with experience shooting in zero-gravity, including a shoot with Apollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin. There were nine high-definition cameras in the capsule, three high-resolution still cameras and three digital cinematography cameras with lens resolution of 4,000 x 2,000-pixels. In addition to Baumgartner's chest-pack camera, he also had one attached to each thigh. The cameras were modified in a host of the ways for the unique needs of the mission -- from pressurized casings filled with nitrogen to protect them from the extreme temperatures to special filters to protect them from the brightness of the sun at that altitude (iPhone 5 owners take note). Parachute . The parachute itself was a tech marvel five years in the making. The first personal parachute ever used for a supersonic-speed fall, it weighs 60 pounds, or three times as much as a normal parachute. It included a ""drogue chute"" that could have deployed if Baumgartner began spinning out of control. He had a button on one of his gloves that would have caused the chute to open if he held it down for three seconds. That parachute (which is separate from the regular emergency chute) also would have deployed if it was being hit by unexpectedly high levels of pressure for more than six seconds. His rig also included a button to cut the emergency parachute. While it would just be an inconvenience for many skydivers, if Baumgartner's emergency chute accidentally deployed at a high altitude, it could have slowed him down so much that he ran out of oxygen. Sticking the landing . How was Baumgartner able to control where he landed? For starters, the skydiver remained within the Earth's atmosphere, so he never had to account for the planet rotating underneath him. His team waited for ideal weather conditions, when there were fewer high-altitude winds that might have caused his balloon to drift. And once he deployed his parachute, less than two miles above the Earth, Baumgartner was able to steer himself to a flat, open landing spot in the New Mexico desert -- some 23 miles east of where the balloon had taken off several hours earlier. A beacon inside his suit allowed his recovery helicopter to follow him.","On Sunday, daredevil Felix Baumgartner lept from 128,100 feet above Earth .

"Oak Creek, Wisconsin (CNN) -- In the strongest denunciation to date by a U.S. law enforcement official, Attorney General Eric Holder on Friday labeled the attack on a Sikh temple that killed six worshippers ""an act of terrorism, an act of hatred, a hate crime."" Holder spoke at an emotional memorial service for the victims of the attack that emphasized healing and forgiveness instead of retribution for the shooting rampage by an Army veteran who killed himself after being wounded by police gunfire. Since the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, Sikhs in America have been targeted by revenge-seekers who apparently have mistaken them for Muslims, perhaps due to the traditional turbans they wear and their dark skin. ""In the recent past, too many Sikhs have been targeted and victimized simply because of who they are, how they look, and what they believe,"" Holder said. ""That is wrong. It is unacceptable. And it will not be tolerated."" He called for a national discussion on changing laws to prevent future shooting attacks, as well as ""how we might change the hearts of those so filled with hate that the despicable act we mourn today could ever have occurred."" Holder mentioned no specific laws. Holder also declared the attack at the Sikh gurdwara, or house of worship, in a Milwaukee suburb to be ""an act of terrorism, an act of hatred, a hate crime ""that is anathema to the founding principles of our nation and to who we are as an American people."" Earlier, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker said the Sikh community lived the words of slain civil rights leader the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. this week by responding with love to the attack. Wearing an orange head covering in keeping with Sikh tradition, Walker quoted King's assertion that only love can overcome hate, and said he witnessed that truth in the aftermath of Sunday's attack at a Sikh temple in a Milwaukee suburb. ""This week, our friends and neighbors in the Sikh community have shown us the best way to respond is with love,"" the Republican governor told the hundreds of mourners who filled the Oak Creek High School gymnasium for the service. As Friday's service began, three Sikh musicians in dark turbans sat cross-legged on the ground next to a row of six coffins and large, framed photos of the dead. Mourners slowly walked past, including Sikhs in their traditional turbans and non-Sikhs using scarves and handkerchiefs to cover their heads in keeping with Sikh custom. ""You have taken this life. This is your will,"" a prayer leader said between hymns sung over somber music. ""We accept your will. Please give us strength to bear this loss."" Remembering the victims . At one point, a group of seven uniformed police officers joined the line to pay their respects, with some embracing family members of the victims. Overhead, a large video screen displayed projected photos of the dead and wounded in the attack, including police Lt. Brian Murphy, who remains hospitalized from multiple gunshot wounds after being the first responder to the temple on Sunday. Murphy's family released a statement Friday thanking police and other emergency responders who rushed to the scene. ""We will never forget their heroic actions and quick thinking that saved so many lives on that terrible day."" The family also thanked medical staff and the Sikh community for including Murphy in prayers. Two Sikhs wounded in the attack remained hospitalized, Punjab Singh in critical condition and Santokh Singh upgraded to satisfactory, while another was treated and released earlier this week. The family of Santokh Singh said ""we are profoundly touched by the outpouring of support from people across the world. "" Killed were five men -- Satwant Singh Kaleka, 65; Sita Singh, 41; Ranjit Singh, 49; Prakash Singh, 39; Suveg Singh, 84 -- and one woman, 41-year-old Paramjit Kaur. At Friday's memorial service, relatives of the slain shared memories of their loved ones and encouraged the Sikh community to move past a crime that still remained beyond full comprehension. ""We must not fight fire with fire. We must not fight hate with hate,"" said Kaleka's son, Pradeep. ""My father used to say that you can't put a fire out by pouring gasoline on it."" The attacker, Wade Michael Page, was a 40-year-old former soldier-turned-front man for a white supremacist rock band. He killed himself in the parking lot of the gurdwara after being shot by a police officer, the FBI said Wednesday. Investigators say they found no clues to explain why Page went on the killing spree. Former Army colleagues said he espoused racist views during his military stint in the 1990s that became more pervasive after he left the service. Siblings ran to warn others of shooting . The incident occurred slightly more than two weeks after a shooting at a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, left 12 people dead and 58 wounded. Civil rights leader Jesse Jackson, who visited the gurdwara on Thursday, said more massacres will come unless the United States tightens up its gun laws. ""It's easy to be polite to say 'We're so sorry this happened' and give the same speech at the next killing a month from now,"" Jackson said, calling for a move from ""politeness to a change in policy."" Jackson delivered the closing prayer at Friday's memorial service. A CNN/ORC International poll released Thursday indicates that the public remains divided on gun laws, with 50% saying they favor no restrictions or only minor restrictions on firearm ownership and 48% supporting major restrictions or a complete ban by individuals except police and other authorized personnel. Those numbers are identical to where they were in 2011, and the number who support major restrictions or a complete ban has remained in the 48%-to-50% range for more than a decade. The CNN survey was conducted by ORC International on Tuesday and Wednesday, after the attack on the Sikh temple. Sikhs repair, reclaim temple after rampage . Also Thursday, temple members swept, scrubbed and painted over damage to their building when investigators allowed them back inside four days after the attack. A lone bullet hole remained in a metal door frame, which members say won't be repaired.

"Istanbul (CNN) -- Turkey's foreign minister applauded recent Libyan rebel advances against the forces of Moammar Gadhafi at an international diplomatic conference Thursday to plan for the post-Gadhafi era in Libya. Diplomats from 29 countries gathered in Istanbul for the meeting of the Libyan Contact Group, a coalition of Arab and European governments as well as the United States and Turkey. Representatives from NATO, the African Union, United Nations, European Union, Arab League, Gulf Cooperation Council and Libya's National Transitional Council -- the rebel Libyan government -- are also present. ""Today we are all proud and pleased with the ground-breaking developments on the ground"" in Libya, said Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu as he opened the meeting. ""The military victories of the National Transitional Council against the Gadhafi forces in Tripoli have brought the Libyan people closer to the noble cause that they been fighting for -- freedom, justice, dignity and democracy."" Turkey is one of the co-chairs of the Libya Contact Group. The governments of many of the countries in attendance threw their weight behind the Libyan rebels by freezing the assets of Gadhafi's government and pledging military and financial support to the NTC, based in Benghazi. The NTC was represented in Istanbul Thursday by its ambassador to the UAE, Arif Ali Mayed, while Washington sent Deputy Secretary of State William Burns and Jeffrey Feltman, assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern Affairs. There was also significant Arab representation at the session, with diplomats from Bahrain, Jordan, Morocco, Lebanon, the UAE, Qatar and Kuwait. Egypt was listed as an observer. Turkey's top diplomat announced Gadhafi had ""exited the political scene,"" and called on the international community to recognize the NTC as the sole representative of the Libyan people. ""Its flag should be raised at the United Nations headquarters in New York, hopefully the next U.N. General Assembly,"" Davutoglu said, referring to the tri-color banner adopted by the Libyan opposition. Davutoglu also said unfreezing Libyan financial assets and handing them over to the NTC was of ""critical importance.""  He urged the U.N. Security Council to take the steps to make this transfer of funds possible. The cash-strapped rebel leadership has already been lobbying the United Nations and several countries to release Libyan money frozen in foreign banks by the U.N. Security Council. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said it was clear that there was ""considerable work"" ahead but that the mood of those present at the meeting was upbeat. The delegates ""came together to demonstrate the international community's firm commitment to supporting the Libyan people at this truly historic time,"" she said in a statement. Everyone there, including the NTC, had ""emphasized the need for reconciliation, respect for human rights, and justice, not retribution,"" she said, and given ""a collective affirmation of the need for Libya's transition to be Libyan-led."" Speaking on the sidelines of the conference, Feltman told reporters the Arab League was expected to officially ""seat"" the Libyan National Transitional Council at the league headquarters in Cairo Saturday. He said priorities for the Libya Contact Group were reconciliation, so that rebels would make peace with regime loyalists; adjusting the donor community to the new reality in Libya, and getting emergency funds to the NTC. Feltman said the release of $1.5 billion in frozen assets would help pay outstanding oil bills and keep the electricity on in Libya. A U.S. proposal for the U.N. Security Council to hand frozen Libyan government assets to the NTC is opposed by South Africa, which is not a member of the Libyan Contact Group.  The Security Council met on the matter Wednesday. Speaking in Rome Thursday after a meeting with senior NTC member Mahmoud Jibril, Italy's Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi pledged to help the NTC. Italy will unfreeze about $505 million (350 million euros) in Libyan assets that have been held in Italian banks, Berlusconi said. He also promised money to support Libya's health and education infrastructure and for military training. Jibril said that the battle for Tripoli was still going on, but that Libya must think of its future. He said urgent aid was needed to deal with the situation, adding that some people had not received a paycheck for months. If the NTC was not able to provide basic services and pay salaries, there was a risk that it would fail and the country would be destabilized, he warned. CNN's Hada Messia and Jill Dougherty contributed to this report.","NEW: Much work lies ahead but the world supports the Libyan people, a U.S. official says .

"(CNN) -- Punxsutawney Phil, America's most famous rodent prognosticator, saw his shadow Tuesday, signaling six more weeks of winter. Phil emerged from his ceremonial tree stump at Gobbler's Knob, Pennsylvania, to a cheering crowd that had waited in the cold for his annual prediction. It is the 99th time that Phil -- in his various incarnations -- has seen his shadow, according to groundhog.org, the official Web site of the groundhog club in Punxsutawney, about 75 miles northeast of Pittsburgh, in western Pennsylvania. Not seeing a shadow -- something that has happened just 15 times in Phil's history, according to the club -- would have meant spring is around the corner. Phil's predictions don't mean much to human weather predictors, however. CNN meteorologist Chad Meyers, citing stormfax.com, said Phil is correct 39 percent of the time. The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration goes even further, saying Phil has ""no predictive skill."" The tradition behind the famous groundhog goes back to medieval times when there was a superstition that all hibernating animals emerged from their caves and dens to check the weather on Candlemas, which is halfway between the winter solstice in December and the vernal equinox in March. Seeing their shadows would mean winter would go on for another six weeks, and they could go back to sleep, according to the tradition. The tradition came to America with the early German settlers who arrived in Pennsylvania.","Punxsutawney Phil comes out of hole, sees his shadow .

"(CNN) -- Celebrity chef Paula Deen, facing allegations of racism that have caused parts of her empire to crumble, slammed what she called ""horrible, horrible lies"" about her in an emotional, nationally televised interview Wednesday. ""I believe that every creature on this Earth, every one of God's creatures, was created equal,"" she told NBC's ""Today"" show. ""... I believe that everyone ought to be treated equal."" Deen was raised to never be unkind to anyone, she said. ""I've had to hold friends in my arms while they've sobbed,"" Deen said, crying. ""Because they know what's being said about me -- it's not true. And I'm having to comfort them, and tell them it's going to be all right. If God got us to it, he'll get us through it."" The accusations against Deen stem from a lawsuit filed by a former manager of Deen's restaurants in Savannah, Georgia. Lisa T. Jackson's lawsuit alleges that Deen and her brother, Bubba Hier, committed numerous acts of violence, discrimination and racism that resulted in the end of Jackson's five-year tenure at Deen's Lady & Sons and Uncle Bubba's Oyster House eateries in Savannah. Deen rejects the allegations. Anne Rice defends Paula Deen . ""There's someone evil out there that saw what I had worked for and they wanted it,"" Deen told NBC on Wednesday, without naming anyone. In a deposition for the lawsuit, Deen was asked whether she had ever used the ""N-word."" Deen answered that she had probably used the racial slur when talking to her husband about ""when a black man burst into the bank that I was working at and put a gun to my head"" -- an incident that took place 30 years ago. Opinion: Half-baked apology is recipe for racial indigestion . In the ""Today"" interview, she gave more details about that incident. The man holding the gun was someone she knew, she said. ""I had gone out on a limb for him and gotten him a loan and he was frightened that I was going to recognize him."" In the deposition, Deen was asked whether she had used the word at any other times since. She responded, ""I'm sure I have, but it's been a very long time."" She added that she may have uttered the word in repeating a conversation that took place between black people. Transcript of Paula Deen's deposition . In fact, she told NBC, ""It's very distressing for me to go into my kitchens and I hear what these young people are calling each other. ... Because I think for this problem to be worked on, that these young people are going to have to take control and start showing respect for each other and not throwing that word at each other. It makes my skin crawl."" Jackson's lawsuit also claims Deen wanted to plan a party in the style of a Southern plantation, staffed with black waiters dressed to resemble slaves. In her deposition, Deen said she was speaking of an experience she had had in which the wait staff was composed of black men in white jackets and bow ties, and that she had said she would love for Hier to ""experience a very Southern style wedding"" such as that. Paula Deen's sons: She's no racist . ""I did not mean anything derogatory by saying I loved their look and their professionalism,"" she added. Amid the firestorm, The Food Network dropped Deen, as did Smithfield Foods, one of her key sponsors. And in another blow, Caesars Entertainment Corp. said Wednesday that it will be ending its relationship with her. There are questions now over whether other businesses, including QVC and Walmart, may cut ties with the star of Southern cooking. Caesars operates Deen-themed restaurants at four of its casinos: Horseshoe Southern Indiana, Harrah's Tunica in Mississippi, Harrah's Joliet in Illinois and Harrah's Cherokee in North Carolina. Deen said she's thankful that other sponsors have stood by her. Deen and Southern food: Critics say credit is past due . Many fans have flocked to her restaurants in support of Deen. And advance orders for her new cookbook have surged. Deen said she's ""distressed"" that people whom she's never heard of are appearing in the media as ""experts on who I am."" Asked whether she regrets telling the truth in the deposition, Deen answered, ""No. Because there's a couple of kinds of people that I don't like, that I am prejudiced against: ... thieves and liars."" ""If there's anyone out there that has never said something that they wish they could take back, if you're out there, please pick up that stone and throw it so hard at my head that it kills me,"" she said tearfully.

"(CNN) -- Actress Lindsay Lohan will be featured in the January/February issue of Playboy, a spokeswoman for the magazine said Monday. The issue is expected to hit newsstands late December, Theresa Hennessey told CNN, declining to offer details. The 25-year-old actress and model shot to fame for her roles in kid-friendly flicks like ""The Parent Trap."" But her rocky personal life, which is standard fodder for tabloids, has overshadowed her career in recent years. Lohan was released from jail early Monday, just hours after she was booked in, authorities said. Last week, a Los Angeles County judge ordered Lohan to serve a 30-day jail term after she admitted she violated her probation on a necklace theft conviction. At the time, Los Angeles County Sheriff spokesman Steve Whitmore said it was likely Lohan could be booked in and booked out the same day. ""It depends on the fluctuations of the day, what's going on in the jail,"" Whitmore said. The actress must work at least 12 days a month at the county morgue until she completes the 53 remaining days on her court-ordered community service, Judge Stephanie Sautner told her. Lohan must also attend 18 psychotherapy sessions. The actress also made headlines last month, when photographs surfaced showing Lohan with less-than-perfect teeth. Her representative, Steve Honig, shot back then, telling CNN: ""Lindsay is widely recognized as one of the most beautiful women on the planet, and is regularly sought after by some of the top photographers in the world to appear on covers of magazines around the globe.""

"(CNN) -- Looking like a tourist can cost you money and pride. Looking like a local can open you up to even greater harassment. Read our survivor's guide, split the difference and come away with your upper lip intact. 1. Getting around . Travel around the UK is relatively simple. Yes, they drive on the left, but don't be daunted. Most roads are so narrow that it doesn't make any difference which side you're on. Be prepared when driving distances of more than 20 miles. These can be epic undertakings on Britain's congested highways, but the misery of gridlocked traffic will be more than compensated for by road signs pointing to places with names like Ramsbottom, Throcking and Goole. Britain has an extensive and efficient rail network, which only ever grinds to a halt when the weather turns hot, cold, wet or dry. Tickets are expensive but you can find cheap fares by booking eight or nine years in advance of travel. Try: The Night Riviera sleeper train from London to Penzance then a drive or hike around the spectacular Cornish Coast. More: 10 of London's oldest, greatest pubs . 2. Climate . There are warm days in the UK, but you know you're in a damp country when the merest hint of sunshine is front page news. Britain has four seasons, and while the transitions between them can be pleasant, each is typically as wet, gray and cold as the last. All are considered by Brits to be ""ice cream weather."" Whatever the climate throws at you, be prepared for endless conversations about it. These needn't be dull since, like Eskimos with snow, Brits have a impressive lexicon for rain. If you hear the word ""mizzle,"" it probably means a light shower. Or maybe a low quality Snoop Dogg track. Try: The Royal Botanic Gardens. Dazzling spring and fall displays, but enough hot houses to ward off the worst of the weather (Kew, Richmond, London; +44 20 8332 5655). More: The world's best city is ... 3. Royalty . Don't be duped by Downton Abbey. Britain has come a long way since the days when ordinary folk were awestruck by aristocracy. This is a modern country where all are born equal and social rewards are based on merit. This is why few British people bothered turning up when a blue-blooded chap married his sweetheart in 2011. It's why barely anyone noticed when she gave birth a couple of years later. And it's also why no one batted an eyelid when his flame-haired brother got naked in Vegas. OK, none of that is true. British people are as in thrall to their royal family as you are. And they're willing to sell you a Wills 'n' Kate souvenir tea towel with matching oven mitts to prove it. Try: Windsor Castle. Sprawling royal residence west of London where Queen Elizabeth II can occasionally be spotted in her natural habitat (Windsor, +44 20 7766 7304). More: Photos: Prince George's christening . 4. History . Britain has so many ancient attractions, it's hard to know where to start. And if you do manage to visit all the sites of historical interest, archeologists will simply dig up the bones of another 15th-century king from under a parking lot, just to annoy you. But since some Brits are only aware of two key dates -- a French invasion in 1066 and an England soccer World Cup victory 900 years later -- you don't need to try too hard to catch up. Try visiting the northern city of York, where you can wallow in 2,000 years of British history in one location. Or Bath, where you can do the same and also wallow in a nice thermal bath (Hot Bath Street, Bath; +44 844 888 0844). Try: York Castle Museum. Compelling and sometimes gruesome stroll down Britain's memory lane (York Castle Museum, York; +44 19 0468 7687) More: 5 travel relationship killers . 5. Tea . There may be coffee shops on every UK street corner, but Britain is resolutely a tea-drinking nation. Vast lakes of insipid infusions are consumed on a daily basis. Visitors will note the almost mandatory provision of a miniscule electric jug, or kettle, in every hotel room. It will take four hours to boil half a cup, but for many Brits this is an essential lifeline. There isn't any crisis they believe can't be solved with a nice cup of tea, and perhaps a biscuit. When preparing tea, there are rituals to be observed. Use boiling water and, if you must resort to tea bags, always add the milk last. Failure to do so will result in such distress that it may take another cup of tea to calm everyone down again. Try: For posh tea, try Fortum & Masons (181 Piccadilly, London; +44 84 5602 5694). For normal, head to the Regency CafÃ© (17-19 Regency St., London; +44 20 7821 6596). 6. Language . Even if you're fluent in English, you may experience linguistic difficulties in the UK. Regional dialects vary extensively in the space of a few miles, resulting in bafflement even among locals. If you can't understand what a British person is saying, it's fairly safe to assume it's either a). something about the weather (see climate above), or b). an apology. British people love apologizing: they're sorry to trouble you, sorry they can't be more helpful, sorry about the rain and sorry about invading your country in 1762, or whenever it was. They also love apologizing when it's not even their fault: they're sorry that you bumped into them, sorry you knocked them to the floor and sorry that you are repeatedly thwacking them over the head and telling them to stop apologizing. Be warned though, it's contagious. Try: Glasgow. Scotland's second city is reputedly the UK's politest. Perhaps it's the impenetrable accents. Or the awful weather. More: Want better sex? Travel more . 7. Cuisine . Britain's bland national diet has been revolutionized by South Asian migrants whose spicy concoctions are now firm favorites sold on every high street. Meanwhile, pubs that once nourished customers with despondent sandwiches are now studded with Michelin stars. But don't be fooled. They might pretend to love fine dining, but when on the hoof, many Brits still prefer to fill their faces with offal and saturated fat. Few journeys are made within the United Kingdom that aren't catered with sausage rolls, Cornish pasties and Scotch eggs. Visitors troubled by the sight of greasy meat should also be warned of three words that will strike fear -- if not full-blown cardiovascular seizures -- into their hearts: Full. English. Breakfast. Try: Offally good food: St. John Bar and Restaurant (St. John Street, London; +44 20 7251 0848). Offally average: Any branch of Greggs bakery. 8. Television . Be sure to take time out from your travels to sample a few hours of British television, but seek not the polished period dramas that are easily exported to other countries. Where British TV excels is in its celebration of the lives of ordinary, dare we say boring, citizens. The UK's three most popular soaps focus not on the beautiful or the damned, but on normal folk engaged in humdrum tasks like buying cheese, arguing about pottery or tending to their farms. Talking of farms, every spring since 2010 British television has dedicated numerous prime time hours to some of the best reality TV ever conceived: live coverage of the annual lambing season. Keep up with that, Kardashians! Try: Tour locations from the UK's sheep-heavy ""Emmerdale"" soap: dull plots, stunning scenery (Brit Movie Tours; +44 84 4247 1007)","Tedious road journeys are offset with entertaining place names like Ramsbottom, Throcking and Goole .

"(CNN) -- Have you been flying much this summer? If so, how has the experience been? Right. Thought so. Flying these days -- the jammed-to-the-groaning-point cabins and torture-rack legroom; the fees for everything from checking your bags to being handed a paltry package of food; the endless, we'll-X-ray-you-to-within-an-inch-of-your-dignity security lines; the sweaty guy in the next seat with a tank top on and his shoes off -- you know how it is. Airline asks passengers for gas money . Flying is too often a dreary, joy-sapping slog. It's difficult even to remember that it was ever any other way. Which is why, at Midway Airport in Chicago recently, I was intrigued when someone mentioned to me a book about that very airport. The book had a workmanlike title: ""When Hollywood Landed at Chicago's Midway Airport.""  Because the person who recommended it to me spoke in such glowing terms, I ordered a copy through the mail. Written by a fellow named Christopher Lynch, who grew up around Midway, it is a thin, paperbound volume that appears to be a labor of love and respect. It tells the story of one Mike Rotunno, a photographer-for-hire in the first boom years of commercial air travel in the United States. Rotunno -- he died in 1994 -- was a newspaper photographer who decided he might be able to do better as his own boss. In the 1930s, '40s and '50s, flying was a big deal. When a family went on vacation by air, it was a major life event. Rotunno set up a company called Metro News at Midway -- O'Hare International Airport was many years from being built -- to offer professional photo service to anyone passing through the airport who wanted a memento of the occasion. But he also began taking photos of Hollywood (and political) stars as they arrived in Chicago. The cross-country flights in those years had to stop to refuel, and Midway was often where they set down. Lynch's book is filled with Rotunno's old photos. And ... Well, take a look at the selection of those photos atop today's column. The next time you're frustrated and downcast about what air travel has become, the memory of the photos may serve as a tonic. ""Traveling by air in those years wasn't like boarding a flying bus, the way it is today,"" Lynch told me. ""People didn't travel in flip-flops. I mean, no offense, Mister, but I don't want to see your toes."" Recovered wreckage fails to solve case of missing pilot . The trains were still king in those years. The airlines wanted to convince people that flying was safe. ""People were afraid to fly,"" Lynch said. ""And it was expensive. The airlines had to make people think it was something they should try."" Enter Mike Rotunno. His pictures of the stars as they got off the planes made air travel seem to be glamorous, sophisticated, civilized, thrilling. The stars dressed up to fly -- and so did everyone else. Few celebrities had the option of private planes in those days, so the guy passing you in the aisle on a cross-country flight just might be Clark Gable. And everyone alighted from the planes by stairways onto the runways -- there were none of the sealed bridges that today attach to the terminals. The photos of the stars set the tone for flying. Lynch told me: ""People who saw pictures in the papers of stars getting off planes thought, 'Hey, if John Wayne can fly, I can fly. I want to be like John Wayne. ' "" Thus, there is Wayne -- the Duke himself -- looking like the proverbial million bucks, climbing off a TWA flight and striding toward Rotunno's camera. There is Marilyn Monroe, right there with Mike and his Speed Graphic. Katharine Hepburn, a dream incarnate. Gary Cooper, taking a photo of Rotunno, as Rotunno took a photo of him. Rock Hudson, surrounded by fans. Red Skelton. Gene Autry. Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis. Jimmy Stewart. John F. Kennedy, Jacqueline Kennedy and Richard Nixon -- together, all in a single frame, beneath a United Airlines plane. It is a lost world -- the airborne world of everyday elegance, as available to the average ticket holder as to Bob Hope or to Abbott and Costello. Mike Rotunno, on a daily basis, captured it all. It was an arrangement in which everyone won. The airlines, which assisted him in lining up the photos, won because the results helped convince the public to abandon the trains. The Hollywood studios won because they got a little bit of free publicity for their stars. The newspapers won because, by buying photos from Rotunno, they didn't have to send photographers to the airport themselves. And Rotunno won, because he got the money. Potential FAA cuts would create big hassles for fliers . And he also won because he got the memories. Think of his photos the next time you're shoehorned into a seat next to a fellow who's dripping the sloppy innards of his carry-on submarine sandwich onto your sleeve. Air travel was once a treasured experience, exciting, exotic, something never to be forgotten. You, too, could travel like Elizabeth Taylor. Who, of course, knew that Mike Rotunno would be waiting for her on the runway at the bottom of the stairs. She's gone now. He's gone now. That era of travel is gone now. And you? Your flight is boarding. Why aren't you smiling? Are you a window flier or an aisle seater?

"(CNN) -- A man who was shot but survived last Saturday's massacre in Tucson, Arizona, was taken to a county mental services unit Saturday after making a threatening comment at a town hall event, Pima County Sheriff's Department spokesman Jason Ogan said. James Eric Fuller, 63, was involuntarily committed after he made threats against a Tea Party member at the Tucson event sponsored by ABC News, Ogan said. Fuller photographed Trent Humphries and said ""You are dead"" when Humphries began speaking at the event, according to Ogan. Humphries told CNN that Fuller's comment came when the town hall discussion turned toward the issue of gun control. ABC News reported that the shooting victim became agitated and mumbled something that prompted him to be detained by police. Footage showed most of the audience filtering out, seemingly unaware, during the confrontation. Humphries has not pressed charges against Fuller and said Saturday that he doesn't want to do anything to heighten tensions after the shooting. ""I am more worried about our community,"" he said. ""This doesn't need to be about Trent Humphries. This doesn't need to be about politics."" The Pima County Sheriff's Department said Fuller was taken into custody after 12 p.m. (2 p.m. ET) and was in a county facility. He could not be reached for comment. The town hall event was held at St. Odilia Church in the southern Arizona city and was taped for Christiane Amanpour's ""This Week"" program on ABC. Earlier this week, Humphries told CNN that he believed ""all the politics, all the things that are going on right now are almost exclusively from the left"" -- suggesting that he felt the Tea Party and fellow conservatives were being criticized. ""It's sick that people are making this into a political issue, when it's a tragedy for our community,"" he said. ""There's people ... who were kind of hoping this would have been the Tea Party (member). They want to cudgel to go after the Tea Party."" CNN's Chuck Johnston and Kevin Bohn contributed to this report.","The target of the threat says that it came amid a discussion on gun control .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. should stop arresting responsible marijuana users, Rep. Barney Frank said Wednesday, announcing a proposal to end federal penalties for Americans carrying fewer than 100 grams, almost a quarter-pound, of the substance. Rep. Barney Frank's bill would radically curb federal penalties for personal marijuana use. Current laws targeting marijuana users place undue burdens on law enforcement resources, punish ill Americans whose doctors have prescribed the substance and unfairly affect African-Americans, said Frank, flanked by legislators and representatives from advocacy groups. ""The vast amount of human activity ought to be none of the government's business,"" Frank said on Capitol Hill. ""I don't think it is the government's business to tell you how to spend your leisure time."" The Massachusetts Democrat and his supporters emphasized that only the use -- and not the abuse -- of marijuana would be decriminalized if the resolution resulted in legislation.  Watch Frank lay out the proposal » . The Drug Enforcement Administration says people charged with simple possession are rarely incarcerated. The agency and the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy have long opposed marijuana legalization, for medical purposes or otherwise. Marijuana is a Schedule I controlled substance, meaning it has a high potential for abuse and no accepted medical use, according to the drug control office. ""Smoked marijuana has not withstood the rigors of science -- it is not medicine and it is not safe,"" the DEA states on its Web site. ""Legalization of marijuana, no matter how it begins, will come at the expense of our children and public safety. It will create dependency and treatment issues, and open the door to use of other drugs, impaired health, delinquent behavior, and drugged drivers."" Allen St. Pierre, spokesman for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, likened Frank's proposal -- co-sponsored by Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas -- to current laws dealing with alcohol consumption. Alcohol use is permitted, and the government focuses its law enforcement efforts on those who abuse alcohol or drive under its influence, he said. ""We do not arrest and jail responsible alcohol drinkers,"" he said. St. Pierre said there are tens of millions of marijuana smokers in the United States, including himself, and hundreds of thousands are arrested each year for medical or personal use. iReport.com: Is it time to legalize pot? There have been 20 million marijuana-related arrests since 1965, he said, and 11 million since 1990, and ""every 38 seconds, a marijuana smoker is arrested."" Rob Kampia, director of the Marijuana Policy Project, said marijuana arrests outnumber arrests for ""all violent crimes combined,"" meaning police are spending inordinate amounts of time chasing nonviolent criminals. ""Ending arrests is the key to marijuana policy reform,"" he said. Reps. William Lacy Clay, D-Missouri, and Barbara Lee, D-California, said that in addition to targeting nonviolent offenders, U.S. marijuana laws unfairly target African-Americans. Clay said he did not condone drug use but opposes using tax dollars to pursue what he feels is an arcane holdover from ""a phony war on drugs that is filling up our prisons, especially with people of color."" Too many drug enforcement resources are being dedicated to incarcerating nonviolent drugs users, and not enough is being done to stop the trafficking of narcotics into the United States, he said. Being arrested is not the American marijuana smoker's only concern, said Bill Piper of the Drug Policy Alliance Network. Those found guilty of marijuana use can lose their jobs, financial aid for college, their food stamp and welfare benefits, or their low-cost housing. The U.S. stance on marijuana, Piper said, ""is one of the most destructive criminal justice policies in America today."" Calling the U.S. policy ""inhumane"" and ""immoral,"" Lee said she has many constituents who are harassed or arrested for using or cultivating marijuana for medical purposes. California allows medical marijuana use, but the federal government does not, she explained. House Resolution 5843, titled the Personal Use of Marijuana by Responsible Adults Act of 2008, would express support for ""a very small number of individuals"" suffering from chronic pain or illness to smoke marijuana with impunity. According to NORML, marijuana can be used to treat a range of illnesses, including glaucoma, asthma, multiple sclerosis, HIV/AIDS and seizures. Frank, who is chairman of the Financial Services Committee, said that about a dozen states have approved some degree of medical marijuana use and that the federal government should stop devoting resources to arresting people who are complying with their states' laws. In a shot at Republicans, Frank said it was strange that those who support limited government want to criminalize marijuana. Asked whether the resolution's passage would change his personal behavior, Frank quipped, ""I do obey every law I vote for"" but quickly said he did not use marijuana, nor does he encourage it. ""I smoke cigars. I don't think other people should do that. If young people ask me, I would advise them not to do it,"" he said. If HR 5843 were passed, the House would support marijuana smokers possessing up to 100 grams -- about 3½ ounces -- of cannabis without being arrested. It would also give its blessing to the ""nonprofit transfer"" of up to an ounce of marijuana. The resolution would not address laws forbidding growing, importing or exporting marijuana, or selling it for profit. The resolution also would not speak to state laws regarding marijuana use.","DEA, White House say marijuana dangerous, has no accepted medical use .

"(Health.com) -- Girls in the United States are entering puberty at earlier ages than they have in the past, a new study reports. More than 10 percent of white 7-year-old girls in the study, which was conducted in the mid-2000s, had reached a stage of breast development marking the start of puberty, compared to just 5 percent in a similar study conducted in the early 1990s. Black and Hispanic girls continue to mature faster than white girls, on average. Nearly one-quarter of black girls and 15 percent of Hispanic girls had entered puberty by age 7, according to the new study, which appears in the journal Pediatrics. But the trend toward earlier puberty is not as pronounced among blacks as it is among whites, the researchers say. Although the rate of early puberty among black girls in the study (23 percent) was higher than that observed in the early 1990s (15 percent), the increase was not statistically significant. Health.com: Is it baby fat or obesity? ""White girls are catching up,"" says Dr. Frank Biro, M.D., the lead author of the study and the director of adolescent medicine at Cincinnati Children's Hospital. Experts aren't sure what's behind the increase in earlier puberty, but it's likely due to a combination of factors, including the childhood obesity epidemic and substances in the environment. Early puberty in girls is a growing public health concern because studies have shown that girls who start puberty earlier are more likely to develop breast and uterine cancer later in life. The National Institutes of Health funded the study as part of a larger investigation into the environmental factors that contribute to breast cancer risk. Video: Girls becoming women sooner . ""Breast cancer is such a common problem, so if we can find some of the things that make it more likely, we could improve screening of those early developers,"" says Dr. Susan Nickel, M.D., an assistant professor of pediatrics at the Texas A&M Health Science Center College of Medicine, in Temple. (Nickel was not involved in the new research.) Cancer risk isn't the only concern surrounding early puberty. Early development in girls has been linked with poor self-esteem, eating disorders, and depression, as well as cigarette and alcohol use and earlier sexual activity. ""If an 11- or 12-year-old girl looks like she's 16, people will interact with her as if she were 16,"" Biro says. ""Early maturation increases the rate of risk-taking behaviors and lowers academic performance. It doesn't mean it's going to happen, but it could."" Health.com: Plastic baby bottles and BPA: Health risk or hysteria? Between 2004 and 2006, Biro and his co-authors assessed the breast development of more than 1,200 girls ages 6 to 8 in three major U.S. cities (New York, Cincinnati, and San Francisco). The stage of development in which a girl's breasts begin to ""bud"" is considered the onset of puberty, not her first menstrual cycle. The average age of the first period has declined as well, says Nickel. ""Girls used to get their first menstrual period at 14 or 15,"" she says, but now the average is closer to 12. Health.com: The big three hormones . Regardless of their race, girls with a higher body mass index (BMI) -- a ratio of height to weight -- tend to mature sooner, the researchers found. This finding, which has been reported in other studies, suggests that soaring obesity rates among children may be contributing to the rates of early puberty. But it's not yet clear why girls -- and especially white girls -- are starting to physically mature at younger ages. One theory is that excess body fat affects the levels of hormones that trigger puberty. Health.com: 4 things that mess with your hormones . Chemicals in the environment -- most notably bisphenol-A (BPA), which is found in many hard plastic products -- may affect hormones as well, says Dr. Gary Berkovitz, M.D., a professor of pediatric endocrinology at the University of Miami's Miller School of Medicine. A girl's experience in infancy and even in the womb may also contribute to earlier puberty, according to a second study that appears in the same issue of Pediatrics. Health.com: Make play areas greener and safer for kids . In that study, which included about 4,000 girls in the United Kingdom, researchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that mothers who had their first period before age 12, smoked during pregnancy, and were pregnant for the first time had daughters who entered puberty sooner than other girls. Above-average weight gain during infancy was also associated with earlier puberty, the study found.

"(CNN) -- For David Richards, the holiday season is about joy, good cheer and smashing a Guinness World Record. The lawyer and his family strung more than a half a million bulbs around their house in the Australian capital city of Canberra to reclaim the title for lights on a residential property. In case you're wondering, that's 31 miles of lights. Richards has been the champ before. He set the world record in 2011 with 331,038 lights, but decided not to do it again because the display took months of effort. In 2012, the Gay family in Lagrangeville, New York, snatched away the title with a display of 346,283 lights. Richard rose to the challenge. He not only wanted to take back the record, he wanted to ""smash it"" so it would stand for a long time. This time, the number was 502,165 bulbs. Guinness didn't count each and every bulb. The record was authenticated with sales receipts and by counting LED bulbs spaced among the half million lights, Richards said. The family takes donations from thousands of people who jam the neighborhood to view the lights. Two years ago, they raised $78,000 for SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome) and Kids ACT. Lightbulb babies and fairytale castles: Your Christmas traditions . That money helped hire two new counselors for families who have lost a child to SIDS. Richards hopes to earn $100,000 this year. ""That's our motivation,"" he said. Richards and his wife, Janean, lost a child to SIDS a decade ago, he said. They have three children, ages 13 to 6. Richards started the project in October and puts in hours before and after work and on weekends. ""I got the last bulb up last night just before Guinness arrived,"" he said Monday. The most Christmassy places on the planet . ""MOST CHRISTMAS LIGHTS ON A HOUSE - OVER HALF A MILLION!"" blared the headline on the Guinness website after it verified the feat. The Richards' house is the former Japanese embassy and has a wide driveway circling in front, he said. Richards built a canopy over the driveway and overlaid it with the lights. ""It's like walking through a tunnel of lights with synchronized music,"" he said. The family's monthly electric bill is expected to swell by $2,500, with the local electric company handling the cost by using renewable energy. Richards wouldn't say how much he's spent on lights, just that it's less than the event brings in for charity.

"(Budget Travel) -- No offense to the nation's capital, but the landmarks of our heritage extend far beyond the District of Columbia. Yellowstone National Park preserves an enormous natural bounty, including 10,000 hot springs and 300 geysers. Sears Tower (Willis Tower) It's fitting that the country's tallest building, the Sears Tower (we haven't come to terms with the new name either), is in the same city that built the first skyscraper, the Home Insurance Building, demolished in 1931. Chicago's innovation sparked a worldwide race that continues to redefine city skylines from London to Dubai to Taipei. There's simply no better way to experience those early architects' remarkable vision than to stand on The Ledge at Skydeck Chicago, a transparent observation box that suspends you 1,353 feet above street level, on a wisp of glass just one and a half inches thick. Gettysburg, Pennsylvania . The site of the Civil War's bloodiest battle and of one of Abraham Lincoln's most famous speeches, Gettysburg National Military Park is a lasting memorial to the devastation caused by, and the reasons for, the war that remade the union. In its successful efforts to fend off encroaching development, Gettysburg also reflects the struggles of many historic sites to preserve the sanctity of their land. nps.gov/gett. Yellowstone National Park . Yes, other National Parks are stunning (Grand Canyon and Yosemite come to mind), but Yellowstone, signed into being by President Ulysses S. Grant in 1872, was the very first in the world -- and established an early precedent for land conservationists internationally. This majestic park, bordered by Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho, preserves an enormous natural bounty: It is home to 10,000 hot springs and 300 geysers, numerous lakes and rivers, and wildlife such as bighorn sheep, bison, grizzly bears, and more than 1,000 gray wolves. nps.gov/yell. New York Harbor . It's still easy to imagine the bay as millions of immigrants might have perceived it on their way to the United States: the promise of the Statue of Liberty, the judgment of Ellis Island, and the hope of Manhattan's skyscrapers rising in the distance. Emma Lazarus's ode to the huddled masses, inside the Statue of Liberty's pedestal, is a timeless reminder of our common bond as immigrants, a history that stretches from Jamestown to the current day. Budget Travel gallery: See the 8 sights . Monticello . Why Thomas Jefferson and not George Washington, you ask? It's undeniable that Washington was the greater warrior, but it was Jefferson who authored the Declaration of Independence and helped define our claim to liberty -- the reason we fought in the first place. Monticello, located in Charlottesville, Virginia, is filled with more than 5,000 of Jefferson's prized artifacts, like botanic microscopes, an illustrated engraving of the Declaration of Independence, and elk antlers from the Lewis and Clark Expedition (which Jefferson sponsored). The residence provides a fascinating exhibition of the progressive, transformative ideas of its owner. monticello.org. Graceland   Born in Mississippi and raised in Memphis, Tennessee, Elvis Presley incorporated the homegrown sounds of the Delta blues and country music into his songs, and then shared them with the rest of the world. Graceland, his home in Memphis, is a similar melting pot of styles and tastes. Like his music, it's American through and through. Among the highlights: two private jets named Lisa Marie and Hound Dog II, five gold-plated showerheads, and in the car museum across the street, 10 of the King's favorite rides, including his famous pink Cadillac. elvis.com/graceland. Pearl Harbor . The bombing of Pearl Harbor transformed a sleepy, remote naval base in Hawaii into a fiery catalyst for America's entry into World War II. Within the space of a few hours, the U.S. Pacific naval fleet was devastated, more than 2,300 servicemen died, and the nation united around a common cause. It's hard to imagine a more poignant memorial than the Alfred Preis-designed bridge that hovers over the midsection of the sunken battleship, the USS Arizona, which remains the underwater grave for 1,177 of her crewmen. nps.gov/valr. Historic Ebenezer Baptist Church . The struggle for racial equality has taken place all over the country, but for Martin Luther King Jr., it began in Atlanta, Georgia, at the church where he was baptized, delivered his first sermon, and served as co-pastor with his father until his death in 1968. His soaring speeches clarified the goals of the civil rights movement and extended the country's promise of freedom; his example of nonviolence remains an astounding contribution to the country's history of dissent. Note: The parish has grown into a larger building across the street (where visitors can attend services); the historic church is now part of a National Historic Site that includes his birth home and grave.

"(CNN) -- IBM, one of America's largest companies, shook the employee compensation world when it announced recently that it would contribute only once every December to its employees' 401(k) accounts. Any employee who leaves before December would not be able to collect the company's match. Workers at IBM aren't marching to the picket line like Walmart workers and longshoreman who protest pay and working conditions, but you just never know. Only about 9% of the nation's employers make matches once a year. IBM's move is paving the way for big companies to go down this road. If I were an IBM manager, I would love this once-a-year lump payment. First, my buddies in Human Resources would have much less hassle with fewer deposits to make. By delaying payment to the end of the year, ""the float"" -- interest accrued -- would go to the company instead of the workers. In other words, the company saves money. Moreover, few IBM workers are going to voluntarily leave before December, which means projects can be planned better and employees can be asked to do more. QUIZ: The ultimate portfolio -- 15 questions to help you define your financial goals . A few years ago, in 2008, IBM made news by transforming its traditional defined benefit plan, a pension, into a 401(k)-type plan. That move saved money, but the company lost an important personnel tool. Defined benefit plans are designed to encourage employees to exit or retire when it is optimal for the company. A 401(k) is cheaper, but it is a ""cash and carry"" account that does not have the element of timing finesse. A 401(k) plan does not reward loyalty, and its value is not predictable as it fluctuates all over the place depending on the financial markets. By making workers stay until December before they can receive the company's 401(k) match, IBM is putting back, albeit with an anemic substitute, a reward for workers to stay at least until December. The company can be pretty sure that there will be very few workers exiting during crunch time season: September, October and November. It would really be IBM's choice in determining which employees to let go. This incremental addition to IBM's control over their employees is surely the main reason IBM changed its 401(k) payment timing. But let's step back. Relative to other companies, IBM actually has a good retirement plan. It matches more than 6% of a worker's contribution, which is above the national average. Only 7% of companies do not make matches to 401(k) plans, so at least IBM is, for now, in the majority of companies that match their employees' contributions. Not many people know that just because a company sponsors a 401(k) plan doesn't mean that it will pay a cent. In the Great Recession of 2008 to 2009, more than 11% of companies stopped their 401(k) match. Because they are voluntary, most workers do not even have a retirement account plan, which means many middle-class and upper-middle-class workers will only have Social Security to rely on for retirement. These workers face considerable chance of downward mobility later in life because Social Security is not designed to replace pre-retirement living standards for anyone but the lowest paid workers. Middle-class workers will need at least a $500,000 payout on top of Social Security checks to have a chance of remaining middle class when they retire. Most of us could only dream of accumulating that amount or its equivalent by saving for retirement at work or being in a pension plan. IBM looks better than most companies because most companies are whacking their workers' retirement plans or don't sponsor any at all. GM offered its salaried, white-collar workers a lump sum -- the worst way to get a retirement account because people spend a lump sum too fast -- instead of an annuity. Ford will follow GM's example next year. Fortunately, very few auto managers and workers are taking up such an offer; they must know an annuity is more valuable. What is there to stop companies from ending retirement accounts altogether? Nothing. Unions represent less than 11% of the private sector workforce and the unemployment rate is high enough that anyone who has a job feels lucky to have a job. I don't see anything on the horizon that will encourage companies to maintain or improve retirement programs at the workplace. Political leadership and bravery is needed to call out the failure of the voluntary retirement system and to secure retirement income and savings for all American workers. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Teresa Ghilarducci.","IBM said it would contribute once every December to its employees' 401(k) plans .

"(CNN) -- Daniel Agdag works with a limited arsenal of tools: a surgical scalpel, some cardboard, every so often a circular cutter and lots of glue. But from that humble toolkit, he makes sculptures that are mind-bendingly complex. For the past 10 years, the Melbourne, Australia artist has been building intricate cardboard sculptures in the form of whimsical flying machines and rickety roller coasters. They look like pencil sketches brought to life, and with good reason. Long before Agdag began crafting his cardboard pieces, he was drawing them in his notebook. He'd sketch crazy roller coasters and off-beat architectural structures. One day he visited his neighbor (an architect), who showed him models made from boxboard. ""I said, 'Can I have some of that cardboard,' and from there I started creating my roller coasters,"" he recalls. ""All of a sudden what was on the page became this really elaborate 3-D sculpture."" It wasn't all of a sudden, of course. Constructing the piecesis a painstaking process that typically takes one to three months. Nowadays, Agdag has enough experience to forego the sketching process and build as he goes. He'll think up some strange contraption and simply begin cutting pieces of cardboard and piecing them together with AVP glue. He prefers working with the scalpel (""I go through four or five a day,"" he says) and uses only three gauges of board: 1mm, .8 mm and .2 mm. Many of Agdag's pieces are marvel of balance. In one, a crepe-like balloons balances on top of fragile unicycle. In another a house sits high on a system of thin-as-toothpick scaffolding. Each of these pieces has glue, yes, but they also have built-in structural integrity, much in the way an architect uses hidden elements to build a robust building. This requires a huge amount of trial and error. ""I have to make it and tear it apart and then throw it away and start again,"" he says. ""It's very much like drawing and rubbing out [erasing]. So even though they're technically sculptural, I feel like they're drawings in cardboard."" For now, the sculptures are moderately sizedâ€”they range from around 20 to 30 inches tall. But Agdag has plans to make them even bigger. He has an idea to make a DC9 plane with a 7Ã—10 meter wingspan. ""I want to make all the ribs, all the componentry, the skeletal structure all the way through, "" he says. ""It's going to take a lot of cardboard."" Read more from WIRED: . Why are we so fat?

"(CNN) -- Bowe Bergdahl wanted a life of adventure. People attend a vigil for Bergdahl in Hailey, Idaho, on Wednesday. He was a seeker, a hard worker, a man raised in a small town, an avid outdoorsman who took ballet lessons. By the age of 23, he had learned to navigate the high seas on an expedition that took him from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean. He didn't care for cars, choosing to bike to and from odd jobs he worked to pay for his travels, friends say. ""He's a good kid,"" said his hometown buddy Dylan Fulmer. ""Strong as an ox."" While working on a commercial fishing vessel in Alaska, Bergdahl told Fulmer he was dreaming of riding his motorcycle around the world. ""This kid is crazy,"" laughed Fulmer, recalling his reaction to his friend's ambitions. ""There's no land all the way around the world. Then he explained the whole boat process. Biking around the world, that's one heckuva feat right there.""  Watch how friends recall adventurous Bergdahl » . Enlisting in the U.S. Army was another way for him to understand the world, but has become a horrific encounter with the darker side. Pvt. Bowe Bergdahl was captured three weeks ago in the Paktika province in southeastern Afghanistan, according to the Department of Defense. The Taliban is holding him, threatening to kill him if foreign troops continue search operations in Ghazni and Paktika provinces, which they claim target civilians, according to Taliban commander Mulvi Sangeen contacted by telephone by CNN Friday at an undisclosed location. On Sunday, a video was released of Bergdahl dressed in loose fitting blue clothes and sitting on the floor in a location that American officials are not pinpointing publicly. The soldier seems to get choked up when he speaks of his family -- his parents, siblings, nieces and nephew -- and the girlfriend he hopes to marry. ""I have a very, very good family that I love back home in America, and I miss them every day that I'm gone,"" he says. ""I miss them, and I'm afraid I might never see them again and that I'll never be able to tell them I love them again. I'll never be able to hug them. I'm scared I won't be able to go home. It is very unnerving to be a prisoner,"" he says. He adds that he's being treated like ""a guest."" It's unclear if he is speaking from a script his captors are ordering him to follow. Bergdahl's family members, who live in a small rustic home tucked in the woods outside Ketchum, Idaho, have chosen not to speak to reporters. The Bergdahls released a statement earlier this week: ""We appreciate and take comfort in all the kind words and support we've heard."" ""We'd like to ask that your concern for our son Bowe also be shared with all of our American service members in harm's way around the world. We are very grateful to all of them."" Bowe Bergdahl was home schooled and taught chivalry at a young age, friends and neighbors of his family say. He is able to have a conversation with anyone, and has a natural curiosity. ""Bowe is not somebody in the corner,"" said Sue Martin, the owner of Zaney's Coffee Shop in nearby Hailey, Idaho, where Bergdahl once worked as a barista. ""You engage and he engages very well."" ""He captures you,"" Martin said. She recalled going to her car after a snowstorm and seeing that the snow had been scrapped off. ""Bowe would have been out there... He would never say anything,"" Martin said. Her shop has become the epicenter of hometown support, with people leaving notes to him. ""Always a knight searching for what is good and right and true in the world,"" one of them read. One rainy evening, Blaine Country Sheriff Walt Femling spotted Bergdahl walking his bike on the side of the road, completely drenched. ""I stopped to give him a ride and he turned it down because he didn't want to get my car wet and he continued to walk in the rain. Kind of tells you a little bit about the person,"" recalled Femling, who know Bergdahl through renting him an apartment the sheriff owned. ""I don't usually rent to 20-year-olds,"" Femling said, but he trusted Bergdahl. ""There's not many young people who have the kind manners he has,"" said neighbor Minna Casser. ""He's a gentleman and a sportsman. He did some yard work for us. And he didn't just do the job, he went above and beyond what was expected."" And for all the complimentary things people in Blaine County, Idaho, are saying at Bowe Bergdahl, they all make sure at least one thing is understood. This is not a young man who backs down. Dan Collins is a fishing boat captain who hired Bergdahl for 10 weeks two summers ago, pulling for sockeye salmon in Bristol Bay, Alaska, up for 18 to 20 hours a day. ""It's just hard, grueling work, hours per day. But he was up to it,"" said Collins. ""I am at times not the easiest guy to get along with, being a fishing boat's captain. But I imagine I am easy compared to what he is dealing with everyday now."" CNN's Ed Lavandera, Paul Vercammen, Ashley Fantz and Barbara Starr contributed to this report.","Bowe Bergdahl tough under adverse circumstances, friends say .

"(CNN) -- Kelci Stringer realized her days in high heels were numbered when her children began to walk. She struggled to keep up with them in her strappy stilettos and platform pumps, and the situation only worsened as they got older and needed to be shuttled around from school to soccer and myriad extracurricular activities. The Atlanta mother still loves heels for special occasions, but her daily routine calls for flats. Slippers, loafers and sneakers are part of her uniform but she struggled to find unique varieties at a decent price. When she decided to start her own business, the name ""flats"" sprang to mind while she was getting a pedicure. ""I saw a void in the market that needed to be filled,"" Stringer said. ""My father said to me, 'You've bought enough shoes so you ought to know something about them.'"" Sure, heels will always be a mainstay of women's fashion. But flats are getting their due on the streets and the runway with more embellishment and detail, belying the common perception of a basic ballet flat. Stringer's Buckhead boutique, ""FLATZ"" is full of variations: embroidered ikat loafers, faux pink snakeskin slippers, bright yellow jelly sandals and leather studded flip-flops. Located in a small shopping plaza among a deli, hair salon and shoe repair shop, FLATZ opened in October to cater to shoppers who don't want to sacrifice style for comfort. Business is picking up with summer around the corner as shoppers look for comfortable beach sandals or stylish walking shoes for sightseeing vacations. Some might say flats lack the appeal of a sky-high stiletto, but strutting around in comfort can be sexy, too. ""I feel like wearing a pair of flats connotes a sense of low maintenance that men are typically drawn toward,"" said Leandra Medine, founder of the popular ""Man Repeller"" fashion blog that celebrates trends women love and men hate. ""Of course, the purported argument against them and pro-heels is related to the sex factor. They're obviously the more conventionally 'attractive' choice."" The return of a classic . Flats are having a moment as mainstream fashion embraces menswear-inspired looks for women, with wing-tipped oxfords, embroidered loafers and smoking slippers gracing fall 2014 runway shows. Glamour Magazine recently started featuring flats in a #FlatsFriday Instagram post which also invites Instagrammers to share their favorite flats. On the popular style blog ""View From The Topp"" Kate Brien chronicles her daily outfits, paying tribute to a wide range of flats, from her beloved Birkenstocks and Clio sandals to tasseled loafers and colorful oxfords. Heels occasionally make an appearance, but ""I'm rarely in heels during my day-to-day,"" she said. ""I'll wear heels on occasion but flats are much more me,"" said Brien, who describes her look as ""Parisian Tomboy/Messy Vogue."" ""I like shoes that are comfortable and classic. Of course interesting details and fun colors are always great, but my favorite pairs are ones that I know I will have forever."" The basic ballet flat has been around for centuries, modeled after the dancer's ballet slipper as an alternative to the unwieldy heels and chopines of the Renaissance era. Their popularity waxed and waned over the years before French shoemaker Rose Repetto revived production of ballet slippers in the 20th century. French actor Brigitte Bardot is credited with bringing the classic ""cendrillon"" shoe to the masses after Repetto created it at her request for her to wear it in ""...And God Created Women."" Actor Audrey Hepburn is also thought to have contributed to the popularity of ballet flats after wearing them in ""Funny Face."" Women have been complaining about heels for as long as they've been wearing them. ""We'll know that feminism has worked when a woman goes up to get a best actress Oscar wearing flat, comfortable shoes,"" author Caitlin Moran snarkily noted in her 2012 book, ""How to be a Woman."" ""How much more fun we would be having if we could only stop being slaves to the torture stilts we insisted on wearing. We could then stand around and chat and laugh all night like the men ... and maybe even do a little bit of business."" Opting for flats over heels might require a mental shift in women who've come to identify themselves by their footwear. 'Reprogramming' perceptions . The typical customer at Atlanta's FLATZ boutique is in her mid-30s, someone who ""knows what works for her and knows what she wants,"" owner Kelcie Stringer said. ""She's not competing with anyone, or what's on TV,"" Stringer said. ""I appreciate a customer who knows what she wants instead of my having to convince her of what she needs."" Other shoppers tend to come in because they can no longer wear heels due to foot problems, or because they're unhappy with their body and want their shoes to be their statement piece, store manager Christina Mitchell said. Often, her job requires ""reprogramming"" their minds to make them understand that flats can be chic, she said. ""Sometimes, when people think of flats, they say flats are boring,"" she said. ""But they can have a lot of personality."" When shopper Tanya Lewis visited the store this week, she was already a convert. Flats are her go-to footwear for work and socializing. Her mother, on the other hand, had just recently come around to them after leaving her job in banking. ""When I was working I wore heels every day. I think you need them in corporate America,"" Lewis' mother said, declining to give her name. The pair left with a pair of gladiator sandals for Lewis, and loafers and pointed-toe slippers for her mother. ""I'm veering more toward flats with age,"" she said.","There's more to flat shoes than your basic ballet slipper .

"(CNN) -- Remember when Sarah Palin was the face of the Republican Party? It only seems like yesterday she was the Republicans' most talked-about candidate for president. Now she's gone from prominent voice on Fox News to a reality TV star whose latest project is a book entitled ""A Happy Holiday IS a Merry Christmas."" That's almost as good a book title as Christine O'Donnell's ""Troublemaker: Let's Do What It Takes To Make America Great Again"" and way better than the snoozer Sharron Angle is pushing: ""Right Angle: One Woman's Journey to Reclaim the Constitution."" Immigration reform may be the aspect of the GOP rebranding strategy that gets the most headlines, but heeding Gov. Bobby Jindal's call to ""stop being the stupid party"" also appears to be high on the party's list. Hence the marginalizing of Palin and the rest of the party's Sisterhood of the Traveling Rants. In 2010, the sisterhood was everywhere, speaking in front of big crowds, making stuff up as they went along. Now they're at the kids' table, trying to make room for one more: Michele Bachmann. ""I fully anticipate the mainstream liberal media to put a detrimental spin on my decision not to seek a fifth term,"" Bachmann said in a nearly nine-minute video in which she announced that she is not seeking re-election. What is Bachmann's legacy? In another example of what has become the norm for conservatives who become annoyed by facts, Bachmann pointed a finger at the so-called mainstream liberal media and not at her former national field coordinator, Peter Waldron, who filed an ethics complaint. She's accusing the media of spin instead of owning up to the fact that House Republicans have quietly shunned her or that her well-documented penchant for massaging the truth has drawn criticism from conservatives such as Bill O'Reilly. In April 2009, while arguing against climate change on the House floor, Bachmann said, ""there isn't even one study that can be produced that shows that carbon dioxide is a harmful gas."" In 2011, in regards to HPV vaccination, she said a mother told ""me that her little daughter took that vaccine, that injection, and she suffered from mental retardation thereafter. It can have very dangerous side effects."" This year, she gave a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conerence, slinging hunks of red-meat untruths about President Obama, and when she was questioned about the facts of her speech by CNN's Dana Bash, she ran away. Bachmann said she is not disappearing and vows to keep fighting for America, a thought I'm sure makes Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus cringe. He's trying to limit the number of ignorant, controversial statements that derailed more than one campaign during the 2012 election. Bachmann is a walking ignorant, controversial statement waiting to happen. ""We have to be persistent but patient,"" Priebus said in response to the handful of notable Republicans who have suggested impeaching Obama over the IRS scandal. ""I think where there's smoke, there's fire. If we present ourselves to the American people as intelligent, we're going to be in a great place as far as showing that this administration is not transparent, is obsessed with power and hates dissent. But you don't call for impeachment until you have evidence."" Bachmann looks forward to future, but not in the House . Bachmann said it was worse than Watergate, and no, she presented no evidence to support such claims. The fact is, the brand of spitfire politics Bachmann, Palin et al. employ is usually not patient or intelligent. It's often irresponsible hyperbole designed to generate buzz as opposed to inform. If directed properly, it's an effective way to win an election. But the problem with spitfire is that it's sometimes hard to control. The sisterhood was hard to control, and on more than one occasion, the party was burned because of it. That's why slowly, methodically, politically, the most famous members of 2010's sisterhood have been extinguished, done in by the fact that far too often they had no idea what they were talking about. Think about it: Three years ago, Palin was a rock star who had Democrats on the run. Now she's writing a Christmas book. Thankfully, Susan Collins was too levelheaded to be a part of the group. Unfortunately, Olympia Snowe was too levelheaded to stay a part of Congress. One can only hope scrubbing stupid away can help bring respect back to a party that handed a lot of it over in exchange for the 2010 midterm election. Assuming Bachmann survives the ethics investigation, I'm sure a new book is in her future as well. I just hope bookstores have the good sense to put it under ""fiction."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of LZ Granderson.","Michele Bachmann announced her plan to leave Congress at end of term .

"(CNN) -- The action on the pitch at the World Cup has been sensational -- but one man is engineering plenty of eye-catching scenes off it too. The wild touchline antics of Mexico coach Miguel Herrera have fans the world over willing his team to score, just so they can revel in his reaction. During Monday's 3-1 win over Croatia, which secured Mexico's place in the last 16, Herrera was his usual firecracker self on the sidelines. Now social media is awash with clips of Herrera hugging his players, screaming at the officials or rolling around the floor celebrating a goal. ""Miguel Herrera reactions are the best reactions ever,"" said one on Twitter. ""Miguel Herrera on the sidelines should be a Broadway show. I'd watch for years straight,"" said another. Herrera has had plenty to shout about too. The 46-year-old took charge of the national team in October last year, with Mexico having struggled in their qualification group. He guided Mexico through a playoff with New Zealand to secure a berth in Brazil and has transformed it into a confident, well organized unit. After beating Cameroon in its opening match thanks to Oribe Peralta's goal, it held hosts Brazil to a 0-0 draw in its second clash. But Mexico exploded into life on Monday, putting three goals past Croatia, each strike prompting an even more exuberant reaction from its coach. After one goal Herrera was even bundled to the floor by defender Paul Aguilar, picking himself up in time for a leaping hug with goalkeeper Guillermo Ochoa. ""That is one of the happiest days of my life,"" Herrera later told reporters at a press conference. ""It was a hard fight, but my team pulled through. We felt as if we were playing at home in Mexico. ""We overcame the first hurdle. We're happy. We're going to celebrate tonight but tomorrow we have to start thinking of our match with the Netherlands."" Should Mexico make it past the Dutch, who thumped defending champions Spain 5-1 in their opening match, one can only imagine the new heights Herrera's histrionics will reach.","Mexico coach Miguel Herrera becoming known for his touchline histrionics .

"(CNN) -- On the eve of President Obama's speech laying out his strategy to combat the terror group ISIS, national security hawks are demanding the United States authorize airstrikes against the group's leaders. ""We need to be targeting the top ISIS military and strategic leadership,"" said Danielle Pletka at the American Enterprise Institute. ""Our policy up 'til now hasn't been good enough. It's a day late and a dollar short, and that's why ISIS is a threat to the United States."" So far, U.S. airstrikes have focused on ISIS field positions in Iraq, following three limited goals outlined by the President: to protect Americans, help Iraqi forces and prevent a humanitarian disaster. But top leaders have not been singled out, according to Pentagon spokesman Col. Steven Warren. ""We have not conducted any targeted airstrikes on specific ISIL leaders,"" he said, using the administration's acronym for ISIS, which calls itself the ""Islamic State"". Still, when asked why the United States is not trying to kill the group's top leaders, White House spokesman Josh Earnest did not rule out such a strategy in the future. ""I would anticipate that as our intelligence improves, and crystallizes, that our military capabilities will expand accordingly,"" Earnest said Tuesday. Moreover, he said, thanks to the formation of a new Iraqi government, the President believes ""we are ready to enter the next, more offensive phase, in this strategy."" The President's former national security adviser, retired Gen. James L. Jones, said he would be very surprised if the President did not instruct the military to target the head of ISIS at some point. ""When the President gives the word, it will be a formidable capability that we launch against this organization, and perhaps against him."" A brief history of fighting terror . Analysts said the first challenge would be to locate elusive ISIS leaders like Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. ""The trouble is, they don't have good human intelligence networks in Syria right now,"" said Paul Cruickshank, author of a new book about a mole who infiltrated al Qaeda. Trying to penetrate a group as ruthless as ISIS with a secret agent would not only be extraordinarily difficult, he said, but also highly dangerous. Former CIA operative Robert Baer said he believes ISIS militants are shrewdly avoiding electronic intercepts. ""I'm quite certain that ISIS is staying off the phone, and nobody around Baghdadi, for instance, would have a cell phone, for instance, or any kind of communications,"" he said. And the failure of the recent U.S. attempt to rescue American hostages with a team of commandos, he said, showed that ""our information is old, and secondhand."" 5 questions Obama must answer about ISIS strategy . But a U.S. intelligence official pointed out that over time, the United States has killed top extremist leaders, from Osama bin Laden in Pakistan to Anwar al Awlaki in Yemen to Abu Musab al-Zarqawi in Iraq. ""The intelligence community has a proven track record finding, fixing and finishing elusive leaders of terrorist groups,"" the official said. ""It is a real cat and mouse game, and in this case the cat is an experienced hunter."" Even if al-Baghdadi were killed, another militant could easily take his place, in the same way that al-Baghdadi himself rose to the top position after both his predecessors were killed. Obama to Congress: No vote needed on ISIS strategy . But Patrick Johnston with the RAND Corp., who studied dozens of past cases where extremist groups were decapitated, found that killing a group's leaders can increase the odds of defeating it by 25% to 30%. ""Removing these individuals can help to degrade the organization in ways that make it harder for them to operate,"" he said, by depriving the group of its leader's charisma, operational skills, personal contacts and even fundraising. CNN's Michelle Kosinski and Jamie Crawford contributed to this report.","As President's ISIS speech nears, hawks say policy hasn't been good enough so far .

"(CNN) -- Could we one day live underwater? Ask Fabien Cousteau -- a month from now. Cousteau, grandson of underwater explorer Jacques-Yves Cousteau, is spending the rest of June in Aquarius, the world's only underwater marine lab, 63 feet beneath the ocean's surface near Key Largo, Florida. Cousteau and a small team of researchers -- they like the term ""aquanauts"" -- will spend the month living together in cramped quarters while studying how climate change and pollution affect ocean life. The monthlong operation is called Mission 31, named for the number of days they will live underwater. ""I hope this will spawn a new focus on ocean exploration, whether it's living in a habitat or beyond,"" said Cousteau. He'll be assisted by more than 30 support staff, including filmmakers and researchers from Florida International University, which operates the Aquarius lab. ""It takes 24 people topside just to have six people down below for 31 days, just like NASA does for the International Space Station,"" Cousteau said. Some 50 years ago, Jacques Cousteau and a team of underwater researchers lived for a record 30 days in an ocean lab known as Conshelf II at the bottom of the Red Sea. With Mission 31, Fabien Cousteau hopes to honor his grandfather's legacy while beating his record by one day. The project also marks the first opportunity for fans to follow an underwater Cousteau expedition in real time. Thanks to Internet connectivity inside Aquarius, Fabien Cousteau hopes to reach millions of people through Skype, Instagram, Twitter chats and classroom sessions via streaming video at mission-31.com. We had a rare opportunity to visit Cousteau as he was undertaking his mission and get a glimpse of Aquarius, a lab that has been used by NASA astronauts in pre-mission training. The 81-ton lab sits on stilts and resembles some kind of underwater machinery that's covered with algae, barnacles and other growths. Schools of fish, a stingray, tarpons, a nurse shark and a 300-pound grouper cruise by as we descend the 63 feet to the lab. We enter through something called a moon pool, a small chamber that leads to the entrance of Aquarius. Going quickly from underwater to inside, we begin breathing normal air, but our bodies are still pressurized, so they're reacting to dive-like conditions underwater. Because of that, our time is limited before we have to go to the surface. At 400 square feet, the lab is the size of a small studio apartment. The air conditioning is broken, and you can feel the humidity. ""You might find this to be a little weird and trippy, but I actually feel at home down here,"" Cousteau said upon greeting us. ""It is amazing. I couldn't imagine a better house than one under sea."" Looking around, we see packets of dehydrated food and chips, which will feed the crew, who can't cook anything. To heat a pan could cause a spark, which is too risky with all the flammable oxygen around. But while the meals are basic, the technology is advanced. The lab and control room are equipped with Wi-Fi, which lets Cousteau use Skype and remain in contact with the world above. There are 4K cameras and dozens of GoPros, along with numerous computers. There's also a refrigerator and a half-dozen bunk beds. A few personal mementos, like family snapshots, are sprinkled around. There are many things scientists already know about what happens when humans spend a lot of time underwater. Weird things. After about 10 days, for example, you start to lose your sense of taste. Your hair grows faster, your voice is higher -- due to atmospheric pressure -- and for some reason you can't whistle (try and you will fail). After scuba diving for six to eight hours a day, you sleep like a baby. That may be helpful, considering Cousteau's team is conducting the longest underwater sleep study to date. Their sleep cycles are monitored constantly with smartwatches. While all this research is important, there's one question that still lingers: What is the point of a mission like this? Cousteau said it's about more than just breaking records. ""I hope I am a firestarter, because at the end of the day, who wouldn't want to be an aquanaut?"" he said. ""I mean, this is just an amazing place. It's our final frontier. We've explored less than 5% of our oceans, so there's a lot left to do out there.""","Fabien Cousteau is living in a marine lab 63 feet beneath the ocean's surface near Florida .

"Washington (CNN) -- The gay Oregon man who helped overturn the state's decade-old ban on same-sex marriage is featured in a campaign ad for a Republican Senate candidate -- and he now finds himself on the receiving end of some criticism from LGBT activists. Ben West and his husband, Paul Rummell, became high-profile figures in Oregon's gay rights community this year when they challenged the state's voter-approved ban on same-sex marriage and won. Now West is backing Monica Wehby, the Republican nominee and same-sex marriage supporter who's challenging Sen. Jeff Merkley, a Democratic incumbent with a long record of fighting for LGBT rights. It wasn't too big of a surprise that Wehby is unveiling her support for same-sex marriage. ""This is Oregon. This is not Texas,"" Republican strategist Ford O'Connell said, referring to the state's liberal tendencies. ""I don't see a political risk."" It was, however, a big step for West and his husband to lend their names to Wehby's campaign. While many of West's friends and acquaintances have been respectful and even happy with his decision, he said, some have been ""shocked."" His Facebook page shows a sampling of the disagreements. Some simply can't fathom electing a Republican, while others say they have a hard time buying Wehby's position. ""Where was she earlier this year when we were 'fighting the fight'?"" one person wrote, referring to the legal challenge against the state's law. ""But now that it's over and she doesn't want to be on the 'wrong side of history', she is supportive, or says that she is."" Still, others are dismayed that West would not support Merkley, a senator that one person described as ""a point of pride for Oregon."" ""I am deeply saddened by the public stance that you have taken against one of the gay community's champions in DC,"" another person wrote. ""I hope you will recant your position."" Judge strikes down Florida's same-sex marriage ban . Jeana Frazzini, executive director at Basic Rights Oregon, a group that worked actively in the challenge against the state's same-sex marriage ban, said she can't speak for West and Rummell, adding the ""LGBT community is politically diverse and we can't expect 100% agreement on every issue or candidate."" She went on to laud Merkley and question Wehby's record on same-sex marriage. Democrats point to previous comments when Wehby didn't take one position or the other on same-sex marriage, saying mostly that it's an issue that should be left to the states. The ad causing the stir . In the 30-second television spot released Tuesday by Wehby's campaign, West looks directly into the camera and talks about how marrying his partner ""was the happiest day"" of his life. But he cautions there's still ""a lot of work left to do"" in the national push for same-sex marriage. ""Whether it's standing up for equality or for the unemployed or for the next generation, we need leaders who have the courage to do what's right,"" he continues. ""That's why I support Monica Wehby. I know she'll fight for every Oregon family, including mine."" At the end of the ad, which was first reported by Politico, West and Wehby stand next to each with their arms around each other, smiling. In a written statement, Wehby said she's ""proud and humbled"" to have the endorsement of West, a Republican, and his husband, a Democrat. ""Their courage to stand up for their family, and against inequality, is inspiring and embodies the spirit I will serve with as Oregon's next senator,"" she said. Supreme Court: No same-sex marriage in Virginia, yet . West and Rummell reached out to Wehby's campaign shortly after she became the GOP nominee and got to know her over a coffee date and a long visit to her house. While Rummell had some serious doubts at the beginning, West said they eventually decided to ""go out on a limb"" and endorse her because they believed she was an overall better candidate than the incumbent senator. Citing their role in Oregon's gay rights world, West described the decision as ""very difficult."" ""It's not easy to get the blowback when yesterday you were the darling of the community,"" he said. ""But we're acting with conviction in our hearts, and I'm not going to apologize for that."" A blueprint for the future? While it wasn't a big risk in Oregon, the spot was certainly an uncommon move on the national level. Only four current GOP members of the U.S. Senate support same-sex marriage. But Wehby, a pediatric neurosurgeon, trails Merkley by double digits. While her race has become more competitive than expected, political observers still rate it as a likely Democratic seat. Experts say she needed to make a splash to keep the pressure on. ""It seemed like a powerful, daring and bold move, but it also seems very wise given the landscape of Oregon,"" said O'Connell. Judges hear four states defend same-sex marriage bans . As polls continue to show increasing support for same-sex marriage, O'Connell argued Republicans will be paying close attention to the outcome in Oregon. ""Depending on how this turns out for Wehby, this could be a blueprint for how Republicans could move forward,"" he said. Advocates for traditional marriage, however, have vowed to stop any momentum Wehby may gain from the ad. ""I think she's committed suicide politically,"" said Frank Schubert, the political director for National Organization for Marriage. He blasted her for supporting West and Rummell, calling their lawsuit a major insult to the voters who backed the amendment in 2004. Schubert said his group is beginning to put together its plan to go after Wehby, adding that they're prepared to spend money in the state. ""Our organization will certainly urge Oregonians to refuse to vote for her,"" he said saying they'll make sure people know she's not only in favor of same sex-marriage, but ""she is in favor of the courts invalidating their votes.""","Republican Monica Wehby is running for the U.S. Senate in Oregon .

"(CNN) -- As U.S. President Barack Obama decides on the best strategy to deal with the threat posed by ISIS in Iraq, Syria and beyond, his final plan of action will undoubtedly include the participation of like-minded allied countries and regional partners. One such partner are the Kurds of northern Iraq who regard ISIS as the biggest threat since the fall of the Saddam Hussein regime in 2003. The Kurds, however, are hoping for a more robust and lasting U.S. commitment as part of rekindled Kurdish-American cooperation. Meanwhile, it might be timely for Washington to reassess its previous refusal to directly engage with Kurdish armed forces. As the last few weeks of military battles against ISIS show, when American assistance has not been forthcoming, the Iraqi Kurds have turned to Iran for help. In terms of identity, the Kurdish Regional Government (KRG) in northern Iraq stands apart from most of the rest of the Middle East due to its secular way of life and pro-Western orientation. And what the Kurds have put together here since securing autonomy from Baghdad in 2005 is antithetical to the primordial worldview of ISIS, which calls itself the Islamic State. Now, with its record of relative stability and nascent democracy in danger, officials in the KRG are once again turning to the United States. The Kurds have welcomed Washington's decision to confront ISIS. At the same time, however, officials in Irbil are urging the Obama administration to start a long overdue process of helping the Kurds help themselves by empowering them militarily. The simplest of facts about the Kurdish armed forces -- the Peshmerga -- are hard to miss. Despite the heightened enthusiasm to repel ISIS, the Peshmerga continue to suffer from some elemental structural drawbacks. After years of semi-autonomous rule, Iraqi Kurds still lack an institutionalized, non-politicized armed force. The majority of the Peshmerga are still made up from armed members from the two largest political parties in the KRG: the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK). In the past the absence of an organized and well-trained armed force was accepted by the various Iraqi Kurdish parties as an inevitable but tolerable condition. The rise of ISIS, however, has rapidly changed that unsustainable attitude. The role of the U.S. To achieve a better organized and a more capable Kurdish military force requires more than just political horse-trading in Irbil. It requires American mediation and military assistance to the Kurds. The fact that the United States has good relations with all Iraqi Kurdish parties gives Washington leverage among the Kurdish parties. This leverage can be used to set out to help the Iraqi Kurds build up a more efficient military as they battle ISIS. But, before any practical steps can be taken, Washington first has to decide whether it wants to go down this path. Since the fall of Saddam's regime, the U.S. has chosen not to train and equip the Kurdish Peshmerga directly. Washington's policy on the provision of military assistance and training has been that all such efforts will have to go through the central government in Baghdad. The U.S. is still committed to Iraq's territorial integrity as a principal policy and dealing with the Kurds over the head of Baghdad is seen as putting that policy in danger. And then there are the bureaucratic hurdles to overcome. Despite good relations with the leaderships of the KDP and the PUK, on paper both entities are still designated by the U.S. as Tier III terrorist organizations. That is why the Kurdish Peshmerga, numbering 150,000 of which some 110,000 are members of KDP or the PUK, cannot receive U.S. military aid directly. As American policy-makers wrestle with this question in Washington, Iraq's Kurds have had to look elsewhere for support. In June, following the barrage of military victories of ISIS, Iran was at first the only country that proved willing to come to the aid of the Kurds with military supplies and advisors. In a press conference with the Iranian foreign minister, Javad Zarif, in Irbil on August 26, Masoud Barzani, President of Iraqi Kurdistan, said ""Iraqi Kurds will never forget Iran's support that came at a crucial time beyond our expectation."" But Iran's appearance as the key backer of the Peshmerga is not cost-free. Under Tehran's stewardship, Iranian-backed Shia militias from elsewhere in Iraq have come north to join the fight against ISIS. As much as the Kurds have welcomed Iran's role in rolling back ISIS, there are fears about the longer-term impact of Tehran's larger footprint in Iraqi Kurdistan. But given the imminent threat posed by ISIS, how Iranian military support has come about is for now a secondary concern for Iraq's Kurds. They are simply pleased that Tehran has been there to provide much--needed military aid when it was most wanted. Tehran, meantime, will not be blind to the fact that internal Kurdish divisions and a decentralized Peshmerga force provides it with opportunities to intervene and increase its influence in northern Iraq. As President Obama formulates a long-term strategy to neutralize the threat of ISIS, he cannot ignore the pivotal role Kurdish fighters likely will play in such a campaign. It might also be an opportune moment to revisit some of the more archaic American policies that shape ties with Iraqi Kurdistan. As Washington looks for ways to better organize and militarily equip the Peshmerga against ISIS, the one undeniable fact is that the Iraqi Kurds are hoping for swift American action. They prefer the United States over other foreign partners but are hardly in a position to be overly selective given the imminent threat from ISIS.

"(CNN) -- Many observers gazing upon the current bloodshed in the Middle East have wondered aloud if we are seeing the disintegration of the nation-state boundaries established in the region nearly a century ago. But the crises in Iraq and Syria have simply laid bare a phenomenon that has been under way for quite some time. What's more, this process is now almost certainly irreversible, and will lead to a radically different Middle Eastern map than we have known. In the heady early days of the Arab Spring, many people imagined that the Arab world might finally be entering a period of greater democratization, one that would inevitably lead -- so the thinking went -- to greater social unity. That didn't happen. The ""people's revolution"" in Egypt was subverted, and the fledgling democracy movement in Bahrain was crushed with Saudi military assistance. But more devastating than that is the ongoing fracturing of nations into their historical component parts. The world may be focused on the rifts in Iraq between its Shiite, Sunni and Kurd communities -- but the same ""Balkanization"" has already occurred in Libya, which is now effectively split into three de facto states. Almost surely next on the chopping block is Syria. Syria's savage civil war has divided the nation into a patchwork of government and rebel-held zones, and there is now talk within Bashar al-Assad's embattled regime of slicing off the Alawite-dominated western portions of Syria to create a more defendable mini-state. READ MORE: Map of Iraq's sectarian divide . Just how did we get here? To answer that, one would do well to look at a map of the region during the Ottoman Empire. In order to keep the peace and hold together their fantastically diverse and far-flung realm, the Ottoman sultans devised a clever system known as the ""millyet."" So long as they pledged ultimate allegiance to the sultan and paid their taxes, the empire's various religious and ethnic communities were allowed to largely govern themselves. It was hardly a trouble-free arrangement, but this system of autonomy was probably what enabled the weak Ottoman Empire, the proverbial ""sick man of Europe,"" to survive into the twentieth century. That all ended in 1914, when the Ottomans joined forces with Germany and Austro-Hungary in World War I. To the rival empires of Great Britain and France, the Ottoman lands now became known as ""the Great Loot,"" the last great frontier for European control and economic exploitation. Of course, Britain and France first had to win the war -- and well into 1915, they displayed scant ability to do so. In desperation, the British forged a secret agreement with Emir Hussein, the ruler of the Hejaz region of western Arabia, to raise an Arab revolt against the Ottoman Turks. In return, Hussein and his rebels were promised independence for virtually the entire Arab world. READ MORE: The terror group taking Iraq by storm . No sooner had Britain made the pact with Hussein, however, than it surreptitiously entered into negotiations with France. Under the terms of the secret Sykes-Picot Agreement, the future Arab independent nation was to be relegated to the wastelands of the Arabian Peninsula -- oil hadn't been discovered there yet -- while Britain and France would take possession of most everything else. Continuing in this vein, Britain also penned the Balfour Declaration, encouraging Jewish emigration into the Palestine region of Syria, an initiative that would ultimately prove to be the catalyst for the creation of Israel. This double-cross of the Arabs was not fully revealed until the postwar Paris Peace Conference, then put to paper in the 1920 San Remo Agreement. Despite the furious protestations of Arab nationalists, greater Syria was divided into four parts -- Palestine, Trans-Jordan, Lebanon and modern-day Syria -- with the British taking the first two, the French the latter. Even more volatile, as events would soon prove, were British machinations in Iraq. In their first negotiations with Emir Hussein, the British had asked for ""special administrative arrangements"" in those southern regions of Mesopotamia where oil had been discovered. But by the war's end, oil had also been discovered in the north and, with the promise of Arab independence long discarded, the British simply joined three of the Ottoman's semi-autonomous regions together and called it a country. Through their blithe hubris, British and French imperialists had built themselves a volcano and then sat atop it. For the next three decades, they managed to weather the periodic eruptions of Arab rage by propping up pliant local leaders or rushing in troops to quell the inevitable revolts. But by the early 1950s, their sway in the region had collapsed along with their empires. Into the vacuum stepped a generation of ardently nationalist military dictatorships that would eventually stretch from Libya all the way to Iraq. But how did this transmogrify into the chaos and dissolution we see in the region today? I think the answer lies in a subtler, more psychological, legacy of the ""order"" that was imposed by the European powers a century ago. READ MORE: How Iraq crisis may redraw borders . Ever since that grand betrayal, the Arab world has tended to define itself more by what it is opposed to -- colonialism, Zionism, Western political and cultural imperialism -- than what it aspires to, and even if Arab leaders have capitalized on this culture of grievance to channel popular discontent away from their own misrule, it is a mindset that has become internalized. In twenty-five years of covering conflict zones around the world, I've found that guerrillas or dissidents most everywhere can articulate what they are fighting for; in the Middle East, by contrast, it is almost always an articulation of what they are fighting against. One result, I believe, is that there's little in the way of consensus going forward once the existing order of things -- artificially-imposed or otherwise -- has been swept aside. Instead, a vacuum is created, and the ""Arab street"" fills it by turning to those allegiances that predated the object of their rage: their faith, their clans, their tribes. While the result is less devastating in a place with a strong national identity like Egypt -- there, the lack of consensus simply means the ""people's revolution"" can be gradually smothered -- in an ""artificial"" nation like Iraq, a centrifugal force takes over that, once given full power, is almost impossible to reverse. We are now at that point in Syria. Since none of its warring factions can be militarily defeated -- and the various regional powers backing their respective proxies will see to that -- the slaughter there will continue until the creation of de facto mini-nations. In Iraq, Kurdistan is already independent in all but name, and has no reason to give it name lest its chief protector, Turkey, become alarmed. The only larger question is whether ISIS -- the Sunni terror group that has taken Iraq by storm in recent weeks -- will manage to consolidate its current hold in the center of the country and join it to the great swath of eastern Syria it controls. Perversely, there may soon come a time when both the Shiite-dominated regime in Baghdad and the Alawite-dominated one in Damascus both decide such a terror-state might be the best way to be rid of their Sunni enemies. Surely the biggest surprise thus far has been the relative calm in Jordan, a nation cut from whole cloth by the European powers after World War I. Despite concerns that it too will fall into the abyss, Jordan might well be saved by the need for all its warring neighbors to have a ""Switzerland"" in the neighborhood. What might explode next? Here, the old map of the Middle East actually offers some solace. We're simply starting to run out of places that the European imperialists screwed up. The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of Scott Anderson.","Anderson: Conflicts in the Middle East are disintegrating region's post-World War I borders .

"New York (CNN) -- Close to 10,000 total flights have been canceled since the beginning of a holiday blizzard that blanketed much of the U.S. northeast with snow and left thousands stranded. Airline representatives from AirTran, American, Continental, Delta Air Lines, JetBlue, United, U.S. Airways, Spirit and Southwest reported a total of at least 9,726 trips were called off due to weather since Saturday. Of those, at least 1,335 flights were canceled on Tuesday as major airports across the region slowly got back to normal. ""With all the cancellations and delays, it'll be two to three days before the airlines are at a regular schedule,"" said Thomas Bosco, general manager of New York's LaGuardia Airport. By early Tuesday evening, LaGuardia was still operating well below its normal 70 flights per hour, he said. John F. Kennedy Airport, in the New York City borough of Queens, and Newark Liberty International, in northern New Jersey, opened to incoming and departing traffic at 6 p.m. Monday, Port Authority spokeswoman Sara Joren said. AirTran spokesman Christopher White said his airline didn't plan any more cancellations Tuesday after dropping 81 flights on Monday. Instead, White said, AirTran planned to operate additional flights out of LaGuardia, Boston's Logan Airport and White Plains, New York's Westchester County Airport to get people home. Delta Air Lines canceled 300 flights on Tuesday and was still facing reduced operations at JFK and Newark because of runway issues, according to spokesman Trebor Banstetter. ""We're hoping to return to a full schedule at JFK by tomorrow morning, and at Newark by midday tomorrow,"" Banstetter said. But the slow recovery left many passengers anxious to get home. Zarmeen Hussain and her family knew their flight home to New Jersey -- scheduled for Monday evening -- might get canceled. But they didn't expect a four-day delay. ""We were very confused and like, 'Oh, my God,'"" Hussain said from an Atlanta hotel Tuesday morning. She, her husband and daughter were in Georgia for a college reunion and were told the earliest available flight will be on Friday. ""We were thinking of the option of driving, but the car rental company gave us a quote of $2,000,"" Hussain said, laughing. She said many rental car companies are out of vehicles. Julie Stratton is in a similar predicament. She was scheduled to fly from New York to Indianapolis, Indiana, on Sunday, and ended up sleeping at LaGuardia Airport. Stratton said Monday she was told she might not be able to fly out until Thursday. ""It's not the best of scenarios, no,"" she said. ""But you just have to make the best of it. There's nothing else you can do."" The storm that has unnerved domestic and international travelers produced blinding snow and wreaked havoc from the Carolinas to Maine. By Monday night, more than 4,155 flights had been canceled, up to 32 inches of snow piled up in areas and wind gusts blew as strong as 80 mph. Several dozen people were trapped and others were thrown to the ground Tuesday when a ski lift at Sugarloaf Mountain in Maine came to an abrupt stop after a cable malfunctioned. CNN meteorologist Jacqui Jeras said wind gusts of up to 50 mph were blowing in the area at the time. ""I felt a jerk,"" said CNN employee Robb Atkinson, who was among those trapped on the lift. He described hearing ""screams from skiers below"" as he watched at least three chairs drop 20 to 30 feet to the ground. Atkinson said he and other trapped skiers were watching the injured being carried from the mountain. ""This storm was one of the most challenging storms we've had in a decade or two,"" Bosco said Monday. Jeras said the onslaught of snow had stopped, but the storm's impact was still being felt. ""The strong winds will be prevalent today,"" she said Tuesday morning. And in another move back toward normalcy, New Jersey Senate President Stephen Sweeney -- stepping in as acting governor -- rescinded the state of emergency in that state shortly after 10 p.m. Monday. Several emergency declarations were made in states and cities as the storm barrelled up the East Coast and officials executed emergency plans in an effort to expedite assistance. On Monday, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg urged residents not to dial 911 unless calling about a life-saving emergency as the city grappled with the fifth-largest storm in New York history. Parts of Brooklyn had 24 inches of snow, according to the National Weather Service -- shy of the 32 inches reported in Rahway, New Jersey. High winds were also a problem, including gusts as strong as 80 mph in Wellfleet on Cape Cod, Massachusetts. The Federal Transportation Security Administration has been coordinating with airports and airlines to bolster staffing as necessary as flights resume, according to spokeswoman Sterling Payne. Authorities were also investigating an incident that occurred at Lambert-St. Louis International Airport on Tuesday when . the wing of an Airbus jet clipped the horizontal bar near the tail section of another jet while it was being de-iced, according to airport Director Rhonda Hamm-Niebruegge. Both planes returned to the gate and were undergoing inspection, she said. Stranded travelers in New York slept on cots and atop luggage carousels Sunday night, while less-fortunate people bedded down on airport floors. ""It looked like everybody was camping inside,"" said Jacob Chmielecki, who was stranded with his family at New York's LaGuardia airport. Antonio Christopher said he spent two nights sleeping at Heathrow Airport in London, where snow caused major delays earlier this month. On Monday, he found himself in a similar situation across the pond. ""It's one of those things,"" he said. ""You have to keep up about these things. It was a blizzard. There's nothing you can do about it."" Other travel -- by rail and road -- was snarled as well. Hundreds of people were left stranded at New York's Pennsylvania railroad station after Long Island Railroad canceled trains. Amtrak said it would resume normal service Wednesday between Boston and Washington, but passengers could see some delays. By Tuesday, police had removed more than 1,000 abandoned vehicles from New York's Van Wyck Expressway and Cross Bronx Expressway, according to Bloomberg, who called the operation ""the biggest effort to clear snow our city has ever seen."" ""Because the snow fell so quickly and in such great amounts, and because the wind blew so forcefully -- creating whiteouts -- many motorists got stuck and abandoned their vehicles in the middle of streets,"" the New York mayor said Tuesday. Bloomberg said the states of New York and New Jersey loaned the city 35 ambulances, helping reduce the backlog of emergency medical services requests. The city has requested private tow companies to assist in cleanup efforts . Bloomberg noted that New York City is also facing blood-supply shortages and asked residents to donate, saying, ""We need your help now more than ever."" According to Connecticut Light & Power's website, the number of its customers affected by the storm dropped dramatically from 33,712 on Monday to 753 by Tuesday afternoon. CL&P services 1.2 million Connecticut residents, so less than 1% of customers state-wide were affected. Some 10,000 customers in Westchester County and New York City lost power due to storm and tree damage, according to a Consolidated Edison statement. By Tuesday, 500 households remained without power, ConEd said. CNN's Aaron Cooper, Allan Chernoff and David Ariosto contributed to this report.","Nearly 10,000 flights have been canceled since Saturday .

"Washington (CNN) -- A year later, President Barack Obama will likely talk differently about Syria. He addresses the nation Wednesday night to offer his strategy for ""degrading and ultimately destroying"" the ISIS jihadists who have swept across northern Iraq from Syria. Exactly one year earlier -- on September 10, 2013 -- Obama also spoke to the nation from the White House to explain why he called off asking Congress to approve air strikes on Syria over its use of chemical weapons. A lot has changed in the ensuing 12 months, particularly the rise of the Sunni extremists who call themselves the Islamic State and who seek dominance over a swath of the Middle East. Here's a look at what Obama has learned about Syria in the past year: . 1) Syrian President Bashar al-Assad isn't going anywhere . ""I have resisted calls for military action, because we cannot resolve someone else's civil war through force, particularly after a decade of war in Iraq and Afghanistan,"" Obama said last year. While he added that the United States had no interest in removing another dictator from power, he hoped the tide of the Syrian civil war would go against al-Assad to force him out. Instead, the Syrian leader got help from Hezbollah in Lebanon and, indirectly, from ISIS fighters who formed out of al Qaeda affiliates to seize the advantage over what U.S. and allied officials call the moderate opposition in Syria. That forced Obama to start providing military aid to opposition forces it considers legitimate and like-minded to Western desires for democratic governance in Syria. 2) Al Qaeda affiliates in Syria posed a broader threat . ""It's true that some of Assad's opponents are extremists,"" Obama said of al Qaeda fighters who worked against the Syrian government. He added that failure to respond militarily to al-Assad's use of chemical weapons would allow al Qaeda to ""draw strength in a more chaotic Syria."" In the end, there was no U.S. military response after Britain's Parliament voted against taking part and Obama knew he would lack congressional approval. While al-Assad gave up his known chemical weapon stockpiles, Obama's prediction came true as ISIS fighters comprising remnants of al Qaeda strengthened dramatically enough to rampage through northern Iraq. 3) The question of U.S. military action in Syria is complex . ""I will not put American boots on the ground in Syria,"" Obama said a year ago. ""I will not pursue an open-ended action like Iraq or Afghanistan. I will not pursue a prolonged air campaign like Libya or Kosovo."" Now he may propose some kind of air campaign against ISIS targets in Syria, and voices in Congress are calling for ground troops from a coalition military force -- but no Americans. The issue raises major geopolitical questions involving who would benefit or be harmed by military strikes in Syria, as well as the legality of doing so without approval from al-Assad's government. Attacking ISIS in Syria stands to benefit al-Assad by weakening what has become an internal enemy and allowing him to portray his country's civil war as a battle against terrorists opposed by the United States. Strikes by a U.S.-backed coalition in Syria also would give Russia, al-Assad's main backer, fodder to justify its own border incursions in Ukraine. 4) Secure the coalition first . ""I have, therefore, asked the leaders of Congress to postpone a vote to authorize the use of force while we pursue this diplomatic path,"" Obama said last year after Britain rejected joining a coalition to attack Syria over its chemical weapons. This time, he is expected to detail support from global allies -- including some Middle Eastern countries -- in going after ISIS wherever the threat exists, possibly including Syria. In addition, many in Congress question if Obama needs congressional approval to launch air strikes on ISIS in Syria, with several legislators saying Tuesday they doubted a vote would occur before November elections. 5) It's an election year . ""America is not the world's policeman,"" Obama said last year. ""Terrible things happen across the globe, and it is beyond our means to right every wrong."" But when ""moderate effort and risk"" by the United States can stop atrocities halfway around the world to make America safer, ""I believe we should act,"" he added then. ""That's what makes America different. That's what makes us exceptional. With humility, but with resolve, let us never lose sight of that essential truth."" Expect to hear the same thing Wednesday night, less than two months before the congressional elections, as the President straddles the political fault line between conservative calls for exerting military power and liberal opposition to a renewed war footing. His goal is to satisfy moderates and independents crucial to Democratic hopes of holding on to control of the Senate while not angering the party's liberal base.","A year ago, President Obama dropped plans to bomb Syria over chemical weapons .

"Da Nang, Vietnam (CNN) -- As far as symbols of a resurgent country -- and city -- go, there can be few as bullish as a 666-meter-long (2,185 feet) dragon-shaped bridge that breathes fire and spouts plumes of water. Opened last year in Vietnam's central coast city of Da Nang, the Rong Cao (Dragon Bridge) is an award-winning, U.S.-designed marvel of engineering that's become a favorite of residents and visitors, and an icon of the prosperous future this once sleepy town has its eye set on. Each weekend, after sunset, residents and visitors are treated to a pyrotechnic show that adds flair to what could have easily been a routine civil engineering project. The road is closed just before 9 p.m., with crowds thronging the six-lane bridge. An expectant hush descends, and then, with a roar, the dragon's head spits fearsome plumes of fire, followed by hissing clouds of water vapor. Spectators love it. Long a symbol of Asian prosperity, the dragon is an ideal image for a city on the rise, and has been taken to heart by the people who live here. Dragon-themed trinkets can be bought along the banks of the Han River, which the bridge spans, and nearby hotels take their name from the structure. Boat tours make the most of it -- prows are painted with the dragon's likeness. Tourism opportunities . The Da Nang Department of Sports, Culture and Tourism expects the bridge to draw 3 million visitors to the city this year. As the de facto capital of Vietnam's central coast and one of the country's rising economic success stories, Da Nang is spending big on infrastructure to bring in tourism dollars. It's positioning itself as a MICE (meetings, incentives, conventions and exhibitions) hub and as the gateway to the historically rich and scenic central coast region, which includes the tourist town of Hoi An to the south. As the city has developed, its interconnectedness has improved and the two banks of the Han are increasingly linked by a network of bridges. All are impressive structures, but none match the Dragon Bridge's inventiveness. ""The Dragon Bridge has been the crowning achievement in the city's bridge program,"" Nick Ivanoff, president of Ammann & Whitney, one of the key companies involved in the bridge's creation, tells CNN. ""City officials have said it will likely become the new symbol of Da Nang."" Ancient history . The dragon itself is modeled after one of the symbols of the Ly Dynasty, which ruled Vietnam a thousand years ago. ""In the year 1010, King Ly Thai To moved Vietnam's capital to Hanoi,"" says Nick Masucci, CEO of Louis Berger, a partner in the bridge's design and construction. ""According to legend, upon arriving in Hanoi by boat, he saw a golden dragon rise into the sky from the Red River. Seeing this as a good omen, he named the city Thang Long (soaring dragon). ""The dragon is one of the most important symbols in Vietnamese culture. It symbolizes power, nobility and good fortune. ""We believe the Dragon Bridge can be a symbol for Da Nang's growth and development as an important transportation, educational and cultural center in central Vietnam."" Light spectacle . In addition to the weekend shows of fire breathing, which take place at 9 p.m. every Saturday and Sunday, the bridge is illuminated each night with thousands of LED lights, which flow through the color spectrum, giving dynamic, dazzling views that reflect off the surface of the river. The bridge was inaugurated on March 29, 2013, to commemorate the country's rich history -- both ancient and recent. The date was chosen to mark the 38th anniversary of the liberation of the city, and the end of the Vietnam War. Its creators, the firms Louis Berger and Ammann & Whitney, were recipients of the 2014 American Council of Engineering Companies (ACEC) National Engineering Excellence Award. Development centerpiece . The opening of the bridge not only gives Da Nang an instantly recognizable landmark, it's done much for the city's development in a remarkably short time. ""Before the bridge opened, the other side (of the river) was very poor. The government has supported the people with these developments,"" says Ngyuen Nan Dong, a restaurateur whose cafe sits near the western side of the bridge. ""Da Nang is a nice place, and the bridge adds identity to the city. It's also developed the economy and cut down the time it takes to get to the airport."" But what does this matter, when you have a real, fire-breathing dragon on your doorstep? ""Its exciting,"" says Ngyuen. ""I like to take my (20-month-old) daughter to see the show.""","Fire-breathing dragon a new symbol of Da Nang, Vietnam's fifth-largest city .

"Kiev, Ukraine (CNN) -- Twenty Ukrainian prisoners of war have been released under the ceasefire between Kiev and pro-Russian rebels signed in Minsk, Belarus, last week, Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko said Monday. Ukraine's counterterrorist operation press office said the freed prisoners were Ukrainian troops, telling CNN they had been exchanged for a ""terrorist."" Speaking in the port city of Mariupol, south of Donetsk, Poroshenko said 33 Ukrainian servicemen who had refused to surrender had also been able to leave the conflict zone. The Russian state news agency ITAR-Tass quoted the vice premier of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, Andrei Purgin, as saying both sides had agreed to exchange ""30 for 30"" prisoners as a starting point. Russia's RIA Novosti government news agency quoted DPR Prime Minister Alexander Zakharchenko as saying 28 servicemen had been handed over Sunday. ""It (the prisoner swap) takes place every day. Yesterday we handed over 28 captives and received even more in return,"" it quoted him as saying. Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council spokesman Col. Andriy Lysenko said Ukraine had determined the whereabouts of more than 100 troops and efforts were being made to bring them home. He said the exact number of hostages was unknown. 'We know our enemy well' The fledgling truce between the Ukrainian government and pro-Russian rebels began Friday evening, though both sides were already accusing each other of violating it by Saturday. Lysenko accused militants of trying to provoke Ukrainian forces in order to blame Kiev for violations. Poroshenko expressed hope the truce would hold. ""I believe that the efforts of diplomats will be successful,"" he told military and border forces. But the Ukrainian leader warned that the country should not be caught off guard: ""We know our enemy well. We know the price of his words. I've got no illusions about our opponent, but I've got hope."" The Kremlin issued a statement saying that Russian President Vladimir Putin had spoken by phone with Poroshenko on Monday. ""The leaders continued to discuss steps to facilitate the peaceful settlement of the situation in southeast Ukraine. The dialogue will be continued,"" it said. In spite of the ceasefire agreement, Putin remains under pressure from the West over Russia's actions in Ukraine. The Ukrainian government and the West accuse Moscow of supporting the rebels with weapons and fighters -- allegations that Moscow has repeatedly denied. EU announces new sanctions . Hours after the truce went into effect, European Union leaders meeting in Belgium agreed on a new round of economic sanctions against Russia. On Monday evening, the president of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy, announced it had adopted ""further restrictive measures against Russia."" ""The sanctions aim at promoting a change of course in Russia's actions destabilising eastern Ukraine and come in the wake of the European Council of 30 August, which condemned the increasing inflows of fighters and weapons from the territory of the Russian Federation into Eastern Ukraine and the aggression by Russian armed forces on Ukrainian soil,"" he said in a statement. The measures will take force once they have been published in the Official Journal of the European Union. ""This will leave time for an assessment of the implementation of the cease-fire agreement and the peace plan. Depending on the situation on the ground, the EU stands ready to review the agreed sanctions in whole or in part,"" the statement said. After Friday's sanctions announcement, the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Russia ""will not fail to retaliate if such measures are adopted."" ""The EU would be better off supporting Donbas' economic revival and bringing normalcy back to the region instead of frantically seeking to put more strain on Russian and its own economies,"" it said. Donbas refers to a southeastern region of Ukraine encompassing Donetsk and Luhansk. Mariupol . Poroshenko told staff at a metal works in Mariupol that Ukrainian forces would fight to ensure the city remained part of Ukraine. ""As commander in chief, I have commanded to ensure the defense of Mariupol and the regime of high combat readiness. Ukrainian militaries managed to stop tank attacks on Mariupol by which the enemy tried to ensure the passage to the Crimea,"" he said. Mariupol is a strategic port city, lying between the Russian mainland and Crimea, which Russia annexed earlier this year. Poroshenko said that Ukraine needed financial and technical assistance and was confident that enhanced cooperation with NATO would help facilitate that. ""NATO managed to reach an agreement with several countries on direct supply of state-of-the-art weapons that will help us defend ourselves and win."" Ceasefire deaths . Sporadic artillery and machine gun fire rang out in the early hours of Sunday on the outskirts of Mariupol. A gas station was set on fire, and cars carried wounded civilians down the roads. Shelling and explosions were also heard near the airport of the flashpoint city of Donetsk on Sunday morning, the city council said on its website. In both cities, the source of the weapons fire wasn't immediately clear. The Mariupol city government said that pro-Russian rebels had carried out the shelling near the city overnight. It said one woman was killed and three people wounded. Poroshenko on Monday confirmed that one civilian had died in the city, as well as a Ukrainian soldier in Stanytsia-Luhanska. The OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine said its monitors also witnessed the shooting of a civilian in a car trying to cross a bridge at the Shchastya checkpoint from the direction of Luhansk on Saturday. The victim was a father traveling with his daughter and her mother, it said. ITAR-Tass late Saturday quoted rebel officials as saying that Ukrainian forces continued to shell Donetsk and rebel positions near Mariupol. RIA Novosti reported that four Donetsk residents were killed in the shelling. 'So much confusion' Ukrainian forces and pro-Russian rebels have been locked in vicious fighting in eastern Ukraine since April, leaving more than 2,200 people dead, according to the United Nations. The conflict has triggered a humanitarian crisis in the region, where shelling has destroyed homes and infrastructure. Nationwide, more than a million people have been displaced from their homes by the fighting, most of them in the East. Ukrainian forces and the rebels have engaged in fierce fighting over the past week in the territory between the Russian border and Mariupol. A previous unilateral ceasefire declared by the Ukrainian government in June broke down after 10 days. Amnesty International, meanwhile, accused Ukrainian militias and rebels of carrying out war crimes. The human rights group singled out Russia for a buildup of armor and artillery in eastern Ukraine. Putin has voiced sympathy for the rebels, many of whom are ethnic Russians. But he denies that Russia has armed and trained the rebels, or sent its troops over the border.

"(CNN) -- Peter J. Goutiere was just shy of 30 years old when he piloted a Douglas C-47, the military designation of the venerable commercial DC-3, from Miami to Kolkata, India. The C-47 was the 100th to be delivered to the China National Aviation Corporation, or CNAC. It was 1944. The United States had been at war since December 7, 1941. CNAC had been at war long before that. The Japanese invaded China in 1937. Like airlines all over the globe would do as World War II unfolded, CNAC, based in Hong Kong, shifted its operations to military service as the Japanese closed in on Shanghai and southern China. Young pilot 'too old' for service . For a young Goutiere, of Katonah, New York, the delivery flight of this C-47, Douglas Serial Number 20806/Line Number 4193, would be his own entry into the war zone. He'd been rejected by the U.S. Army Air Corps when he volunteered after the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor; he was too old, having missed the 26-and-a-half age cutoff. Rebuffed, he joined Pan American Air Ferries, a subsidiary of the storied airline set up to ferry all types of airplanes to the U.S. armed forces and allies. Goutiere ferried planes from the United States to Africa after joining Pan Am, but Ship 100 would take him to India, the jumping-off point to combat areas. The ferry flight of Ship 100 -- a short-range, twin-engine aircraft, designed to seat 21 passengers -- took 90 flight hours over 14 days. Goutiere flew via South America, Ascension Island in the mid-Atlantic, through Africa and on to India. In December 1942, Goutiere began flying for CNAC from India over the Himalayas to China, a dangerous routing call ""the Hump,"" ferrying supplies for Chinese and U.S. troops and the U.S. Army Air Corps, for the rest of the war. A round trip took about seven hours. ""There were three enemies,"" Goutiere told CNN. ""Mountains, Japanese and the weather. Weather is what did the most damage."" Goutiere flew Ship 100 on some of his 680 missions through September 1945, when Japan surrendered. Flying through history . The last time Goutiere saw Ship 100 was in 1945 -- until 69 years later, when on September 4 he arrived in Everett, Washington, at the Historic Flight Foundation (HFF) in the shadow of Boeing's giant wide-body plant at Paine Field. HFF acquired Ship 100 in 2006 and was preparing to fly the airplane to the annual CNAC reunion in San Francisco. After doing a walk-around inspection of the plane, Goutiere, family members and a small entourage piled into the historic aircraft for the flight to San Francisco, which took just less than five hours. The flight underscored advances in aviation technology. A flight leaving the Seattle area in a modern jetliner, for instance, would travel well past Chicago in five hours. The flight started off at 2,500 feet outside of Everett and over the Cascade Mountains in Northwest Oregon before hitting turbulence. Cruising at about 160 knots (roughly 185 mph) with no auto-pilot and using only visual flight rules, passengers felt their ears popping due to no pressurization in the cabin. After diverting around wildfires in the Mount Shasta area of northern California, the aircraft climbed to 13,800 feet to avoid restricted air space reserved for aerial tankers. American, Chinese WWII pilots embrace at historic reunion . Upon arrival at San Francisco International Airport, the plane was met by legendary CNAC C-47 pilot Moon Chin, who set a record during the war for evacuating 71 people fleeing the Japanese. One of the 71 was a U.S. Army Air Corps colonel named Jimmy Doolittle, who was making his way back to Allied lines after America's first offensive mission against Japan following the attack on Pearl Harbor -- the famous air raid on Tokyo in April 1942. Chin and Goutiere embraced and exchanged smiles and warm words in advance of celebrating the CNAC with scores of relatives of CNAC employees and families and others on hand to honor the men and women who took part in this theater of World War II. Goutiere and Chin are the sole remaining pilots who flew for the CNAC during World War II. Goutiere, who still resides in Katonah, will be 100 this month. Chin, now 102, lives in Hillsborough, California. Extreme hazards . While flying during the war, C-47s were unarmed. Goutiere carried only a .45 caliber pistol. He never was shot at and only iced up once, with four tons, forcing him from 18,000 feet to 12,000 feet. The dependable C-47 carried him to safety. The flying wasn't a cakewalk, however, and the Hump is littered with wreckage of airplanes that were brought down by weather or flying into the mountains. Ironically, good weather wasn't a good omen, either. ""A clear day was dangerous,"" Goutiere recalled. ""Japanese Zeros would come out, so we began flying at night. We did 15 to 18 trips a month. As we began to understand the weather, CNAC lost one aircraft a month "" The planes had to thread their way through dangerous mountain passes. They were usually overloaded with supplies or fuel. Goutiere, along with his fellow pilots, delivered gasoline to American Boeing B-29 air bases, staging areas for bombing raids over Japan. Sometimes, under the demands of war, pilots took to the skies alone, Goutiere among them. The conga line of airplanes worked hand-in-hand with the American Volunteer Group (AVG), more commonly known as the Flying Tigers. CNAC was a principal source of fuel for the Tigers. Turbulent history for C-47 . When the war ended, Ship 100 was converted to passenger configuration and entered CNAC's peacetime service. But the civil war between the Chinese Nationalists under Chiang Kai-Shek and the Communists under Mao Tse-tung, which began before World War II and only moderated during the fight against the Japanese, resumed. CNAC helped evacuate Chiang's family to Taiwan (then called Formosa) when it became clear Mao and the Communists would soon claim victory. CNAC's fleet evacuated from China to Hong Kong during the closing days of the civil war. Lawsuits were filed over ownership and the fleet was tied up in courts for two years. A few airplanes remained airworthy during the limbo, including Ship 100. Saboteurs placed small bombs on these to prevent them from being flown into Communist China. Some failed to go off -- but one on Ship 100 did, damaging the fairing behind the right engine. Legal ownership was eventually resolved and Ship 100 was sold to Johnson & Johnson, the U.S. consumer goods company. The airplane was modified, adding landing gear doors to streamline aerodynamics and an elongated nose to accommodate radar. Historic Flight Foundation locates plane . By 2006, the aircraft had changed hands several more times and was owned by an aircraft broker in New York. John Sessions, founder of the Historic Flight Foundation, was looking for a DC-3 to add to the HFF collection of airworthy aircraft. HFF focuses on the 1937-1957 era of significant military and civil advances in aviation. Sessions wanted aircraft that weren't only from this era, but aircraft with a history. Ship 100 filled the bill. Sessions had the gear doors removed and replaced the ""Pinocchio"" nose with a standard DC-3 nose fabricated from scratch. The airliner was painted in Pan Am colors (his late wife worked for Pan Am); Pan Am owned 45% of CNAC until after WWII. HFF takes the DC-3 to air shows and offers rides. But the CNAC reunion became a special occasion, and Ship 100's flight from Everett to San Francisco became its longest in years at just less than five hours. For Goutiere, the reunion with Ship 100 was as important as the CNAC reunion in San Francisco. ""I was home,"" an emotional Goutiere told the reunion. ""I was homesick.""

"(CNN) -- ""Are you for Ukraine or for Russia?"" Alex Shiroki's boss asked him Thursday. Shiroki, 35, from Yalta, opposes the Russian invasion, and the proposed rejoining of Crimea to Russia. But he carefully said his views are ""something in the middle"" -- just in case his opinion could affect his job. His boss supports Russia. ""He says that Russia is more rich than Ukraine and we will have stability,"" Shiroki said. ""Most of (the) people think like that."" It's amazing how normal life continues to appear in some parts of Crimea. People still go to work, to restaurants, to bars. But tensions continue to mount in the region, where lawmakers voted Thursday in favor of rejoining Russia and having a referendum in 10 days. Many people are sincerely grateful for the Russian presence, said Maria Zaborovska, 24, who lives in Crimea and is translating for international radio journalists. ""I don't know if they fully realize -- if they know what it means,"" Zaborovska said of the pro-Russia supporters. Many of them were born in the Soviet Union and speak Russian, she said. As to how they would benefit from Crimea becoming part of Russia, people who support breaking off from Ukraine don't seem to have answers, she said. Zaborovska herself is against the Russian invasion. In the main square in Simferopol, a crowd gathered Wednesday in support of Russia, waving flags. ""Our grandparents protected our land from the SS, and we will protect our land from Western extremists,"" one woman shouted. ""Thank you Russia for protecting us."" Biscuits with Crimean jam were served up at a pro-Russian militia recruitment center, with a portrait of Russian President Vladimir Putin watching over. Anna Bardina a Russia supporter, told CNN's Diana Magnay that she has been receiving threatening texts from far right elements, and even death threats from Chechnya. ""Russia is far more stable,"" she said. ""They have no economic problems, not like here where we have movements like the Maidan and are in a political and economic mess,"" she said, referring to the popular pro-European street rallies that led to the ouster of Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych. Areas around military bases showcase the bubbling tensions. Wednesday, outside the headquarters of the Ukrainian navy in Sevastopol, women tried to sneak up to windows and shove food through to the soldiers inside. The facility is surrounded by pro-Russian civilians who call themselves a ""civil defense group,"" backed up by masked, armed men in green combat fatigues, presumed to be Russian soldiers. A woman with her young daughter, bringing soup and meatballs to her husband inside, was turned away. So was a Sevastopol Red Cross worker who tried to bring in supplies. ""There are no problems with food,"" one of the men told him. ""Anyone who wants to eat can go home."" In the seaside resort city of Yalta, Alex Shiroki observed a crowd of hundreds gathered Wednesday by a monument to Vladimir Lenin, singing songs and waving flags in support of Russia. He thought the pro-Russian presence would be even bigger. Shiroki doesn't mind people expressing their opinion, but the latest string of political developments has him depressed. ""It's happening so fast that I am kind of lost and disoriented by all of this,"" he said. With tourism as a main industry in the city, several hotels are closing their doors, with at least one big hotel firing personnel, Shiroki said. ""Smaller hotels, they just closed because maybe they think there is no hope of having tourists in summer,"" he said. It's unclear if they will re-open. For now, the region is largely blocked off by troops and vacationers are likely making other plans in the face of obvious tensions. Shiroki has not seen any of the presumably Russian soldiers in unmarked green uniforms, as his friends have encountered in other cities such as Simferopol. As a joke, people refer to these troops as ""polite armed people,"" Shiroki said. One of Shiroki's friends brought food to Ukrainian soldiers at a military base in Perevalnoe, near Simferopol, and told Shiroki he was stopped by soldiers about 20 times on the way. After answering many questions, he was able to deliver the food through a gate, but could not go inside. If Crimea does become part of Russia, as Shiroki suspects it probably will, he will consider leaving the country. Shiroki has been studying Polish, so Poland could be an option, or perhaps elsewhere in Europe or the United States. ""If you dislike living in a place ruled by a power you dislike, maybe you should change your life,"" Shiroki said. CNN's Chelsea J. Carter. Laura Smith-Spark and Michael Holmes contributed to this report. Diana Magnay reported from Simferopol and Ben Wedeman reported from Sevastopol in Ukraine.","Crimean supporters of Russia gather in public .

"(CNN) -- The script for Robocop, a futuristic tale of decline, had a note scribbled on the top of the first page. It read: ""The future left Detroit behind."" As screenwriter Ed Neumeirer recalls, it was a prescient message. That statement has never been more relevant to the American city, after it filed the biggest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history earlier this month with debts around $18 billion. Neumeier says that RoboCop was, and still is, a metaphor ""to show the industrial decline in America."" He told CNN: ""The reason Detroit is important is because it's facing an economic blight that you can imagine happening in a lot of places."" Set in a futuristic Detroit plagued by financial ruin and economic decay, ""RoboCop"" -- made in 1987 -- relates how a no-nonsense cyborg law enforcer ends up policing the city's crime-ridden streets. Written by Neumeier, directed by Paul Verhoeven and mostly filmed in Pittsburgh and Dallas, the film paints Detroit as a once-great metropolis and manufacturing hub laid to waste by outsourcing and mass unemployment. Read more: Detroit's bankruptcy could spell good-bye for Howdy Doody . Neumeier told CNN he battled with producers to ensure Detroit remained the setting for the film, adding the fictional dystopia in ""RoboCop"" could easily become a reality when a city is stripped of the industry that ties its communities together. ""In retrospect, the idea of ""RoboCop"" really goes back to the car industry"" he told CNN. ""The sculpture of it is very much Detroit road-iron... having grown up in the sixties when the muscle car was so prominent, the notion of cars was very important to me then and ultimately to the formation of RoboCop."" Read more: Why Obama won't bailout Detroit . The cradle of auto manufacturing in the 1950s and home to the likes of Ford and General Motors, Detroit was once considered the engine of the U.S. economy. But production saw a sharp decline in the 1980s when Japan emerged as a global financial heavyweight and automakers like Nissan began to provide stern competition. Decades of stagnation culminated in an $80 billion U.S. government bailout for the automotive industry between 2008-2010. Watch more: The Motor City sputters to a stop . Today, Detroit is a shadow of the economic boomtown it once was. With a population of just over 700,000, the so-called ""Motor City"" is suffering from a 16% unemployment rate, as automotive jobs have all but disappeared and the mortgage crisis of 2007 hit homeowners hard. Crime also poses a major social threat to Detroit. In 2012, Forbes named it the most dangerous U.S. city and the most miserable for 2013. A debt restructuring deal to solve Detroit's economic woes is likely to mean extreme cuts to public services with retirees receiving just a fraction of their pensions, if plans proposed by emergency manager Kevin Orr go ahead. At a press conference on Friday, in which he discussed the city's economic demise, Orr said: ""Does anybody think it's OK to have 40-year-old trees growing through the roofs of dilapidated houses?"" Corporate America . In the film, fictional Detroit is propped up by a multinational corporation, called Omni Consumer Products (OCP), which runs everything from the hospitals to the police force. It also has grand designs to demolish ""Old Detroit"" and create an ultra-modern utopia called ""Delta City."" The vulgar and callous corporate age that serves as the backdrop to ""RoboCop"" is upon us, according to Neumeier. ""We are increasingly asking corporations to do these things for us... to provide human services. But their objectives are different to public service needs."" Despite Neumeier's efforts to remain, as he puts it, ""neutral"" to big business in ""RoboCop,"" the antihero is a senior executive at OCP, who conspires with gangsters to run Detroit. ""We are now living in the world that I was proposing in RoboCop,"" said Neumeier, adding that it showed ""how big corporations will take care of us and..how they won't."" Read more: Detroit: After bankruptcy, then what? Neumeier believes Detroit now has the opportunity to rebuild and perhaps rebrand itself as the aspirational ""Delta City"" portrayed at the start of his film. The one-time gem of the U.S Rust Belt must overcome the expectations of the past, he says, and clean up the ruined parts of the city. He remains optimistic for the future of Detroit. ""There is a cheap and educated labor force. Some kind of high-tech would be good for them... I would say with the industrial and mechanical legacy there, somebody should start a robotics company."" Neumeier quotes Dick Jones, one of RoboCop's corporate villains, to sum up the city's industrial past and potential for a tech-based future: ""Good business is where you find it."" A remake of the cult hit, directed by Jose Padilha and starring Hollywood big-hitters Samuel L. Jackson and Gary Oldman, is set to be released in 2014.

"(CNN) -- In October, Taylor Swift's transition to pop music will be complete. The 24-year-old singer/songwriter has long had one foot in country and the other in pop, sometimes to the chagrin of country fans. But with her fifth studio album, the October 27 release ""1989,"" Swift has eliminated her twang altogether. ""At a certain point,"" she told Rolling Stone in its new issue, ""if you chase two rabbits, you lose them both."" Instead, she's taken inspiration from '80s pop acts like Madonna, Phil Collins and Annie Lennox, and turned to producers and musicians like Max Martin and Fun.'s Jack Antonoff to help her shape what she calls her ""blatant pop"" sound. Along with her change in tune has come other shifts in Swift's life: She's moved to New York, has focused more on her friendships and has backed off dating (at least for now). Where past Swift albums could fuel gossip for weeks over which song may be about which ex-boyfriend, ""1989"" has a different vibe. It's not as ""boy-centric"" as past releases, Swift explained -- basically because there haven't been any boys. ""I feel like watching my dating life has become a bit of a national pastime, and I'm just not comfortable providing that kind of entertainment anymore,"" Swift told Rolling Stone. ""I don't like seeing slide shows of guys I've apparently dated. I don't like giving comedians the opportunity to make jokes about me at awards shows. I don't like it when headlines read 'Careful, Bro, She'll Write a Song About You,' because it trivializes my work. And most of all, I don't like how all these factors add up to build the pressure so high in a new relationship that it gets snuffed out before it even has a chance to start. And so, I just don't date."" Don't feel sorry for her, as Swift presumed readers might; there's plenty that she ""really like(s) about my life right now."" ""I have friends around me all the time. I've started painting more,"" Swift said. ""I've been working out a lot. I've started to really take pride in being strong."" That strength was evident in her push to have ""1989"" made in the way she envisioned. When Swift turned the album in to the head of her record label, she was told that it was ""extraordinary"" and the best she's ever done but also in need of a few country songs. Swift held her ground. ""Love you,"" she recalled responding. ""But this is how it's going to be.""","Taylor Swift's next album will be ""blatant pop""

"(CNN) -- Adam Scott produced the performance of his life to win the Masters on Sunday and finally exorcise the demons of last year's British Open. Scott, the first Australian to ever wear the famous green jacket, defeated Argentina's Angel Cabrera on the second hole of the playoff after both men finished at nine-under on an enthralling day at Augusta. As Scott sank the winning putt on the 10th at Augusta he banished the pain and heartache that had haunted him following his humiliating collapse at Royal Lytham in July. Scott's collapse . On that occasion, the 32-year-old looked set to win his first major until he somehow contrived to blow a four-shot lead with just four holes remaining. But with the eyes of the sporting world upon him, Scott showed nerves of steel to hole his putt and finally end Australia's Augusta curse. ""I don't know how that happened,"" Scott said after his historic triumph. ""It seems a long, long way from a couple years ago, or last July when I was trying to win a major. It was incredible."" Scott's character and determination came to the fore at a course where his country's most famous golfer suffered so mercilessly. Greg Norman, the man who squandered a six shot lead on the final day at the 1996 Masters, was the closest Australia had come to a Masters champion. Norman lost out to Augusta native Larry Mize in a playoff in 1987, just a year after his bogey at the 18th allowed Jack Nicklaus to win his 18th and final major. The tale of Twitter: Augusta reaction . Two years ago, Scott and Jason Day finished tied for second as Charl Schwartzel produced an astonishing final four holes to win the tournament. But this time, Scott got the job done, and the Adelaide-born player was quick to praise the man who had come so close at Augusta in years gone by. ""It's incredible to be in this position,"" said Scott, who had earlier shot a three-under 69 for the final round. ""Australia's a proud sporting nation, and it's amazing that it's come down to me today. ""There was one guy who inspired a nation of golfers, and that's Greg Norman. Part of this definitely belongs to him."" He later added: ""A phone call isn't going to be enough; I'd like to share a beer with him."" Taking the green jacket from last year's winner, Bubba Watson, Scott stood proudly after an afternoon that neither he nor Australia will ever forget. His birdie on the 18th, the 72nd hole of the weekend, produced a hugely emotional celebration, with Scott appearing to believe had finally won a major. Cabrera, Snedeker lead Masters . But while he walked back to the clubhouse, 2009 champion Cabrera produced an exquisite shot to ensure a relatively simple putt and the opportunity of a second Masters title. The playoff provided an exhilarating climax to a round played amidst worsening conditions with the rain constantly falling and the light deteriorating. After both making par on the first playoff hole at the 18th, the pair moved to the 10th. While Cabrera failed to make a birdie, Scott made no such mistake as he holed from 15 feet to spark delirium. Cabrera would have been the second oldest man to have won the tournament at the age of 43, with only Nicklaus, who won at the age of 46 in 1986, ahead of him. It would have been some achievement for the Argentine, currently ranked 269th in the world. ""That's how golf is,"" said Cabrera, who hit a final round 70. ""I came back. I had my chance to win it. Adam is truly a good winner. ""He's a great person and a great player, and I'm happy for him."" Australia's Day was one of the first to congratulate Scott after he missed out on qualifying for the playoff, eventually finishing two shots back on seven-under for the tournament. ""It was really tough,"" Day said. ""The pressure got to me a little bit."" Woods penalized two strokes . While Scott celebrated, world No. 1 Tiger Woods refused to blame his two-shot penalty for taking an incorrect drop during his second round Friday. Woods finished with a final round of 70 to finish four shots off the lead -- but the U.S. star refrained from blaming Friday's incident. ""We could do that 'what if?' in every tournament we lose,"" he said. ""We lose more tournaments than we win out here on tour, so that's just part of the process, and I'll go back to it. ""I thought 65 would win it outright today. I thought that was going to be the number, and it looks like it was. If I would have shot my number, it might have been a different story. ""I had a tough time getting accustomed to the speed of the greens; they were so much slower than yesterday. I left every putt short on the first eight holes. ""I played well but unfortunately did not make enough putts and missed a few shots here and there. I had an opportunity today."" McIlroy blames 'stupid mistakes' for slump . World No. 2 Rory McIlroy carded a closing 69 to finish the week at two over par, but the Northern Irishman was satisfied with his game despite failing to challenge the leaders. ""I know I've played good enough golf here to win; it's just a matter of stringing it all together,"" McIlroy said. ""I was in a good position and did not quite have it all yesterday, and that really cost me. ""You have to be right on your game for 72 holes here. I played a five hole stretch in five over, and that was really it. I played nicely again today; if I just limit the mistakes from yesterday, I am right there. ""It's frustrating. Sometimes you hit a good shot and all of a sudden it's off the green; it is what it is, and you have to embrace it. ""It's Augusta, and you're going to get some good bounces; you're going to get some bad. It will all even out in the end."" Teen sensation Guan makes Masters cut . Earlier Sunday, China's 14-year-old sensation Tianlang Guan finished his momentous week with a three-over 75 to leave him 12-over for the tournament. Guan, the youngest ever player to make the cut, received the Silver Cup after finishing as the leading amateur. ""It's not easy to play here and make the cut and be the low amateur, and I think I did a pretty good job,"" Guan said. ""I'm a little bit tired today. There are still a lot of things to improve. My short game is good, but I could still get better, and my driving has to get a little bit longer. Yes, everything needs to improve."" Rapping golfers return with 2.Oh . Defending champion Watson endured a nightmare final round, dunking his ball into the water on three separate occasions at Rae's Creek. Watson hit a seven-over 10 on the 12th, Augusta's shortest hole at just 155 yards. ""If you're not going to win, you've got to get in the record books somehow,"" Watson said after carding a final round 77, seven-over for the tournament. ""So I'm a guy that got a double-digit score on a par three.""","Adam Scott of Australia won the Masters at Augusta .

"(CNN) -- Six Americans who were salvaging goods from the bottom of the sea off the coast of Honduras have sat in a jail there for over three weeks as officials have charged them with illegal weapons possession. On May 5, after the ship pulled into port in Puerto Lempira, police came aboard, arrested the crew and confiscated the vessel, according to a Facebook statement from Aqua Quest, the Florida company the men work for. The ship's captain said from jail that the weapons on board were for personal protection against pirates. ""It's suicide not to carry them,"" said one of the detained Americans, Robert Mayne, in a phone interview from the jail. Squalor and danger . The men do not have access to good sanitation and are not being properly fed, said Michael McCabe, a crew member who was not detained. ""The inmates only ever eat beans and rice. I'm told it's one spoon of each, and that's it,"" he said after visiting them. McCabe has tried to purchase additional food for them, but some of it has been stolen, he said. The detainees' squalor turned to terror, when gunfire erupted around them on Friday, according to Mayne's account. ""Fighting breaks out every few days here,"" he said. ""One prisoner beat another with a stick with a nail in it."" But this was the first time shots were fired their way. Legal allegations . Aqua Quest alleges in its statement that authorities boarding and searching the ship circumvented proper legal procedures. The company said Honduran officials had the legal possibility of dealing with the weapons without imposing detentions. The official charge is illegal possession of firearms detrimental to the internal security of Honduras, according to a court document. The caliber of the weapons and the fact that one is semiautomatic also seems to bother authorities, who have termed them ""commercial."" Illegal arms regularly flow through Honduras, and drug traffickers transit cocaine from Colombia through the Central American. Mayne and Aqua Quest are adamant that their weapons were for personal use and not for resale on the black market. Diplomatic efforts . State Department spokesman Noel Clay, who confirmed the detention, said Saturday that ""there is no greater priority for us than the welfare and safety of U.S. citizens abroad."" The U.S. Embassy in Tegucigalpa has been monitoring the case and providing consular assistance. Consular officials last visited the crew on May 19. A lawyer in Honduras familiar with the case says the men could face up to 16 years in prison. U.S. Rep. Mike Fitzpatrick, R-Pennsylvania, has attempted to intervene on the men's behalf. ""I have been working with American officials and other contacts to expedite the detainees' release. I have formally written to the Honduran Ambassador to the United States requesting his personal engagement to swiftly resolve the situation,"" he said in a statement. Crew's business . Aqua Quest International salvages precious cargo from sunken vessels underwater beds, according to its website. That can range from valuable ore to historic artifacts. The crew in Honduras was tasked with removing valuable mahogany logs from the nearby river bed in the impoverished eastern municipality of Ahuas. The goal was to clear the waterways to ease the way for boats in an area where there are few roads, the company said. The wood, remnants of decades of logging in that region, commands a high price on the open market, the company said. Profits from its sale was to be shared with locals for infrastructure and social programs.

"(CNN)  -- New publisher Nollybooks is taking chick-lit and adapting it for a South African audience, with a series of romance novels by, and for, young black women.  Nigeria's Nollywood film industry has revolutionized African cinema, and Nollybooks is hoping to do the same for South African publishing. Nigeria-born Moky Makura is a writer and TV presenter. When it came to starting her own publishing company, she made it her mission to get young women reading again. ""There are lots of aliterate people in South Africa,"" she said. ""They can read but don't read. ""There isn't really a culture of reading here. The book buying public is white middle class women and I wanted to change that."" But like any good story there's a twist -- it's romance without the smut. As Makura argues, ""You don't need sex to have good storytelling."" Makura says she took the decision to make the books sex free because it was a more responsible approach. ""Because of the market we are selling to and because of the issues in Africa with AIDS and sex as a whole we didn't think it was important,"" she said. Novels in South Africa generally don't sell very well. A fiction book need only sell 5,000 copies to be considered a best seller. South African journalist and author Fred Khumalo says most South Africans can't afford to buy books and there is no culture of reading for leisure. That's why Nollybooks come with another twist. Rather than use a traditional book format, they are in the form of ""bookazines,"" which include word puzzles and quizzes in their pages, and have a glossary of difficult words at the back. Makura said the aim was to make reading entertaining and fun -- quite a challenge in South Africa, where she says the commonly held perception is that books are purely educational. ""I see Nollybooks as almost having a soap opera in your hand,"" Makura explained. In the world of Nollybooks the heroines are strong, confident, ambitious and know what they want. Titles include ""Unfashionably in Love,"" about a fashion intern trying to attract the attention of her boss and ""Looking for Mr. Right,"" which tells a cautionary tale of the internet dating game. Makura says it is important that young Africans have positive role models to whom they can relate. ""We need African role models that have achieved things and didn't have to grow up in the West. ""Even though the heroes in the books are fictional our books are written to a formula and one of them is that the heroines are strong and not the typical Mills & Boon slutty woman."" The company also wants to nurture young talent and many of its writers have never had a book published before. Cheryl Ntumy, who is in her 20s and from Botswana, wrote ""Looking for Mr. Right."" ""A lot of my friends were getting married and I found myself in a situation where I was still single so that got me thinking about writing a story,"" she said. ""Internet dating is also something a lot of people talk about here so I decided to combine the two. ""I was really trying to evoke girl power, an independent woman's message, because a lot of women in Africa have a strong sense of marriage and family and I felt it important for women to know that they didn't have to become that person and that it's okay to be single."" Johannesburg-based English teacher Joan Buchanan says many of her pupils don't enjoy reading traditional novels because they struggle with context and vocabulary. She is convinced the Nollybooks stories are just what they need to develop a love for reading. ""This is for me such a wonderful hand up because I don't have to say anything -- I'll let them sample the book and they'll do their own magic,"" she said.  The success of Nollywood movies has shown that Africans hunger for their own stories and homegrown heroes, and Makura says it's time books provided them. ""South Africans need more heroes, fiction and non-fiction, and we need to be creating and reading our own content,"" she said.","Nollybooks produces romance novels aimed at young South African women .

"(CNN) -- Last week, in his first days at his new job as manager of the Miami Marlins, Venezuelan-born Ozzie Guillen said to Time magazine, ""I love Fidel Castro,"" adding ""You know why? A lot of people have wanted to kill Fidel Castro for the last 60 years, but that mother------ is still there."" The Marlins' brand new $634 million ballpark is in the city's Little Havana, and not surprisingly, Guillen's words ignited a powder keg of emotion and anger from Cuban-Americans. Since then, Guillen apologized and received his punishment -- suspension from five games. And to many, that's that. After all, some say, Guillen, legendary for inserting his foot in his mouth, was simply mouthing off. ESPN's Michael Baumann put it this way: ""I can't believe anyone cares what Ozzie Guillen thinks about a foreign dictator. Baseball should not want to be in a place where it restricts political speech."" Guillen joins a long line of people in powerful positions in sports saying offensive things; salty-tongued Marge Schott, former owner of the Cincinnati Reds, went so far as to praise Hitler. But to dismiss Guillen's words as inconsequential, so absurd as to not warrant serious analysis, is to ignore the depth and passion of Cubans who live in this country not as immigrants but as exiles. Cuban-Americans were kicked out of Cuba by a hateful despot. As such, their view of Castro is imbued by violent, tragic experience and memory, and by a profound appreciation for the freedoms they now enjoy in the United States. That a public figure in sports claimed respect -- even love -- for Castro is despicable. There have been calls for Guillen's resignation, threats of boycotts of all Marlins games and constant coverage in Miami of the firestorm that appears only to have increased since Guillen fumbled out an apology, blaming his statement on a miscommunication because of his poor English. Amid the furor, some major leaguers refrained from any comment, for fear of repercussions in Cuba. Braves pitcher Livan Hernandez, who defected from Cuba 17 years ago, didn't want to risk expressing an opinion, so strong is his fear of Castro. ""I do not talk about politics,"" Hernandez said. ""I still have family down there."" Dan Le Batard, a journalist for The Miami Herald, explained, ""Without getting into comparison shopping on atrocities ... for Cuban-Americans, he's our Hitler."" Older Cubans still recount with great pain their memories of Castro's infamous ""paredons,"" or firing squads, to which he summarily subjected thousands of his enemies at the beginning of his revolution. As Amnesty International's reports document, the terror, torture and repression that Cubans continue to experience under Castro's brutal regime seem boundless. Activists against the regime are held for days in detention centers subject to ""interrogations, intimidation, and threats. Beatings during detention have also been reported."" Dr. Bernie Fernandez, a renowned Cuban-American doctor in Miami and CEO of the Cleveland Clinic Florida, recalled that when he was 5 and living in Cuba, his father Bernardo, a doctor, became disillusioned with the Castro regime and sought permission to emigrate. This sole act was considered treason, and he was summarily sent to a forced labor camp indefinitely. The Cuban police took an inventory of the family's possessions -- thereby taking ownership of them on paper -- and Bernie and his mom and sister were forced to survive on their own. Seven years later Bernardo was released. In 1973, when Bernie was 12, Castro's police conducted another inventory to seize their possessions before letting them leave Cuba. Bernie Fernandez chokes up remembering how he boarded the plane in a shirt and pants cut out from a sack of potatoes. The family arrived in Spain, penniless. Fernandez eventually made it to Miami, where he struggled to learn English and make something of himself. ""Our experience,"" he says now, ""was mild compared to millions of other Cuban-Americans."" Guillen's insensitive comments and the subsequent explosive reaction from Cuban-Americans have exposed a raw, painful vein in the U.S. Hispanic experience. And such a vein should not be dismissed or ignored. When Schott spewed her racist comments, she was suspended for two seasons and ultimately forced to sell the Cincinnati Reds. She will be remembered as a bigoted anti-Semite. In that light, Guillen's five-game suspension hardly seems just. Castro is not Hitler, but Le Batard's claim that Castro is ""our Hitler"" -- a sentiment echoed by many exiles -- points unavoidably to the fact that the way Cuban-Americans feel about Castro is a lot like the way Jews feel about Hitler. And it also points to the woeful lack of understanding on the part of most Americans -- those who would dismiss Guillen's words and Cuban exiles' reaction to them as irrelevant -- about the Cuban-American experience, versus the understanding that Americans have of the Jewish experience. Indeed, if Guillen had expressed his love and respect for Hitler instead of Castro, his punishment would have been immediate and severe -- and no one would be dismissing his statement as irrelevant. Guillen's words were an insult to all freedom-loving Americans, not just Cuban-Americans. And to those who would say otherwise, I would respond that there needs to be a wake-up call to the tragedy and pain of the Cuban exile experience. Such a wake-up call will bring a greater understanding of what it means to be Cuban-American and what it means to be American -- and a much-needed appreciation for the freedoms we often take for granted in this country. Freedoms that Guillen's beloved Castro ripped so viciously away from his countrymen. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Charles Garcia.","Marlins manager Ozzie Guillen apologized for comments admiring Fidel Castro .
Charles Garcia said some dismissed the controversy and said suspension was too harsh .
He says America needs a wake-up call about repression, brutality Cuban exiles suffered ."
"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- President Barack Obama made an unannounced visit Friday to Afghanistan, where he delivered holiday greetings to U.S. troops stationed there and promised continued full support in the war against Taliban and other extremists. The president, who stayed for almost four hours before heading back to Washington, addressed nearly 3,900 troops at Bagram Airfield. Most of the troops were with the Army's 101st Airborne Division, though components of all the service branches were represented. ""I wanted to make sure that I could spend a little time this holiday with the finest fighting force the world has ever known,"" he told the enthusiastic audience. ""On behalf of more than 300 million Americans, we are here to say thank you."" The president praised the troops for what he characterized as recent military gains in the nine-year conflict. Our coalition ""is strong and is growing,"" he said. ""You're going on the offense (We're) tired of playing defense."" Obama visited a hospital on the base, where he met with five wounded soldiers and three wounded civilian contractors, reporters traveling with the president said. He awarded five Purple Hearts and met with the surviving members of a platoon that lost six comrades earlier in the week. Obama had originally planned to travel to Kabul to meet with President Hamid Karzai and greet U.S. Embassy staffers, but stayed at Bagram because of poor weather. He did, however, speak to Karzai for 15 minutes via secure videoconference. The president later huddled with National Security Adviser Tom Donilon, Ambassador Karl Eikenberry, and Gen. David Petraeus, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan. It was unclear whether U.S. concerns with the Karzai government publicized this week by the website WikiLeaks were discussed. Two of the cables paint an unflattering portrait of President Karzai's half brother, Ahmed Wali Karzai, who has been accused of dealing drugs. Prior to the latest WikiLeaks disclosures, Petraeus met with the Afghan president in an effort to ease tensions. Karzai had told the Washington Post he would like to scale back the U.S. military presence in his nation, and criticized the military presence as ""intrusive"" while calling Special Operations raids a problem. In response, Petraeus told Karzai aides that the president's view could make his relationship with the United States ""untenable."" A major U.S. military review of the war in Afghanistan is due this month, a year after Obama ordered additional U.S. troops to the country as part of a strategy that could bring some forces home as soon as July 2011. Officials have said the goal is to end combat operations in Afghanistan in 2014. Friday's trip was Obama's second to Afghanistan since he became commander-in-chief. He visited Afghanistan in 2008 as a presidential candidate.","NEW: Obama visit to Afghanistan lasts nearly four hours .

"(CNN) -- Officers in two Utah cities will make extra patrols Monday, the anniversary of the slayings of two women -- one in 2006, the other in 2008 -- who investigators believe were killed by the same person. Sonia Mejia, left, 29, and Damiana Castillo, 57, were killed on the same date two years apart, police say. Investigators recently learned forensic evidence links the February 9, 2006, killing of a pregnant Sonia Mejia and the February 9, 2008, slaying of Damiana Castillo, police in two neighboring Salt Lake City suburbs announced last week. No arrest has been made. Both women were Hispanic, and both were found slain in their apartments -- one in Taylorsville and the other a mile away in West Valley City. Authorities are trying to determine whether the date is significant, but they want residents ""to be cautious in general"" and not focus just on Monday, West Valley City police Sgt. Mike Powell said. Still, police will do extra patrols Monday ""just so the public is aware we're out and about,"" he said. Investigators are not saying a serial killer was involved, Powell said. But the links are alarming for the involved neighborhoods, which are heavily populated by Latinos, the director of a Hispanic advocacy group said. ""[News of the links] is important because, although I think law enforcement doesn't want to say it, this could be a serial killer type of thing, and there's concern from our point of view that there could be a guy that could be trying to kill people on a certain date,"" said Tony Yapias, director of Proyecto Latino de Utah. Mejia, 29, was six months' pregnant when she was sexually assaulted and strangled, CNN affiliate KSL-TV in Salt Lake City reported. She was found dead in her Taylorsville apartment, and her unborn child died, too, police said. Her car was found abandoned outside a hotel in nearby Murray, Utah, according to KSL. Some jewelry of Mejia's is missing, Powell said. Castillo, 57, was found strangled in her apartment two years later in West Valley City, about a mile away from Mejia's apartment, according to CNN affiliate KTVX-TV in Salt Lake City. Her son found the body, and there were no signs of forced entry, KSL reported. Police in both cities announced on Wednesday that forensic evidence linked the slayings to one killer, and that they had reason to believe he was a Hispanic male in his late teens or early 20s, standing between 5 feet 3 inches to 5 feet 5 inches tall, weighing 135 to 150 pounds and having short black hair. Powell declined to say how investigators arrived at those details or what kind of forensic evidence linked the killings. Police haven't said whether the women knew their attacker. Investigators haven't linked the killings to any other but are ""not closing the door on anything that might be related,"" said Powell, who added he isn't aware of any other February 9 homicides in the two cities or surrounding communities in recent years. The link between the February 9 stranglings has rattled some residents in the area, KTVX reported. ""I'm scared for me and my daughter to be here,"" West Valley City resident Elizabeth Berrelleza told KTVX. The police departments said Thursday they've created a joint eight-member task force to investigate the killings. The departments had known about each other's cases and had compared information for quite some time, ""but it's just recently that we've been able to link the cases,"" Powell said. ""[The significance of the date] is something that we're looking further into, and if someone has some information that would enlighten us, that would be helpful,"" Powell said. At a news conference Thursday, the task force made a special appeal to Latinos in the area, saying anyone with information -- including any undocumented person -- should come forward without fear. ""Sometimes they're worried about their [immigration] status. We're not interested in that. Come forward regardless,"" Powell said in an interview after the news conference. Police reached out to Yapias and other leaders of Hispanic advocacy groups, Yapias said. Yapias' group is working with Spanish-language media in the area to spread information about the killings and investigators' request for information, he said. ""Law enforcement has assured everyone that if someone is undocumented and they have information, they just want the information,"" Yapias said. ""But if they're afraid because of their legal status, then I or any other community leader can act as a mediator to make sure they're going to be protected."" Anyone with information about the slayings can call the task force's tip line at 801-965-5121 or send an e-mail to the task force at taskforce@wvc-ut.gov, police said.","Police: Evidence links killings that happened on same date two years apart .

"Karachi (CNN) -- Plumbing new depths in the battle for television ratings, abandoned babies are being given away on a controversial prime-time game show in Pakistan. TV host Aamir Liaquat Hussain presented baby girls to two unsuspecting couples during his show, which is broadcast live for seven hours a day during the month of Ramadan. ""I was really shocked at first. I couldn't believe we were being given this baby girl,"" said Suriya Bilqees, now a mother of a two-week old. ""I was extremely happy."" Another baby, a boy, is due to be given to another couple at some point in the coming days. The show's host has been described as a religious scholar, TV megastar and even a sex symbol. His heady mix of religion and entertainment is often followed by controversy. ""At Christmas there's Santa Claus to give everyone gifts, it's important for Christians. For us Ramadan is a really special time so it's really important to make people happy and reward them,"" said Hussain. His show -- Aman Ramazan -- has been dubbed Pakistan's version of The Price Is Right, with members of the 500-strong audience receiving prizes in exchange for answering questions on the Quran. The giveaway bonanza includes motorbikes, microwave ovens, washing machines and fridges. He also cooks while men sing Islamic hymns and discusses religion with children in a garden full of rabbits, snakes and goats. The baby girls given away on the show were found by an NGO, the Chhipa Welfare Association, which says it receives up to 15 abandoned babies a month. ""Our team finds babies abandoned on the street, in garbage bins -- some of them dead, others mauled by animals. So why not ensure the baby is kept alive and gets a good home?"" said Ramzan Chhipa, who runs the organization. ""We didn't just give the baby away. We have our own vetting procedure. This couple was already registered with us and had four or five sessions with us."" But, the couple didn't know they would be handed a newborn when they were invited to take part in the show and paperwork was not processed before the live broadcast. Adoption is not officially recognized in Pakistan and there is no adoption law. The couple will have to apply for guardianship at a family court. Some viewers praised the show's baby giveaway but others declared it a publicity stunt. ""Pakistan wake up,"" Shamim Mahmood wrote on the NGO's Facebook page. ""Babies are not trophies to be handed to just anyone."" Hussain says it isn't a gimmick to win ratings during the Islamic holy month. He believes his show is unifying a fractured nation, plagued by sectarian violence, religious intolerance and terrorism. ""These are the disenfranchised babies that grow up to be street kids and used for suicide bombing attacks. We have tried to show an alternative,"" he said. ""Telling people to take these kids off the rubbish on the streets, raise them and make them a responsible citizen, not to destroy society through terrorism,"" he said. The show has proved extremely popular, breaking ratings records and may be extended beyond its Ramadan run. He is also planning another program where the audience will be from the minority Hindu, Sikh and Christian communities. ""We've created a symbol of peace and love, that's our show's theme -- to spread love. I'm setting an example. Giving a childless couple an abandoned child,"" Hussain said. CNN's Saima Mohsin reported from Karachi, journalist Katie Hunt wrote and reported from Hong Kong .","Pakistani game show gives away unwanted babies .

"Washington (CNN) -- Under fire after veterans died waiting for appointments at VA hospitals, Veteran Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki will say Thursday that he is ""angered and saddened"" but won't be providing much detail about how his department is correcting the problems, according to prepared congressional testimony obtained by CNN. In fact, Shinseki, who is scheduled to testify in front of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee on Thursday, won't even acknowledge that there are problems. Finally, Senate and vets to hear from Shinseki on growing scandal . According to the written testimony, Shinseki will say the VA Inspector General's Office, which has launched an independent investigation, has advised the department not to provide information that could compromise their inquiry. ""I am personally angered and saddened by any adverse consequence that a veteran might experience while in, or as a result of, our care,"" he says in the prepared testimony. Last month, CNN revealed that at least 40 veterans died waiting for appointments at the Phoenix Veterans Affairs Health Care system, according to sources inside the hospital and a doctor who worked there. Many of those veterans were placed on a secret waiting list, the sources said. A fatal wait: Veterans languish and die on a VA hospital's secret list . Since November, CNN has uncovered delays in care at VA facilities across the country where numerous VA staffers have stepped forward to allege dangerously long wait times and efforts by VA officials to cover them up. The VA has previously admitted that 23 veterans passed away because of delays, and 53 others had adverse health effects at VA facilities across the country. Sources now tell CNN the Office of Inspector General is investigating in six states, including Arizona. ""In response to allegations about scheduling and delays at the Phoenix VA,"" Shinseki will say according to the testimony, ""I invited an independent investigation by the VA Office of Inspector General (OIG) to conduct a comprehensive, thorough and timely review. ""If these allegations are true, they are completely unacceptable -- to veterans, to me and to our dedicated VHA employees,"" Shinseki says in the prepared testimony. ""If they are substantiated by OIG, responsible and timely action will be taken."" Shinseki also said that he has placed three employees, including two senior executives, on administrative leave at the request of the Inspector General's office. Shinseki will also tell lawmakers that he has directed the Veterans Health Administration to ""complete a nationwide access review,"" according to the testimony.

"Washington (CNN) -- Jordan's King Abdullah met Tuesday with U.S. President Barack Obama to discuss the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the conflict in Syria, which borders Jordan. The two leaders told reporters after their White House talks that they would continue working together to bring about a resumption of Middle East peace talks, with King Abdullah citing the need to ""keep our fingers crossed"" for progress. In recent months, King Abdullah has taken a more active role in trying to bridge the gulf between Israelis and Palestinians, filling the vacuum created by the removal of Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak. Earlier this month, Palestinian and Israeli negotiators met in Amman with representatives of the Middle East Quartet -- made up of the United States, the European Union, the United Nations and Russia -- in an effort to relaunch negotiations after more than a year of deadlock. No significant breakthrough was made, but the two sides agreed to meet again. Obama said Tuesday he wanted to express his appreciation for the monarch's leadership in the region amid the change of what is known as the Arab Spring that has toppled governments in Egypt and Libya. On Syria, Obama noted that King Abdullah was the first leader of an Arab state to call on Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to step down over excess brutality against his own people. Obama thanked the king ""for his willingness to stand up,"" and for Jordan's role in Arab League efforts to encourage a needed peaceful transition in Syria. ""Unfortunately, we're continuing to see unacceptable levels of violence inside that country, and so we will continue to consult very closely with Jordan to create the kind of international pressure and environment that encourages the current Syrian regime to step aside so that a more democratic process of transition can take place inside of Syria,"" he said. In addition, Obama noted what he called the ""extraordinary efforts that have been made by his majesty"" and Jordan's prime minister ""in guiding political reform in Jordan,"" putting them ""ahead of the curve in trying to respond to legitimate concerns both politically and economically."" ""We have said we want to be as helpful as we can,"" Obama said of Jordanian reform efforts. In his remarks, King Abdullah expressed his gratitude for U.S. support for Jordan's political reforms, as well for its economic support. Obama, in his comments, said the United States is providing ""timely assistance in areas like food security this week."" ""As we move into political reform, obviously the economy and the situation that challenges the livelihood of Jordanians is very, very important as we move forward. But we are very, very optimistic,"" said King Abdullah. Outside the White House, however, the Jordan National Movement, a group that says it seeks to promote democracy in the country, protested King Abdullah's ""absolute monarchy system in Jordan."" Peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians fell apart more than a year ago over disagreements on the issue of Israeli settlements in the West Bank. In September, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas made a bid for the United Nations to recognize a Palestinian state, a move Israel called premature without direct talks to address its long-standing security concerns. In November, King Abdullah made a rare visit to the Palestinian political capital of Ramallah in the West Bank, followed by a meeting in Amman a week later with Israeli President Shimon Peres.","President Obama praises King Abdullah's leadership in the Middle East .

"(CNN) -- Psy's new song ""Hangover"" featuring Snoop Dogg dropped three days ago and the video has already racked up more than 31 million views on YouTube. That's actually a pretty slow start for the Korean superstar, considering ""Gangnam Style"" became the first video to pass two billion hits a week ago, while his follow-up single ""Gentleman"" also broke a record for the most views in 24 hours -- it currently has 694 million views on YouTube. The ""Hangover"" video shows Psy taking Snoop on a ridiculous guided tour of what he does best -- hardcore drinking, Korean-style. This involves endless bomb shots, hanging out at a jjimjilbang (Korean bathhouse), throwing up and karaoke with strangers -- with one particularly surreal scene of Snoop, Psy and and two Korean women blithely skipping through an amusement park, presumably drunk. True to the premise, Psy told CNN he was actually hungover when the song came out. Promotions for the new song kicked off Sunday on Jimmy Kimmel, with the unlikely trio of Kimmel, Psy and Snoop heading to a local karaoke bar in Los Angeles and bringing the house down with their yodeling. We asked Psy to talk about his hot new collaboration. CNN: How were you introduced to Snoop Dogg? Psy: My manager Scooter Braun put me in touch with him at my request. When I first wrote this track, I thought that Snoop's slow rapping would fit perfectly with my rapping on this track, so I asked him to put me in touch with Snoop and it's how it all happened. CNN: Who came up with the ideas for the video? Psy: When I first spoke with Snoop on the phone to discuss the collaboration idea, Snoop loved the title of the song, and I immediately suggested to him during that first conversation to shoot the music video in Korea and show us getting drunk and getting hungover in the most traditional Korean way. CNN: Where was the video filmed and who chose the locations? Psy: It was shot in Incheon. I chose that location because Snoop only had 18 hours to shoot the video. Since he was going to arrive at Incheon International Airport, I wanted to shoot the entire video in an area that is the closest to the airport to get the most out of those 18 hours. CNN: What was the filming process like? Psy: I initially told him that the shoot would be very relaxed and that he would only be in five scenes to entice him to come to Seoul and shoot the video. He ended up being in more than 20 scenes in more than 10 different locations within those 18 hours. CNN: Why did you decide to go with a different director this time? Psy: I co-directed this video so technically it's the same director, but my co-director [Cha Eun-taek] was different from that of ""Gangnam Style"" and ""Gentleman"" [co-directed by Cho Soo-hyun] because the type of the song is different -- electronic dance music versus 808 hip hop -- and I also wanted my fans to experience something different. CNN: What surprised you about working with Snoop Dogg? Psy: We all know how diligent Snoop is. He is all about working hard every time -- haha. I am just joking. I was very surprised working with him because he ended up shooting 20 different scenes in a short time -- it was a tough schedule, but he was a total pro and I appreciated it so much. CNN: How did you celebrate passing two billion views of ""Gangnam Style""? Psy: I really did not have a chance or time to celebrate because I immediately flew to LA for the Jimmy Kimmel Live appearance and other promos. CNN: What are some events/concerts/collaborations coming up for you? Although I cannot say at this moment who I collaborated with this past year [for an upcoming EP], but what I can tell you is that I worked with some big name artists! Psy's new EP is slated to come out later this year. The lead single on the EP ""Daddy"" will be released this summer.","Psy and Snoop Dogg shot new ""Hangover"" music video in Incheon, South Korea .

"Bamako, Mali (CNN) -- Elderly men were keeping watch Saturday over Timbuktu's main library after Islamists burned a tomb listed as a UNESCO World Heritage site. The attacks Friday were blamed on Ansar Dine, a militant group that seeks to impose strict Sharia law. The ancient city in Mali was captured by at least two separatist Tuareg rebel groups -- one of which is Ansar Dine -- in an anti-government uprising in the northern part of the country that began in January. The rebels burned the tomb of a Sufi saint where people come to pray, said Sankoum Sissoko, a tour guide familiar with the place. He said the library and other heritage sites remained under threat. Baba Haidara, a member of the National Assembly, called for UNESCO and the greater international community's help restoring the shrine and freeing the city. ""They attacked the grave, broke the doors and windows and ripped and burned pieces of white clothing that surrounded the tomb of the saint in front of everyone,"" said Haidara, who is from the central Mali city. ""With their attack, the militants touched the heart of Timbuktu. They picked Friday because they know many people visit the shrines on this day."" Sufism is a mystical dimension of Islam, and Islamists believe Sufi shrines are sacrilegious. As such, they have mounted attacks against Sufi sites in several nations. Sissoko said the attackers were dressed in signature Ansar Dine black robes and turbans. Timbuktu residents, he said, were ready to take up arms against the rebels, who have been linked to al Qaeda. Religious leader Baba Cheick Sekou said the occupying rebel groups have no respect for Timbuktu's religious and historic importance. Sekou said he feared for the protection of the prestigious Koranic Sankore University and ancient manuscripts that are kept there, as well as other tombs and mosques of historic significance. ""All Muslims know the tomb is a holy place,"" he said. ""It's not something you attack and destroy. It's anti-Islamic. People in the community are angry."" Haidara described the shrine situation as bad. Read also: Mali's treasure at risk from uprising . ""The young people of Timbuktu have started training to resist the militants, and I fear people will seek revenge,"" he said. Timbuktu Mayor Ousmane Halle said the attackers tore down windows and wooden gates at the grave sites and burned them. Tensions were high in the city, he said. ""People are angry, and for a good reason,"" Halle said. ""So far there's been no response from the central government condemning the attack,"" he said. ""I'm still waiting for them to give a declaration. That's what they would have done if it happened in (Mali's capital city of) Bamako."" To many, Timbuktu conjures a distant and exotic place due its location on the southern edge of the vast Sahara and accounts of great material and scholarly wealth. Known as the ""city of 333 saints"" for the Sufi imams, sheiks and scholars buried there, Timbuktu was declared a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1988. UNESCO is a United Nations cultural organization. See the list of UNESCO World Heritage sites . After the ouster of Moammar Gadhafi, armed Tuaregs who had been fighting in Libya streamed back across the border into Mali. In March, the ongoing Tuareg revolt sparked a military coup against Mali President Amadou Toumani Toure by officers unhappy with the government's handling of the rebellion. The rebels capitalized on the chaos in Bamako, in southern Mali, and usurped large swaths of territory in the north. UNESCO grew gravely concerned about the protection of heritage sites. UNESCO chief Irina Bokova has called for all groups to respect and protect the city's history. ""Timbuktu's outstanding earthen architectural wonders that are the great mosques of Djingareyber, Sankore and Sidi Yahia must be safeguarded,"" she said. ""Along with the sites' 16 cemeteries and mausolea, they are essential to the preservation of the identity of the people of Mali and of our universal heritage."" Islamists destroyed another world heritage site in 2001 when the Taliban used dynamite to blow up two giant 6th century statues of Buddha carved into the cliffs of Bamiyan in central Afghanistan. In a recent report, Human Rights Watch accused the Tuareg rebels of war crimes, including rape, use of child soldiers, summary executions and pillaging of hospitals, schools, aid agencies and government buildings.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The House of Representatives passed a bill Thursday that would give the Food and Drug Administration the authority to regulate the advertising and sale of tobacco products in the United States. The bill would give the FDA the authority to require the posting of larger warning labels on tobacco products . The measure passed by a vote of 298-112. Only eight Democrats voted against the bill; a majority of Republicans opposed it. The Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, which now moves to the Senate for further consideration, would allow the FDA to restrict the marketing of tobacco and ban candy-flavored cigarettes. It would also allow the agency to regulate nicotine and other ingredient levels, as well as force greater disclosure of the contents of tobacco products. Among other things, it would give the FDA the authority to require the posting of larger warning labels on cigarette cartons and other tobacco products. Tobacco companies could be barred from running ads implying, critics say, that ""mild"" or ""low-tar"" cigarettes are less harmful. ""This legislation is a major victory for those of us who prize the health of this nation over the profits of tobacco companies,"" J. Randall Curtis, the incoming head of the American Thoracic Society, said in a written statement. ""We applaud the House for passing the bill and hope that the Senate will move it through quickly so that President Obama can sign it into law as he has already indicated he would. Swift action could prevent tens of thousands of future deaths."" North Carolina Sens. Richard Burr and Kay Hagan have introduced separate legislation in the Senate that would create a new agency to oversee the tobacco industry. Critics say such an agency would do a less effective job regulating tobacco products. ""It's a legal product,"" Hagan said in a recent interview with the Charlotte Observer. ""I don't want to do anything that would harm the industry in North Carolina.""

"Napa, California (CNN) -- Many high-school-age students are hooked on their phones and computers. Instead of fighting the kids, some schools like the public New Technology High School in Napa, California, are jumping right in and embracing the technology. ""We meet kids where they live,"" New Tech Principal Michelle Spencer said. Where they live is increasingly online, on instant messenger and Twitter. The school encourages students to bring in their own computers and to embrace tools like Gchat and YouTube in school and as part of their lessons. New Tech High School, founded in 1997, is the oldest member of the New Tech Network, a national nonprofit organization that schools hire to implement project-based learning and embed the use of technology with teachers and students. The New Tech Network has gone on to work with 120 schools of varying grades and budgets, but the Napa high school is a unique look at how the next generation of schools might work with modern technology, not against it. Responsibility online . Giving high school students unrestricted access to technology presents its own challenges. The decision to trust students online and even encourage them to build up a public presence is the opposite of what's happening these days in many schools, where strict social-media policies, Internet filters and constantly evolving rules are meant to rein kids in. ""Teach responsibility. That's the better battle to choose,"" Spencer said. All students at New Tech are trained in digital citizenry and responsibility, with teachers constantly emphasizing awareness of how things posted online will never go away. These lessons come at a key time, educators there say: early enough to prevent students from sharing the irresponsible photos or posts that seem to be a rite of passage for the Internet generation. The teachers are also active on Twitter, bantering with students and using the social network as a teaching tool in their lessons. Any errors of judgment the students may make along the way are treated as teaching moments. After one student tweeted something negative about a basketball player, one of his teachers publicly replied on Twitter, respectfully asking whether that was the best choice of words. New Tech junior Vanessa Meno, 16, has a public Twitter account that she uses to communicate with teachers and other New Tech students and teachers. She is very careful about what she says because she knows she is representing her school. ""I know that people from all around the country are following my Twitter,"" Meno said. ""I also have my personal Twitter, which is blocked, so I have those separate lives."" Social media is just one of the ways students and teachers connect outside of the classroom. Most high school students don't do much e-mailing, according to Spencer. They prefer chatting online. The classroom goes online . At the heart of the school's modern take on technology is a Web-based program called Echo, which ties into Google Apps so students and teachers can use Google e-mail, docs, chat and calendar accounts. They are on Gchat constantly and can use it to talk to teachers or other students in and out of school. ""It is the biggest part of New Tech; I'm on Echo every day,"" Meno said. Teachers use the system to upload all the teaching materials for their classes and to track grades for projects. Students use it to track their progress in the seven categories that make up their grades: written communication, tech literacy, curricular literacy, oral communication, work ethics and professionalism and critical thinking. Teachers can upload PowerPoint presentations, project guidelines, resources like links to websites and other relevant content to guide students though projects. Because classes are primarily project-based, the students use the tool's online discussion boards to work on group assignments. ""Using it as a tool for instruction saves so much time; that's time I can focus on teaching,"" said economics and political government teacher Andre Baldauf. Instead of making teachers overly dependent on technology, the tool seems to free them up to be more creative with their classroom time. When a new big project is introduced, teachers create ""entry events"": splashy presentations that grab the students' attention and get them excited about the work ahead. In the past, a teacher staged a ""CSI""-style crime scene, taking on the role of corpse and asking the students to investigate the murder. A biology class had local winery and vineyard owners come in and lead the students through examining soil samples in order to determine what type of grape should be planted in each. Having an online mirror of everything taught in the classroom is useful for students with different learning styles. Some might soak in information better listening to a teacher speak, while others prefer to read the materials for themselves. ""I think it's empowering for the students,"" Baldauf said. It's also helpful for their parents, who have full access to their kids' pages and can see transcripts, grades and assignments. There's no more waiting until a bad report card arrives in the mail; parents have the power to track their child's progress in real time. ""My mom checked in my freshman year. I wasn't really sure New Tech was right for me,"" Meno said. ""She would definitely check in very often, keeping me on task."" Bring your own computer . Because most of the tools are now based in the cloud, students aren't stuck using school-issued computers. Instead, they are embracing the bring-your-own-device trend. Popular in businesses, the approach has taken off in schools only very recently. Three years ago, New Tech took on a $30,000 three-year lease for 120 Dell netbooks. With 320 students at the time, all the laptops were constantly in use. This year, the student population has grown and includes a larger percentage of students from low-income families, yet only 60 of the school netbooks are in use. Most people bring in their own laptops. Some use Macs, while others take advantage of the low-cost netbooks found in stores like Walmart. iPads and other tablets are the least popular choice for students. Spencer says that when they do see the devices, they're mostly being use for play, not work. This still being high school, the kids who do use the clunky school laptops feel conspicuous, according to Spencer. While she hasn't seen any students being teased for using the school laptops, she said she has seen evidence of the kids judging themselves. Ready for the real world . All the training at New Tech is focused on preparing students to transition into the real world. In addition to the group work that mimics companies (students can fire someone on a team if they aren't pulling their weight), seniors at the school wrap up their final year with a required project: a Web page they build themselves with their rÃ©sumÃ©s, letters of recommendation and links to work they've done at school.","The New Tech High School in Napa allows students to bring in their own computers .

"Washington (CNN) -- An Internal Revenue Service official involved in a 2010 conference cited for wasteful spending said Thursday no rules were broken and no fraud occurred, though he acknowledged that video parodies, fancy hotel suites and other excesses funded by taxpayers never should have happened. ""It's embarrassing, and I apologize,"" said Faris Fink, the IRS official who portrayed the Mr. Spock character in a training video for the conference that parodied the ""Star Trek"" television show and films. Fink told a congressional hearing that new federal regulations would prevent such a video and conference from occurring today. However, he said planners ""followed IRS and government procedures that were in place at the time."" He also noted that an inspector general's audit that revealed high hotel bills and other wasteful spending for the $4.1 million cost of the conference found no fraud occurred. ""In hindsight, many of the expenses that were incurred at the 2010 conference should be been more closely scrutinized or not incurred at all,"" said Fink, a 32-year IRS veteran. His testimony under oath to the House Oversight Committee followed fierce criticism from the panel's top Republican and Democrat. IRS puts two on leave over lavish 2010 conference . GOP Chairman Rep. Darrell Issa of California called the waste by the agency that collects taxes from the public ""maliciously self-indulgent."" He noted that in some cases, IRS workers who received employee benefits from the conference failed to file W-2 forms for the income, saying ""the IRS effectively was guilty of tax evasion."" The panel's ranking Democrat, Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, berated Fink for wasting the money of people who earn less in a year than the cost of the ""Star Trek"" parody video. Insisting he found ""no redeeming value"" from the video, Cummings cited examples of working people in his neighborhood, such as a hotel cleaning woman he saw at the bus stop on Thursday morning. ""That is her money, the one who makes $35,000, that's her,"" he told Fink. ""The gentleman up the street from me who makes $45,000 hauling trash. That's their money and so, it was wasted."" Thursday's hearing was the seventh in recent weeks on controversies at the IRS. The others focused mostly on the targeting of conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status that was uncovered in a separate inspector general's audit made public last month. Despite the public displays of outrage by legislators, Issa and Cummings conceded that such wasteful IRS spending on conferences and travel no longer occurred due to government reforms. ""It's not a new occurrence and many of these things may not be happening today,"" Issa said, while Cummings credited both the committee and the Obama administration for taking effective action in response to a similar spending scandal involving the General Services Administration that was uncovered in 2011. Partisan views of IRS targeting: Political conspiracy or overzealous scrutiny . On Wednesday, the IRS announced it has placed two employees on administrative leave in connection with the Anaheim, California, conference in 2010. Daniel Werfel, the acting IRS commissioner appointed by President Barack Obama last month to clean up the mess at the agency, said Thursday the move was a step toward firing the two employees, who have not been identified. In his report on the conference spending made public on Tuesday, Treasury Inspector General J. Russell George said the IRS spent taxpayer dollars on everything from event planners' commissions to speakers' fees to guest prizes to parody videos. ""Questionable expenses"" comprised much of the budget, according to George's report, which also said $3.2 million to pay for the conference expenses came from unused funds allocated for hiring. The August 2010 conference, held by the Small Business/Self-Employed division, had 2,600 attendees at three hotels in Anaheim. Fink said the conference provided valuable training for new managers at the time, despite what he called inappropriate spending. That didn't satisfy the legislators from either party, who questioned how IRS employees notorious for being sticklers on compliance with the law did not realize or protest the excess and waste of the conference. Democratic Rep. Gerald Connolly of Virginia called the problem ""a culture of arrogance and a real tin ear to the concerns of the public that pays the bill"" rather than something criminal. Gregory Kutz, an official in the inspector general's office who helped conduct the spending audit, agreed with Connolly, telling the panel it didn't appear to be fraud but rather ""a case of people who lost sight of the fact they were spending taxpayer money."" While outrage over the wasteful spending was bipartisan, both sides sought to score political points on Thursday. Issa, a leading GOP messenger in efforts to depict the Obama administration as government gone wild, complained of a ""culture without whistle blowers"" in the federal government and referred specifically to the targeting scandal his panel also is investigating. He wondered out loud how many IRS workers involved in the improper targeting could have benefited from better training and more staff paid for by the money spent instead on the Anaheim conference. Cummings, meanwhile, noted that IRS spending on conferences doubled during the final years of the GOP Bush administration, when the nation headed into recession. ""It would be legislative malpractice if we don't figure out what happened there,"" he said. Some Republicans sought to link the IRS controversies to Obama's health care reform law, pointing out the tax agency will enforce compliance with requirements for people to purchase health insurance. GOP Rep. Trey Gowdy of South Carolina said the problem was a ""cultural, systemic, moral, character"" issue at the IRS that no amount of training would solve. Noting that people now will submit health information to the IRS, which already has their financial information, Gowdy said ""those are details we don't share with people we do trust."" Cummings took exception with such remarks, saying that the misdeeds of some at the IRS didn't impugn the 90,000-employee agency or its ability to do its work. ""I don't buy this because we had some bad players, we can't do the job,"" he said, asking Werfel if the IRS was up to the task of taking on the health care law's mandate. ""Yes,"" replied Werfel, saying the IRS has reached all key milestones so far in preparing for its new responsibilities and adding he would be ""very active in this area because it's one our critical operational priorities."" On the targeting issue, Werfel said the agency and the inspector general would soon be providing additional information on groups seeking tax-exempt status that came under extra scrutiny. In the inspector general report last month, an IRS unit that handles applications for tax-exempt status was found to be using criteria that included conservative labels such as ""tea party"" to target groups for extra questioning. Republicans contend the targeting was political discrimination, but the report blamed poor management in dealing with unclear regulations and an increased workload rather than a political motivation.

"(CNN) -- Gwyneth Paltrow and husband, singer Chris Martin, have split, the couple announced in a joint statement on Tuesday via her website, Goop. While there had been speculation of trouble in paradise over the years, the couple seemed to remain united. ""It is with hearts full of sadness that we have decided to separate,"" the statement said. ""We have been working hard for well over a year, some of it together, some of it separated, to see what might have been possible between us, and we have come to the conclusion that while we love each other very much, we will remain separate."" The news comes fresh on the heels of an announcement that Martin, front man for the Grammy-winning band Coldplay, will be joining the hit NBC singing reality show ""The Voice."" It also comes days after a report in the Los Angeles Times that the pair had purchased a $14 million John Lautner-designed home in Malibu, California. The couple have been married for more than a decade and are the parents of two children, Apple and Moses. Paltrow and Martin asked for privacy for their family in their statement. ""We are, however, and always will be a family, and in many ways, we are closer than we have ever been,"" they said. ""We are parents first and foremost, to two incredibly wonderful children and we ask for their and our space and privacy to be respected at this difficult time. ""We have always conducted our relationship privately, and we hope that as we consciously uncouple and co-parent, we will be able to continue in the same manner."" The statement was signed, ""Love, Gwyneth & Chris."" The Goop site crashed from too many people trying to read the statement almost as soon as the news hit the Web. On social media the reaction was shock and snideness. Paltrow, who most recently guest-starred on ""Glee,"" has long riled up feelings of love/hate among fans with her Goop site, which some have viewed as aspirational.

"Indiana, U.S. (CNN) -- North Korea will soon test its third nuclear device. Earlier tests in 2006 and 2009 drew worldwide condemnation, Security Council sanctions and led Pyongyang to withdraw from the six-party talks. In resolution 2087, passed on January 22, the Council imposed new sanctions on North Korea for its December 12 space missile launch and made clear that new violations would be dealt with harshly. In response, North Korea rejected Council legitimacy, asserted their right to nuclear weapons and deterrence and proclaimed it would soon conduct a new nuclear test. In addition the North engaged in some strong saber-rattling aimed at South Korea. Because some analysts believe this will be a uranium explosion, it is a game-changer for the region and poses new and unfavorable challenges to the Security Council. A successful uranium test indicates that Pyongyang has advanced centrifuge technologies and related support systems. It means that North Korea, if left unchecked, can both produce and export such material, raising new concerns that Pyongyang and Iran cooperate in such developments. Politically the test will reveal that the new regime of Kim Jong-Un exceeds the defiance to U.N. dictates of his predecessors in pursuing his nation's nuclear goals. Neither the prospect of stronger sanctions, nor the growing discontent of Russia and China with his behavior, appears to deter North Korea's young leader. OPINION: Rescind North Korea's license to provoke . These dilemmas confront the permanent five members of the Council with a harsh reality check regarding their unity of action and what message to convey to the north via what particular sanctions. If the Council follows the logic of resolution 2087, it will impose more extensive and punishing sanctions than ever before. Such sanctions will blacklist companies, government agencies and individuals long known for their role in illicit technology procurement and sanctions evasion. They will expand financial sanctions into areas of banking that would require substantial transnational enforcement to bite, and they may call upon countries in the region to inspect almost all North Korean trade. The economic squeeze and further isolation of the DPRK will increase substantially. These sanctions would require China to play an enforcement role against North Korean economic actors it has hitherto resisted. Seizing prohibited goods that pass through Dalian harbor and other trans-shipment points, as well as shutting down various border activities, would also fall to China. These extensive sanctions as punishment operate from the assumption that at some point the north will forego its nuclear program in order to survive as an authoritarian state. But there may be an alternative to the punishment approach that could bring Beijing on board with effective Council action. China might well accept specialized trade sanctions aimed to degrade the DPRK's ability to sustain the nuclear program for lack of material and due to prohibitive costs of sanctions busting, as a way of conveying to Pyongyang that it must return to the negotiating table. The logic of extensive new product-focused sanctions is that DPRK can make -- or jerry-rig -- only a small fraction of the advanced technologies and specialty materials that sustain an ongoing uranium enrichment program. To choke off these materials -- and the illicit means of financing them -- provides the Council with a possibility to make it technically impossible for DPRK to have a functioning uranium-based bomb program. Precise lists of dozens of the materials used in centrifuge operation that should be sanctioned are already recorded for the Council in the reports of their Panel of Experts for the DPRK. Lists of related materials have also been developed by the Nuclear Supplies Group. To date the permanent five have sanctioned only a very few of the materials on either list. The Council also needs member states to strengthen export, customs and financial controls on dual-use items that are ""below grade"" of those newly sanctioned items. This will stifle the North's ability to upgrade or jerry-rig these hitherto unsanctioned items as a way of maintaining their program. Also critical to the success of this choking of supplies would be stricter controls of the illicit financing that supports such trade. Putting strong enforcement behind the 2087 resolution's concern about DPRK cash flows, especially through its embassies, is also in order. Another, somewhat unprecedented, sanctions option would be a Council-issued travel ban on North Korea placed on all scientists, engineers and others with specialized expertise in centrifuge technologies and uranium enrichment. Political agreement on these measures will not be easy to attain among the permanent five nations of the Security Council. But a product-focused sanctions approach -- especially leveraged to aim for more direct diplomatic engagement with the DPRK while denying them material to grow their illicit programs -- has the best chance of gaining Council consensus. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of George A. Lopez.","Lopez: Uranium-based blast would pose new challenge to U.N. Security Council .

"(CNN) -- A man who lost both legs in the Boston Marathon attack is engaged to the woman he was waiting for at the finish line. Jeff Bauman, 28, is also expected a child this summer with fiancee Erin Hurley, 27, according to an announcement on his foundation's Facebook page: . ""We are so happy to share with you exciting news that has happened over the last few months...Jeff and Erin became engaged and are expecting their first child in the summer!!! Congratulations Jeff and Erin!!"" The posting did not reveal a due date for the child or a wedding date. Bauman is credited with helping investigators identify the suspects in the April 15, 2013, double bombing. The image of the maimed Bauman being led to safety by a man in a cowboy hat became one of the most memorable images of the Boston Marathon terrorist attack that killed three and injured more than 260 people. A day after he woke up from two life-saving surgeries with no legs, he mustered the strength to describe bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev to law enforcement. Tsarnaev's younger brother, Dzhokhar, has pleaded not guilty to 30 federal charges related the bombings, including murder. Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed when his brother ran over him as police were trying to handcuff him in a chase a few days later, authorities said. Bauman announced in September that he will publish a memoir -- titled ""Stronger"" -- about his experiences at and since the marathon. ""The past months have often been difficult, but the support I've received from around the world, and especially from the people of Boston, has inspired me to set and achieve high goals,"" he said in a statement released by Grand Central Publishing last year.

"(CNN) -- In an agreement that the National Association for the Deaf (NAD) calls ""a model for the streaming video industry,"" Netflix has agreed to caption all of its shows by the year 2014. The online-streaming giant is already captioning 82 percent of its videos, according to the consent decree [PDF] filed in court yesterday. Now, it's bound to finish its entire library, reaching the 90 percent mark in 2013 and 100 percent by 2014. The company has also agreed to speedily caption new content. The agreement says that Netflix will put captions on new content within 30 days by 2014; within 14 days by 2015; and within 7 days by 2016, ""and shall strive to reach a point at which Conforming Captions are provided simultaneously with launch at all times."" Netflix provides its service on more than 1,000 devices; its captioning service works on most, but not all, of those.The company promises to make ""good faith, diligent efforts"" to get it working on all devices, but it isn't obligated to get 100% device compatibility. The agreement ends a class-action lawsuit that NAD filed in 2010, claiming that Netflix's website was a ""place of public accommodation"" that was out of compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act. While the parties have made nice now, Netflix spent a fair amount of time trying to get the lawsuit kicked out first. Netflix said that the ADA didn't apply in this case, because it was superseded by a new law directing the FCC to set rules for online captioning. In June, however, Netflix definitively lost that argument, when a Massachusetts federal judge ruled [PDF] that the new law was meant to ""complement, not supplant"" the Americans with Disabilities Act. ""The National Association of the Deaf congratulates Netflix for committing to 100 percent captioning, and is thrilled to announce that 48 million deaf and hard of hearing people will be able to fully access Netflix's Watch Instantly services,"" said NAD CEO Howard Rosenblum in a press release accompanying the decree. As part of the consent decree, Netflix will pay $755,000 to plaintiffs' lawyers who prosecuted the lawsuit, as well as $40,000 for the decree to be implemented over the next four years.

"(CNN) -- A US Airways plane blew a tire during takeoff Thursday evening at Philadelphia's airport, an airline spokesman said, with witnesses recalling seeing the plane ""bounce"" before screeching to a halt. Citing initial reports, US Airways spokesman Todd Lehmacher said the commercial airliner's pilot decided to abort takeoff after the tire issue. Philadelphia International Airport tweeted, and photos indicate, that the plane's nose gear collapsed. Philadelphia Fire Commissioner Lloyd Ayers said two women from the plane were transported to the city's Methodist Hospital, one with a minor injury and the other with a minor illness. ""This is a good time,"" Ayers said, referring to the response and the fact things turned out as well as they did. ""It worked out alright."" Flight 1702 was scheduled to take off at 5:50 p.m. and arrive in Fort Lauderdale about three hours later, according to US Airways' website, though Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Jim Peters said the incident took place around 6:25 p.m. Watching from a nearby plane, Dave Olinger said, ""I saw the plane come down with its landing gear (hitting) the ground abnormally hard and it bounced back into the air. Then it continued to try to land and it went out of my view as I saw a massive cloud of dust come up from behind it."" A witness in an airport terminal, posting to the online travel community FlyerTalk.com, reported seeing the plane ""bounce twice on takeoff."" Firefighters spotted smoke coming from one engine, but no fire. Philadelphia Fire Department Deputy Chief Gary Loesch said crews sprayed ""a protective foam blanket"" around where ""hydraulic fluid ... was leaking from the front landing gear,"" saying this was only done as a precaution. Images from the airport afterward showed the plane pitched forward, but otherwise upright, and surrounded by flashing emergency vehicles. One showed the plane at a standstill as some people left from an emergency slide and others got out on the wing. ""So my plane just crashed,"" tweeted one apparent passenger. A short time later and minutes before taking a selfie at the scene, she added, ""I almost just died."" The 149 passengers and five crew members who had been aboard the Airbus A320 quickly got off, then were moved about 400 yards away into a field, according to Loesch. They were surrounded by police and fire vehicles to block the wind, with women and children getting into these vehicles to stay warm in temperatures hovering around the freezing mark. ""Most people were complaining about being cold,"" Loesch said. Departing and incoming flights at the Pennsylvania airport were temporarily halted. Some of them resumed around 6:55 p.m., Peters said, though one runway remained closed for some time after that. The incident caused significant travel headaches, and not just for those on Flight 1702. The airport noted there were departure delays of about one hour, with airport spokeswoman Victoria Lupica saying arrival delays stretched up to two hours. According to Joe Taney, the vice president of operations in Philadelphia for American/US Airways, Flight 1702 passengers were bused to the terminal and taken to one of the airline's Admirals Clubs, which is typically for ""preferred members."" They remained there for some time, before they could collect items they had left on the plane. Another aircraft was arranged to take them to Fort Lauderdale. That plane hadn't left by 10:30 p.m., though it was supposed to head out soon. ""There's maybe a couple that chose not to go, which is fine ...,"" Taney said. ""But overall the majority of people are choosing to go on that extra (flight).""

"(CNN) -- ""There are so many ways of being despicable it quite makes one's head spin. But the way to be really despicable is to be contemptuous of other people's pain."" -- James Baldwin . No doubt most people who listened to Ariel Castro's self-serving monologue during his sentencing hearing on ""consensual sex,"" and ""harmony in that house,"" wondered at his sanity and his definition of ""monster."" Sanity, however, is judged by reality testing and not by caring or compassion. Human cruelty is not a disease or a mental illness, although it is a plague on humankind. As someone who has worked with violent offenders for 35 years, I can tell you unequivocally the number of offenders who deny, minimize or justify their behavior far outweigh the number who take responsibility. Never mind the tortuous loops the mind has to jump through. If the sex was consensual, what exactly were the chains and locks for? There is no limit to the mind's ability to rationalize. A man who beat a 3-year-old to death told me that he only committed violence when ""the situation called for it. I never did anything I didn't have to do."" When asked how he feels about the boy's suffering, he replied, ""I guess I don't feel anything."" When asked if he saw himself as a criminal, he said, ""I know that's what I'm seen as but no, I don't."" A man whose brother took him in when he had no place to go after being released from prison raped his benefactor's 12-year-old daughter -- his niece -- and stabbed his brother 12 times when he came to her rescue. When asked why he did this, he replied: ""I was drinking. It just happened. ... You can't blame anybody for the rain. You can't blame anybody for nothing."" We are familiar with whole cultures justifying violence as extreme as genocide. Why are we surprised when individuals do the same? Violence is almost always denied or rationalized -- after the fact, if not before. Even violence that appears impulsive is usually related to thinking patterns and beliefs that justify it. Such rationales are important to protect self-image. Again it was Baldwin who said, ""No man is a villain in his own eyes."" As to Castro's claim that he had an illness, a sexual addiction, there is a difference between urges and behaviors. Castro could have dealt with his urges by seeking help. Medication and treatment have been available for sex offenders for well over a decade. Would they have worked? Who knows? He didn't try. He made a decision to live out his sexual fantasies, not to try to control them. In treatment, at the least he would have learned how not to reinforce the fantasies through violent pornography. At least by telling someone, he would have had some check on his behavior. Castro may not have chosen the fantasies that dominated his dreams, but he chose to act on them -- for more than a decade. Even the most persistent urges are not present 24 hours a day. All Castro needed was for 51% of him to have an attack of conscience for a few minutes and want to release those women long enough to open a door. In more than a decade he never had it. In fact, he tormented his victims not only in sexual ways but in nonsexual ways as well: He showed them TV coverage of their families grieving. He told one that her family didn't care about her. He fed them once a day. He beat a pregnant woman until she miscarried. None of these speak to sexual urges; these acts speaks to psychopathic traits: the lack of a conscience, lack of caring about other human beings, callousness, lack of guilt and lack of remorse -- in short, malevolence, the desire to harm another human being gratuitously while being contemptuous of her pain. Even now, he has shown no genuine remorse or regret. What we saw at the hearing instead was a cocoon of aggressive narcissism wrapped so tightly Castro could proclaim with a straight face that chained women were having sex with him consensually. Yet at the same time he asked for their forgiveness. No doubt there are those who will advise the victims they must forgive in order to move on. I disagree. Forgiveness is not a gift; it must be earned. Atonement and change must precede forgiveness or else it is an empty gesture. It is difficult to imagine how much Castro would have to change for forgiveness even to be legitimately on the table. I'm not sure his sentence is long enough for that to happen, and to date, he has not taken a single step. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Anna Salter.","Anna Salter: Ariel Castro believed he had ""consensual sex"" with chained women .
Salter: Most predators justify their behavior; it's not sexual, it's psychopathic .
If Castro believed he had an addiction, she says, why didn't he seek help?

"(CNN) -- Catholic faithful from Latin America cheered the historic election of the first pope from the region Wednesday. Crowds swarmed outside the metropolitan cathedral in Buenos Aires, chanting as they waved Argentine flags. Smiling immigrants and tourists praised the news on the steps of New York's St. Patrick's Cathedral. Pilgrims at Mexico City's Basilica of Guadalupe said they were thrilled. Even though about 480 million of the world's 1.2 billion Catholics live in Latin America, for centuries, the church's top job has gone to Europeans. That changed with the announcement that Argentine Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio, who served as archbishop of Buenos Aires, would become the new pontiff. Bergoglio, 76, chose the name Pope Francis. ""I felt like crying. I felt great excitement. It is a blessing from God,"" said Ines Ambrosi, who spoke to CNN en EspaÃ±ol outside New York's St. Patrick's Cathedral shortly after the news was announced. ""In Latin America there are millions of Catholics and truly it has been a bit forgotten by the church. Now we feel very represented, and proud."" New pope adopts the name Francis . Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner -- whose government has sparred with Bergoglio in the past -- sent a letter congratulating him as he assumed his new role. ""Today is a historic day. ... For the first time in 2,000 years of the church there is going to be a pope that comes from Latin America,"" she said later at an event broadcast on public television. ""And from our hearts we wish for Francis that he can accomplish a greater degree of fraternity between peoples and religions."" Talk Back: What kind of spiritual leader will draw people back to organized religion? Argentine Martin Watson compared the new pope to another kind of celebration that has historically been far more common in his country. ""The news, for us, was almost like winning the World Cup in soccer,"" he said. But he added that the papal pick goes beyond national pride. ""For Latin America, it will be a great change. More eyes will be focused on our region, and maybe we'll have more support for our region,"" he said. ""We have a lot of needs. We have more than 50% in each country of the region (that) are very poor. That would be a great help for them."" 5 things to know about the new pope . Excitement spreads beyond Argentina . Mexico's Catholic bishops released a statement praising the news. ""For the churches that are pilgrims in Latin America, it is the cause of great joy,"" the statement said. ""For the Mexican church, it is a clear sign of love for the churches that are pilgrims in these lands."" In St. Peter's Square in Vatican City, a woman from Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, told CNN's Anderson Cooper she was overcome with emotion. ""I feel that Mexico has been a country that has suffered a lot, and so has Latin America, but it is a people that has always put trust in God,"" she said, ""so it is absolutely wonderful to represent our part of the world this time around."" Beside her, a woman from Mexico City said her heart jumped when she heard the announcement that a pope had been picked. A look at the life of Cardinal Bergoglio . ""I'm so excited,"" she said. ""It's a reason of being proud tonight, because Latin America is a very important Catholic area and now it's going to be totally represented here, so I'm so proud and I'm so happy today. ... It's going to help a lot, a Latin American pope, it's going to help. It's going to rebuild many things, and it's a new start."" In Brazil, the secretary-general of the country's Council of Bishops said he and many others were surprised, but happy, that Bergoglio was chosen. ""It is a very beautiful sign that the cardinals gave us by electing a Latin American cardinal, now our Pope Francis,"" said Leonardo Ulrich Steiner, according to state-run Agencia Brasil. ""It shows that the church is truly universal."" In Venezuela, interim leader Nicolas Maduro suggested the late President Hugo Chavez -- who died last week -- could have influenced the church's historic move. ""We know that our commander ascended to those heights,"" Maduro said in remarks broadcast on state-run VTV. ""He is face to face with Christ. He influenced something. ... Some new hand arrived, and Christ said, well, the new hour of South America has arrived."" Before Wednesday's announcement, speculation had surged that the church might select its first non-European pope of the modern era. What's in a name? ""It would be an enormous gesture to name a Latin American pope,"" Virginia Garrard-Burnett, a professor of history and religious studies at the University of Texas at Austin, said earlier this week. Because Catholicism is losing ground in the region, a pope from there could be a boost for the faith, she said. Priest: Pope gives hope and pride to U.S. Latinos . The pick is also good news for Catholic Latinos in the United States, said the Rev. Juan J. Molina, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops associate director for the church in Latin America. ""He is also the son of migrants. And for us, Hispanics in the United States, this is very important. ... I think that this topic of migration is going to be very important for him,"" Molina told CNN en EspaÃ±ol. ""And we, the Hispanics, the Latinos that now live in the United States ... we can also take some hope and pride that this pope intimately knows and has deeply lived the life of a migrant."" New pope's name choice 'precedent shattering' Bergoglio's selection also sends a significant message throughout Latin America, Molina said, where the Catholic faith has had a strong presence for centuries. ""The election of a Latin American pope demonstrates that we are now empowered with this faith,"" Molina said. ""The church in Latin America is a mature church."" Even the new pope himself alluded to the fact that the church had reached farther than ever for its papal pick. In his first speech from the balcony of St. Peter's Basilica, he quipped Wednesday that cardinals had gone to ""the end of the world"" to find him. CNN's Mariano Castillo and Marysabel Huston-Crespo in Atlanta, CNNMexico and Rey Rodriguez in Mexico City, Jose Manuel Rodriguez in Buenos Aires, Juan Carlos Lopez in Washington and Rafael Fuenmayor in New York contributed to this report.","""Today is a historic day,"" Argentina's president says .

"Shenandoah, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- The Pennsylvania prosecutor who failed to secure felony convictions against two teens in the beating death of a Mexican immigrant says he thought his case was ""compromised"" from the start. Like many residents in the small, tight-knit eastern Pennsylvanian community of Shenandoah, Schuylkill County District Attorney James Goodman knew that an officer investigating the death of Luis Ramirez was in a relationship with the mother of one the teens involved. Goodman also believed the investigation and evidence hadn't been handled as it should have been. ""They didn't interview the perpetrators, the boys. In fact, not only did they not interview them, they picked them up, gave them rides, helped them concoct stories, brought them back and told the boys what to say,"" Goodman told CNN. The son of Shenandoah Police Lt. William Moyer also played on the same football team as the teens who were involved in the July 2008 street brawl, according to court documents. Read excerpt from ""Latino in America"" ""It's clear they were trying to help these boys out, for whatever reason -- they were football players, these police officers were trying to help these boys out and limit their involvement in the death of Luis Ramirez."" Early on, Goodman says his office reached out to the U.S. Attorney's Office with his concerns. Their investigation led to a federal indictment alleging that the teens, Brandon Piekarsky and Derrick Donchak, participated in a scheme to obstruct the investigation with the help of Moyer, Shenandoah Police Chief Matthew Nestor and Police Officer Jason Hayes, who was dating Piekarsky's mother. Moyer, Nestor and Hayes pleaded not guilty in U.S. District Court in Scranton on Tuesday. Moyer and Hayes were released; Nestor is being held under a magistrate's order, his lawyer, Patrick M. Rogan said. ""The situation is very tragic in many ways and too many families and I'm not in any way taking the attention away from what happened to the Ramirez family,"" Rogan said. ""But I believe that after a full airing of the case and the situation that my client will be fully exonerated."" Piekarsky and Donchak are also charged with a federal hate crime for fatally beating Ramirez allegedly because of his race. The two are serving prison sentences after a Schuylkill County jury found them guilty in May of misdemeanor simple assault in Ramirez's death. They were acquitted of felony charges of ethnic intimidation, a hate crime according to Pennsylvania law, and hindering apprehension. Piekarsky, who was accused of delivering the fatal kick to Ramirez's head while he was on the ground, also was found not guilty of third-degree homicide. Anticipating the potential jury verdict, Goodman says his office considered a plea deal. ""We knew there were problems with the evidence, with what the police did, with the reports that were generated,"" he said. ""We knew our case was compromised and we knew we didn't have the strongest case going forward and that's why we entertained the plea deal."" The plea deal never panned out, but Goodman says he does not fault the jury for reaching its verdict. ""With the evidence, the police, what they did, we don't get to pick our evidence either and you've got to play the hand you're dealt,"" he said. ""We respect their verdict and now the federal system has spoken and we'll see what happens there."" The federal indictment alleges that, shortly after the July 12, 2008 fight, Piekarsky went with Hayes and Moyer to the scene of the assault and told them about it. After talking with them, the indictment says Piekarsky went to Donchak's home and made an agreement with Donchak and others, including two of the alleged participants ""to give a false account of the assault on L.R. [Luiz Ramirez] to authorities in official statements,"" the indictment says. Prior to leaving the home, the young men ""created a false version of events to be incorporated in official police reports which omitted references to Brandon Piekarsky kicking L.R. and to the racial motivation for the assault,"" the indictment alleges. Moyer is accused of instructing the teens to dispose of their shoes; he is also accused of mischaracterizing witness accounts to minimize Piekarsky's role. Hayes and Nestor are accused of creating false and misleading investigative reports, among other allegations, according to the indictment. Piekarsky's relationship with the officers and rumors of a cover-up have been circulating among the community ever since Ramirez died after two days on life support. Ramirez, a 25-year-old father of two, was living with the mother of his children, a lifelong resident of Shenandoah. He was walking her sister home the night of July 12 when he encountered Piekarsky, Donchak and several other members of the Shenandoah High School football team, who were leaving a local festival. Prosecutors alleged that the teens baited Ramirez into the initial confrontation after a night of drinking, hurling racial epithets at the undocumented Mexican immigrant. After the fight broke up, witnesses said Ramirez came back at the teens. They beat him so severely that, according to medical testimony, brain tissue oozed out of his skull during surgery at a hospital. Defense lawyers argued that Ramirez's death was a street brawl gone wrong that was not motivated by racial bias. They also suggested that Ramirez was responsible for triggering the second confrontation. Ramirez's fiancee, Crystal Dillman, said the indictments bring a measure of hope that justice will finally be served. ""We prayed for this day. And it finally happened. It was a gift from God, a Christmas present from God. It was a long-time coming but it was definitely worth the wait.""

"(CNN)  -- Two U.S. journalists who had been detained by North Korea were traveling back to the United States with former President Clinton hours after being pardoned, a Clinton spokesman said. Former President Clinton meets Tuesday with North Korea leader Kim Jong Il. ""They are en route to Los Angeles [California] where Laura and Euna will be reunited with their families,"" said spokesman Matt McKenna. Doug Ling, Laura's father, reacted to the news outside his home in Carmichael, California, with, ""One of the best days in my life ... I figured, sooner or later, they'd be back."" In Los Angeles, family friend Welly Yang said the Ling family had ""done everything they could, while respecting the North Korean government, to try and get Laura home."" He predicted that Ling would remain a journalist. ""Despite this terrifying experience, I can't imagine that Laura would give up her passion to tell stories that otherwise wouldn't be heard."" Their release Wednesday came after Clinton met with top government officials in Pyongyang. ""Clinton expressed words of sincere apology to Kim Jong Il for the hostile acts committed by the two American journalists against the DPRK after illegally intruding into it,"" the news agency reported. ""Clinton courteously conveyed to Kim Jong Il an earnest request of the U.S. government to leniently pardon them and send them back home from a humanitarian point of view. ""The meetings had candid and in-depth discussions on the pending issues between the DPRK and the U.S. in a sincere atmosphere and reached a consensus of views on seeking a negotiated settlement of them.""  Watch Ling's father welcome his daughter's pardon » . The report said Clinton then conveyed a message from President Obama ""expressing profound thanks for this and reflecting views on ways of improving the relations between the two countries."" But White House spokesman Robert Gibbs told reporters in Washington before the announced agreement that Clinton was not carrying any message -- written or oral -- from Obama. Gibbs added that the former president last spoke with Obama during a White House visit in March. He described Clinton's trip as a ""solely private mission to secure the release of two Americans."" The report from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the nation's official name, described the agreement to release the journalists as ""a manifestation of the DPRK's humanitarian and peace-loving policy. ""The DPRK visit of Clinton and his party will contribute to deepening the understanding between the DPRK and the U.S. and building the bilateral confidence."" Ling and Lee are reporters for California-based Current TV -- a media venture launched by Clinton's former vice president, Al Gore. The women were arrested in March while reporting from the border between North Korea and China for California-based Current Media and sentenced in June to 12 years in prison on charges of entering the country illegally to conduct a smear campaign. Because the United States has no diplomatic relations with North Korea, efforts to resolve the issue had been handled through Sweden, which represents U.S. interests in Pyongyang. ""We want to thank the Obama administration for its continuous and determined efforts to achieve this outcome, and President Clinton for his willingness to undertake this mission,"" Current Media co-founders Gore and Joel Hyatt said in a written statement. ""All of us at Current are overjoyed at Laura and Euna's safe return. Our hearts go out to them -- and to their families -- for persevering through this horrible experience."" The visit by the former president, whose wife, Hillary Clinton, is the Obama administration's secretary of state, came about three weeks after the United States dropped a request that Ling and Lee be released on humanitarian grounds. Instead, the United States was seeking amnesty for the women, Hillary Clinton said.  Watch what may lie behind the pick of Bill Clinton » . Clinton's mission came as the United States and its allies in the region are seeking to persuade North Korea to return to nuclear disarmament talks, which have stalled. North Korea conducted its second nuclear bomb test in May and has conducted several missile tests since. The United Nations has responded to those tests by tightening and expanding sanctions on the nation. North Korea and the United States were on opposite sides in the 1950-1953 Korean War and had no regular contacts before a 1994 crisis over North Korea's nuclear program. North Korea agreed then to halt the development of nuclear weapons but abandoned that accord and withdrew from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 2003. Former President Clinton had considered visiting North Korea in 2000 near the end of his second term as president. His secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, had gone to Pyongyang in early 2000 to meet with Kim. The 67-year-old North Korean leader is widely reported to have suffered a stroke a year ago and is believed to be grooming his youngest son, Kim Jon Un, as his successor.

"(CNN) -- A federal appeals court has stayed the Texas execution of a convicted rapist and murderer, saying that his defense team should have more time to make their case that Robert James Campbell is intellectually disabled. Campbell's execution had been scheduled for Tuesday. It would have been the first execution in the United States since a botched lethal injection in Oklahoma left an inmate writhing in pain before death. His defense team now will have more time to appeal his death sentence. ""It is regrettable that we are now reviewing evidence of intellectual disability at the eleventh hour before Campbell's scheduled execution. However, from the record before us, it appears that we cannot fault Campbell or his attorneys, present or past, for the delay,"" justices from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit said in their opinion. A neuropsychologist had diagnosed Campbell with ""mild mental retardation."" His attorneys say that makes him ineligible for the death penalty. But Texas prosecutors say their efforts are a last-ditch effort to stop execution and not a valid claim. In 2002, the U.S. Supreme Court concluded ""the mentally retarded should be categorically excluded from execution."" Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott, in a petition contesting the defense claims of mental retardation before the appeals court's ruling, questioned why Campbell, now 41, waited until 12 years after a court had determined his mental state to raise the claims. ""Campbell's last-minute claim of mental retardation, which was previously raised and rejected in the federal and state courts does not warrant review. Campbell is not mentally retarded,"" according to pertinent case law, Abbott contends. Campbell's lawyer praised the appeals court's decision, arguing that Texas should stop pursuing the death penalty in the case. ""The Fifth Circuit's decision today creates an opportunity for Texas to rise above its past mistakes and seek a resolution of this matter that will better serve the interests of all parties and the public,"" attorney Robert C. Owen said in a statement. According to court documents and the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, Campbell was involved in a string of armed carjackings in 1990 and 1991. In one incident, Alexandra Rendon, a 20-year-old Houston bank employee, was snatched from a gas station, robbed, sexually assaulted and fatally shot. ""Mr. Campbell gave Ms. Rendon's coat to his mother, and her jewelry to his girlfriend, as gifts; he also drove Ms. Rendon's car openly in his own neighborhood, and told people he had been involved in the crime,"" according to his application for post-conviction relief. These facts are key, as the defense team says they indicate that ""Mr. Campbell demonstrates no criminal sophistication."" Questions about competence . Testing showed Campbell had ""applied academic skills consistent with an individual midway through fifth grade,"" according to court documents, and while he was able to count and add change, he was inconsistent ""calculating change from a purchase."" He also asked a friend for help reading a non-digital watch, and an informant told the court Campbell could not read a car's gas gauge and ""always had to ask others whether there was enough fuel to get to the destination,"" the documents say. Dr. Leslie Rosenstein, a clinical neuropsychologist, diagnosed Campbell with ""mild mental retardation,"" saying his performance on recent tests was consistent with his standardized intelligence test scores when he was a child, according to court documents. Campbell's defense team alleges the Texas Department of Criminal Justice was aware of Campbell's low test scores, yet told the team in 2003 that his only IQ test yielded a score of 84, well above the threshold range for mental retardation. But as Judge Elsa Alcala wrote last week in her dissent to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals' 5-4 decision, a defense team later learned the Department of Criminal Justice administered a test in 1992, on which Campbell scored a 71. Alcala described it as ""a score that, after applying the standard of margin of error, would indicate mental retardation."" Had the department not ""misinformed"" Campbell's defense, the judge wrote, ""then this court would have had IQ testing supportive of applicant's mental-retardation claim."" Also influencing the dissent is that Rosenstein had deemed the 1990 test score of 84 ""unreliable."" ""This court should not base its decisions that determine whether a person will live or be executed based on misinformation or wholly inadequate information,"" Alcala concluded in her dissent. Questions over execution drug mixes . Campbell's attorneys have also challenged the method by which Texas intends to execute Campbell. The constitutionality of lethal injection drugs and drug cocktails has made headlines since last year, when European manufacturers -- including Denmark-based Lundbeck, which manufactures pentobarbital -- banned U.S. prisons from using their drugs in executions. Many states were left to find new drug protocols. Campbell's defense cites last month's botched execution in Oklahoma, in which a three-drug cocktail was used to to try to put to death convicted murderer Clayton Lockett. The provenance of the drugs was shielded by Oklahoma law. Lockett reportedly twitched, spoke and writhed in pain for about 40 minutes before dying of a massive heart attack. Death row inmate Charles Warner was scheduled to die in Oklahoma the same day, but the execution was postponed. The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals last week extended the stay until November 13. ""We are very pleased that the (attorney general) agrees at least 6 months is necessary before any execution in Oklahoma can take place, given the need for a full investigation to be conducted into Clayton Lockett's agonizing botched execution, and the Department of Corrections' own recognition that protocol revisions and extensive retraining are necessary,"" Warner's attorney, Madeline Cohen, said. In Campbell's case, Texas intends to use pentobarbital, and Campbell's lawyers point out that the drug is no longer available in regulated form and can be obtained only via so-called ""compounding pharmacies,"" which operate outside of U.S. Food and Drug Administration oversight. Arguing Lockett was ""subjected to a torturous execution that undeniably violated his Eighth Amendment"" rights, the defense says that pentobarbital also poses concerns after Oklahoma inmate Michael Lee Wilson complained during a January execution, ""I feel my whole body burning."" Texas' Jose Luis Villegas also complained of a burning sensation during his April execution, and he was executed ""using compounded pentobarbital from the same batch intended for Mr. Campbell,"" the defense's appeal says. Campbell's attorneys say Texas' refusal to disclose the ""source, efficacy and potency"" of the drug raises issues similar to those in Oklahoma. It's not about which drugs are used, Campbell's defense wrote in its appeal, but about the transparency of the entire process.

"(CNN) -- The United States and its allies are facing ""an absolute defeat"" against the Taliban in Afghanistan even if additional troops are sent, according to a message purportedly from the Taliban's elusive leader, Mullah Mohammed Omar.

""You and your allies are facing an absolute defeat, and nothing will change that even if you send more troops, no matter what your strategies are, because the logic of force will have no impact on the mujahedeen and you will never be able to control the Afghan people by physical force or by your satanic hypocrisy,"" the transcript says. CNN could not independently confirm the authenticity of the report, which appeared in Arabic and in Pashtun. The transcript continued: ""Let it be known that your hostile policies have created a new world of enemies who will fight against you, and the earth is narrowing around you and you will always live the life of all bitterness and sorrow, because the policy of force and tyranny cannot and will not be accepted by anyone.""

"(CNN) -- Texas and Oklahoma suffered through their warmest months on record as persistent heat scorched central and eastern states from May to July. Temperatures averaged 88.9 degrees in Oklahoma -- the warmest monthly statewide average temperature ever recorded -- and 87.1 degrees in Texas, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said Monday. The heat wave resulted in the fourth-warmest July on record for the United States. In Dallas, temperatures exceed 100 degrees for 30 of July's 31 days. And there was no relief in sight. Temperatures are forecast to remain high in Texas and Oklahoma through the end of the week. Parts of the two states could cool off by the weekend, but temperatures are likely creep back up by next Monday. If temperatures continue to hit 100 degrees or more by Saturday, Dallas will have set a record -- becoming the first city to mark 43 consecutive days of temperatures above 100 degrees. Residents of nearby Kemp, Texas, were reeling from no water in the midst of the wretched heat. As temperatures soared to the triple-digits for the 37th consecutive day Sunday, city officials made an emergency decision to shut off the town's water supply. ""Right now our water towers have no water in them at all,"" said Mayor Donald Kile. ""According to the weather forecast we got no relief coming. We're believing and we're praying for rain."" In the meantime, Kile said the water supply could remain shut off for days while the towers refill. A combination of high water demand and old pipes caused major ruptures along waterlines and forced the city to resort to emergency procedures, Kile said. The city will continue to provide bottled water to residents at city hall until the water supply is restored.  But for Kay Bloomfield, 57, it was not enough. ""I've got two grandkids I had to bathe in the sink in there!"" she told CNN affiliate WFAA-TV. ""It's a necessity, you have to have water.""

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A Los Angeles inventor who photographed Michael Jackson 33 years ago hopes those images will now help launch an electric motor he claims could solve the world's energy problems. Reginald Garcia will use cash from the sale of 130 unpublished Jackson photos to fund testing of the motor, which he claims generates more electricity than it uses. Garcia is in the process of getting the photos appraised and prepared for sale. The photos show a 19-year-old Jackson and his brothers during a video shoot at a Hollywood studio in March 1978, before he began changing his appearance with surgery. The Afro hair style and 1970s clothing show ""a rare glance"" of Jackson in an ""awkward teenage stage,"" an image that he personally tried to bury in later years, according to a collector who sold photographs to the singer. ""If it was an image he didn't like, he was more likely to buy them than if they were images he did like,"" said Keya Morgan. ""Were he alive now, I would definitely go to him and I'm sure he would want to buy them."" With Jackson gone, Morgan's Keya Gallery is buying the image copyrights and helping Reginald Garcia sell the original slides, prints and contact sheets that have been forgotten on his shelf for decades. Garcia pulled the box of photos out of his closet last month when he was looking for ways to finance testing of his ""self-generating"" motor, Garcia said in a CNN interview this week. ""He was the greatest guy you could ever talk to,"" Garcia said of his day with Jackson. Garcia was a student at California Tech and a freelance photographer when a friend of his sister's, who worked for CBS Records, asked him to take pictures of the Jacksons at Gower Studios in Hollywood, he said. The color photos show the Jackson 5 dressed in blue tuxedos, singing on a soundstage. The black-and-white images were taken during breaks in the video shoot, Garcia said. ""I sat him in front of a mirror and shot some photos, and I said 'act like you're reading a letter like you just got from your girl,'"" he said. The result was a photo showing Jackson and his reflection in a dressing room mirror. Garcia said he only recently realized it echoes the singer's later hit ""Man in the Mirror."" Garcia and business partner David Marohnic brought his photos and the prototype of his invention to CNN's Los Angeles bureau to demonstrate the engine and talk about their plans. ""What we're essentially looking for is trying to take the photos that Reggie took of Michael Jackson, his legacy, use those funds to try to take our prototype to the market and ultimately clean up the environment and use less greenhouse gases as a result of a motor that's very highly efficient,"" Mahronic said. The motor buzzed as two voltage meters measured the energy going in and the power flowing out, back to the battery. ""It's generating more energy recharging the battery than it actually draws from the battery,"" Marohnic said. Garcia reconfigured the brushes and rewound the copper in a standard motor ""so it captures the negative electromagnetic field as it collapses, sends energy to a capacitor and recharges the battery,"" he said. The sale of the Jackson photographs will allow them ""to certify that the prototype does everything that we say it's going to do,"" Marohnic said. ""It's written in the stars,"" Garcia said. ""We have a destiny of a greener earth, a door opening today that should lead us to this clean earth.""","Reginald Garcia just rediscovered his March 1978 photos of the Jackson 5 .

"(CNN) -- PepsiCo is ending its relationship with rapper Lil Wayne over what the company calls an ""offensive reference to a revered civil rights icon"" -- 14-year-old Emmett Till, who was killed nearly 60 years ago. The rap superstar, featured in the song ""Karate Chop"" by Future, says: ""Beat that p---- up like Emmett Till."" Till, a 14-year-old black youth, was killed in Mississippi in 1955 for allegedly whistling at a white woman. He was beaten to the extent that his face was unrecognizable when his body was discovered. He was identified by a monogrammed ring belonging to his father. Mountain Dew, a brand of PepsiCo, said Friday its relationship with the rapper would end. A Mountain Dew spokesman told CNN, ""We do not plan any additional work with Lil Wayne moving forward. His offensive reference to a revered civil rights icon does not reflect the values of our brand."" The spokesman declined to comment on the company's previous relationship with the artist. Sarah Cunningham, publicist for Lil Wayne's record label, Young Money, issued the following statement to CNN: ""I can confirm that due to creative differences, we mutually decided to part ways. It was amicable."" Till, a Chicago teenager who was visiting relatives in Mississippi in 1955, was arrested at gunpoint and severely beaten. One of his eyes was gouged before he was killed by a single gunshot to the head. The teen's body was tied to a large fan before being dumped into a river. Members of the Till family could not be reached for comment Friday by CNN, but the Rev. Al Sharpton said he has set up a meeting next week between PepsiCo officials and members of the family. In a statement to CNN, Sharpton said that the situation was a ""teaching moment for Lil Wayne, corporate America and the family of Emmett Till ... more than a condemnation of any one artist, it is an affirmation of Emmett Till and a call for more sensitivity about what we say and do in our culture.""","Lil Wayne's lyrics include what PepsiCo calls an ""offensive reference"" to Emmett Till .

"(CNN) -- Pakistani Taliban factions and their allies have set up a council of elders in hopes of coordinating efforts against NATO troops in Afghanistan, a spokesman said Monday. The five participating factions, including the Taliban branch led by Hakimullah Mehsud and the militant Haqqani network, announced the move in a leaflet circulated in the Pakistani tribal district of North Waziristan over the weekend. The council's creation was spurred by fugitive Afghan Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar, who urged the Pakistani Taliban and associated jihadist groups to put aside their internal disputes and work together to battle the U.S.-led alliance across the border, Pakistani Taliban spokesman Ihsanullah Ihsan told CNN. 15 killed in Pakistan explosions near Afghanistan . Ihsan told CNN that Omar had sent three of his representatives to Pakistan to urge the jihadist movements there to put aside their differences and work together to attack coalition forces in Afghanistan. Ihsan said the insurgents would start moving across the mountainous border in March. The Taliban ruled most of Afghanistan before the U.S.-led invasion that followed the September 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington. The fundamentalist Islamic militia was quickly turned out of power but regrouped in the countryside and has been battling NATO troops and the Western-backed government in Kabul ever since. The leaflet announcing the council calls for an immediate halt to the killings and kidnappings of innocent people. But the Pakistani Taliban will keep fighting Pakistani security forces as long as their attacks on the Taliban continue, Ihsan said.

"Washington (CNN) -- It's the punchline of a joke no one bothered to write the set-up for: Warren Buffett's secretary pays a higher tax rate than he does. It's a joke about the fishnet our tax code turns into when it snares a golden snapper instead of a few million sardines, a joke about the kind of man who still employs a person he refers to as his ""secretary"" in 2012 and a joke about a rich guy who allegedly cares enough about his secretary's tax rate that he'll get behind a government effort to raise his taxes but can't bring himself to call her an executive assistant. And it's now the punchline on which the Obama administration decided to rest its efforts to increase taxes on the wealthy in an election year. What was one semi-faceless woman on the other side of the mahogany doors of Buffett's office is now a road show featuring four wealthy Obama donors and their (at least in some press accounts) still-nameless assistants story. No one called them ""secretaries,"" though. The word ""secretary"" conjures up images of a bygone era, of pearls and sweater sets, sensible heels and knee-length skirts, and the right mixture of efficiency and self-effacement to fade into the background while acting as a powerful man's right hand. Perhaps that -- and the plethora of lawyers in the city limits -- is why the phrase ""Warren Buffett's secretary"" didn't strike any odd notes in Washington even as most of the rest of the country would consider the word consigned to the same heap containing ""stewardess,"" ""love child"" and ""going steady."" In 2012, we don't celebrate Secretaries' Day; we celebrate Administrative Professionals Day. We have -- when we have administrative support at all, which is increasingly rare in the post-recession hyper-productive economy -- administrative assistants, executive assistants or (if you're a celebrity) personal assistants. And while it probably goes without saying that at least a few still fetch coffee for the higher-ups, a fair number of administrative and executive assistants would probably look askance at a boss who asked them to stop answering phones, planning for meetings and dealing with the time-consuming minutiae of keeping an office functioning to do a personal task like that. Plus, in the modern economy, there's no longer a secretarial pool: More likely, a group of employees and managers will be pooled together to use the resources of one administrative assistant, who then gets to juggle not only their work demands but their desire to have their demands met before those of their colleagues. If you bring five different people coffee on demand, that's less assisting one's supervisors and more waiting on them. At its core, being an assistant -- or an administrative professional -- is framed as a career upgrade, even if many of the tasks are essentially the same: It's a way of acknowledging the importance of administrative work and support to the success of many projects and even many people. A secretary served one boss -- and it's the service nature of that categorization that perhaps rubs us the wrong way nowadays -- with both professional tasks and more than a few personal ones. ""Administrative professional"" denotes strictly professional assistance; ""secretary"" still holds the connotation of ""work wife."" The phrase ""Warren Buffett's secretary"" sounds strange. Are we supposed to conjure up a modern-day Joan Holloway, Doralee Rhodes, the ""sweet"" and loyal Maria of the R.B. Greaves song or the stern, all-knowing mother-figure of an assistant? Do they still get coffee, buy gifts for relatives, even take dictation? And how does Buffett's ""secretary"" feel about being the invisible half of his political punchline-turned-policy? If nothing else, Debbie Bosanek -- who, despite having a real name, is still known to the world as ""Warren Buffett's secretary"" -- seems to have a sense of humor about the whole thing. Though, when conservative commentators take her limited role in the fight to raise rich people's taxes seriously enough that they decided to speculate that she is too rich to be the poster child for the downtrodden, she'd have to be amused, if she wasn't going to get annoyed. It's probably not the first time that her boss' needs have trumped her personal desires, and at least it netted her a seat at the State of the Union. But it's interesting that, even in the wake of the Occupy movement calling for more attention to be paid to income inequality, the legislation is still called the Buffett Rule. The rule designed to even the playing field by putting Buffett's taxes on Bosanek's scale isn't called the Bosanek Rule or the Secretaries' Rule. It makes no obvious reference to the people to whom Buffett is to be made more equal. Instead, it's the Buffett Rule. It's about him; it concerns him; it affects him; it takes his name. Bosanek will probably go back to being the anonymous secretary of the story (if she hasn't already done so), and the legislation inspired by Buffett's epiphany about her unequal tax rate will get named after him. Even when legislation is intended to ding the 1%, it still bears their name, and it's still with the permission of at least some of them -- whether it be Buffett or the four donors with whom Obama shared the stage this week -- that it's even on the political agenda. It's not getting pushed because Bosanek deserves it but because Buffett thinks she deserves it. After all, that's what secretaries do: They fade into the background. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Megan Carpentier.","Megan Carpentier: Political discussion revolves around ""Warren Buffett's secretary""
She says the word ""secretary"" conjures up images of a bygone era, of pearls and sweater sets .

"Washington (CNN) -- The arrest of a key Afghan Taliban leader represents a setback for the militant group but won't directly affect the fighting in Afghanistan, a senior U.S. military official said. Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, the military leader of the Afghan Taliban, was captured recently in Karachi, Pakistan, a development called a major success for the United States and a blow to the Taliban. Baradar and Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar are said to have orchestrated the Taliban's military activities from Quetta, Pakistan. The U.S. official said Tuesday that Baradar and the rest of the Afghan Taliban leadership in Quetta have provided ""overall strategic direction"" to their fighters but not ""tactical control"" over their actions, so there will be little effect on Operation Moshtarak, a major offensive against the Taliban in the Marjah area of Helmand province.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Signs of oil and gas have been found by a Chinese rig that was drilling off a disputed island chain in the South China Seas, according to Chinese state media. The drilling area does have the basic conditions and potential for oil exploration, Wang Zhen, deputy director of CNPC Policy Research Office, told Xinhua. The drilling operation, known as the Zhongjiannan Project, was completed on July 15, according to the China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC). The state-owned energy company will further analyze the collected geological data before announcing their next steps. When China dispatched the oil rig on May 2 to begin drilling near the Paracel Islands in the South China Seas, the move kicked off a series of confrontations between Chinese and Vietnamese vessels in the area. Both nations claim ownership over the chain China refers to as the Xisha islands. Rioting . Clashes at sea sparked violent anti-Chinese riots on land. Thousands of Chinese nationals had to be evacuated from Vietnam in mid-May as the demonstrations turned deadly. In the face of Vietnam's ferocious protests, Beijing has stood its ground on its claim over the Paracels. China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Hong Lei emphasized this on Wednesday. ""The Xisha Islands are integral parts of China. The operation by the Chinese company is located in indisputable coastal waters of the Xisha (Paracel) Islands, which falls well within China's sovereignty,"" said Hong. Xinhua also reported that 13 Vietnamese fishermen previously arrested by the Chinese coastguard were deported on Tuesday. The fishermen were accused of operating illegally in Chinese waters off the coast of Hainan Province. Vietnam continues to reject China's claims to the Paracels, calling recent drilling activities ""illegal"" and in violation of international law. According to CNOOC, a third of China's oil and gas resources are under the South China Sea, most of which it claims as its own, refuting rival claims from Vietnam, the Philippines, Taiwan, Malaysia, and Brunei.","China completed a drilling operation near the Paracel Islands between May 2 and July 15 .

"Washington (CNN) -- Gen. David Petraeus on Wednesday issued a new ""tactical directive"" for forces in Afghanistan that emphasizes guidance for the use of force by troops operating in the country. ""We must continue -- indeed, redouble -- our efforts to reduce the loss of innocent civilian life to an absolute minimum,"" the directive states in part. ""Every Afghan civilian death diminishes our cause. If we use excessive force or operate contrary to our counterinsurgency principles, tactical victories may prove to be strategic setbacks."" The directive states that before firing, the commander authorizing a strike must determine that there are no civilians present. If the status of civilians is unknown, firing is prohibited except when certain types of risk to troops exist. In another unclassified portion of the document, Petraeus states, ""Protecting the Afghan people does require killing, capturing, or turning the insurgents. Indeed, as I noted earlier, we must pursue the Taliban tenaciously. But we must fight with great discipline and tactical patience."" According to the directive, some civilian casualties result from misunderstandings or ignorance of local customs or behaviors. To reduce that, NATO forces partner with Afghan troops in their operations. Petraeus stressed the importance of these partnerships, saying that he expects every operation and patrol to be partnered. ""(Afghan troop's) presence will ensure greater situational awareness. It will also serve to alleviate anxiety on the part of the local population and build confidence in Afghan security forces,"" the directive states. Most of the directive is classified. U.S. and coalition military officials told CNN that that Petraeus was not expected to reverse existing directives issued by the previous commander, Gen. Stanley McChrystal, but instead characterized the new directive as a clarification of the rules he put into place emphasizing protection of civilians on the battlefield. The directive does that by spelling out more clearly under what circumstances units must get permission to launch attacks to defend themselves. Troops were awaiting the directive with some anticipation. Some troops on the ground complained about the McChrystal directives, saying they unduly hampered troops from defending themselves in favor of protecting civilian populations. Those McChrystal directives limited the use of airstrikes, night raids and other firepower against civilians. In Wednesday's directive, Petraeus notes that this order, as with the previous directive, does not prevent use of force in self-defense. At his confirmation hearing last month to take command in Afghanistan, Petraeus explained a tactical directive is ""designed to guide the employment, in particular, of large casualty-producing devices, bombs, close air support, attack helicopters, and so forth."" The concern, however, is that implementation has been uneven, leading some units to be overly restrictive. ""We have to be absolutely certain that the implementation of the tactical directive and the rules of engagement is even throughout the force,"" Petraeus said, ""that there are not leaders at certain levels that are perhaps making this more bureaucratic or more restrictive than necessary when our troops and our Afghan partners are in a tough spot. And when they are in a tough spot, it's a moral imperative that we use everything we have to ensure that they get out of it."" Petraeus made clear he is aware of the troop's worries. ""I am keenly aware of concerns by some of our troopers on the ground about the application of our rules of engagement and the tactical directive. They should know that I will look very hard at this issue."" On Sunday, Petraeus issued a more general, public list of guidelines for counterinsurgency warfare in which he urged American troops and the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force to learn and adapt to the culture of Afghanistan while battling the Taliban insurgents and their allies. While Petraeus called on the troops to ""pursue the enemy relentlessly"" and ""seek out and eliminate"" insurgents who threaten Afghan civilians, he also urged coalition forces to fight ""with discipline"" and be careful to avoid civilian casualties. Petraeus' directive comes shortly after the Taliban released its own directive late last month. That directive, from Mullah Omar, called for insurgents to avoid harming civilians. In a news release Wednesday, the International Security Assistance Force said that despite Mullah Omar's call, 43 Afghan civilians have been killed and 65 injured by insurgents since the directive came out. The casualties included five children who were killed in Kandahar on Monday by a suicide bomber, ISAF said. Others were killed by improvised explosive devices. ""Mullah Omar's new directive has done nothing to protect the Afghan people from further harm,"" said Brig. Gen. Josef Blotz, ISAF spokesman. ""This is either a smokescreen to repair the Taliban's well-earned reputation for brutality, or insurgent groups are simply ignoring their leader. In either event, the Afghan people will continue to suffer from oppression and indiscriminate violence until the insurgents are defeated.""

"(CNN) -- Former South African leader Nelson Mandela remained in intensive care Monday, two days after he was hospitalized with a recurring lung infection. The increasingly frail Mandela was rushed to a hospital in Pretoria on Saturday. Later in the day, the South African president's office said the 94-year-old former leader was in a ""serious but stable condition."" He was breathing on his own and his wife was by his side, the office said at the time. After offering no updates for 48 hours, the government said Monday that Mandela's condition was ""unchanged."" Meanwhile, his daughter Zenani Dlamini, who is the South African ambassador to Argentina, has flown back to South Africa to be with her father. Mandela has been in and out of hospitals in recent years. Each episode has sparked concerns worldwide. South Africa: Following Nelson Mandela . 'We will release him' On Sunday, South Africans offered prayers at church services, and well-wishes poured in for Mandela from across the world. Meanwhile, the front page of South Africa's Sunday Times read, ""It's time to let him go."" The paper quoted Mandela's longtime friend Andrew Mlangeni as saying that the time may have come for South Africans to say goodbye to the beloved icon. ""You have been coming to the hospital too many times. Quite clearly you are not well and there is a possibility you might not be well again,"" Mlangeni told the paper. ""Once the family releases him, the people of South Africa will follow. We will say thank you, God, you have given us this man, and we will release him too,"" Mlangeni said. History of ailments . South Africa's first black president gets round-the-clock care, and his house is fitted with medical equipment that mirrors that of an intensive care unit. His history of lung problems dates to when he was a political prisoner on Robben Island during apartheid, and he has battled respiratory infections over the years. Last year, he spent Christmas holidays undergoing treatment for a lung infection and gallstones, one of his longest hospital stays since his release from prison in 1990. Considered the founding father of South Africa's democracy, Mandela became an international figure while enduring 27 years in prison for fighting against apartheid, the country's system of racial segregation. ""He has taught us ... that we enhance our own humanity when we serve and make a difference to other people's lives,"" presidential spokesman Mac Maharaj said. ""It's easy to serve oneself, own interests, but serving the interests of others, making their lives better changes the quality of all humanity.""

"(CNN) -- A town engulfed by fighting in South Sudan remained tense Thursday as peacekeepers and police deployed patrols and ""a significant number"" of people who had fled to safety stayed at a U.N. base, officials said. The discord erupted in Wau, the capital of Western Bahr el-Ghazal state in the newly independent country. The violence reflects the growing pains of the new nation, which became independent from Sudan last year. The unrest started last week after a decision to switch the seat of the local government headquarters from Wau to nearby Bagarre stirred anger, government spokesman Barnaba Marial Benjamin told reporters in the national capital, Juba, on Thursday. Security forces killed 10 people amid rioting. Demonstrators attacked a bank and others businesses Saturday and Sunday, he said. Relatives of those killed abducted 28 farmers thought to be aligned with the state government, Benjamin said. The discovery of the bodies of six of the farmers spurred more violence Wednesday. There was no official word on the number of people killed Wednesday. It is believed at least two people died in the violence, but some news outlets reported higher tolls. Peacekeepers with the U.N. Mission in South Sudan saw fires and a few hundred young people carrying sticks, spears and machetes, U.N. officials said. The mission deployed peacekeepers and armored personnel carriers to secure Wau's airport and patrol in and around the city. About 5,000 people, mostly women and children, escaped the fighting and sought protection at a local base of the U.N. mission in Wau, officials said. ""Earlier today, many of those who sought U.N. protection and stayed overnight left the base to inspect their homes -- a significant number of civilians, mainly women, children and the elderly, remain in the U.N. base and continue to be protected,"" said U.N. spokesman Eduardo Del Buey at U.N. headquarters in New York. ""The U.N. mission continues to safeguard the airport and has conducted patrols to assess the situation in the city and affected outlying settlements,"" Del Buey told journalists. ""The mission is also redeploying additional peacekeepers to Wau in order to assist in the protection of civilians."" Del Buey said the U.N. Mission in South Sudan is urging authorities and community leaders to ""exercise restraint and engage in peaceful dialogue in order to prevent a further deterioration of the fragile situation."" Peacekeepers are working closely with South Sudan -- which has sent more police to Wau and is investigating the violence, officials said. South Sudan is the world's newest country. It became independent six years after the signing of a peace deal that ended the war between northern and southern Sudan.

"Austin, Texas (CNN) -- The past month has been the worst for the United States in Afghanistan since the war began after the attacks of September 11, 2001. There have been more difficult periods of combat against the Taliban, al Qaeda and other insurgents. There have been more fragmented and confused moments in allied strategy. There has, however, never been a time when American soldiers acted with such obvious and offensive disrespect for Afghan citizens. The past month has witnessed a string of incidents, including the alleged killing of 16 civilians by a U.S. soldier and the burning of Qurans, the holiest touchstone of the Islamic faith, at a NATO air base. The United States has crossed a self-defeating threshold in Afghanistan where our soldiers are seen as attacking the very people and culture they are deployed to protect. We are destroying villages in order to save them. We have witnessed this dynamic before. In early 1968, it became apparent that American soldiers in South Vietnam were fighting a stubborn communist enemy without the support they expected from South Vietnamese citizens. To the contrary, residents of South Vietnam frequently gave assistance to the insurgents killing Americans. Frustrated and desperate, particularly after the Tet Offensive in January 1968, American soldiers took the war to the population with devastating consequences. Counterinsurgency warfare meant burning rural villages, bombing crowded areas and killing innocent civilians. The My Lai massacre of March 16, 1968, was the most notorious example, but it was not unique. After failing to catch insurgents who fled the village, angry American soldiers killed more than 300 women, children and elderly residents in cold blood. The United States was massacring the same South Vietnamese it was fighting to save. We do not know what motivated the American soldier who is accused of going house-to-house, murdering Afghan families, on Sunday. Based on the patterns of the past month, the question arises: Was he acting in ways that echo My Lai? The U.S. military might be the strongest fighting force in the world, but it is still a collection of emotional and fragile human beings who react to the circumstances, pressures and incentives around them. As in Southeast Asia more than 40 years ago, the American soldiers in Afghanistan are fighting a war against an elusive enemy amidst a population that is increasingly resistant to American demands for assistance. Afghan citizens know that the United States is planning to leave soon, and they sense that the Americans they meet care more about an ""exit strategy"" than the welfare of their society. Afghan intransigence furthers the frustration and resentment among American soldiers, fueling violent behavior directed at innocent civilians. This self-defeating cycle reflects specific policies. President Barack Obama has acknowledged the corrupt Afghan leadership of Hamid Karzai, but he is doing nothing serious about it. The U.S. government has told its more than 80,000 troops in Afghanistan that they must help create a stable and secure Afghan nation, despite rampant corruption, in less than a year. Young American soldiers are under enormous pressure, in hostile circumstances, and they are increasingly isolated from support networks within the United States. For all the talk of ""supporting the troops,"" the Afghanistan war receives little serious attention in American public debate. Obama rarely mentions the war, and his Republican challengers say little about it either. The American soldiers in Afghanistan are under orders to do the impossible at light speed, and they are ignored by their fellow citizens. We have re-created the conditions of extreme stress, isolation and victimization that were evident in Vietnam. We have turned a frustrating war into a breeding ground for American atrocities. This is what happens when our national leaders try to fight a war and exit a war at the same time. We cannot do both. Our soldiers cannot build a functioning nation when they are told that we are not doing nation-building. They cannot defeat an enemy when we refuse to engage fully. They cannot work peacefully with local citizens when they are told that local citizens are the problem. The choice is not to use more firepower or withdraw. The real choice is whether the United States is committed sufficiently to Afghanistan and willing to invest in supporting long-term efforts that will give our soldiers and local citizens a reason to believe that things will get better. If the United States is unwilling to make these commitments, then it should admit it and reduce the demands on its soldiers. Either way, Americans must create a realistic basis for their activities in Afghanistan and end the fiction of a smooth transfer of authority from our overburdened soldiers to Karzai's corrupt administrators. Realism will not please many Americans, but it will at least help to reduce the cycle of atrocities in Afghanistan. The time has come to escape the worst dynamics of Vietnam and re-learn the limits of American power.

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistani security forces killed a key Taliban commander and 20 other suspected militants in northwest Pakistan, two military officials told CNN Wednesday. The military operation targeted militant hideouts and training facilities in the Shaikhan area of Orakzai Agency, one of seven semiautonomous tribal districts near the Afghan border, the officials said Wednesday. Security forces destroyed the headquarters of Mullah Toofan and Pakistan Taliban Commander Moinud Din in attacks on four targets in Sheikhan and Samana Bazaar at midnight, a security official said. The officials, who were not named because they are not allowed to speak to media on the subject, said Din was a senior Taliban leader in Orakzai Agency. In addition, at least 15 Pakistani soldiers were killed and 14 others were wounded Tuesday when militants attacked security force check points in Pakistan's southwestern province Balochistan, a paramilitary force representative said. Dozens of armed men attacked check points with heavy weapons in areas in Quetta, the provincial capital of Balochistan province, said Murtaza Baig, the spokesman. The soldiers were deployed in the mountains to guard rich coal reserves in the area, Baig said. The exchange of fire between the security forces and the militants lasted several hours in nearby mountains. Separatists and other armed militants groups, who want more autonomy and shares in natural reserves for their province, have been targeting security forces personnel in recent years.

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Afghanistan endured an unusually bloody day Tuesday, with three separate attacks leaving at least 47 people dead and at least 145 wounded, according to government and police officials. At least 29 people died and 110 were injured in a series of attacks Tuesday afternoon in Zaranj, the capital of the southwestern Afghan province of Nimruz, a government spokesman said. In northeastern Afghanistan, a bomb blast at a bazaar in Kunduz province killed 10 civilians, while a Taliban ambush in Badakhshan killed a district government chief and three police officers, according to police officials. The attacks made Tuesday among the bloodiest days in Afghanistan so far this year. Shootings by Afghan forces take growing toll on NATO troops . Gen. John R. Allen, commander of the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force, said the bomb attacks were the work of Taliban insurgents and called on Taliban leader Mullah Omar to ""rein in his murderers."" ""What we saw today were further acts of intentional mass murder,"" he said. ""By targeting innocent civilians in populated areas, the insurgents have again shown they will kill non-combatants without hesitation to advance their backward looking plans for Afghanistan."" The first in a series of apparent suicide bomb attacks in Zaranj hit a government gas station, killing and injuring some people, provincial government spokesman Omar Baluch said. There were a total of six suicide bombers. After those victims had been evacuated to a hospital, a second bomb exploded there, causing more injuries and deaths, including some who had been injured in the initial attack, Baluch said. Police shot two other attackers dead after they used hand grenades in attacks against various targets. Security forces in the province arrested three other bombers who were planning attacks, Baluch said. Sporadic gunfire could still be heard inside the city Tuesday evening, he added. The U.S. military was expected to evacuate nine of the injured to a military hospital in neighboring Helmand province, Baluch said. The ambush that killed the government chief of Sheghnan district and three officers happened Tuesday afternoon in Badakhshan province in northeastern Afghanistan. The attack happened in neighboring Baharak district, which lies between Sheghnan and the provincial capital of Faizabad, Rasekh said. And in Kunduz, Dashte Archi district chief Shaikh Sadruddin said a motorcycle bomb exploded in a crowded bazaar, killing 14 civilians and wounding 35 others. Children were among the casualties, Sadruddin said. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attacks in Zaranj and Dashte Archi, but Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid claimed responsibility for the Badakhshan ambush in an e-mail sent to reporters. The attacks come one day after police arrested two other would-be attackers in Nimruz.","NATO commander in Afghanistan calls on Taliban leader to ""rein in his murderers""

"(CNN) -- Qatar, as diplomats say, likes to ""punch above its weight."" This arid peninsula in the Persian Gulf is smaller than Connecticut but played a leading role in helping Libyan rebels oust Moammar Gadhafi and has been at the heart of Arab League sanctions against Syria. It's now facilitating talks on the Afghan conflict by allowing the Taliban to open a liaison office in its capital, Doha. Qatar is also home to the pan-Arab news channel Al Jazeera, a thorn in the side of many Arab regimes past and present. It is a major player in the energy industry, with vast reserves of natural gas, and -- perhaps in an effort to outflank Dubai as the playground of the Gulf -- is due to host the soccer World Cup in 2022. It helps that the emirate is fabulously wealthy, with the highest per-capita gross domestic product in the world. It can fund ambitious initiatives -- to help fund the Palestinian Authority, for example, or provide cash and weapons to the Libyan rebels. Now it's exploiting long-held ties with the Taliban to provide a platform between the group and the international community, and especially the United States. Will Taliban's Qatar address change dynamics of Afghan conflict? As far back as 2001, before the group was ousted in Afghanistan, the Qataris hosted Taliban delegations. And in the past year, thanks to its hyperactive diplomacy under Prime Minister (and Foreign Minister) Hamid bin Jassim Al-Thani, the emirate has emerged as a regional power broker -- to the consternation of its larger neighbor, Saudi Arabia. Qatar's growing dynamism within the Arab League has been most evident amid the unrest in Libya and Syria. It was one of two Arab states to play a role in enforcing the no-fly zone over Libya. And according to journalists in western Libya last spring, Qatari advisers were working with Libyan rebels in the Nafusa Mountains as well as supplying anti-tank missiles and other weaponry to rebel forces in the east. In November, Qatar forged a package of sanctions against the regime of Bashar al-Assad that was adopted by the Arab League, provoking an attack on its embassy in Damascus and the withdrawal of the Qatari ambassador. It lobbied other Arab states hard, telling them that effective Arab action was required to avoid ""foreign interference"" in Syria. Qatar was also ready to use the power of the purse with Syria by canceling projects there. As part of intensive efforts to build a relationship with the United States, Qatar has allowed U.S. forces to use the al-Udeid air base for operations in Iraq, Afghanistan and Somalia. It also hosts the forward headquarters of the U.S. Central Command. Over the past 10 years, Qatar has also offered to be the go-between in Iran for successive U.S. administrations. According to a 2006 U.S. diplomatic cable, Foreign Minister Al-Thani told a U.S. official, with some pride: ""Qatar talks to Iran as an equal, and this is important."" The two countries are joined at the hip, as they share vast natural gas reserves under the Gulf. And it is a principle of Qatari diplomacy that it will cultivate groups that won't talk to each other -- Hamas and Iran as well as Washington. Qatar also offered to help the United States improve relations with Sunni tribal leaders in Iraq at the height of the insurgency there. The emir, Hamad Bin Khalifa Al-Thani, and his family drive Qatari policy and have proved themselves agile negotiators with a grasp of the intricacies of Middle East politics. U.S. diplomatic cables describe Qatari officials as well-prepared with a detailed understanding of the nuances of their complex neighborhood. The Arab Spring has worked in Qatar's favor. One of the few states where no protests have occurred, it has taken advantage of Saudi caution and upheavals in Egypt and Syria to carve out an assertive regional role. But Qatar's activism generates plenty of resentment. The populism of Al Jazeera has infuriated Arab regimes. The emir fends off complaints about Al Jazeera's reporting, telling CNN's Wolf Blitzer last year: ""Of course it's not necessary I will agree with what Al Jazeera say. Actually, Jazeera caused for me a lot of problems."" Similarly, the Saudis are suspicious of Qatar's open channel with Iran. President Ali Abdullah Saleh of Yemen put an end to Qatari efforts to mediate between his government and Huthi rebels. And President Hamid Karzai recalled the Afghan envoy in Doha in December because he'd been kept in the dark about contacts with the Taliban. But the Al-Thanis are not afraid to ruffle feathers. In the diplomatic world, as one Gulf commentator observed, Qatar is proof that size isn't everything.","Qatar is allowing the Taliban to open a liaison office in its capital .
Gas-rich, Qatar has become a regional power broker .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- A Taliban-affiliated website has released video that purports to show suicide bombers who targeted Kabul's Intercontinental Hotel in June preparing for the attack in the hills and studying a tiny model of the hotel in detail. The video -- released on a Taliban-affiliated website in the past few days -- is an hour long. It includes testimony and footage - -even gymnastics -- from the seven attackers who killed 11 more people when they laid siege to a government conference at the hotel for six hours. The attack -- one of the most brazen and penetrating to hit the capital -- was eventually suppressed by special forces, helicopters and a drone. One of the apparent suicide bombers, Naseer Ahmad Anas, speaks of his motivation to take his own life and that of others. ""My message is life is too short,"" he says. ""You can die of cancer, or a car accident. If you want God's blessing, be a suicide attacker."" CNN cannot prove the authenticity of the elaborate video. The images also show masked and uniformed men training in the hills, the exercises they undertake clearly designed to show they are a more disciplined force than parts of the Taliban have been in the past. In one scene, they appear to attack an Afghan military vehicle, killing the troops and stealing their weapons and uniforms. The footage is undated and the mountainous location where it was shot is unclear. The hotel attackers are also filmed in a room sitting in a circle, surrounding a realistic mock-up of the Intercontinental Hotel. A tutor, whose face and voice are not discernible, offers tactical tips for the assault. ""Those of you with machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades, get on the roof and use it as a control tower, so the enemy can't enter easily."" The video shows footage of the attack obscured by darkness, but the tracer fire of the attackers, and their NATO and Afghan opponents is visible. The attack caused considerable concern in Kabul, the first of several attributed to the Haqqani network that penetrated the capital's so-called Ring of Steel. The video is possibly also the first detailed glimpse of a part of the insurgency that is rapidly becoming America's main opponent here. The Haqqani network, a group of militants active in Afghanistan's east but accused of receiving sanctuary and logistical support in Pakistan, were blamed for the Intercontinental Hotel attack and some observers have suggested the pictures are in fact a rare insight into the network. The insurgent group -- which is linked to the Taliban but often considered a more sophisticated and independent adjunct to it -- has rarely been filmed.","The hour-long video was released on a Taliban-affiliated website .

"Washington (CNN) -- Army Staff Sgt. Robert Bales could be sentenced to death if convicted on any of the 17 counts of murder filed against him Friday for allegedly embarking on a bloody shooting rampage in Afghan villages, the U.S. military said. In addition to the charges of murder ""with premeditation,"" the 38-year-old faces six counts of attempted murder and two counts of assault. Authorities say Bales left a remote outpost in Kandahar province's Panjwai district early March 11 and went house-to-house, gunning down villagers. U.S. and Afghan officials initially said 16 people died in those attacks. Col. Gary Kolb, a spokesman with the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force, on Friday said only that investigators assigned to the case felt they had evidence to charge Bales with 17 counts of murder. There was no immediate indication as to where the other fatality came from, besides the fact it was an an adult, and Afghan government officials in Kabul have said they have no record of another death. Read the charges against Bales (PDF) The six people wounded in the shootings are four children, one woman and one man, according to the charge sheet against Bales. Two of those have been released from a hospital, said Ahmad Javed Faisal, a Kandahar provincial government spokesman. At the minimum, Bales would be sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole if he's convicted on even one of the 17 murder charges, according to a statement from the U.S. Forces-Afghanistan public affairs office. At the maximum, he could face the death penalty. Prosecutors could levy more charges ""as they see fit,"" said a defense official with knowledge of the charges preferred. ""The Army investigators are still working,"" the official said. ""There is no requirement to 'lock in' to certain charges at this point."" Stunned friends recall good deeds of suspect . The Taliban, in an e-mail Friday to CNN, vowed ""strong revenge"" for the attacks and claimed justice won't be served in U.S. courts, which they said ""are not reliable."" The Islamic fundamentalist group, which been battling coalition and Afghan government forces for years, believes that ""tens of American soldiers, and not one person"" are responsible for the killings, according to the message. ""We don't believe in these (American) courts and reject the decision,"" the Taliban said. ""We will take practical revenge on every single American soldier."" Bales, who was returned to the United States last week, is being held at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. Speaking from Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington state, where Bales is assigned, Army Gen. Lloyd Austin called the developments Friday -- in which U.S. military lawyers in Afghanistan ""preferred"" the charges -- ""the first step in a long process that's going to occur."" The case is now in the hands of the special convening authority, Col. Kenneth Kamper from the 17th Fires Brigade. As a I Corps unit leader who is still at Lewis-McChord, Kamper handles courts-martial issues regarding Corps members, according to base spokesman Joe Piek. Bales' case could go straight to an Article 32 hearing -- a military hybrid of a civilian preliminary hearing and a grand jury session that Austin, the Army's vice chief of staff, acknowledged has ""challenges associated with it."" Or Bales could go before a group of mental health experts who would determine whether his mental health may be a factor in his defense. Jeffery King, a military defense lawyer, told CNN on Friday that he expected ""the mental status of ... Bales will be the overriding factor in this case"" -- including both his state of mind at the time of the attack, as well as whether he's mentally competent to stand trial. Eventually, after gathering prosecution and defense testimony, Kamper will recommend what charges should be pursued to a higher-ranking general convening authority, in this case Maj. Gen. Lloyd Miles. As deputy commanding general for I Corps, Miles is taking on this duty while the corps' commanding general, Lt. Gen. Curtis Scaparrotti, is deployed, Piek said. Miles is expected to offer his own recommendation on whether the case should go to trial and, if so, on what charges and whether a death penalty should be a possible sentence. If and when the case comes to trial, Bales' lawyer, John Henry Browne, said, it is going to be ""extremely difficult"" for the prosecution. ""They have no murder scene, no forensics,"" the lawyer said Thursday night outside his Seattle office. ""I'm going to make them prove every claim."" Prosecution faces major hurdles . Military law experts acknowledge that proving the case may be difficult, especially given that there are no autopsies to help prove the cause of death -- in part because those killed were buried quickly, in accordance with Islamic tradition -- and difficulty in getting witnesses to testify. Afghans are insisting that the suspect be returned to Afghanistan to face trial, with villagers and lawmakers questioning the U.S. military's account of what happened. But a military official in Afghanistan has said that Bales will be tried in the United States. Kolb, the ISAF spokesman, said that defense attorneys would need coalition forces' protection if they choose to investigate in Afghanistan. He notes that the Taliban ""has already taken some potshots at Afghan investigators that went to the area."" Still, Kolb said witnesses may not necessarily have to fly to the United States to testify as they could speak via teleconference. And Gary Solis, a former U.S. Marine Corps lawyer and current Georgetown professor, told CNN that any bullet rounds recovered from the scene could be matched with Bales' weapon -- assuming it was ""immediately seized"" -- which would serve as ""powerful evidence for the government."" Suspect has memory loss, lawyer says . Lance Rosen, the lawyer for Bales' wife, Karilyn, said Bales did not surrender to U.S. authorities, as some have reported. Rather, Rosen said, Bales was taken into custody, though he wasn't sure why. Asked about Bales' state of mind, Browne said on ""CBS This Morning"" on Friday that his client hasn't said much in their meetings and appears to have memory problems predating the incident. ""He has some memories about what happened before the alleged event and some memories after the alleged event and some windows here and there into things, but he really doesn't have any memory,"" Browne said. ""He's kind of in shock."" Bales told his wife, in the first of two phone conversations they had since he was detained, that something had happened and he didn't know what it was, according to Rosen. What's the link between violence and disorders? Browne told CBS that ""The Hurt Locker,"" the acclaimed 2008 film about a bomb disposal unit in the Iraq war, is a ""Disney movie compared to what these guys are going through."" ""Just seeing people blown apart ... picking up body parts, putting them in bags,"" he said. ""You know, a lot of servicemen go through that and don't have incidents alleged like this, but it's pretty horrific. We do know he had a concussive head injury, which is serious. We also know it was not treated for a variety of reasons."" Afghan villagers describe massacre's horror . Another member of Bales' defense team, Emma Scanlan, said Friday that she'd spoken recently with Bales, and he is ""holding up."" ""He's concerned about the welfare of his family, first and foremost, and the safety of the people who are on the ground in Afghanistan,"" Scanlan said of the father of two. The massacre has strained already tense U.S.-Afghan relations and intensified a debate about whether to pull American troops ahead of their planned 2014 withdrawal. Afghan President Hamid Karzai has demanded that troops withdraw from villages in his nation and return to their larger bases, saying relations between the two countries are ""at the end of their rope."" Karzai urges U.S. pullback after massacre . CNN legal contributor and defense attorney Paul Callan said on CNN's ""Erin Burnett OutFront"" that he believes prosecutors will seek the death penalty against Bales ""because this is one of the biggest alleged massacres in memory."" ""You have the diplomatic and political problems that are being caused by this crime,"" Callan said. ""Afghan citizens will be looking, saying, 'Is the U.S. seeking justice in this case?' "" But he said that even if prosecutors won a death sentence, it is unlikely that Bales would be executed for years, if not decades. Suspect held liable for financial fraud . Accounts from the military, Bales' family, friends and neighbors describe a man who remained committed to serving his country despite wounds he received during three previous combat tours to Iraq, including a traumatic brain injury suffered during a vehicle accident. But Michael Breen, a former Army captain, said the speculation about whether his injuries or a possible undiagnosed case of post-traumatic stress disorder contributed to Bales' actions is unfair to other veterans. ""Sgt. Bales has been through a lot as a soldier. Many of us have,"" Breen said. ""That is certainly no explanation or excuse for the gross violation of his code of honor, to say the least, and the horrific crimes that he committed."" CNN's Mitra Mobasherat, Sara Sidner, Chris Lawrence, Miguel Marquez and Paul Vercammen contributed to this report.","NEW: A top Army general calls the charges ""the first step in a long process""

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- The Afghan government hopes to hold talks with Taliban representatives in Saudi Arabia in the coming weeks, according to a senior Afghan official, in a move that threatens to cloud already delicate and fragile steps to negotiate an end to the United States' longest war. The senior official, speaking anonymously as he was discussing sensitive diplomatic issues, said there were plans for a meeting between insurgents and Afghan officials in Saudi Arabia. Yet, he added, the plans were at such an early stage that it was not clear who -- including American officials -- would attend or when any talks would be held. The U.S. has acknowledged that it has held discussions about opening a Taliban office in Doha, Qatar, as well as the possibility of transferring some Taliban prisoners held at Guantanamo Bay as part of American support for Afghan reconciliation efforts. ""The principle is that although there is now an agreement -- almost -- to set up an office in Doha, that doesn't necessarily mean that all conversations will take place in Doha,"" the official said. ""We will talk to the same or different individuals (from the insurgency) in a different location. Obviously, Saudi Arabia has been supportive of the recent agenda and has hosted talks in the past. It is likely that we are heading there in the future for meetings."" He said the dates and participants were still being worked out and insisted that any Saudi discussions would feed into the Qatar process. This is ""absolutely not in opposition to the Qatar process,"" he added, calling the talks in that Gulf state ""a very substantive step forward."" Importantly, while the Afghan official was unable to say whether the Americans would attend any talks held in Saudi Arabia, he insisted, ""The U.S. is supportive of the idea. It is far too early to discuss any specifics about this."" The creation of a parallel process to the Qatar talks risks frustrating American efforts to bring the Taliban and Afghan officials together. The current ""talks about talks"" in Doha are the product of months of U.S. efforts to reach out to the insurgency, which came to sudden fruition last month when the Taliban announced that they would support opening an office in their name in Qatar. Officials in President Hamid Karzai's government privately voiced frustration at being excluded from the early stages of this process. They agreed to support it last week, but the announcement of a separate drive in Saudi Arabia will be interpreted by many as an Afghan reminder that they wish to exert overriding influence over any peace process. The official's remarks that they might talk to different insurgents in Saudi Arabia could further create distance between this process and that in Qatar, although the official insisted that was not the intention. The official said the Qatar process could move forward once the Qataris sent a delegation to Kabul to discuss the next steps, adding that he hoped that would be soon. He said that as of now, there were no Afghan government officials in Qatar to support any discussions. ""To fully assume ownership of the Qatar process is important for us,"" the official added. ""We will work in the weeks ahead"" to do that. He said the Americans needed a clear statement from the insurgents, distancing themselves from terrorism, for their role in the Qatar process to move forward and for an office to be established. He said: ""We know and are aware the are Taliban representatives in Doha. There are channels in fact, and we are aware of the presence. What's not yet established is the office."" An American observer with an intimate knowledge of the discussions said, ""What (Karzai) is basically saying is that he is not on board with the Qatar process."" The observer said he did not think American officials had been made aware of the Saudi Arabian process before its announcement and expressed doubts as to how thought-out and organized any Saudi meeting was. ""This doesn't seem really serious. It's more a symptom of Karzai protesting the progress that's been made in Qatar. We don't know if this is real or if the Saudis are on board. It's yet another statement that comes out of Kabul that throws a monkey wrench into the process."" He added that Karzai had blown ""hot and cold"" over reconciling with the Taliban. ""It is frustrating because often the assumption was that it would be difficult to get the Taliban to focus on talks, but actually it's difficult to get Karzai to.""","Most details, such as who and when, remain up in the air .

"Washington (CNN) -- The women talked about it at the gym, caring for their children, over drinks and dinner and in the hallways of Congress. More than 200 Nigerian schoolgirls were gone, kidnapped from their beds by an armed terrorist group, Boko Haram, who vowed to sell them into forced child marriages — all because the young women had dared to seek an education. So, just a few days before Mother's Day, every single woman lawmaker in Congress signed letters urging President Barack Obama to push the U.N. Security Council to add Boko Haram to the al Qaeda Sanctions List. It was a move Rep. Ann Wagner, a Missouri Republican, said would send ""a strong message to the administration and the U.N."" The sanctions would require all member nations to freeze the assets of those affiliated with Boko Haram, an Islamic militant group, and prevent travel through their borders. ""We are mothers, sisters and daughters and we were all feeling helpless and wanted to do something,"" said Rep. Ann Kuster, a New Hampshire Democrat. She worked across the aisle with Wagner over the course of two days last week to get the 79 women in the House to sign the letter. ""It's not that we're going to do this without men, but we are going to speak up and not be silenced,"" Kuster said. They were inspired by the example set earlier that week by Sen. Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, and Sen. Barbara Mikulski, a Maryland Democrat, two veteran lawmakers who got the 20 women in their chamber to sign a similar letter. The message, the women said, was to give voice to the voiceless. And, as female lawmakers, they say their perspective lends a different take on this and other policy issues. ""Symbolically, it is very important that all the women in the House and Senate came together to get the U.S. government to push the U.N. Council on the sanction issue,"" said Jennifer Lawless, director of the Women and Politics Institute at American University. ""It's hard to come up with a better mix to push this forward. It highlights issues that cut across party lines that affect women and girls."" We will not be silenced . Their election to Congress in 2012, with a historic number of women elected to the Senate, made them the largest class of female lawmakers to ever walk the halls of the Hill. Ever since then, the 99 women of the 113th Congress have pushed for changes that political experts say have had an impact both in terms of perception and policy on women and girls. The list of key initiatives is long. • Female lawmakers, such as Wagner, have bills poised to come to the floor next week designed to end what the United Nations estimates is the $9.5 billion human trafficking industry in the United States and also are working on measures aimed at addressing campus sexual assaults. • Mikulski sponsored a paycheck fairness measure in the Senate and when it was blocked last month by Republicans, she lashed out at those who say women are ""too emotional when we talk."" • Rep. Carolyn Maloney, a New York Democrat, and Rep. Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican, have a measure that would create a bipartisan commission to study using private funds to create a National Women's History Museum in Washington. • The women of the Black Congressional Caucus recently pressured the Pentagon to re-examine grooming rules they felt were discriminatory to female troops of color. • Women in both chambers last year helped lead the fight to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act and ensured that language expanded protections to immigrants, Native Americans, gays, lesbians, and transgender individuals. • That same year, Rep. Barbara Lee, D-California and more than a dozen other Democrats put forth a House resolution asking Congress to recognize the disproportionate impact of climate change on women and children in poor nations. • Democratic Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Claire McCaskill of Missouri worked for most of 2013 on competing measures to reform the process for prosecuting military sex assaults. Though headlines tended to focus on fractures within the Senate women's caucus over the two competing measures, the very fact that the two lawmakers were able to raise the profile of the issue is noteworthy, Lawless said. Political fight over military sex assaults divides women senators . • And it was the actions of women, in particular Collins and Sen. Patty Murray, Washington Democrat, as a chief budget negotiator, that helped end last year's government shutdown and helped craft a debt deal. Breaking bread and stalemates . Collins said she remembered sitting in her office one Saturday watching C-SPAN in disgust as lawmakers bickered over the details of a spending plan and whether that plan should, as some in the GOP wanted, defund or whittle away at Obamacare. She pounded out a three-point plan to end the shutdown and went to the Senate floor to plead with fellow lawmakers to let go of partisanship and start negotiating. When she left the floor, her cell phone rang. It was Sen. Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican, offering to help. When the phone rang again, it was Sen. Kelly Ayotte, a New Hampshire Republican. Part of that plan would help form the framework that ended the government shutdown. ""There have been definite strides and we're pleased at seeing progress,"" said Linda Young, president of the National Women's Political Caucus, a nonprofit group which seeks to improve female participation in politics. ""When there are more women at the decision-making table there is a different perspective expressed."" At a gathering hosted by Senate women every six weeks, Mikulski has three rules: no staff, no press and no leaks. The get-togethers, which are often held at a lawmaker's home, are a time for the women to bond outside of the halls of Congress and get to know one another on a personal level. Recently, Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat, hosted the women. Over on the House side, the women try to get to know each other on a personal level. ""We've got our softball team, the gym, we get together for dinner or a cocktail,"" Wagner said. ""We talk about our families and who are as wives, daughters and mothers. You have to reach a humanity level to realize that end of the day we need to come together."" All of that bonding might have an effect on policy, according to research by the University of Virginia. ""Based on scoring all lawmaking activities in the House of Representatives, women in the minority party are one third more effective than men in the minority party,"" said Craig Volden, a public policy and politics professor at the University of Virginia who, along with his team, examined the sponsorship of bills from 1973 to 2008. Volden and his team of researchers have also found that female lawmakers tend to sponsor bills on broader range of policy areas than their male counterpart, and that the ""women's issue"" areas tend to face more gridlock than the ""'men's issue"" areas. 'No room for gridlock' When it comes to the issue of helping rescue the kidnapped Nigerian schoolgirls, female lawmakers say there is no room for gridlock. ""I knew the 20 women of the Senate, standing united and speaking in unison, were in a position to send a very powerful message, one that not only condemns this crime but that also helps spur action to bring these girls back home safely to their families,"" Collins told CNN in a statement. And they will not take ""no"" for an answer. ""We may make some additional calls to the White House,"" Wagner said. ""Just to make sure they understand our position on this going forward.""","A historic number of women were elected to Congress in 2012 .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- An eighth-grade girl was awarded Pakistan's first National Peace Prize Thursday for her online diary reporting on the Taliban's ban on education for girls. Malala Yousufzai, a resident of Swat Valley in northwest Pakistan -- one of the most conservative regions of the country -- wrote about her frustration with the Taliban's restrictions on female education in her town. Using the Internet, she reached out to the outside world, taking a stand by writing about her daily battle with extremist militants who used fear and intimidation to force girls to stay at home. ""I was scared of being beheaded by the Taliban because of my passion for education,"" Yousufzai told CNN. ""During their rule, the Taliban used to march into our houses to check whether we were studying or watching television."" Yousufzai said she used to hide her books under her bed, fearing a house search by the Taliban. Prime Minister Yusuf Raza Gilani announced the award Thursday, which also comes with a 500,000 rupee ($5,780) prize. He directed Pakistan's Cabinet to award the national prize every year to a child younger than 18 who contributes to peace and education in the country, a statement from his office said. Yousufzai, 14, was also one of the five nominees chosen from 42 countries for the International Children's Peace Prize for 2011. That award, presented by Nobel laureate Mairead Maguire Monday, went to 17-year-old Michaela Mycroft of South Africa, for her ""commitment to the rights of children with disabilities,"" a statement from that prize foundation said. The International Children's Peace Prize is awarded annually to a child whose courage and remarkable acts have made a difference in countering problems faced by children around the world. Although Yousufzai didn't win that prize, she said she would still ""fight for girls' education and work toward creating a society where girls can be educated freely."" She also has big plans for the future. ""I want to be a political leader, as this country needs honest and true leaders,"" she told CNN. Swat remained under Taliban control for years until 2009, when the military cleared it in an operation that also sparked the evacuation of thousands of families. Journalist Shaan Khan contributed to this report.","Yousufzai used to hide her books under her bed, fearing a Taliban search .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Authorities in northern Pakistan were looking for 384 inmates who escaped from a prison early Sunday morning after hundreds of Taliban militants raided the facility. The attack took place in the city of Bannu in northwest Pakistan, an area known for a heavy militant presence. Four prison officials were wounded in the attack, which lasted more than two hours, said Iftikhar Khan, a senior police official in the city. Of the 944 prisoners the facility held, 384 escaped, officials said. Among them were 21 high-profile militants, said Iftikhar Hussain, the information minister of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province, where Bannu is located. The attackers apparently were aiming to free a senior Taliban commander, he said, but prison records were destroyed in the attack, and officials were still working to verify the names and crimes of those who escaped. ""This is beyond terrorism. Such an attack challenges the writ of the state,"" Hussain said. Two of the inmates who escaped had been awaiting execution. One, Adnan Rashid, had been found guilty in the attempted murder of former President Pervez Musharraf in 2003. The other, Safi Ullah, was convicted of several bombings in northern Pakistan in recent years, officials said. Authorities were investigating how militants managed to enter the city, Hussain said. ""A soul-searching investigation is underway to answer some big questions,"" he said. ""How were the militants allowed to block routes to the jail before the attack? Why didn't the reinforcements arrive?"" The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack, according to its spokesman Ehsanullah Ehsan. ""We will go where we need to go"" said Ehsan, vowing to continue attacks that would result in the release of other imprisoned Taliban fighters. Journalist Wajahat S.

"(CNN) -- As the family of a late Kansas City Chiefs linebacker pursues a lawsuit against his former employer, claiming that effects of multiple concussions caused Jovan Belcher to kill his girlfriend and himself, we are left to consider a larger legal question: How liable can a negligent employer be for a suicide? Emile Durkheim, the French social psychologist of the early 20th century, observed: . ""Each victim of suicide gives his act a personal stamp which expresses his temperament, the special conditions in which he is involved, and which, consequently, cannot be explained by the social and general causes of the phenomenon."" Culturally, we have long-viewed suicide as the most personal of decisions. The law has mostly followed suit. Legally, suicide is like murder in that it's a specific-intent killing. There are many degrees of intent in criminal law, and specific intent is the highest level. It means the killer acted intending the specific outcome -- the death of the victim. The only practical difference is the inherent complication in prosecuting the completed suicide. Your defendant is also your victim, and in any event, he is no longer subject to the state's jurisdiction. So then how can we suggest that Belcher's employer negligently caused him to do the most independent, intentional act of all? The legal question is better framed like this: Negligent parties are generally liable for all the harm that is foreseeably caused by their negligence. When a person is negligent, it means they undertook some activity, and their conduct fell below a standard of care in performing that activity. Sometimes, however, a defendant can act negligently, but the subsequent harm to another person is caused by a completely independent intervening cause. This will break the original chain of causation, absolving the defendant of liability. Suppose, for example, the Chiefs were found to be negligent as to Belcher. (The team hasn't commented on the lawsuit.) Belcher's body exhumed for brain study . Suppose the plaintiff proves all their allegations and then some: Imagine an e-mail surfacing where the team president knowingly and mockingly writes after reviewing medical evidence of concussions: ""Time for some concussions in Kansas City!"" To which another executive, aware of the potential harm to players, writes: ""Is it wrong that I'm smiling?"" Of course, no such evidence is known to exist. But suppose Belcher's family can also show that he suffered concussions and emotional problems as a direct result of the (fictional) team officials' negligence. But then imagine that Belcher's death was actually caused by an errant bolt of lightning in the parking lot. That bolt of lightning -- an ""act of God"" -- would be considered something unexpected that was wholly unrelated to his employer's negligence. None of us would expect the Chiefs to be liable for Belcher's death by electrocution in this hypothetical. So what about the alleged murder committed by Belcher? Could the Chiefs be liable? Traditionally, an unforeseeable, willful criminal act that intervenes between the negligent act and an intentional killing breaks the causal connection. Similarly, courts traditionally held that suicide was an ""independent intervening cause,"" so that there was no liability for negligence that resulted in a suicide. But the times are changing. The recent trend is to permit these cases if the plaintiff can ""prove"" that the negligence caused the suicide. This development appears completely inconsistent with centuries of jurisprudence. But it may be very consistent with the current direction of our culture: holding others responsible for our own behavior. In Missouri, a wrongful death plaintiff has the burden to show that the decedent's death was ""a direct result"" of a defendant's negligence. More specifically, if the plaintiff can show that the death was the ""natural and probable consequence"" of the injury that the defendant caused by his negligence, then the plaintiff can win. Now, this is no easy case to make and likely would require expert medical evidence to draw a scientific relationship between one man's carelessness and another's suicide. Fortunately for the Belcher family and plaintiffs at large, Missouri courts acknowledge that the science, like the law, is increasingly on their team. According to Missouri courts, modern psychiatry supports the idea that suicide sometimes is a foreseeable result of traumatic injuries. And if a qualified expert takes the stand and tells a jury that, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, a concussion directly caused a suicide, well that jury has something on which to hang a verdict. We shouldn't be shocked. After all, as a society we've been tinkering with holding people responsible for another's suicide for some time now. In New Jersey in 2012, Rutgers student Dharun Ravi was convicted of invasion of privacy and more than a dozen other charges by using a webcam to peek (into his own room, that he would have had an absolute right to walk into at any time) at his roommate Tyler Clementi. When Clementi learned of the immature and cruel prank, he was upset. In gauging Ravi's responsibility, we should have considered the ""natural and probable consequence"" of Ravi's juvenile acts on Clementi. We should have asked: what would we have expected Clementi to do in this instance? Perhaps we'd expect him to sucker-punch Ravi. Maybe we'd expect Clementi to fling Ravi's laptop out of their dorm window. But can any of us say the ""natural and probable"" consequence of Ravi's stunt was Clementi's suicide? The clever reader will point out that Ravi was not prosecuted for the death of Clementi, and that is true. But let's face it: The main reason Ravi was in criminal court was because Clementi committed suicide. Ravi was prosecuted because of the independent act of a very upset young man. (Clementi's family decided not to file a lawsuit and instead to focus on working with The Tyler Clementi Foundation to support gay and lesbian youths.) We're entering a new cultural era. Now, when a tragedy occurs, heads must roll, no matter what. Now that appears to include suicide, that most personal, independent decision to end one's own life. Our mind may tell us that the deceased is the only party liable for his suicide. Our grief, however, speaks louder, and it calls out for retribution. Modern jurisprudence appears to join in the public sentiment; we are moving toward the idea that for every tragedy, every social wrong, every inequity, that someone must be held responsible. Perhaps it's socially cathartic, or perhaps we are devolving to our bloodier Coliseum days, where we are sated as long as a lion eats someone. Even though it goes against centuries of legal precedent, cases such as Ravi's and other civil cases are suggesting a cultural sea change. When someone commits suicide, it's someone else's fault.

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- The death toll in a Pakistani mosque attack has risen to at least 51, a local government official said Saturday, a day after the bombing during prayers. The attack on a mosque in the village of Ghondi inPakistan's Khyber Agency also injured 121, Muthar Zab said. A separate attack on a Pakistani security convoy, also in the Khyber district, left two security officers dead and six wounded Saturday, two intelligence officials told CNN. The attackers opened fire as the convoy travelled through the Aka Khel region, they said. In response, security forces killed 10 militants and injured five during a search operation in Khyber, intelligence officials told CNN. They also destroyed three militant hideouts in the area where the convoy was attacked. The bombing during Friday prayers in Ghondi was a reprisal attack for local resistance against the Taliban, a spokesman for the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan group said in a statement. Spokesman Mohammad Talha said the villagers' resistance movement had killed two Taliban fighters that week and destroyed three Taliban hideouts in the area. About 300 people were at the mosque when the blast went off, officials said. Khyber Agency is one of the seven districts of northwestern Pakistan's volatile tribal region bordering war-torn Afghanistan and has seen many casualties in recent years. Khalid Kundi, a senior Khyber official, said the bomber blew himself up in the courtyard of the mosque with 8 to 10 kilograms of explosive material. One worshipper said the blast was so loud, he passed out. ""When I stood up, I saw dead bodies and injured people everywhere,"" Hikmat Ullah Afridi said.

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Taliban militants attacked a hotel near Kabul on Friday and seized dozens of hostages, sparking a fierce gunbattle with Afghan and NATO troops that left 26 people dead, authorities said. The standoff, which lasted 11 hours, ended with the deaths of all seven militants, police said. The militants killed 15 civilians, a police officer and three security guards, Kabul police Chief Mohammad Ayoub Salangi said. By the end of the siege, police had rescued all the remaining 50 civilians held hostage in the hotel, according to Salangi. Earlier, he had said there were five militants, but he revised the number as more details emerged. Police said they found burqas in the vehicle the attackers used to bring in explosives to the hotel, an indication that some were dressed as women. A burqa is an outer garment worn by Muslim women to cover their bodies. Terrified civilians fled when the gunmen struck the Spozhmai hotel about midnight Thursday, with some jumping into a nearby lake to avoid the bloodshed. The hotel was hosting an outdoor dinner that drew a large number of guests when the attack occurred. Afghan forces had moved slowly overnight to avoid civilian casualties. ""We did not take any action in the dark because of the risk to civilians,"" Salangi said. NATO's International Security Assistance Force said there was no immediate indication of coalition casualties. In a written statement, the U.S. Embassy in Kabul praised the professionalism of Afghan forces and condemned the attack as ""the latest in the insurgents' murderous campaign against innocent Afghan civilians, especially women and children."" Pentagon spokesman George Little said the strike ""bears all the hallmarks"" of the Haqqani network. The network, a movement with close ties to the Taliban and based in neighboring Pakistan, is one of the militant groups fueling the insurgency in Afghanistan. ""The Haqqani network, which has the backing of elements within the Pakistani security establishment, is one of Afghanistan's most experienced and sophisticated insurgent organizations,"" the Institute for the Study of War said. ""Although the Haqqani network is officially subsumed under the larger Taliban umbrella organization led by Mullah Omar and his Quetta Shura Taliban, the Haqqanis maintain distinct command and control, and lines of operations."" The attack follows recent strikes aimed at coalition troops and Afghan security forces. Bombings in two eastern provinces Wednesday killed at least 29 people, including three American soldiers. It also comes nearly a year after an insurgent attack on Kabul's Hotel Inter-Continental killed nine attackers and 12 others. Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said the hotel attack targeted Westerners. Attackers are armed with suicide vests, rocket-propelled grenades and heavy machine guns, he said in an e-mail while the siege was under way. ""Every night people come here for different types of debauchery, but on Thursday night, the number increases, including foreigners who come here and they hold anti-Islamic ceremonies,"" Mujahid said. ""Tonight, according to our information, a number of ISAF and embassy diplomats from foreign countries have been invited by some senior Kabul administration officials and are now under attack."" He said the Taliban fought government forces outside the hotel and had killed tens of government officials and foreigners, but the insurgents regularly inflate casualty figures. The Taliban, an Islamic fundamentalist militia, once ruled most of the country. CNN's Masoud Popalzai contributed to this report.","Pentagon says the attack ""bears all the hallmarks"" of the Haqqani network .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- In parts of rural Afghanistan a fierce battle is going on between the Taliban and the country's government. And the victims in this battle, it seems, are school children. Recently, the Taliban demanded the closure of some schools in two eastern provinces. In Ghazni province, the closure of schools was in retaliation for the government's ban on motorbikes often used by insurgents. In Wardak province, the Taliban has been a little more compromising, locals say, and has allowed some schools to open late after making changes to the curriculum. ""The Taliban are fine with us as long as we do what they want. They tell us what to teach and what not to. If we don't do what they say they have a representative who comes checking things,"" one teacher said. ""They have increased the number of hours we teach religious subjects in a week and decreased other subjects like English. If we didn't, they would threaten teachers, and it is very much possible that they would close the school down."" This power struggle in classrooms is symptomatic of broader fears about the future. As the U.S.-led military effort winds down in Afghanistan will the Taliban tighten its grip on daily life in the country? CNN's cameras were allowed in one classroom in Wardak but those interviewed will not be identified for their own safety. In this classroom, teaching is allowed but a Taliban minder oversees the syllabus. One student in the class says he does not mind. ""The Taliban have only increased the religious subjects in our day-to-day schedule, which is very good as people should learn religious subjects,"" he said. Mohammad Sediq Patman, a deputy education minister said the government has to be flexible in order to keep schools open. In areas where the Taliban had more control, sometimes the government lets them influence what subjects are taught and even allows them to check student attendance, Patman said. ""There was no deal between the government and the Taliban, but only in order to keep the schools open and running the Education Ministry had shown flexibility to this issue,"" he said. One Taliban school minder spoke to CNN but chose to cover his face on camera so that he could not be identified. ""We didn't allow schools to be opened here at the beginning of the school year because we wanted them to change,"" the Taliban minder said. ""Then we had a big meeting with school officials and concluded we would allow school to start, but teaching should be according to our principles and Islamic principles. They accepted that. We have only increased Islamic subjects so that even when a person becomes an engineer, he should have enough knowledge in Islam."" The minder said he was implementing instructions from Taliban leader Mullah Omar as are many others across Afghanistan.","Recently, the Taliban demanded the closure of some schools .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- The Afghan Taliban are prepared to open an ""office outside the country for talks with foreigners,"" a purported spokesman for the movement said in a statement released Tuesday. The statement could signal the Taliban's public willingness to talk to the United States for the first time. Calling himself ""Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan spokesman,"" Zabiullah Mujaheed said the Taliban have a ""preliminary agreement with Qatar and other respective sides."" The Taliban are asking for the release of prisoners from the U.S. detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, in exchange for opening the office, he said. He said the group is also ""ready for talks and negotiation inside the country."" It appears to be the first time the Taliban -- who ruled Afghanistan from 1996 until 2001, when they were ousted in a U.S.-led invasion -- have offered talks without the condition of an American withdrawal from the country. Read more about Qatar as a mediator . It is not clear if the purported spokesman speaks for all parts of the loose-knit Afghan Taliban. His statement was released in Pashto, a local language. ""The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan has always tried to solve any problem with its opposite side through talks,"" the statement said. The U.S. Embassy in Kabul responded cautiously to the statement. ""We support an Afghan-led reconciliation process in which the Taliban breaks with al Qaeda, renounces violence and accepts the Afghan constitution, especially protections for minorities and women,"" said Gavin Sundwall, a U.S. Embassy spokesman. In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said the United States is prepared to support an Afghan-led reconciliation. ""But this process will only be successful if the Taliban are prepared to renounce violence, break ties with al Qaeda, support the Afghan constitution in all of its elements, including human rights for all citizens, and particularly for women,"" she said. Nuland said U.S. officials are not aware of any formal announcement, ""but we are prepared to support a process that the Afghans support. "" A top Afghan peace official said he was ""cautiously optimistic"" about the Taliban statement. ""We are optimistic that they want to come to the negotiating table, but we have to be cautious because words alone are not enough,"" said Ismail Qassemyar, a member of the country's High Peace Council. He agreed with the Americans that talks had to take place between Afghans. The peace talks are ""an Afghan process .... Americans can't give them anything in Afghanistan because America can't make any decision on behalf of the Afghan nation,"" he said. Last week he warned against the United States or other nations trying to strike their own peace deals with the militants. ""We ask our international friends not to hold any kind of talks with the Taliban leaders,"" Qassemyar said December 27. Recent media reports have said the United States and other foreign governments with a stake in the Afghan war may try to strike a separate deal with the Taliban. The Washington Post reported in December that the Obama administration reached a tentative deal with Taliban negotiators that would have included the Taliban's public renunciation of international terrorism and the transfer of five Afghans from Guantanamo Bay. The deal collapsed, the Post said, because of Afghan President Hamid Karzai's objections. Any talk of a peace process slowed in September when suicide bombers killed senior Afghan peace negotiator and former President Burhannudin Rabbani. Karzai told CNN in December that the government cannot hold talks until the Islamic militia identifies a representative with the authority to negotiate. Karzai said Rabbani's death showed that ""we were actually talking to nobody."" ""A man who came in the name of a messenger for peace turned out to be a suicide bomber,"" Karzai said. ""Therefore, we have now clearly said that we will welcome a Taliban address, but that address must have the clarity that this representative is authorized and is representing the Taliban movement as we see it."" Qassemyar said a Taliban office in Qatar would by no means legitimize the Islamist group. ""We accept an address for the Taliban in Qatar if they come there as a movement or a group, not a government or use it as a propaganda venue,"" he said.","NEW: Nuland: ""We are prepared to support a process that the Afghans support""

"(CNN) -- As a reporter, I spent much of 1998 following a U.S. Senate candidate who was a handsome, likeable, well-spoken, ambitious guy in his 40s who was a graduate of Craig High School in Janesville, Wisconsin, his hometown. At heart, he loved issues and advocacy. He was the son of a small-town lawyer and his rise to political heights included surprising turns that led some to speculate he could go on to be president. His name was Russ Feingold, and he won his second term in the U.S. Senate that year by defeating another Janesville political wonk in his 40s, Mark Neumann, a Republican who gave up his seat in the House of Representatives to enter the race. He was, without question, a Wisconsin liberal. 'Gen Xer' Paul Ryan takes up GOP torch, makes case to young voters . Wednesday night, I listened to the acceptance speech of the Republican candidate for vice president given by a handsome, likeable, well-spoken, ambitious guy in his 40s who was a graduate of Craig High School in Janesville, Wisconsin, his hometown. He is the son of a small-town lawyer, he loves issues and advocacy, and his rise to political heights has included surprising turns leading to speculation he could go on to be president. He was, without question, a Wisconsin conservative. His name, of course, is Paul Ryan. (If I was really prescient, I would have been following Ryan, then 28, in 1998. He seized upon Neumann's decision to run for Senate as his chance to run for the House. He has held that seat since, and he has ridden his talents to national influence.) As I watched Ryan on Tuesday night, I found myself with two questions on my mind: What is it with guys in their 40s from Janesville? More importantly, with so many similar traits and so many parallels in their personal stories, what do Ryan, Feingold, and their sharply differing views tell us about politics in my now-so-heavily-spotlighted home state of Wisconsin -- and what does that say to the nation? Three thoughts: . First, Janesville is a pleasant, smaller city about 35 miles south of Madison with a strong history of taking its politics very seriously but keeping things civil. It is rightfully proud of its current prominence. It is a place where people such as Ryan and Feingold are raised to have a commitment to the public good and to involvement in issues. I wish there were more such places and more such people. Second, image and substance. The pleasant personalities of both Feingold and Ryan have been big assets in their political careers. We live in a marketing world, and you have to be a marketable person to be a successful candidate. Both Ryan and Feingold fit the bill. Opinion: How did Paul Ryan do? But ultimately, each is known for the serious stuff. Each is a person of political substance. I'd like to think that ideas and principles still matter and both of these Janesville guys have shown that it does. Wisconsinites, for decades, have respected that. Feingold received scorn when he was the lone member of the Senate to vote against the Patriot Act in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, but it played pretty well in Wisconsin. Ryan has made his mark as the ideas guy for Republicans in Congress, the guy who has been more than willing to take on issues such as Medicare and the federal debt. We need to have adult conversations about these issues, as he sometimes puts it. That has played fairly well in Wisconsin also. If many national political commentators have said that the addition of Ryan to the Republican ticket means this will be an election in which heavy-duty policy issues get more debate, I think that, too, will look good in the eyes of many Wisconsinites, whatever their own partisanship. What's bad if the debate is about serious issues and not the trivial things that take up so much attention in major campaigns? Third, what does this have to do with who is going to win? Ryan is just about the hottest act in American politics. Feingold is watching from the sidelines after losing a bid for a fourth term in the Senate in 2010 to a previously little known businessman, Ron Johnson, whose stands are much in line with Ryan's. This has been a good period to be a Wisconsin conservative. Scott Walker was elected governor in 2010 at the same time Johnson beat Feingold. Walker set off a huge political fracas with his budget-cutting, union-crushing stands in 2011, which led to a recall election three months ago that Walker won. In addition to Ryan and Walker, there is Reince Priebus, national Republican Party chair (he's from Kenosha, in Ryan's congressional district), which gives Wisconsin three of the most spotlighted names in conservative politics. But the pendulum swings in politics. One side, one set of ideas, is impressively dominant at some point. Then in the battle of ideas and real politics it finds itself on the outs. It has happened often in Wisconsin, a fertile place for producing political winners who seem to be polar opposites. I assume the pendulum will swing some day. More immediately, the conservative (and Ryan) ascension doesn't mean Wisconsin will go for Romney and Ryan in November. Wisconsin has built a rich record of being almost evenly split when it comes to presidential races. The 2000 and 2004 outcomes in the state were very close, with Democrats Al Gore and John Kerry narrowly prevailing. Obama won the 10 electoral votes easily in 2008, but that seemed to be an exception. In the most extensive polling project in Wisconsin, the Marquette Law School Poll, Obama has been ahead all year. But the race has narrowed. With the addition of Ryan, the gap narrowed to three points (49% to 46%) in results released Aug. 22, down from a five-point margin in early August. This is, once again, a battleground state. The Marquette Law poll found ratings on Ryan in his home state (41% favorable, 34% unfavorable) that were better than in comparable national polling, and better than the figures for Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney in Wisconsin. But it doesn't look like Ryan alone is enough to swing the outcome. What will swing Wisconsin -- and perhaps the nation? Convincing people who are part of the very small bloc of undecided voters. Motivating people in each of the parties' bases. Ryan's speech gives undecided voters mild nudge toward Romney . That could take the form of basic partisan battling. But I would suggest that the lesson of these two major political figures from Janesville is that sometimes, ideas still matter and serious argument can still be persuasive. You can build careers on ideas and advocacy. You can win or lose on those things -- which is what is likely to happen in Wisconsin and which is, I still believe, the way the American political system is supposed to work. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Alan Borsuk.","Paul Ryan and Russ Feingold are two policy wonks who grew up in Janesville, Wisconsin .

"(CNN) -- Afghan President Hamid Karzai dismissed calls for negotiations with the Taliban, saying neighboring Pakistan is the key to peace talks with the insurgency, the presidential press service said in a statement Saturday. ""The people of Afghanistan say 'president, you have called for peace but peace with who?'"" according to the statement. ""I don't have another answer for them, except to say that it is Pakistan we have to approach. We cannot find Mullah Omar. Where is he? We don't know where the Taliban Shura is."" The comments came the same day Afghanistan's intelligence service said it provided evidence that the assassination of former Afghan President Berhanuddin Rabbani was planned by the Taliban council in Quetta, Pakistan. Rabbani, who was spearheading the reconciliation process with the Taliban, was killed in a suicide bomb attack at his home on September 20. Police said the bomber claimed to be a Taliban member who had come for the talks about peace and reconciliation and detonated the explosives as he entered the home. ""We have given the evidence to the Pakistan Embassy in Afghanistan to cooperate with us,"" Lutfullah Mashal, Afghanistan's intelligence service spokesman, told reporters. ""We have concrete evidence that (Taliban council in Quetta) was responsible for killing the head of the peace council."" Among the evidence turned over to Pakistani officials were photographs, documents, maps and the location where Rabbani's killing was planned, Mashal said. Long an enemy of the Taliban, Rabbani was a controversial choice when appointed by Karzai as chairman of the High Peace Council a year ago. He was forced to flee Kabul when the Taliban took over in 1996, but he continued to lead resistance to the regime from his stronghold in Faizabad in northern Afghanistan. Rabbani's death shocked the war-torn country, undermined the fledgling peace initiative and stoked fears of renewed ethnic conflict between Pashtuns and others, such as Rabbani's ethnic group of Tajiks. Karzai believes any negotiations must be conducted with Pakistan since the enemy ""sanctuaries and operating places"" are there, the statement said. In the statement, Karzai condemned insurgent attacks launched from Pakistan's volatile tribal area that borders Afghanistan. ""We also condemn the attacks on Nuristan and Kunar from Pakistan, and have asked the Foreign Ministry to use emergency diplomacy and contacts to stop these attacks,"" the statement said. The comments by the Afghan president follow ones made by U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Adm. Mike Mullen, who said last week that the Haqqani network -- which has carried out a number of high profile terror attacks in Afghanistan -- acted ""as a veritable arm of Pakistan's intelligence."" Pakistan's prime minister has rejected Mullen's accusations. Western counterterrorism officials believe that contrary to Pakistan's assertions, the Haqqanis rely on Pakistani territory -- specifically the tribal areas of North Waziristan and the Khurram agency -- to organize, resupply and raise funds. CNN's Nick Paton Walsh, Matiullah Mati and Ruhullah Khapalwak contributed to this report.","New: Afghans have ""concrete evidence"" that an assassination was plotted in Pakistan, an official says .

"(CNN) -- A Taliban attack in southern Afghanistan killed eight officers and completely destroyed a police post, a provincial spokesman said Wednesday. At least three more officers were injured in the Tuesday night attack near Lashkar Gah in Helmand province, according to Daud Ahmadi, the spokesman. An investigation revealed it was an inside job, he said. ""It is now clear that a policeman from the post had contacts with the Taliban who invited the Taliban to conduct the attack,"" the spokesman said. He said the policeman fled with the Taliban. It was the second attack by the terror group in the province that day, he said. On Tuesday morning, it targeted a bakery, killing two civilians and injuring 26 others, including officers collecting bread.","The two attacks are in Helmand province .

"Kabul (CNN) -- The Taliban have accused the United States of killing tens of thousands of Afghans and brutally torturing others in a defiant statement marking the 10th anniversary of the 9/11 terror attacks against the United States. The statement accuses the United States of using the September 11 attacks as a pretext for violence against Muslims. It says the Afghan people have ""an endless stamina for a long war"" and could rise up as a nation ""to send the Americans to the dustbin of history."" ""It will remain a permanent stigma on the face of the Western democracy that America and her allies martyred tens of thousands of Muslims under the pretext of this ambiguous and murky event,"" the statement says, referring to 9/11. Children, old men, women and babies are among the victims of U.S.-led attacks in Afghanistan, which also destroy homes, villages and orchards ""under the unjustified name of war on terror,"" the Taliban say. The statement comes as the United States remembers the events of 10 years ago and intelligence officials warn of a ""credible"" threat of another attack on U.S. soil. U.S. and international forces have been battling the Taliban in Afghanistan for almost a decade, with the loss of almost 2,700 lives across the coalition, more than 1,700 of them American. Figures released by the United Nations mission in Afghanistan for the first six months of this year showed 1,462 civilians had died, with anti-government insurgents responsible for 80% of the killings. While air strikes were the leading cause of civilian deaths at the hands of international forces, the majority of those who died as a result of insurgent action were killed by homemade explosive devices and suicide attacks, the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan report said. The U.S.-led bombing of Afghanistan began in October 2001, within weeks of the attacks on New York and Washington D.C., as American forces sought al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. The Taliban were forced from government soon afterward but continue to lead the insurgency against NATO-led forces in Afghanistan. Taliban leaders granted bin Laden sanctuary in Afghanistan for several years, despite U.S. requests for his extradition over previous terror attacks, and declined to hand him over when he became the main suspect in the 9/11 attacks. The Taliban, Islamic fundamentalists who come mainly from Afghanistan's Pashtun ethnic group, rose to power in Afghanistan in the 1990s after the Soviet withdrawal from the country. They gave bin Laden, exiled from his native Saudi Arabia, a safe haven in Afghanistan from 1996 and allowed his al Qaeda followers to live and set up training camps there. CNN's Matiullah Mati contributed to this report.","The Taliban accuse the U.S. of ""shedding the blood of tens of thousands"" of Afghans .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Exactly 10 years ago, a brutal civil war was being fought in Afghanistan as rebels advanced on the Taliban in the capital, Kabul. From the former five-star Intercontinental Hotel -- a luxury hotel without TVs which were banned by the Taliban -- we watched as the rebels launched a daring raid on the airport. We could see the rockets flying in and flames coming from the fuel dumps and damaged aircraft. A few hours later we heard about the attacks in the United States. The Intercontinental was where we watched the civil war, and where we were on 9/11 though the TV ban meant bizarrely we could not watch those events, and it was where the Taliban foreign minister denied Osama bin Laden's involvement. This year it came under attack from the Taliban. It's in the heart of Kabul and could symbolize the fragility of progress. A few months ago the Taliban were able to storm the Intercontinental and put up a three-hour gun battle that eventually involved NATO coming in to quell. That's part of the story here. There's the appearance of security but the Taliban can mount complex attacks. The security we see is a veneer and that's in the capital. Meanwhile the rest of the country is open to violence and Taliban intimidation. In Kabul now, you can walk the streets but you can't set a pattern without opening up the risk of kidnap. For Afghans, the city is relatively safe. People blame the police for a lot of bribery at the various checkpoints. But the city has improved. It's much greener because the irrigation systems have been repaired and that makes the city look and feel brighter. Under the Taliban so much had been destroyed and it was always dusty. Now there are new hotels being built and lots of brand new glass in the windows. The city looks and feels much better than it did but that does not make the place secure and right now the city is on very, very high alert. There are more checkpoints and the searches are much more thorough. Everyone is aware the Taliban can launch complex attacks, like the one on the Intercontinental, and the anniversary of 9/11 would be a prime time for them. Any moment when they can launch an attack that makes them look bigger or stronger than they are, they will exploit because of the worldwide headlines it would generate. The thing about being in Kabul on 9/11 is we could not see any of the images because the Taliban had banned TV. We could only visualize it through what others were telling us. I was on the phone to my wife when the second plane hit the World Trade Center and at that moment I knew it was terrorism and most likely Osama bin Laden. He was the only one launching these 'spectacular' attacks against the U.S. that we had seen previously with the USS Cole and the embassies in Tanzania and Kenya. Back then, eventually the Taliban said it was not safe for us. Under Afghan culture when they invite you into the country they protect you. This was their way of saying we needed to leave. It was only when we were kicked out of the country about 10 days later that I got to see the damage from 9 /11 for the first time. One of the hardest lessons over the past decade is the failure of the international community to step up. It's frustrating that the window of opportunity that was there at the beginning was missed -- when all the Afghans wanted was weapons and warlords to be removed and disarmed so that they could have a normal life. But the commitment that the international community gave was only sufficient only for its own needs - enough troops only to chase out al Qaeda -- and did not address the fundamental problem of Afghans. Then the humanitarian money over the following years did not measure up to the task and the Taliban took advantage of that and exploited it. It's also frustrating to realize -- without trying to heap all the blame on one person -- the failings or weaknesses of President Hamid Karzai have limited what can be achieved in the country. When I first interviewed him he said the right things -- he wanted peace and stability for the whole country -- but he has failed to deliver, ran a corrupt regime and been accused by many of lying. One of the big political issues now is to get agreement on the number of U.S. forces that can be based in Afghanistan. That will set in stone the future relationship between the two countries. I don't think anyone expects good security in the near-term. There are no quick fix solutions to the fight with the Taliban. There is a sense among Western officials that the Taliban is getting worn down and worn out but that is not what the Taliban says. They say they are ready to fight until the occupying force, NATO, leaves the country. The scene is being set for a continuation of what we have already seen and as coalition forces draw down the Taliban will take any advantage. On a personal level when there were the 7/7 attacks in London 2005 I was in the U.S. and it made me very concerned about my family and I felt the same in the immediate aftermath of 9/11. I spend a lot of time examining the al Qaeda threat, and while I am happy that I put it in perspective and don't overblow it in my own my mind, I am very aware of what that threat could be. So if there is a heightened threat warning I would advise my friends and family to be cautious.","The Intercontinental Hotel has entertained diplomats and come under Taliban attack .

President Karzai's weaknesses have also limited what can be achieved in the country .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- A police commander and 13 junior officers in western Afghanistan have joined the Taliban in a move that is new and troubling for the struggling nation as international forces prepare to depart. The commander, known only as Mirwais, had been with the Afghan National Police for a year and was in charge of two police stations and 20 officers in the Bala Boluk district of western Farah province, bordering Iran, said Abdul Rahman Zhewandai, a spokesman for the provincial governor. He said the seven officers who refused to defect with Mirwais were found poisoned but they all survived. Mirwais absconded with two police vehicles and 20 light and heavy machine guns -- including AK-47 rifles -- and rocket-propelled grenades, Zhewandai said. Read more: Afghanistan Crossroads . Farah province is one of the most insecure areas of western Afghanistan, which is relatively calm compared to other regions. Zhewandai said the police defections were a first. Mirwais belonged to the Taliban when the militants controlled Afghanistan between 1996 and 2001, when a U.S. invasion ousted them from power, Zhewandai said. The defection comes at a time when the United States and its NATO allies are trying to prop up Afghan forces to take over the nation's security. There have been several incidents of Afghans turning their guns on their international counterparts, including one Sunday when an Afghan policeman opened fire at a training center in western Afghanistan. Three Americans, most likely trainers at the West Zone Police Training Center in Herat province, were killed, along with the shooter. Violence has also been on an uptick in strategically located Farah province, where the Taliban has been active. In May, suicide attackers with explosives stormed the governor's compound, killing themselves and seven people. In April, a Taliban attack in the province killed eight policemen.","A police commander took 13 junior officers and equipment with him to join the Taliban .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- The Taliban claimed responsibility for a suicide car bomb attack Sunday that targeted a NATO convoy in northern Afghanistan's Kunduz province, killing at least three people and wounding 11, a spokesman for the provincial governor's office said. The attack came a day after Afghan President Hamid Karzai said the United States was involved in peace talks with the Taliban. U.S. officials have downplayed Karzai's statements, saying there had been contact but no discussions substantial enough to be considered negotiations. ""I would say that these contacts are very preliminary at this point,"" Defense Secretary Robert Gates said in an interview broadcast Sunday on CNN's ""State of the Union."" The State Department is carrying out the contacts with the Taliban, which have been going on for ""a few weeks, maybe,"" Gates said. He added that the Taliban must come under further military pressure from the U.S.-led international military force and Afghan government forces before any substantive talks will occur. ""My own view is that real reconciliation talks are not likely to be able to make any substantive headway until at least this winter,"" Gates said in the interview conducted on Saturday. ""I think that the Taliban have to feel themselves under military pressure, and begin to believe that they can't win before they're willing to have a serious conversation."" News of the talks has done little to stem attacks in Afghanistan. On Sunday, a suicide bomber detonated a car full of explosives just as a convoy driven by German soldiers passed, said the governor's spokesman, Mahbobellah Saidi. The convoy was attacked on the road leading to the airport in Kunduz City, the provincial capital, the Ministry of Interior said in a written statement. Two German soldiers sustained minor injuries, according to the German military. The target of the attack was unclear. Two armored vehicles were damaged and are in the process of being recovered, a military spokesman said. It was not immediately clear whether there were NATO casualties, though one of the convoy vehicles was damaged, Saidi said. But the Taliban claimed to have killed many soldiers in the attack. ""The troops were targeted accurately, according to the plan, and many of the soldier have been killed as a result of the attack,"" Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mojahed told CNN by telephone from an unknown location. CNN can not independently verify the Taliban claim nor Saidi's account. On Saturday, four NATO service members were killed in combat-related incidents in eastern and southern Afghanistan, and another four were killed in a vehicle accident in southern Afghanistan, NATO said. ISAF has not released the names of those killed, saying its policy is to defer casualty identification procedures to national authorities. CNN's Stefan Simons contributed to this report.","Gates says U.S. contacts with the Taliban are preliminary .

"(CNN) -- Graphic video footage released Monday by the Taliban shows the execution of at least 16 men believed to be Pakistani police officers -- a new escalation in the fight for control of a pivotal country in the global war over Islamic extremism. Seventeen men were executed in total, according to Pakistan's government. The video shows a group of men standing in a line in a patch of dirt along a grassy hillside being berated by an individual holding a firearm. Several armed individuals then open fire on the men, who immediately drop to the ground. The gunmen then proceed to shoot the men in the head one at a time. ""Kill the enemy of Allah's faith,"" the lead gunman says in the video. ""These all are the enemy of God religion."" ""Shoot him again, shoot him in the head,"" the man says to one of the other gunmen. ""All right now he is dead."" ""Come here, that one too is still alive,"" the man says, scanning the bodies. ""Dead? Yeah, okay come here shoot that one too. A bit lower."" Mir Qasim Khan, police chief for Pakistan's Upper Dir district, told CNN the men killed in the video were probably those abducted from his region during a June 1 Taliban attack on the village of Shaltalo. The attack targeted a security check point near the village. Thirty police officers were killed, and more than a dozen more were kidnapped in the assault, Khan said. Taliban representatives allege in the video that the executions were conducted in retaliation for the execution of six children by government security forces in Pakistan's heavily contested Swat Valley. A spokesman for the Pakistani military denied that any such incident took place, calling the claim ""absolutely incorrect."" ""It's wrong, and it's a propaganda tool,"" Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas said. ""There was no such incident, and Pakistani children have never been executed by security forces."" The militants responsible for the attack are the same individuals who controlled Swat Valley before the Pakistani army recently cleared the region, according to Abbas. The video is ""quite repulsive, and it shows the complete merciless and ruthless minds of these terrorists,"" he said. The Taliban ""are quite inhumane, and they use terror as a weapon."" Taliban extremists ""used to terrorize Swat and now they're trying to bring terror to the Upper Dir region,"" he claimed. Abbas said he believes the executions occurred in Upper Dir. CNN could not verify the location of the executions or the identity of the victims. Pakistan is a strategically-important nation in the global war over Islamic extremism. Its location next to Afghanistan has put it squarely in the middle of U.S.-led efforts there. The Pakistani military has launched more than 10 offensives against violent extremists in northwest Pakistan in recent years, but for the United States, what matters most is North Waziristan, which U.S. officials call a safe haven for al Qaeda-linked militants who attack American soldiers across the border in Afghanistan. Washington has pressured Pakistan to launch a major offensive in North Waziristan, but the Pakistani military has refused, saying its troops are stretched too thin with other operations in northwest Pakistan. The army's reluctance to attack the Taliban in the district has fueled suspicions that the Pakistani military has links to militant groups in North Waziristan that are undermining the NATO operation in Afghanistan. Pakistani military officials have repeatedly denied the allegations. The relationship between Pakistan and the United States has been in a downward spiral over disputes about how to pursue counterterrorism efforts, particularly in the wake of the May raid on the Pakistani compound where al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was killed. U.S. officials did not tell their counterparts in Pakistan about the raid ahead of time. The United States believes Pakistan is not doing enough to go after al Qaeda and other extremists, while the Pakistanis are upset with what they consider to be unilateral steps taken by the United States within their borders.","Newly released footage shows the execution of at least 16 men .

"(CNN) -- Apple says a new software update provides tools to get rid of the so-called ""Flashback"" virus that has infected hundreds of thousands of Mac computers. In a post on its support forums, Apple said the update to the Java software platform ""removes the most common variants"" of the Flashback malware. Last week, a Russian security company reported that as many as 600,000 Macs, most of them in the United States and Canada, had been infected by Flashback, a Trojan horse virus that infiltrates computers, secretly giving someone else remote access to them. Flashback was first discovered in September, disguising itself as an Adobe Flash Player installer. Apple recommended the new update to all Mac users who have Java installed. Throughout their history, Macs have been relatively free from most of the viruses and other malware that have targeted PCs, with cybercriminals preferring to go after the larger number of computer users on that system. But the rise of Macs has also seen an uptick in the number of Mac users targeted. ""Malware authors have targeted the Mac OS for quite some time; however, the recent OSX.Flashback.K infections indicate a very significant shift to the current threat landscape, which is dominated by malware on the Windows operating system,"" Web security firm Symantec posted on its blog. Symantec estimates that the number of computers still infected is down to about 270,000, slightly less than half of the number that was reported a week ago. Apple, which prides itself on keeping a safe environment for users, was criticized in some quarters for the amount of time it took to respond to Flashback. ""Better late than never?"" wrote Tony Bradley of PCWorld on Friday. Bradley was more complimentary of the fix itself. While previous updates have closed the loophole that allowed the malware, the latest fixes the damage and is designed to protect Macs from similar attacks in the future. ""Kudos to Apple,"" he wrote. ""It may be late to the game when it comes to helping users remove the Flashback malware from Mac OS X, but it has raised the bar for proactively protecting systems at the same time.""","Apple releases update to fix damage from the ""Flashback"" malware .

"(CNN) -- The Taliban have met with U.S. officials to discuss possible peace talks, but do not want to negotiate with Afghan President Hamid Karzai's government, a Taliban spokesman said Tuesday. The spokesman's comments, rejecting a key American condition, could potentially derail American efforts for Afghans to reach a negotiated end to the decade-long war. In an e-mail response to questions from CNN, Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid denied previous reports that the Taliban had been invited to meet with the Karzai government in Saudi Arabia, saying that talks with what he called a ""puppet"" government would be pointless. ""We have never been asked to attend talks with Karzai administration officials in Saudi Arabia, but even if we are asked to attend, we won't because (the) Karzai government is a puppet and unauthorized, and meeting with them will not be beneficial in solving the issue,"" Mujahid wrote in a message from an e-mail account regularly used by the Taliban to issue statements. The spokesman, in answers that he said had taken some time to consider, said the Taliban wants direct discussions with the Americans. ""The issue is ... who is powerful and has got the power to make a decision, and who hasn't, and everyone around the world knows that the one who has got the authority in opposition to the Mujahideen (the Taliban) is America,"" he wrote. The e-mail also contained the Taliban's first open recognition that they have met with U.S. officials in Qatar -- talks that senior American officials also confirmed. The talks with the Taliban are aimed at establishing what the senior U.S. officials called ""confidence-building measures"" to lay the groundwork for negotiations between the Afghan government and the Taliban, with the United States possibly serving in a mediation role. U.S. officials have been trying to jump-start peace talks between the Taliban and Afghan officials through discussions over the past year. The nascent process has been marred by dissatisfaction from Afghan government officials that they were not included at the start. Karzai's advisers have complained that U.S. officials were going behind Kabul's back in talking to the Taliban. After initially opposing U.S.-Taliban talks, Karzai has since given his blessing, paving the way for a meeting last month between U.S. envoy Marc Grossman and Taliban representatives in Doha, Qatar, senior U.S. officials said. The Taliban's demand to talk with U.S. officials and not the Karzai administration could throw a wrench in the U.S. State Department's demand that all talks be Afghan-led and Afghan-owned. Another meeting between U.S. officials and Taliban representatives could happen this month, the senior U.S. officials said. The officials said the likelihood of reaching a deal between the Afghan government and the Taliban is slim. The talks could sow discord in the Taliban ranks, between those who want to negotiate and those who don't, the senior U.S. officials said. On Tuesday, Mujahid said that the Taliban sought confidence-building measures from the Americans for talks to proceed.

"(CNN) -- A three-story museum and sanctuary dedicated to Islam near the World Trade Center site in New York is the latest plan from a developer who failed to build his ""ground zero"" mosque amid local and national opposition more than three years ago. Rather than the 15-story, $100 million mosque and community center that raised such ire, developer Sharif El-Gamal now plans a smaller, three-story museum and sanctuary at 45-51 Park Place, to be designed by Pritzker Prize-winning architect Jean Nouvel. ""New York's arts and cultural institutions have always been a great inspiration to me and I consider this opportunity to create a museum to be a true privilege,"" El-Gamal said in a statement released April 30 through his publicist, Hank Sheinkopf. ""Commissioning an architect of Jean Nouvel's talent is a dream come true."" In 2010, El-Gamal faced opposition to his mosque proposal from some families of September 11 victims, anti-Islamic activists and others who thought the mosque was to close to the World Trade Center site. President Barack Obama said he supported the right of Muslims to build a house of worship on private property, adding that his support was not a comment on the ""wisdom"" of such a decision. U.S. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and former Speaker of the House of Representatives and ""CNN Crossfire"" co-host Newt Gingrich joined the debate, coming out against the site's location. El-Gamal tells CNN why he wanted to build the mosque . Although he didn't lay out a budget or timeline for construction, El-Gamal's application to demolish the existing buildings at 45 Park Place and 51 Park Place were approved April 7, a New York City Department of Buildings spokesman confirmed. But the developer hasn't filed the necessary paperwork for permits to start demolition, the spokesman said. El-Gamal's news release didn't offer many specifics about what the museum will showcase, although ""it will likely display rotating exhibitions of art and host academic and cultural events."" It's not clear how much more opposition he might face three years later, but El-Gamal has already taken at least one step to better negotiate the rough-and-tumble debate around New York development: He's hired veteran New York publicist Sheinkopf to manage his communications.","Developer Sharif El-Gamal plans to build a museum near ground zero .

"(CNN) -- Tottenham Hotspur medical staff were putting Hugo Lloris' life at risk by leaving him on the field after he suffered concussion at Everton, the former head doctor at Chelsea has told CNN. Dr Ralph Rogers, the first team doctor at the English Premier League side between 2009 and 2010, believes Tottenham's medical staff erred in their treatment of the Frenchman at Goodison Park. ""I don't want to be critical of the doctor in question but this is a time to reflect because next time, we have to ensure we get it right,"" said Rogers. Lloris suffered concussion after being accidentally hit in the head by the knee of Everton striker Romelu Lukaku late in the game, with play held up for nine minutes as he received treatment. To widespread surprise, Lloris -- who could not remember the incident after the match -- was allowed to continue after saying that he wanted to stay on the pitch. Both world governing body FIFA and the global players' union FIFPro criticized the decision-making progress employed by the Tottenham staff, who say they followed procedure when assessing the state of the France captain. ""Once the relevant tests and assessments were carried out we were totally satisfied that he was fit to continue playing,"" Spurs' Head of Medical Services Wayne Diesel said on the club website. Local FA rules state that any player who leaves the pitch with a head injury should ""not be allowed to resume playing or training without the clearance of a qualified medical practitioner"" even if such an injury is sustained in training. Tottenham's medical staff have come under fire for their actions, which come 18 months after they were widely praised for saving the life of visiting Bolton Wanderers player Fabrice Muamba, whose heart stopped beating during a game at White Hart Lane. Nonetheless, Rogers is unhappy with the way in which Lloris was treated on the pitch, saying the goalkeeper was allowed to move too freely before a more comprehensive treatment had taken place. ""Lloris could have died, he could have been paralyzed,"" said Rogers. ""If knocked out with a head injury, he should have been carried off the pitch -- but first and foremost, they should have checked his spine."" ""He needed to have a collar put around his neck, blocks applied to either side of his head, to have been strapped in and then a spinal board placed underneath him in order to determine any injury to his cervical spine."" After declining to specifically address Rogers' assertions, Tottenham referred CNN to the earlier statement made by Diesel. On Monday, the Professional Footballers' Association, the body that looks after the welfare of footballers in England and Wales, called for a change in the rules surrounding head injuries. ""If anyone suffers a severe trauma to the head and loses consciousness, then they should be required to leave the field of play automatically,"" said PFA deputy chief executive John Bramhall. Chain of Command . After the match, Tottenham manager Andre Villas-Boas said he had taken the final decision to send Lloris back onto the pitch following consultation with his medical staff. For Rogers, such an admission lies at the heart of a weakness he believes exists within the game. ""The problem is that no one knows who's boss at present on such an issue,"" he said. ""Traditionally, it has been the physiotherapist but does he know more than the team doctor? If you go to hospital, it's not the nurse but the doctor who ultimately looks after you. A physio has fewer qualifications. ""I strongly believe that the doctor should be the team leader above both the manager and referee. He has to be strong enough to make that crucial decision, because at the end of the day it's not about the club, it's about the doctor looking after the player. ""If I had been in the same situation, I would have ordered Lloris' removal from the pitch, telling all concerned that if they didn't like my decisions, then they could fire me in the coming days."" FIFPro backed Rogers' viewpoint on the chain of command in a statement which called the decision to keep Lloris on the pitch 'unacceptable'. ""FIFPro condemns that the health and safety of players are let to coaches/trainers or even to players themselves,"" said the body's Medical Advisor Vincent Gouttebarge. ""Medical professionals should be aware of any relevant medical guidelines and apply them in order to empower the health and safety on the field. The health and safety of the players should be the number one priority and should prevail against any other matters."" The issue of concussion has become a major talking point in sports such as rugby and the NFL in recent times. Three months ago, the NFL reached a settlement worth $765 million with 4,500 former players who sued the organization over claims it hid the potential impact of concussion-related injuries. In rugby, Dr Barry O'Driscoll -- the uncle of Ireland star Brian -- quit his seat on the International Rugby Board's medical committee in protest at a new method of dealing with head injuries. New guidelines stipulate that a player can return to the pitch five minutes after injury if a medical inspection entitled the Pitch-Side Concussion Assessment determines he has not been knocked out. Once upon a time, the rules stated that a player had to wait three weeks before returning to the fray. Lloris was given less than ten minutes in a clattering that so badly damaged Lukaku's knee the Everton striker was forced off the field. Earlier this season, Lukaku was praised for finishing a game against West Ham despite suffering a concussion himself when scoring late on -- a difference in media coverage that Spurs fans may point to when considering the outcry over Lloris.","Former Chelsea team doctor critical of Tottenham's handling of Lloris concussion .

"(CNN) -- Monday's arrest of five men accused of aiming to bomb an Ohio bridge raises disturbing questions about the attraction to violence of some contemporary anarchists. But it also offers critical lessons to Americans about the nature of the domestic terrorist threat they faceâ€”a threat more diverse in its ideological origins than commonly appreciated. Since 9/11 the country has been concerned primarily with terrorist threats from militants inspired by a violent jihadist ideology, like that associated with al Qaeda. In recent years fears have focused on Muslim ""homegrown"" terrorism, which typically involves plots in the United States initiated by American residents and citizens who are inspired by jihadi ideology, but lack formal connections to al Qaeda or foreign militant organizations. Muslim homegrown terrorists may draw the attention of a nation still traumatized by 9/11, but such plots are no more numerous or serious than those perpetrated by other domestic terrorists in the United States. As the country's history and Monday's arrests underscore, extremism comes in many incarnations. Focusing only on terrorism perpetrated by American Muslims misrepresents the scope and nature of domestic terrorism in the United States. It risks leaving us vulnerable to attacks from other sorts of violent idealogues and promotes a hurtfulâ€”and pointlessâ€”tension between Muslim-Americans and other Americans. There have been many instances of non-jihadist terror in the U.S. Some may recall that in the late 1960s and 1970s the country faced an onslaught of bombings and attacks by social revolutionary groups and Puerto Rican nationalists. That violent era eventually ebbed, but then in the 1980s and 1990s the country witnessed an upsurge of threats from right-wing militants. While Timothy McVeigh's 1995 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City was unusual in its lethality, it was unfortunately far from the only plot hatched by extremists on the right. The Southern Poverty Law Center documents 75 plots, of varying degrees of operational advancement, between July 1995 and June 2009 and an additional 22 from 2009 through November 2011. A study by the Institute for Homeland Security Solutions, a research consortium in North Carolina, found that from 1999-2009, in the United States there were 17 al Qaeda-inspired plots undertaken, 20 plots initiated by white supremacists and 17 by violent anti-government militants. Recent attacks include the 2009 shooting of a guard at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum and the murder by ""sovereign citizens"" in 2010 of two Arkansas police officers at a traffic stop. In January 2011, a bomb laced with rat poison was found in a backpack along the route of a Martin Luther King Jr. parade in Spokane, Washington. Eco-terrorists and animal rights activists too have perpetrated their share of bombings and attacks in the United States, especially in the last decade. While these groups aim to avoid civilian deaths, accidents can happen and produce sobering acts of violence. Add to the mix militants inspired by jihadist ideology. In the decade following 9/11, by my own accounting, there have been 18 plots in which militants have taken at least some preliminary operational steps to realize their deadly mission. Like the alleged anarchist attack, 12 have involved informants and federal agents whose presence can help advance plots that otherwise may have remained aspirational. All but two of these plots have failed or been foiled by law enforcement: Army Major Nadil Malik Hasan's 2009 Fort Hood attack and a lesser known shooting, also in 2009, outside a Little Rock army recruiting center that harmed two soldiers. The perpetrators of all 18 homegrown plots had been known to law enforcement before their attempted attacks, with the exception of the May 2010 Times Square bomber, Faisal Shahzad, whose own failings as a bomb-maker, despite his overseas training, underscore the challenges of successfully executing attacks in the contemporary United States. Some may recoil at grouping right-wing, single-issue, and left-wing terrorists with militant jihadists. Yet, there are several benefits to promoting a more comprehensive assessment of the domestic terrorist threat. First, it ensures that society remains vigilant against threats from different sub-groups and that law enforcement has the support and bureaucratic incentives to do the same. As Norwegians learned with the 2011 attacks by Anders Behring Breivik, neglecting the threat from the right (or other ideological extremes) can leave society dangerously vulnerable. Second, focusing our attention on domestic terrorism of all types and not just that generated by Muslim Americans can help heal the social rifts generated by 9/11. Singling out Muslim militants when we talk about terrorism in the U.S. adds to the mutual alienation of Muslims and Americans of other backgrounds. By unifying in opposition to extremism of all types, we demonstrate to ourselves and to our terrorist adversaries abroad that we remain true to American values and principles. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Risa Brooks.","Risa Brooks says foiled Ohio bombing plot reminder of diversity of U.S. terror .

"Madrid, Spain (CNN) -- The FBI used a photograph of a Spanish lawmaker as part of a digitally enhanced Osama bin Laden wanted poster, and the U.S. Embassy here has apologized to the angry politician, a spokesman said. ""That was not normal procedure. It was completely unintentional and the FBI is looking into it to prevent it from happening again,"" U.S. Embassy spokesman Will Ostick told CNN on Saturday. Ostick said he called the leftist politician, Gaspar Llamazares, to ""express regret"" on behalf of the embassy after the lawmaker's hair and forehead wrinkles, taken from a photo, were mixed into an FBI image showing the possible appearance of Bin Laden now. The embassy received various calls from the Spanish government earlier Saturday expressing concern about the use of Llamazares's features in the FBI's depiction, Ostick said. Spain's Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba is meeting the new American ambassador to Madrid, Alan Solomont, on Monday, the ministry announced Sunday. The ministry did not say what they would be talking about, but the meeting appears to have been scheduled at short notice and is taking place on a U.S. federal holiday when the embassy is not expected to be open. The digitally enhanced images of Bin Laden appeared Friday on the U.S. government's Rewards for Justice Web site. One depicts how an aging Bin Laden might look now, wearing his usual turban. But the other one, depicting him without the head covering, showed the hair and facial wrinkles that were taken from a photo of Llamazares. That photo is no longer on the U.S. government's Web site. Ostick said he told Llamazares that the error occurred when an FBI ""technician who put together the digitally enhanced image found an image (of hairline and wrinkles) that suited his purposes, and used it."" Llamazares, an elected member of Spanish parliament from the small, Communist-led United Left coalition, said he wants to know which photo of him the FBI used, and he threatened possible legal action. Spanish newspaper El Pais reported that the Llamazares photo was from his 2004 election campaign. Llamazares told reporters that he hoped it was just a case of the ""low level and incompetence"" of the FBI in the fight against Al Qaeda. He said he would not travel to the United States, for fear of problems at the border, CNN partner station CNN+ reported.","FBI used photo of Spanish politician to depict older Osama bin Laden .

"Forward Operating Base Salerno, Afghanistan (CNN) -- As Presidents Barack Obama and Hamid Karzai parry over troop levels and assistance, ""retrograde"" is the operant word I am hearing from U.S. commanders in Afghanistan. A nuanced military term for withdrawal, retrograde defines operations in this insurgency-plagued land. After more than a decade of U.S.-led warfare, American commanders are now insisting their Afghan counterparts take over the fight. The 101st Airborne Division's Rakkasan Brigade is the battle-space owner of eastern Afghanistan's restive Khost and Paktia provinces, both of which border Pakistan's anarchic tribal regions. In the brigade headquarters at Forward Operating Base Salerno -- a building hardened against rocket and mortar attack -- Rakkasan Deputy Commander Col. Tim Sullivan told me, ""Our mission was to go from a partnered role with the ANSF (Afghan National Security Forces) to an advise and assist role. We kind of gave it the 'tough love' approach."" With the announced U.S. withdrawal in 2014, American officers have no choice but to push the Afghan security forces forward. What does the future hold for Afghanistan? It's a big change for Afghan commanders used to U.S. troops taking the lead and accustomed to having the formidable U.S. firepower and air support. Sullivan talked of turning down a cosseted Afghan commander who demanded helicopter transport to one of his bases. ""We fly them nowhere,"" Sullivan told me. ""It's a big transition. It has to happen. It's a clash of wills."" Sullivan is the right man for the job. A hulking, gravel-voiced Brooklynite from an Irish Catholic family of seven boys, Sullivan is a West Point graduate who has served in Somalia, Haiti, Iraq and Afghanistan. Sullivan and other U.S. officers in Afghanistan talk about the need to transition to ""Afghan Good Enough"""" a sustainable Afghan security force that does it the Afghan way. The U.S. partnering strategy of ""Shohna ba Shohna"" (Shoulder to Shoulder) has abruptly given way to ""After You"" as Afghan security forces take the lead -- sometimes reluctantly. ""Across the A/O (Area of Operations), I wouldn't paint a rosy picture,"" Sullivan says. ""We've had some very good success. We've had some moderate success. We have not encountered any nightmares."" Across the insurgent heartland of eastern and southern Afghanistan, there's a palletizing fever as U.S. equipment is packed for shipment. In military briefings, U.S. bases scheduled for imminent closure are highlighted on PowerPoint maps. Long convoys of armored vehicles are making their way back from forward bases as combat outposts are closed or transferred to Afghan security forces. Remaining U.S. bases are groaning with the influx of transiting troops and contractors, housed in new barrios of Alaska tents and ""tin-can"" metal housing pods. Turning off the lights in Afghanistan . Some bases are being dismantled and returned to nature. Combat Outpost Tillman, named after NFL star and Special Forces soldier Pat Tillman who died in an infamous friendly fire incident, was one of those closed. ""We scraped it clean,"" Sullivan said. U.S. anti-IED teams traveled north to blow up the watchtowers. The base is now a soccer field, where Afghan boys play a wolfish style of football. As Obama administration representatives float the big round trial balloon of zero troops in Afghanistan, soldiers here talk about the spring 2013 drawdown of 20% of the remaining 66,000 US troops, with another 50% to be gone soon after. How are the Afghans responding to U.S. retrograde? Among some, there is clearly denial. They simply can't imagine a country rich enough, or foolish enough, to just walk away from the enormous investment poured into these bases, many just built during the boom that accompanied Obama's troop surge. Aid and development money is drying up. I listened to one Afghan government farm worker in insecure Zabul Province insist that a U.S. military development team needed to build a fence around a section of a U.S.-financed Afghan demonstration farm. The U.S. commander patiently told the farmer he should ask his provincial agriculture minister to do it. ""We don't do projects anymore,"" the commander repeatedly said. The farmer, who sported a bright gold wristwatch that signifies inordinate wealth (and sometimes indicates Taliban ties), retorted that the ministry was ""weak,"" so the American ""friends"" needed to do it. Many Afghans tell me they are very pessimistic about post-2014 security. One Afghan who has translated for U.S. forces in Khost Province for nine years says, ""The Afghan situation right now is kind of bad. If the American forces withdraw from Afghanistan, I don't think the Afghan army is strong enough to defend everybody."" Karzai, in his own words, on U.S. troops . He told me he hoped coalition forces would keep training the Afghan security forces. ""Right now if the coalition forces would leave, it's going to be so hard for the Afghan people."" Like many of his colleagues, the educated interpreter, whose father was an Afghan National Police general, is applying for a special U.S. immigration visa. Other Afghans are getting angry. One U.S. commander in southern Afghanistan told me about his Afghan counterpart flaring up when he learned American support was being quickly scaled back. It's a dictum that ""retrograde under contact"" (withdrawal under pressure) is among the most difficult of military operations. At some point when troop levels have dropped, all a force can do is protect itself. As U.S. forces withdraw after well over a decade of war, the insurgents have responded in various ways. IEDs continue to be the weapon of choice. Media-magnet complex attacks, such as the spectacular attacks on Kabul and Camp Bastion when Britain's Prince Harry was stationed there, broadcast the insurgency is still thriving. In some formerly insecure provinces such as Khost, insurgent attacks have diminished. I asked Sullivan about the contention that attacks dropped because casualty-cautious U.S. commanders ordered fewer combat patrols. Sullivan challenged the idea that U.S. soldiers are not ""out there,"" saying soldiers constantly travel the roads on retrograde convoys. ""We're not finding the mother lodes of caches (insurgent military supplies) when we go out,"" he says. ""We're not getting a fight."" Then I asked about the assessment that Afghan insurgents are just husbanding their forces while the U.S. withdraws. ""Husbanding of forces,"" Sullivan quickly agrees. ""I might buy that.""

"(CNN) -- Environmental activists have declared an early success at the start of their annual high seas showdown with Japanese whalers in Antarctic waters. The anti-whaling group Sea Shepherd Australia said its ships had split up the Japanese fleet in the Southern Ocean and chased it out of the main Antarctic zone. ""The whale poaching fleet is scattered and currently not hunting whales,"" Sea Shepherd said in a statement Monday. But Japanese authorities say the hunt is still on. Japan's fleet carries out an annual whale hunt despite a worldwide moratorium, taking advantage of a loophole in the law that permits the killing of the mammals for scientific research. Whale meat is commonly available for consumption in Japan. Each year, environmental groups like Sea Shepherd pursue the Japanese hunters in an attempt to disrupt the whaling. The resulting confrontations have led to collisions of ships and the detention of activists. Sea Shepherd said Monday that the Japanese fleet's harpoon ships are ""separated by hundreds of miles."" The factory ship, the Nisshin Maru, is ""on the run,"" the environmental group claimed. It said its three ships had ushered the Japanese fleet out of the Antarctic Treaty Zone, the internationally designated area below 60 degrees south latitude. ""Within a day and a half, we have the entire whaling fleet in disarray,"" said Siddarth Chakravarty, the captain of one of the Sea Shepherd ships. Japan's Fisheries Agency, which oversees the annual hunt, said Tuesday that the whaling operation has not been halted. It said the fleet remains in the Southern Ocean, which is generally considered to cover a similar area to the Antarctic Treaty Zone. The agency declined to comment specifically on Sea Shepherd's claims or on the fleet's exact whereabouts. On Monday, Sea Shepherd published photos and videos that it said showed three harpooned Minke whales lying on the deck of the Nisshin Maru and another being butchered. The Australian government has challenged the Japanese whaling program in the International Court of Justice. But the current hunt will continue, and Sea Shepherd activists say they'll continue to fight it. ""We have won this battle,"" said Adam Meyerson, another of the group's ship captains. ""But the war for the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary will wage on over the coming months."" CNN's Yoko Wakatsuki contributed to this report.","An anti-whaling group says it split up Japan's fleet and chased it out of the Antarctic zone .

"(CNN) -- Faced with a loud and angry backlash from some of its most active users, photo-sharing app Instagram backtracked Tuesday on new language that appeared to give the company ownership of their images. ""The language we proposed ... raised question about whether your photos can be part of an advertisement,"" Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom wrote in a blog post. ""We do not have plans for anything like this and because of that we're going to remove the language that raised the question."" An update Monday to Instagram's terms of service had stated that data collected through the app can be shared with Facebook. That's not a surprising move, considering Facebook paid an estimated $1 billion for the photo-sharing service earlier this year. But the language that upset some of the app's more than 100 million users said that ""a business or other entity may pay"" Instagram for the use of user images and may do so ""without any compensation to you."" That didn't sit well with some -- including Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's wedding photographer. ""Pro or not if a company wants to use your photos for advertising they need to TELL you and PAY you,"" Noah Kalina wrote Tuesday on Twitter. Kalina stopped short of vowing to quit Instagram, saying he hopes that language will be deleted. The proposed changes are set to go into effect January 16. Others weren't being so patient. A popular Twitter feed associated with the hacker collective Anonymous was urging its more than 780,000 followers to dump the app Tuesday morning. ""Only way to opt out of @instagram selling your photos is deleting your account,"" wrote the person who runs the account. ""Sounds good to us. #BoycottInstagram"". The feed posted image after image of screen shots from followers who had done just that. It claimed it was receiving thousands of such images -- too many to count. Systrom wrote that the intent of the new terms was ""to communicate that we'd like to experiment with innovative advertising that feels appropriate on Instagram."" ""Instead it was interpreted by many that we were going to sell your photos to others without any compensation,"" he wrote. ""This is not true and it is our mistake that this language is confusing. To be clear: it is not our intention to sell your photos. We are working on updated language in the terms to make sure this is clear."" The new terms appeared to significantly broaden what Instagram can do with users' content. Currently they say, ""Instagram may place such advertising and promotions on the Instagram Services or on, about, or in conjunction with your Content."" Systrom's post came after a morning when social media and tech blogs lit up with complaints. #BoycottInstagram and #Instagram were top trending topics on Twitter for much of the day. Wil Wheaton, who parlayed a child-actor stint on ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" into becoming one of the Web's earliest star bloggers, wrote that he doesn't use Instagram. But he questions whether other ""celebrities to some degree"" could be exploited if they do. ""If someone Instagrams a photo of Seth Green walking through an Urban Outfitters, does that mean Urban Outfitters can take that image and use it to create an implied endorsement by Seth?"" Wheaton wrote. ""What if the picture is taken by a complete stranger? Who gets final say in how the image is used? The subject, the photographer, or Instagram?"" Even CNN's own Anderson Cooper was expressing some concern on the site. ""#Instagram will now be able to use anyone's photos in ads? Without consent?"" he wrote on Twitter. ""Come on! Is there another photo app people recommend?"" Cooper wasn't the only one considering his options. ""I have my fingers crossed that they, Instagram, will listen to the voice of the community and reverse the new terms of service, but I'm not holding my breath,"" wrote photojournalist Richard Koci Hernandez, who has more than 163,000 Instagram followers. He shared his thoughts Tuesday on Instagram, where he was posting blank black squares instead of his usual artful black-and-white images. ""I don't feel like debating the terms of service or being too nostalgic about the old days of Instagram, I feel that it's much better just to take our work and more importantly friendship and conversation to another place that respects our rights and ownership as creators,"" Hernandez added. ""Let's move the party to a new location."" Bloggers also were spotlighting tools like Hipstamatic and Camera Awesome, as well as Twitter's own new photo service that includes Instagram-like filters. A year-and-a-half-old blog post from photo-sharing site Flickr was also making the rounds. In it, Yahoo, which owns Flickr, uses language, perhaps aimed at Facebook, that says ""(w)e feel very strongly that sharing online shouldn't mean giving up rights to your photos."" Systrom said Instagram agrees. ""Instagram users own their content and Instagram does not claim any ownership rights over your photos,"" he wrote. ""Nothing about this has changed. We respect that there are creative artists and hobbyists alike that pour their heart into creating beautiful photos, and we respect that your photos are your photos. Period."" It is, of course, too early to know how many people were fleeing Instagram on Tuesday. But anecdotal evidence suggested a movement was afoot. Instaport, a tool that lets users export and and download their Instagram images, was reporting overtaxed servers Tuesday morning. ""Our servers are very busy right now, so it may show you some errors,"" the company wrote to a user on its Twitter feed. ""Please try again later or tomorrow.""","NEW: Instagram backtracks on controversial privacy language .

"Rome (CNN) -- The Roman Catholic Church will declare the late Pope John Paul II a saint, the Vatican announced Friday. Pope Francis signed the decree Friday morning, the Vatican said. John Paul was pope from 1978 until his death in 2005, and was in a way the first rock star pontiff, drawing vast crowds as he crisscrossed the globe. At his funeral, thousands of pilgrims gathered in St. Peter's Square and chanted ""Santo subito"" -- Sainthood now! The Polish-born pope was fast-tracked to beatification and became ""the blessed"" John Paul II barely six years after his death, the fastest beatification in centuries. Sainthood explained: Understanding John Paul II's beatification . Pope John XXIII, who convened the Vatican II council in the 1960s, will also be declared a saint, the Vatican said . No date has been announced for the canonization ceremony. Pope John Paul II, the third-longest serving pope in history, died in April 2005 at the age of 84. He had suffered from Parkinson's disease, arthritis and other ailments for several years before his death. Pope John Paul II: Fast Facts . During his tenure, he became the most widely traveled pope in history and canonized more saints than any other pope. His papacy included a lot of firsts. He was the first modern pope to visit a synagogue and the first pope to visit Cuba. There are essentially three steps to becoming a Catholic saint after death. First, the title ""venerable"" is formally given by the pope to someone judged to have exhibited ""heroic virtues."" Second, a miracle must be attributed to the deceased person's intervention, allowing beatification. Canonization -- or sainthood -- requires a second attributed miracle. In 2010, Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI approved John Paul's first reported miracle: a French nun supposedly cured of Parkinson's disease. Benedict XVI's homily of beatification for John Paul II . Sister Marie-Simon-Pierre, a nun whose order prayed to the pope after he died, said she was cured of the disease, an ailment that also afflicted John Paul. The second miracle reportedly occurred in Costa Rica, where a woman said she recovered from a severe brain injury thanks to the intervention of John Paul, sources told CNN Vatican analyst John Allen. Patrick Kelly, executive director of the Blessed John Paul II Shrine in Washington, explained the church's process for investigating reported miracles. ""A team of doctors first examine the miracle. Secondly, the team of theologians look at the miracles, and then they discuss amongst themselves the legitimacy and all the facts surrounding the miracles,"" he said. Despite being so beloved, John Paul didn't live up to expectations at a crucial moment in the church's history, as revelations of sexual abuse scandals involving thousands Catholic priests erupted across the world in the early 2000s, critics say. In the United States alone, the scandal involved more than 16,400 victims or alleged victims and cost the church $2.6 billion in settlements, therapy bills, lawyers' fees and care for priests removed from ministry, according to the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops.

"(CNN) -- What can 40 goats and 20 cows buy a Kenyan man? Chelsea Clinton's love, if you ask Godwin Kipkemoi Chepkurgor. Hillary Clinton says she would let her daughter Chelsea know about a Kenyan man's unique marriage offer. The Kenyan man first offered the dowry nine years ago to then-President Bill Clinton in asking for the hand of his only child. He renewed it Thursday after Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was asked about the proposal at a Nairobi town hall session. CNN's Fareed Zakaria, the session's moderator, commented that given the economic crisis at hand, Chepkurgor's dowry was ""not a bad offer."" However, Clinton said her daughter was her own person. ""She's very independent,"" she said. ""So I will convey this very kind offer.""  Watch Clinton's response to dowry offer » . The audience laughed, but Clinton's comments were no joke to Chepkurgor, who described the younger Clinton as a ""beautiful, disciplined and well-natured woman."" ""Of course I have never met her, but I like her family and how they stick together,"" Chepkurgor told CNN. ""I've waited for a long time. I'm still waiting to meet her and express my love for her."" Chepkurgor operates a small electronics and computer shop in Nakuru, a major city northwest of Nairobi. He may still be waiting for Chelsea, but he's not exactly single. He married his wife Grace, a college classmate, in 2006. ""My wife has no problem with this,"" he insisted. ""She listened to the answers given by Hillary and did not complain."" Polygamy is legal in Kenya, so Chelsea would be Chepkurgor's second wife. ""Is that allowed in your side of the world?"" he laughed. In Kenya, a man proposes with dowry for the prospective bride, Chepkurgor explained. He said he stands by his initial livestock offer until someone makes a counteroffer. Chepkurgor, now 39, first made his intentions known when all three Clintons visited East Africa in 2000. He wrote a letter to the former president, offering himself as his only child's suitor. He said he had not expected the secretary of state to address the issue during her visit to Kenya this week. However, he admits his chances might be rather slim. ""Unfortunately, I don't have their contact information,"" he said. ""I just want to convey my message of goodwill to the Clintons,"" he said. ""And to all of America.""","In 2000, Kenyan man offered cows, goats for Chelsea Clinton's hand in marriage .

"(CNN) -- The NCAA on Tuesday proposed that athletes receive unlimited meals and snacks, the collegiate sports organization said in a news release. Member Division I schools could provide their athletes food in addition to the meal plan covered by the student's scholarship if the plan is approved, the release said. The announcement comes not long after a University of Connecticut star told reporters covering the NCAA tournament that he sometimes goes to bed ""starving"" because he can't afford food. Shabazz Napier's remarks sparked a new discussion on what benefits athletes should receive. Napier, a senior, is a top NBA prospect. However, the NCAA has been discussing changes to its meals rules for months. The decision from the Legislative Council would need to be approved by the Division I board of directors at a meeting on April 24. ""Today we took action to provide meals to student-athletes incidental to participation. I think the end result is right where it needs to be,"" said council chairwoman Mary Mulvenna. As of now, NCAA rules say athletes may be provided three meals a day or a food stipend. The new rule would apply to scholarship and nonscholarship athletes. Other proposals from the council included reducing the penalty for first time offenders of a positive test for street drugs like marijuana during championships and requiring football players to take at least three-hour breaks between practices during preseason. The drugs penalty will be suspension for half a season instead of a full season, the NCAA said. If approved the measures would take effect August 1.","Ruling would apply to both athletes who get scholarships and those who don't .

"(CNN) -- Two young men -- both still in their teens -- are facing murder and robbery charges in the shooting deaths of three members of one family, according to Wyoming authorities. The suspects, Stephen Hammer, 19, and Tanner Vanpelt, 18, both from Cody, Wyoming, were denied bail during a court appearance Tuesday. They are charged with 11 felony counts each in the shooting deaths of 40-year-old Ildiko Freitas and her parents, 69-year-old Janos Volgyesi and 70-year-old Hildegard Volgyesi. ""This is nothing short of cold blooded murder,"" Park County Sheriff Scott A. Steward said in a weekend statement after the two were arrested. According to court documents, the suspects told investigators that they went to the victims' home in the small community of Clark, Wyoming, last Saturday morning intending to steal a car and go to Denver. Authorities said the victims' bodies were found shortly after the killings when neighbors found the family's dog running in the street, returned it to the house and found Volgyesi's body in the garage. The bodies of the two women were found in the house, one in the kitchen and one in the basement. Other witnesses told deputies that they had seen two men enter the victims' residence and a short time later saw two cars speeding from the house. Witnesses recognized one of the fleeing cars as being that of Freitas and her husband, who was out of town for his work. The Wyoming State Patrol arrested the two suspects shortly after noon Saturday, after one officer stopped two cars. According to a sworn affidavit by Park County Sheriff's Lt. Dave Patterson, Hammer explained the shootings in detail to him after waiving his right to remain silent. Patterson said in the affidavit that Hammer confessed to an earlier gun theft in Cody, and said that he and Vanpelt wanted to flee to Denver because they were afraid of being arrested for the theft. According to Patterson's affidavit, Hammer said that Freitas was shot in the head during an argument with Vanpelt over the car. Hammer admitted to shooting Hildegard Volgyesi in the basement because she ""surprised "" him, according to the affidavit. Hammer said he was sorry for ""shooting 'that lady,'"" Patterson wrote in the affidavit. Vanpelt told Patterson that he shot Janos Volgyesi in the back twice, according to the affidavit. Patterson wrote that he ""asked Vanpelt for clarification and asked 'you shot him in the back?' Vanpelt replied yes he had shot him in the back twice, the he wasn't going to just shoot him in the legs."" Patterson also wrote that Vanpelt said ""they had not planned it to go down this way."" Both suspects told authorities that they hid the guns used in the shootings in the mountains, according to the affidavit. Patterson wrote that Hammer and Vanpelt took deputies to two 9mm pistols that had been hidden in an irrigation tube. No plea was entered by either defendant during their court appearance Tuesday, according to CNN affiliate KTVQ. Both were assigned public defenders and both are due back in court next week, the station reported.","Three members of a Wyoming family were shot and killed Saturday morning .

"(CNN) -- From bikinis and tank tops to short shorts, summer fashion calls for a whole lot of skin. When you're not feeling your beach bod best, time to break out the caftans, those long, loose garments with wide sleeves. These robe-like gowns have transcended their ancient origins to become summer fashion staples with universal appeal thanks to their forgiving silhouette, whether you're Elizabeth Taylor or Mary Kate Olsen. ""They're extremely comfortable, and they're extremely flattering to many body types,"" said fashion historian Valerie Steele, director and chief curator of the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology. Maybe your fashion-forward mom donned a caftan to host pool parties or to swing by the neighborhood shindig. Or maybe you caught ""Mad Men"" star Christina Hendricks wearing one on ""The Tonight Show,"" describing caftans as her ""go-to"" item around the house and inspiring one of the best theme parties ever: caftans and casseroles. Depending on what they're made of, caftans can be worn any time of the year, Steele said. But ""we tend to see them as summer wear"" because they are one of few clothing items that keep you cool in warm weather without having to bare a lot of skin. Through the years, designers from Yves Saint Laurent to Rachel Zoe have reinterpreted the caftan in sync with the styles of the time. But what makes a caftan distinct from a flowing dress essentially has remained consistent: a T-shaped garment reaching the ankles that can be pulled over the head. From there, the rest is up to artistic interpretation. The caftan -- or kaftan -- has come a long way since the early days of the Persian empire, when soldiers wore them under chain mail armor, ""reputedly impenetrable by the enemy's sword"" thanks to a weave of heavy cloth padded with silk floss, according to Columbia University's Encyclopedia Iranica. The word itself is Persian and translates to a battle garment worn by soldiers, said Niloo Paydar, curator of textile and fashion arts at the Indianapolis Museum of Art, which houses one of the country's largest collections of Islamic textiles. References to caftans appear in Persian art and literature as early as 600 B.C., and revered Persian poet Ferdowsi mentions them in his seminal work, ""Shahnameh,"" or the Persian ""Book of Kings,"" she said. Beyond the battlefield, anyone from the peasant class to the upper class could enjoy caftans thanks to their simple structure, which allowed for embellishment and adornment depending on one's means, Paydar said. Much like today, the caftan was worn as a length of draped fabric with sleeves, open or closed, that could be wrapped around the body with a sash or belt. Arab conquerors introduced caftans to North Africa, where different groups interpreted them according to their religious and cultural traditions, and European imperialism led to cultural contact with the East, allowing for caftans to infiltrate the Western wardrobe, said Steele. Ambassadors to the Ottoman Court in Istanbul received gifts of caftans as early as the 17th century that played well into the era's imperialistic obsession with ""Orientalism,"" she said. ""The English in particular liked to have themselves portrayed in Ottoman dress, so there are a number of portraits of them in caftans,"" she said. The style evolved in 18th-century Europe into ankle-length gowns that open in the front known as banyans, Steele said. In the 20th century, when European imperialism opened up North Africa to Western artists and tastemakers, European designers like Paul Poiret and Mariano Fortuny y Madrazo derived inspiration from Moroccan and Algerian styles of caftans to create evening coats and dresses for western women. When wealthy jet-setters and superstars took off for places like Morocco and India in the 1960s, they brought back Eastern fashion traditions along with spiritualism, Steele said. Halston and Yves Saint Laurent adopted the style into a symbol of bohemian elite that trickled down to mainstream fashion in the 1970s. The caftan continues to change with the times, with embellishments and diverse patterns offering a more feminine silhouette. Now, as then, the drapey dresses appeal to diverse audiences, from starlets on the red carpet to diplomats at State Dinners to summer music festival-goers. Would you wear a caftan?

"(CNN) -- Editor's note: On April 21, Denis Asselin, 63, stepped out his front door to embark on a 525-mile walk from Philadelphia to Boston in memory of his son Nathaniel, who took his life last year after a 13-year battle with body dysmorphic disorder, a condition related to obsessive compulsive disorder. Nathaniel was 24. With a photo of Nathaniel attached to his walking stick, Asselin is visiting the schools, clinics and medical facilities where Nathaniel had been treated over the years, as well as the places where he experienced the greatest joys in his short life. There he will share his story as a parent of a child with body dysmorphic disorder. The journey will end in downtown Boston on Thursday, June 7. To engage in a ""pilgrimage"" in the 21st century is by its very definition an invitation to step outside of chronos time (ordinary clock time) and to enter into kyros time (timelessness). A walk to pound grief into the ground . That is exactly what I did on Tuesday, April 21, when I walked out my front door in Cheyney, Pennsylvania, and began my seven-week journey by foot to Boston. I invited in possibilities and gave myself permission to be open, attentive and present. Expert Q&A: Will my daughter ever recover her mental health? My huge undertaking has become a journey of faith where I allow true learning to happen. What have I learned so far? I am learning about myself, about others and about my place and purpose in the world. My primary goals are to tell Nathaniel's story -- so that awareness about brain disorders, especially OCD and BDD, can spread far and wide -- and to raise much needed funds for the International OCD Foundation so research and programs can help other sufferers, their families and their friends. OCD in children: 'A darkness has overtaken me' As nobly stated those basic intentions are, the learning that accompanies them can be quite unexpected and magical. I am learning that... 1. Not many people know about the cruel brain disorder, BDD. They have heard of OCD, but not much about the former. Therefore, I tell them Nathaniel's story. 2. You can never fully know whose life you will touch by making yourself available to others and by speaking from the heart. 3. The first 10 seconds of my encounters with strangers are the most critical in gaining their attention and their willingness to hear more and to learn more. I usually vary my approach, but I must always choose my initial words carefully. They are the portals through which connections occur. 4. When you mention brain disorders, you intentionally open the doors for your listeners to also share their stories about similar conditions in their own lives, in their own families and among their own friends. I'm learning to be a good listener. 5. If you put one foot in front of the other, you will eventually get somewhere. 6. Everyone seems to be rushing somewhere, mostly in cars, and don't seem to be very happy about it. Apparently, increasing one's speed doesn't necessarily bring happiness. 7. Acts of kindness still happen in the world based on my direct experiences of the generosity of others during these past weeks. 8. Life doesn't get any better than when you live it fully outside. Walking outdoors puts you directly in touch with nature but also with yourself. 9. I marvel at my own resilience, resolve, flexibility and spontaneity. I never knew I already had these skills in such huge quantities. 10. The best rule of thumb when walking is to be open, to be attentive, to be present and to let life unfold in from of you.

"(CNN) -- The latest WikiLeaks revelations may have incurred the wrath of U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who warned they could even ""put people's lives in danger,"" but some seasoned observers believe the episode will prove more embarrassing than damaging in the longer term. On Sunday the whistle-blowing website began publishing more than 250,000 cables from U.S. embassies around the world, in what it said was the largest-ever disclosure of confidential information. The cables will be released over the course of several months, giving the world ""an unprecedented insight into the U.S. government's foreign activities,"" it said. The New York Times, Britain's Guardian, Germany's Der Spiegel magazine and the Spanish daily El Pais were all given advance copies of the documents. What is WikiLeaks? Among the revelations so far are allegations that: . -- Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah urged the United States to attack Iran to halt its nuclear program, warning that if Tehran were to go nuclear, other countries in the region would too. -- China was growing ""frustrated"" with North Korea and worried that its nuclear program posed a ""threat to the whole world's security."" -- Russian President Dmitry Mevedev was playing ""Robin"" to Prime Minister's Vladimir Putin's ""Batman."" ""This disclosure is not just an attack on America's foreign policy; it is an attack on the international community, the alliances and partnerships, the conventions and negotiations that safeguard global security and advance economic prosperity,"" Clinton told reporters Monday. Transparency? We used to call it spying . But Richard Dalton, former British Ambassador to Iran, told CNN Wednesday that although it was a ""wake-up call"" for the U.S., it would not suffer any lasting damage. ""Some people may be reluctant to talk to American diplomats in some countries, while some statesmen may be reluctant to express their minds freely,"" he said. ""But in the long term things are going to get back to normal simply because the Americans will correct some of the weaknesses in their approach to computer security. ""We don't have the full details of Rupert Murdoch's operations or the Bank of England's operations all over the media, even though the things they do are very much in the public interest. So I think the U.S. government has simply messed up."" Dalton also cast doubt on the contention that U.S. personnel serving abroad would be in greater danger as a result of the leaked cables. ""I don't think it's likely,"" he said. ""This is political analysis, not military."" Timeline: WilkLeaks releases . In October, WikiLeaks released nearly 400,000 U.S. military reports about operations in Iraq. In July, it released more than 70,000 reports from the war in Afghanistan. However the U.S. government has not said whether any of its military personnel have died as a result of this leaked information. Richard Caplan, professor of international relations at the University of Oxford, said the U.S. government was ""overreacting"" in the interest of its own reputation, adding that he understood great care was taken by news organizations to ensure potentially sensitive material was not released. ""This is going to be more embarrassing than damaging for the U.S.,"" he told CNN. ""There won't be many surprises. If there are a few personal insults, then elected individuals can live with those. At the end of the day what matters are interests, and interests won't be affected. ""For example, what we've learned about Saudi Arabia's overtures to the U.S. didn't come as any surprise. Perhaps the tone was different, but it's not as if we're learning something new about Saudi Arabia's views vis-a-vis Iran. It won't have come as a surprise to Iran either. ""It will be an embarrassment in terms of the public perception of relations between the U.S. government and other governments."" The international reaction to the diplomatic cables has so far been relatively mixed. Russia's Vladimir Putin, who was described as an ""alpha dog,"" told CNN's Larry King on Tuesday that ""leaks have happened before, and WikiLeaks is not a catastrophe."" The French government released a statement Wednesday calling the controversial website a ""threat to democracy"" after President Nicolas Sarkozy was described in U.S. embassy memos as ""thin-skinned and authoritarian."" Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan had threatened to sue the Americans after some of the cables accused him of corruption. ""This is the United States' problem, not ours... Those who have slandered us will be crushed under these claims, will be finished and will disappear,"" he said in quotes carried by Hurriyet Daily News. A Pakistan foreign ministry spokesman told CNN fears over the nation's nuclear weapons were misplaced. He was reacting to a cable in the New York Times that mentioned the U.S. ambassador in Islamabad was concerned over a supply of highly enriched uranium at an aging research reactor, allegedly enough to build several ""dirty bombs."" ""Their fears are misplaced and doubtless fall in the realm of condescension,"" spokesman Abdul Basit said. ""There has not been a single incident involving our fissile material which clearly reflects how strong our controls and mechanisms are."" Basit said Pakistan has ""extended experience in handling nuclear stuff."" CNN's Reza Sayah and Tim Lister contributed to this report.","WikiLeaks has published more than 250,000 cables from U.S. embassies around world .

"(Real Simple) -- Feeling overwhelmed? Stop stress in its tracks with this 14-day relaxation regimen. Here's a plan aimed at reducing your daily stress. Monday Day 1: See the big picture. When obstacles pop up, ask yourself how stressful the situation really is: Will this matter in three months? Three years? For issues with long-term repercussions, write down exactly what you think the problem is or how the situation needs to change. Brainstorm about what you can do to move toward a better outcome, itemize the steps that must be taken, then create a concrete plan of action. Tuesday Day 2: Survey your support system. Make a list of people you could turn to for advice and hands-on help in a pinch. You'll probably realize you have more people to rely on for emotional, practical, or financial support than you thought you did. Knowing that they're there can mitigate the effects of stress and make you feel more resilient. RealSimple.com: How to make positive changes in your life . Wednesday Day 3: Plant something. Whether it's a window box or a row of bulbs, caring for greenery can have a positive effect on your well-being. A recent study put heart-disease patients in a horticultural-therapy class. Immediately after the class, their heart rates were lowered and their moods improved. Gardening can help shift the focus away from the stressors in your life and calm you down. Thursday Day 4: Take tea. A British study found that regularly drinking black tea can lower levels of stress hormones and induce feelings of relaxation. Just be mindful of how much caffeine you drink before bedtime. RealSimple.com: Easy ways to unwind . Friday Day 5: Get a chair massage. These short massages now offered in salons, malls, and airports can work wonders on chipping away accumulated stress. Even a 15-minute massage can calm nerves. Or try this DIY solution a few times a day: Place your left hand in front of you, palm-side up with your fingers together, and using your right thumb, massage the fleshy spot between your left thumb and index finger in a circular motion while you slowly count to 15. Saturday Day 6: Play on the web. Doing online puzzles, like solitaire or sudoku, can decrease stress and improve mood, according to research from East Carolina University, in Greenville, North Carolina. Because you're distracted from your worries by the game, your nervous system can relax. Find a game you like, one you become so absorbed in that you lose all track of time, and play it daily. Sunday Day 7: Bless yourself. Focusing on what you're grateful for flips a switch in your brain: When you let good things take center stage, the stressful ones can recede. Make a list of three to five specific things you're thankful for your husband did the laundry today, the new album you downloaded, and so on. With daily practice, gratitude will soon become a more natural state of mind. RealSimple.com: 36 low-cost, make-you-smile ideas . Monday Day 8: Think pink. You may find it too girly to wear, but, surprisingly, a bubblegum shade of pink originally called Baker-Miller Pink has been shown to have a temporary soothing effect, actually lowering blood pressure. To add a little pink to your day (without repainting your office), make your screen saver a bright pink image, store papers in pink file folders, put a pink pillow on your chair, or jot memos on pink Post-it Notes. Tuesday Day 9: Turn off the TV. Constant bombardment by news can make you feel anxious when you're already keyed up, and a blaring TV hits you with both visual and aural stimulation. Consider a quieter, more single-sensory form of news whether it's the morning paper or the car radio. And limit your news to one source to keep from being overwhelmed. Wednesday Day 10: Take the scenic route. Whenever possible, get off crowded city streets and busy highways and take a tree-lined road to your destination. A study showed that the frustrations of commuting are somewhat eased if you travel down streets with views of vegetation. Thursday Day 11: Untie your knots. Several times a day, scan your body from top to bottom, focusing on the areas that are most vulnerable to stress-related muscle tension. Consciously release the muscles in your forehead, eyes, lips, tongue, jaw, lower back, and toes. Friday Day 12: Give bad thoughts the stop sign. Negative thinking can fuel stress. So when damaging, unhelpful thoughts come to mind, ask yourself: How could I look at this in a more positive or at least a neutral light? Or try visualizing a giant red stop sign in front of these thoughts. Then take a few slow, deep breaths and decide whether you need to dwell on the negative or can think about something more upbeat. Saturday Day 13: Lend someone a hand. Help a colleague who's in a jam, sign up to mentor a student, or volunteer at a women's shelter. Reaching out to someone else gets you away from your own worries, puts things in perspective, and can make you feel better about yourself and your circumstances. Sunday Day 14: Plan to laugh. Research has found that feel-good endorphins start cranking and the mood-boosting benefits kick in as soon as people start anticipating having a laugh, and a good belly laugh can relax your whole body.

"Grenoble, France (CNN) -- Former Formula 1 driver Michael Schumacher, who suffered a serious head injury in a skiing accident, is showing a ""slight improvement"" in his condition, doctors in France said Tuesday. On Monday night, doctors carried out a surgical intervention on Schumacher that allowed for some pressure to be relieved on his brain in a way that was ""gradual and effective,"" said Jean-Francois Payen, head of anesthesiology at the University Hospital Center of Grenoble. The surgery, which took about two hours, involved the removal of a large hematoma, he said. Schumacher remains in a medically induced coma. ""The situation is better under control than yesterday,"" Payen told reporters. ""We cannot say that he is out of danger, but we've gained a little time in his development. But the hours to come are hours that are crucial in our strategy."" The surgery came after a scan showed a surprising improvement in Schumacher's condition Monday afternoon, Payen said. After consulting with the driver's family, Schumacher's doctors decided to seize the ""window of opportunity"" and operate, he said. But Payen warned that it was too soon to speculate on Schumacher's prognosis. ""There is still a long way to go,"" he said. The driver is still in too fragile a state to be moved to another hospital. Schumacher, the most successful driver in Formula 1 history, suffered severe head trauma after falling while skiing Sunday in Meribel, in the French Alps. 'Catapulted onto his head' His manager, Sabine Kehm, recounted more details Tuesday of how the accident happened, gleaned from friends and family members who were present at the time. The party was skiing in an area of deep snow when Schumacher helped a friend who had fallen, she said. As he set off again and went to make a turn, he seems to have hit a rock hidden under the snow. This catapulted him into the air and he fell head down with all his weight onto another rock, she said, resulting in severe injuries to his head. Schumacher was not traveling fast at the time, Kehm said, so those with him were initially shocked by how badly he was hurt. ""It's not a question of speed but of the angle that you hit the rock,"" she said. Kehm also cautioned against reading too much into the doctors' latest report. ""They made it very clear that they are not optimistic, that ... there was a slight improvement compared to the situation yesterday, which doesn't mean we can be optimistic yet,"" she said. ""It's much too early to say."" Kehm declined to comment on the emotional state of Schumacher's family. But she said ""heartwarming"" messages of support have come flooding in via e-mails, text messages and letters from people around the world. In a statement released Tuesday, Schumacher's family expressed thanks for the outpouring. ""They are giving us great support. We all know he is a fighter and will not give up,"" the statement said. Kehm said a journalist tried to sneak into Schumacher's hospital room disguised as a priest. World titles . The accident happened while Schumacher was off-piste -- meaning he was on unmarked slopes -- in the mountains between Georges Bauduis Piste and La Biche Piste, resort director Christophe Gernignon-Lecomte said. The driver was wearing a helmet at the time. Schumacher, who turns 45 Friday, won a record seven world titles in his spectacular Formula 1 career and ""also holds nearly every scoring record in the book by a considerable margin,"" according to the motorsport's official website. He dominated the competition for the best part of a decade, winning five world championships in a row between 2000 and 2004. He retired for the first time at the end of the 2006 championship. He returned to the Formula 1 track with the revived Mercedes team in 2010 but struggled to repeat his earlier glories. His best finish was third place at last year's European Grand Prix in Valencia, his only podium position in three seasons with the German manufacturer. He retired from the sport for a second time in 2012. Schumacher suffered a serious injury once during his career in the high-speed sport, breaking his leg in a crash at the British Grand Prix in 1999. .

"(CNN) -- Seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher will retire from Formula One at the end of the season. The announcement by Schumacher, who originally retired from the sport in 2006 before launching a comeback in 2010, was prompted after he learned he was to be replaced at Mercedes in 2013 by Lewis Hamilton. A winner of 91 grands prix in a career which has spanned 21 years, Schumacher denied he has chosen to retire because he can no longer compete with the very best in Formula One having managed just one podium finish since coming out of retirement. ""I have decided to retire from Formula One at the end of the season, although I am still able to compete with the best drivers of the world,"" the 43-year-old told F1's official website. ""This is something that makes me proud, and this is part of why I never regretted my comeback."" The former Ferrari driver has struggled to regain his top form since returning to racing, registering just 149 points in two-and-a-half seasons back behind the wheel. ""I can be happy with my performance and the fact that I was continuously raising my game during the last three years,"" he commented. ""But then, at some point it is time to say goodbye. ""I said at the end of 2009 that I wanted to be measured by my success, and this is why I had a lot of criticism in the past three years, which was partly justified. ""There is no doubt we did not achieve our goal of developing a car capable of fighting for the world championship in those three years. But then it is also clear that I can still be very happy about my overall achievements in F1."" Schumacher's comeback with Mercedes saw him reunited with team principal Ross Brawn, who he won world championships with at both Benetton and Ferrari. It is his decade with the Italian marque which cemented Schumacher's reputation as one of the sport;s finest drivers. In 2000 Schumacher won Ferrari's first drivers' championship in 21 years, going on to clinch the title in each of the next four seasons. ""Already during the past weeks and months I was not sure if I would still have the motivation and energy which is necessary to go on,"" said the 43-year old German. ""And it is not my style to do anything which I am not 100 percent convinced about. With today's decision I feel released from those doubts. ""In the end, it is not my ambition to just drive around but to fight for victories; and the pleasure of driving is nourished by competitiveness."" Schumacher had been linked with a switch to Sauber to replace the outgoing Sergio Perez, who will take Hamilton's seat at British team McLaren. Meanwhile Hamilton, the drivers' champion in 2008, has denied his move to Mercedes has been motivated by money. ""It was hard. Really, really hard. It was very, very stressful and then there became a crunch time where there was pressure from the team,"" the 27-year-old was reported to have said in British newspaper The Guardian. ""There was one deadline and we didn't do anything with it. We just went on to another deadline. But then the decision was made. It really, really was tough but once I made the decision I was so much more relaxed. ""It was not about the offer. I had two offers on the table which were very, very similar. Martin [Whitmarsh, McLaren team principal] asked me what more they could have done. I said: 'To be honest, Martin, it was about the new challenge and a step that I wanted to make.'"" Hamilton also insisted his departure has not created any animosity within the team heading into this weekend's Japanese Grand Prix. ""I have got nothing but love for Martin,"" he said. ""When you are with a team for so long you generally learn to love them. ""I think I will always have McLaren at heart even when I am driving for another team down the line. I will still have a bit of my heart that is McLaren.""","Michael Schumacher will retire from Formula One at the end of the season .

"(CNN) -- Kim Dotcom, the millionaire founder of the file-sharing website Megaupload, was released on bail Wednesday after a judge said he didn't appear to have enough money to flee. Under one of the largest anti-piracy crackdowns ever, the U.S. Department of Justice is seeking to have Dotcom, also known as Kim Schmitz, and three co-workers extradited to face charges including conspiracy to commit racketeering and conspiracy to commit copyright infringement. Last month, U.S. authorities shut down Megaupload's websites and announced indictments against Dotcom and six other people connected to the site, accusing them of operating an ""international organized criminal enterprise responsible for massive worldwide online piracy of copyrighted works."" They say Megaupload generated more than $175 million in illegal profits through advertising revenue and the sale of premium memberships. The New Zealand police arrested Dotcom, a German citizen who has residency in New Zealand and Hong Kong, and the other three at the U.S. government's request. Megaupload's lawyers have denied the charges, and online activists have rallied to the site's defense. An initial effort by Dotcom's lawyers to obtain bail last month was denied, with the judge at the time concluding that flight risk remained ""a real and significant possibility."" But on Wednesday, District Judge N.R. Dawson said that ""fresh and new"" information had emerged since and that there was no longer ""just cause"" to keep Dotcom in custody, providing satisfactory bail conditions were imposed. In his 13-page decision, Dawson noted that: . -- Megaupload's chief financial officer has filed an affidavit supporting Dotcom's contention that he has no money to flee; . -- He has only two passports (one Finnish and one German), not three, as previously asserted; . -- The United States has extradition treaties with Germany and Finland; . -- No steps have been taken to re-establish the shuttered business; . -- No new evidence has been uncovered; . -- Some of Dotcom's business associates facing the same charges have been granted bail; . -- An extradition hearing likely will not occur before July, an ""effectively punitive"" period of time, despite the fact that no criminal conduct has been established. Dotcom's release on bail comes after the U.S. authorities added charges and broadened their case against the defendants last week. The other charges that the accused face include conspiracy to commit money laundering and criminal copyright infringement. Dotcom holds a German passport and two Finnish passports, under the names of Kim Tim Jim Vestor and Kim Dotcom. Prosecutors had said that the multiple passports, as well as bank accounts and credit cards from various countries linked to different names, showed that he presented a flight risk. But Dawson was unswayed. Dotcom ""legally changed his name on two occasions and each passport was obtained in his legal name at that time,"" the judge wrote. ""It is the applicant's understanding that the first Finnish passport in the name of Vestor would have been canceled when he applied for a new passport from Finland in the name of Dotcom. Suprisingly, no inquiries have been made of the Finnish authorities to confirm this."" In addition, Dotcom ""is entitled to hold both his German passport and his Dotcom Finnish passport,"" he said. Dawson said Dotcom, at the time of his arrest, had 59 credit or bank cards under 13 names in his possession, 21 of them still valid. But the judge said Dotcom's possession of so many expired cards could indicate no more than ""a degree of muddlement"" in his financial affairs. The 38-year-old businessman has prior convictions related to computer hacking and insider trading. But Dawson noted that they were ""historical,"" with some of them dating to his teenage years. Dotcom obatined residency status in New Zealand in December 2009. He is married to a Filipina woman with whom he has three children, and his wife is pregnant with twins. ""The factors against him being a flight risk include that he would live his life as a fugitive, he would be abandoning his expectant wife and three children and he would effectively lose all the considerable assets and bank accounts in a number of countries that have been seized or frozen,"" Dawson wrote. ""It is submitted that he has a good defense to the charges and that he has every reason to stay and fight for his family's future and his seized assets."" The arrests of Dotcom and his co-workers, along with the closure of Megaupload, prompted an angry reaction from the activist hacking collective Anonymous. After the prosecution was announced, the group took credit for temporarily crippling the U.S. Department of Justice, FBI and entertainment company websites.

"(CNN) -- Venus Williams was the first former champion to fall on Friday at the U.S. Open. The American lost an epic encounter with world No. 13 Sara Errani as the Italian came through 6-0 0-6 7-6. Roger Federer and Maria Sharapova, also former winners at Flushing Meadows, hope to stay the course later on Friday. Williams, who has rediscovered some of her best form in the build up to the final grand slam of the season, looked down and out as she lost an error-strewn opening set. But there were cheers from the crowd on Arthur Ashe court when the 34-year-old home favorite won her first game of the match at the start of the second. It looked like a phoenix from the flames comeback was on from Williams as she overpowered Errani to level at one set all. The third set saw the pendulum of momentum swing between the two players. Williams was serving for the match at 5-3 up only for Errani to break back and eventually force a deciding tiebreak. The breaker was another see-sawing affair but it was the Italian who conjured some brilliant play to wrap up it 7-5 and book her place in the fourth round. Williams came into Friday's single match on the back off a draining doubles match with her sister Serena. The 34-year-old, who is dealing with the effects of Sjogren's Syndrome, will turn her attention to that side of the tournament now. Fairytale in New York . There was a fairytale in New York for qualifier Mirjana Lucic-Baroni as she knocked out second seed Simona Halep 7-6 6-2. The world No. 121 had once been one of the game's rising stars, reaching the Wimbledon semifinals in 1999. But her career went into freefall after personal revelations about an abusive childhood. Lucic-Baroni fled to the United States with her mother and siblings but her promising tennis career was all but over. ""After so many years, it's incredible,"" the 32-year-old told reporters.

"(CNN) -- Outrage is mounting in Saudi Arabia about the case of a 5-year-old girl who died after allegedly being beaten and tortured by her father, who activists say is an Islamist preacher. Lama Al-Ghamdi was admitted to King Saud Hospital in Riyadh last March after suffering extensive injuries, including broken ribs, a crushed skull, bruising and burns. Family, activists and officials say she died of her wounds in late October. Read related: Small protests have big impact in Saudi Arabia . Lama's mother and several high-profile activists in Saudi Arabia accuse the girl's father, Fayhan Al-Ghamdi, of committing those crimes. Saudi Arabia's Human Rights Commission, a government-backed rights group, confirmed that Al-Ghamdi has been accused of torturing his daughter and that he is on trial for crimes leading to her death. Attempts to reach Al-Ghamdi via activists, government officials and King Saud Hospital have been unsuccessful. ""My dear child is dead, and all I want now is justice so I can close my eyes and know she didn't die in vain,"" the mother, Syeda Mohammed Ali, told CNN. ""She was brutally tortured in the most shocking ways."" Read related: America, the Saudi Arabia of tomorrow . Activists say Al-Ghamdi is an Islamist evangelist popular in Saudi Arabia for his televised appearances and for speaking on air about the rewards of repenting to God. But they also say he only fancies himself as a cleric and is not recognized by the clerical establishment. Some media reports say that Al-Ghamdi was sentenced to pay blood money for Lama's death, and others say that he has been released from jail. But Mohammed Almadi, with the Human Rights Commission, told CNN that the father has been in prison for about eight months and has been accused of the torture that led to the girl's death. Lama's mother says the next hearing in the case will take place in about two weeks. Read related: Small step forward for Saudi women, but will it affect their daily lives? ""We have appointed a lawyer to assist the mother in the case,"" said Almadi, who added that there was a hearing Sunday and that the case is still under review. ""Reports that the accused is out of prison are incorrect. The case is still actively being studied."" At the Sunday hearing, Lama's mother tried to bring her own case against Al-Ghamdi. ""The Human Rights Commission considers this case to be not just an assault against Lama,"" Almadi said, ""but also an assault against every Saudi little girl. We are asking that the aggressor receive the maximum penalty."" Several activists and numerous local media reports say that Lama was also raped, but her mother denied that happened, despite saying that the father had burned Lama's rectum. Syeda said that Lama's father also was concerned about the virginity of his 5-year-old daughter. Read related: Saudi Arabia objects to .gay and .islam domain names . ""The father confessed to the abuse, the beating and torturing Lama in the most obnoxious manners,"" she said. ""These are not some unfounded accusations, but everything is based on the medical examination by the hospital and the team of physicians who treated Lama when she was first admitted."" Syeda, who is divorced from Al-Ghamdi, says Lama's torture occurred while she was staying with her father. She added that Al-Ghamdi is now remarried with two more children and that ""the state needs to even consider taking his two children from him and his wife away because I fear for their lives."" Aziza Al-Yousef, a human rights activist and lecturer at King Saud University, who is in very close contact with Lama's mother, said this case highlights the urgent need for legislation in Saudi Arabia that would better protect women and children from domestic violence. ""We need to get some laws passed to protect women and children here. It's been difficult getting these laws passed,"" she said. ""This case is a horrifying example of the kind of violence that can be faced by children here."" Prominent Saudi women's rights activist Manal Al-Sharif, who has launched an online campaign and created a Twitter hashtag, #IAmLAMA, expressed a similar sentiment, explaining how this case reflects once again how dire the situation is for women in Saudi Arabia, who must contend with a male guardianship system that she says infantilizes women and strips them of any power. ""In Saudi Arabia,"" Al-Sharif told CNN, ""all women are considered minors and are automatically assigned to the care and judgment of their most immediate male relative."" Al-Sharif said Saudi courts tend to ""show leniency toward male abusers,"" and she said she is concerned that might happen in this case as well. Lama's mother says she wants to make sure this doesn't happen to other children. ""I want to address the king and urge him to consider my case and my daughter's case,"" she said, ""because such brutality needs to be punished in order to set a clear example for anyone who dares to abuse and harm their children.""","Lama Al-Ghamdi, 5, was hospitalized for her injuries last March and died in October .

"(CNN) -- ""There are those who keep out of mischief, and then there are the adventurers,"" Juan Manuel Fangio, the pioneering legend of Formula One racing, said in the 1990s. ""We racing drivers are adventurers; the more difficult something is, the greater the attraction that comes from it. ""Michael Schumacher is the greatest of the adventurers."" He's not just been an adventurer. He is a man whose image transcends sport, much like Roger Federer, Sachin Tendulkar, Martina Navratilova, Tiger Woods, Pele and Usain Bolt. The adventurer Schumacher, who suffered a serious head injury in a skiing accident Sunday, is a man for whom winning became an obsession. He racked up victories, wins and titles -- and then some: five consecutive world championship titles between 2001-2004, 56 race victories in six years between 2000-2006, a total of seven F1 crowns and 91 grand prix wins. After claiming his first two titles at Benetton in 1994 and 1995, Schumacher moved to Ferrari where he would go on to bring about a period of domination. His 72 race victories and five world titles with the ""Scuderia"" etched his name into F1 folklore and made him the most successful driver in the history of the sport. His search for perfection translated to recreational activities such as skiing. ""Schumacher wasn't a skier when he joined Ferrari, but by the end he was excellent,"" British journalist Kevin Garside told CNN. ""Each year Ferrari used to have a media week in the Alps in Italy and they would always have a race -- and it was always Schumacher who won."" Few doubted Schumacher's natural talent, but his desire to win at all costs didn't always endear him to the watching world. Ayrton Senna, the triple world champion who was killed at the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix, remains revered to this very day, while 1950s hero Fangio -- a five-time F1 champion -- was also hugely popular. ""Schumi"" was loved in his native Germany and by the majority of Ferrari fans, but his appeal was not altogether universal, though his skiing accident has prompted a huge outpouring of support for him from around the world on social media websites. Ruthless streak . Never far from controversy, Schumacher was often criticized for his arrogance and use of unsavory tactics to ensure victory. That ruthless streak was scarcely more evident than at the title-deciding 1994 Australian Grand Prix where, with his own car already irreparably damaged, Schumacher deliberately collided with title rival Damon Hill. The crash caused both men to retire from the race, handing the German the title. Three years later, Schumacher attempted the same tactic again in the deciding race, this time against Williams' Jacques Villeneuve -- only to be disqualified from the championship, giving the Canadian the title. Then there were the groans of dismay at the 2002 Austrian Grand Prix when Ferrari ordered teammate Rubens Barrichello to allow Schumacher to win the race. In 2006, he was accused of cheating during qualifying for the Monaco Grand Prix after deliberately stopping his car to prevent his nearest rival, Fernando Alonso, from completing a lap which would have probably given the Spaniard pole position. Born on January 3, 1969, near Cologne, Schumacher attended the local go-kart track where his mother worked in the kitchens. By 1987, he was already the German and European go-kart champion and left school to pursue work as an apprentice mechanic before becoming a professional racing driver. Three years later he won the national F3 Championship and joined Mercedes before making the move to F1 in 1991. He made his debut for Jordan, qualifying seventh, and moved to Benetton the following year where he began his ascent to the very top. A year later, he won the first of his 91 grand prix victories in Belgium. While his two title triumphs with Benetton brought him to the attention of the wider world, it was at Ferrari where Schumacher went on to make his name. He joined in 1996, when the Italian team was desperate to end a title drought which stretched back to 1979. It took four years for Schumacher to deliver what Ferrari so desperately craved, but when it came it began a period of dominance for the ""Prancing Horse."" From 2000-2004, Schumacher swept all before him to win five consecutive world titles. In 2004, he won a staggering 12 of the opening 13 races to help clinch his seventh and final title in what proved to be his last season of success. The following year he won just a single race after the introduction of new tire rules, and Alonso ended Schumacher's title streak. Alonso repeated the feat in 2006, a year which concluded with Schumacher's retirement. ""I retired simply because I don't have the passion and the motivation anymore,"" he said on leaving the sport. ""I was tired. I didn't really think, 'I'll take a break and then come back.' I wasn't interested in it. I was old enough and I had achieved enough. There was no need."" High-octane life . Schumacher -- who has two children with his wife Corinna, 14-year-old Mick and 16-year-old Gina -- was never going to take it easy in retirement. He took up motorcycling and skydiving to help quench his thirst for adrenalin while he also enjoyed horse riding as well as skiing. In 2009, Schumacher was involved in a motorbike crash while testing his Honda 1000 CBR-Fireblade at a racetrack in Cartagena, Spain. He was taken to hospital where he was diagnosed with a mild concussion, while Schumacher also complained of pain in his right wrist. Discharged from hospital after just five days, the incident did little to persuade him to give up such a high-octane life and instead he returned to F1 in 2010 at the age of 41 after signing a deal with Mercedes. His three-year stint failed to match the glorious success he had enjoyed earlier in his career, with a third-place finish at the 2012 European Grand Prix at Valencia the highlight. At 43, he became the oldest driver to finish on the podium since Jack Brabham at the 1970 British Grand Prix. Finally, in 2012 following the news that Mercedes would replace Schumacher with Lewis Hamilton, he retired for the second time after a seventh-place finish at the Brazilian Grand Prix. ""From now on life will offer me plenty of new possibilities,"" he said after his decision to leave the sport. ""I'm looking forward to them. I prefer to be described as a fighter, someone who never backed down.""","Michael Schumacher won the Formula One title on seven occasions .

"(CNN) -- Already packing 110 mph winds, a hurricane churning in the Pacific Ocean off Mexico is forecast to get even stronger -- though, as of now, it poses no direct threat to those onshore. Hurricane Emilia may ""become a major hurricane"" -- or a Category 3 storm, with sustained winds in excess of 111 mph -- ""later today or tonight,"" the National Hurricane Center reported in its 2 p.m. (5 p.m. ET) advisory. At that time, the eye of the storm was about 680 miles (1,095 kilometers) south of the southern tip of Baja California in western Mexico.

"Editor's note: Burton Wides served as chief counsel to Sens. Ted Kennedy, Phil Hart and Paul Sarbanes and special counsel for President Carter. He now works as a pro bono private counsel on civil rights and human rights issues. Former Kennedy aide Burton Wides says the senator had a zest for politics and an appetite for hard work. (CNN) -- For half a century, Ted Kennedy was the most prolific senator on the political scene, making major strides in civil rights, civil liberties, education, human rights abroad, arms control, good government and of course health care. You name it, he was there -- and in the lead. To some tabloid readers, he was largely a spoiled Kennedy playboy. To his colleagues and staff who watched him up close year after year, and to millions of Americans who saw him fighting on so many fronts, he was a committed champion of equality, justice, peace and protection of those in need. How did he do it? With incredibly long hours, amazing energy and hard work, coupled with a zest for politics -- in the best sense -- and legendary legislative mastery acquired over the years. His staff knew that when he was starting an initiative, his first priority instinctively was to win over as staunch a conservative as he could find to be his partner and original co-sponsor. It worked so many times. Sometimes, he would leave an evening event where he was the honoree before it had ended. The next day, a cynical scribe might note that shortly after receiving his award, ""Kennedy bugged out early."" I knew that the senator had gone home to be able to help his son with homework or put him to bed, and then had begun a late-night briefing with staff to prepare for an important hearing the next morning. Finally, over a life of personal trials and tribulations, Kennedy had developed great ""empathy"" -- a word recently much maligned, but all-important in the Senate's staid, marble halls. He had endured the physical and emotional pain that enabled him to feel the pain of illness, discrimination or disability endured by others. You could see that he did, as he gently helped a tearful witness through difficult testimony at a Senate hearing. Kennedy knew well that on Capitol Hill you tried for a full loaf, sometimes took half of one and, if necessary, you planted the flag, took a slice and came back another day for more. But he also remembered Frederick the Great's admonition: ""L'audace, toujours l'audace (boldness, always boldness.)"" The 1965 Voting Rights Act, the crown jewel of modern civil rights laws, revolutionized America. In small Mississippi towns and elsewhere in the South where African-Americans once feared walking past the sheriff's office, they now may be the elected sheriff, mayor or state senator. The same is true for Hispanics in parts of the Southwest. The Act's two main parts are Section 2 and Section 5. Section 2 is a permanent, nationwide prohibition against electoral discrimination. Section 5 requires preclearance by the U.S. attorney general of election law changes in jurisdictions covered by the provision. From the beginning, Section 5 was controversial and was set to expire in 1982. In 1980, however, a Supreme Court ruling had gutted the equally important Section 2 with a statutory misinterpretation. Kennedy had to decide which section to save. The nation's civil rights coalition urged him to go for both. Many Democrats warned that trying to preserve both was a bridge too far and that Kennedy would risk losing everything. After much debate, and uncertainty, he firmly decided to go for broke, and ""ran the table."" Section 5 was preserved for another 25 years, while the statutory clarification of Section 2, combined with the 1990 census, dramatically increased the number of minority members of Congress. Kennedy was interested in results. At the outset of Watergate, long before it became a constant headline, he and his staff started the Senate investigations, fully apace with the Washington Post, and unearthed the ""dirty tricks project"" of the 1972 Campaign. But he came to realize that a Kennedy was not the most appropriate person to chair hearings on the Nixon White House and supported Majority Leader Mike Mansfield's creation of the select ""Ervin Committee"" to finish the job. Kennedy's intense pursuit of the causes he championed was matched by his fabled sense of humor. I enjoyed both his huge store of anecdotes and his gentle barbs, except when I was the target. Sitting in the back of the Senate chamber behind him and Sens. Edmund Muskie, Walter Mondale, Eugene McCarthy and Phil Hart while they regaled each other with the foibles of Washington was a treat that helped lighten the often tense atmosphere of debate on heated issues. Occasionally, he missed the humor in the situation, especially if advance work for his events wasn't up to his standards. I remember Kennedy rebuking Bob Shrum, his speechwriter, and me for running late as he weaved through traffic from his suburban home to an interview by civil rights leader and radio host James Farmer. Shrum kept assuring him that the interview would be prerecorded and could be taped whenever they got there. Then, at a stoplight, a cabbie leaned out his window and yelled: ""Hey Ted, you're late. They're all waiting for you."" It turned out that, because Kennedy had been in the news a lot, Farmer had decided to do the interview live on his daily show. Needless to say, Kennedy did not laugh. Superseding these and many other recollections of Kennedy the senator is my vivid memory of him as a person uniquely able to distract and comfort others in distress. On time stands out. When my first Senate boss, Phil Hart, was in the last stages of his battle with cancer, Kennedy spent hours by his side offering humor, Irish tales and Senate banter almost endlessly, as Chris Dodd and many others have now done for him. Hopefully, we will see his like again. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Burton Wides.","Burton Wides: In the tabloids, Ted Kennedy was viewed as a playboy .

"Editor's note: Erica Williams is deputy director of Campus Progress, a project of the Center for American Progress, a Washington-based organization that describes itself as dedicated to progressive causes. She works to engage the millennial generation and other underrepresented communities in the political process. She can be found at ericawilliamsonline.com and on twitter at @ericawilliamsdc. Erica Williams says Ted Kennedy consistently exemplified the hope for an open, just and inclusive America. (CNN) -- Sen. Edward ""Ted"" Kennedy may have been 77 years old, but he embodied the spirit, determination and core values of my generation -- the millenials -- in a way that no other senator has in our lifetime. How ironic that the passing of one of the oldest and longest serving senators has left me, a 25-year-old woman, frantically searching for a fierce, dedicated ally for causes that concern young Americans. As a young person with equal parts hope in -- and criticism of -- America's body politic, I value the length of time Kennedy spent championing the causes of those constituencies that are traditionally underrepresented in the political process and also the tenacity, savvy and consistency with which he did it. When I first began working in politics, advocating for the political empowerment and representation of young people, I quickly learned that Kennedy not only fought for us, but also eagerly and wholeheartedly worked with us. He spoke at student rallies, held press conferences with youth organizations and ensured that his staff kept an open and accessible ear to the interests, concerns and needs of those of us who worked full time to engage young people. Ultimately, the proof was in the pudding. Some of his most memorable accomplishments were those that centered on young people in an explicit way. In 1970, at the height of the Vietnam War, when young men were dying in record numbers, Kennedy championed an amendment to the Voting Rights Act that lowered the voting age from 21 to 18. He felt that those old enough to risk their lives for their country were old enough to have a voice in its elections. Kennedy was also a consistent, hard-working and effective advocate for making higher education affordable and accessible. He steadily worked toward his goal of reforming the student financial system and played a valuable role in nearly every major federal student-aid program in our nation's history, from Pell Grants in 1972 to the Academic Competitiveness and SMART Grants for high-achieving low-income students in 2006. He was also a chief architect of the federal direct-loan program, in which the government lends money to students through their colleges. He consistently opposed efforts to eliminate programs and offered dozens of budget amendments to increase the maximum Pell Grant. He worked to reauthorize the Higher Education Act in 2008, which expanded federal grant aid, put new regulations in place to prevent abuse of student lending, simplified the student application process for federal aid and established debt forgiveness for public service. Even as he neared the end of his life, Kennedy prioritized those at the beginning of their own. He championed the Serve America Act, signed into law just this year, which created 175,000 positions in public service in AmeriCorps and other organizations that work on education, health care, energy and veterans services. But these policies speak only partially to his connection to young people. The surge of young voters who came to the polls in record numbers last year weren't just voting for a candidate. Nor were they voting for an ""issue."" They were voting for a political philosophy, culture and core set of values that were overwhelmingly progressive. Social justice, equality, economic opportunity, accountability, openness of government, inclusiveness -- this was the foundation of the 2008 youth vote mandate. It was in this way perhaps, greater than any other, that the current generation of young people identified with and appreciated the work of Ted Kennedy. Beyond his role in advocating policies with clear implications for young people, he consistently exemplified the hope for an open, just and inclusive America -- the platform that young Americans overwhelmingly supported during the election. To Kennedy, young Americans weren't just young voters. We were young citizens, people who deserve equal access to an affordable education, a voice in our nation's political process. He didn't view our concerns and needs as fanciful, impetuous dreams of youth. He realized and valued the unique gift that we bring to this country when given the opportunities and access to make our voices heard.

"(MNN.com) -- I don't remember where I was going when that stray dog weaved across a busy street near my home. But I do remember turning the car around to rescue the white pup with large tan spots that looked more like stains, except for one heart-shaped patch on her side. As cars sped past, I stood at the side of the road and waited for her to get comfortable around me. Eventually, she approached my extended hand and I was able to coax her into my car. I named the dog Honey and worked with a local rescue group called Atlanta Animal Rescue Friends (AARF) to find the sweet pooch a forever home. Not every encounter leads to a happy ending. But with care, you can help a stray dog find its forever home. MNN: 11 of the bravest dogs in history . Exercise caution: You don't know the dog's history, so it's important to avoid getting bitten. That means remaining cautious as you approach the dog. If it has been roaming for a while, or lived chained outside, the dog may be overly skittish around humans. ""If it's afraid, a dog's first instinct is to run and the safest thing is to let it go,"" says Mike Upshaw, a Georgia police officer who also trains dogs. ""If the dog's hackles are raised and its tail is up, turn around and walk away."" He advises waiting for the dog to grow more comfortable around you, which may take some time. If you fear that the dog may be in danger of being hit by a car, place a call to your local animal control and provide a description of the dog, the area where you saw it and the location in which it was heading. If a stray dog becomes a regular sight in your neighborhood, try to build a relationship over time. Upshaw suggests keeping a few dog treats in your pocket so that the treats have your scent. Leave them in that area each time you pass it, and hopefully the dog will grow more comfortable with you. When the opportunity arises, stand a safe distance from the dog and allow it to approach you. Extend your hand, letting the dog sniff you. If it tolerates petting, proceed with caution and move slowly. MNN: Tornado survivor says his dogs warned him . Start the search: . When I found Honey, our first stop was the neighborhood pet store, where I asked for help spreading the word about her. They kindly offered a leash so that I could safely transport her to my house. (Unlike my rambunctious dog Lulu, who hates car rides, Honey settled in and didn't make a peep. If anything, she seemed curious about the next leg of her journey.) You should also visit your nearby animal shelter to drop off fliers featuring the dog's photo, a general description and contact information. Limit interaction with your pets: Until you have a better understanding of the dog's health and temperament, it's best to limit interaction with your pets. Honey's first destination at my home was the tub, where she got a good long bath. Fleas dotted her white fur like pepper in a saltshaker. After the bath, we took a walk and I snapped a few photographs to post online. It took a few days before she got to meet my dog, Lulu. Upshaw says that your pets may take issue with others attempting to join their pack. During the first meeting, keep dogs leashed and limit interaction to sniffing until they become comfortable together. ""Even with dogs from the same litter, skirmishes will happen,"" he warns. MNN: Southeastern shelters swamped by pets misplaced by storms . Schedule a checkup: Since your new houseguest will be sticking around for a while, it's best to schedule a checkup. Your veterinarian can provide clues about the dog's age and breed. The vet also can check for the presence of a microchip, which could ensure a happy reunion. If your vet is closed for the day, see if a 24-hour emergency veterinary clinic is willing to quickly scan the dog for a chip. Also, those chips are worthless without up-to-date information on file. Pet owners: Make sure you have submitted your most recent contact information to the chip company. Your vet can provide info on how to upload new information. As for your stray, many vets offer discounted services. Consider getting a rabies vaccination, too. If you want to get it spayed or neutered, there are low-cost options available. Check the ASPCA website for programs that offer free or discounted programs in your area. Once you get a clean bill of health, it is OK to gradually introduce the new animal to your pets. Kids should never be left unattended around animals, especially when you don't know the pet's history. Use extreme caution when allowing children to interact with the stray dog. MNN: How to make the vet less scary for your pet . Start spreading the news: It can take time for strays to reunite with their owners, if it happens at all. Start building buzz about your new houseguest by posting fliers in the general vicinity of where you found your stray, as well as pet-friendly locations such as nearby dog parks, pet stores and veterinary clinics. Sites like Petfinder.com allow you to post a free classified ad that lasts 180 days announcing your found pet. If there is no response after a few weeks, you may need to secure a forever home for the dog. Connect with a rescue group: Most county animal control facilities are packed with pets in need of homes, and they are reluctant to take in a stray. If you are willing to foster the dog for a while, a local rescue group may be the best way to help find a forever home. Rescue groups are like pet PR firms, focused on finding the perfect love connection between pets and people. Animal shelters happily work with rescue groups because it relieves overcrowding. In exchange, rescue groups set up adoption fairs and actively seek pet lovers to adopt. MNN: Adopting a dog? How to find the right fit . Your stray is already at an advantage because you can provide valuable information to prospective owners about its personality, age and demeanor around other people and pets. All of these details can help this animal find a home more quickly. Under Lulu's guidance, Honey also learned a few tricks such as how to pour on the charm during rescue fairs. The photo of Honey that I took after her first bath was the one that sealed the deal for her future owner. Thanks to that white dog with a heart-shaped patch on her side, I now travel everywhere with a leash, bottled water and a few dog treats in my car ... just in case life gets in the way. I encourage you to do the same. The next leg of your journey will never be the same. © Copyright 2011 Mother Nature Network .","The next time you see a stray dog, consider stopping to help it out .

"(CNN) -- Another child has been infected with a rare, brain-eating parasite, less than a month after an Arkansas girl ended up in a hospital, fighting for her life. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed another case of this amoeba, called Naegleria fowleri, in Florida, a spokesman told CNN Tuesday. The patient is 12-year-old Zachary Reyna, his family told CNN affiliate WBBH. Reyna's family told WBBH that Reyna was kneeboarding with friends in a water-filled ditch by his house on August 3. He slept the entire next day. Reyna is an active seventh grader, his family said, so sleeping that much was unusual. His mother took him to the hospital immediately. He had brain surgery, and doctors diagnosed him with primary amoebic meningoencephalitis, according to WBBH. The family said he is currently in the intensive care unit at the Miami Children's Hospital. The CDC says it has been in touch with the patient's doctors and has released the same experimental anti-amoeba drug used to treat 12-year-old Kali Hardig in Arkansas. Reyna's family told WBBH he is also being treated with an antifungal medicine and antibiotics. Getting this parasite is extremely rare; between 2001 and 2010 there were only 32 reported cases in the United States, according to the CDC. Most of the cases are in the Southeast. The cases are nearly always deadly, but Hardig's case is giving the Reyna family some hope. The Arkansas girl was infected with the same rare, brain-eating parasite a couple of weeks ago and was in the intensive care unit at Arkansas Children's Hospital. She is now in rehab, which is ""really a great sign for her,"" hospital spokesman Tom Bonner said Tuesday. She is listed in fair condition. Hardig has shown so much progress that she can now sign her own name, her mother, Traci Hardig, told Bonner. Kali can't talk yet because of a sore throat from the breathing tube and the general grogginess she feels from medication, Bonner said. Hardig's doctors are in largely uncharted territory. Of 128 known cases in the past half-century, just two patients have survived an infection caused by this microscopic organism, according to the CDC. Naegleria fowleri is found in hot springs and warm, fresh water, most often in the southeastern United States. The amoeba enters the body through the nose and travels to the brain. There is no danger of infection from drinking contaminated water, the CDC says. ""This infection is one of the most severe infections that we know of,"" Dr. Dirk Haselow of the Arkansas Department of Health told CNN affiliate WMC about Hardig's case. ""Ninety-nine percent of people who get it die."" Why 'nightmare bacteria' on the rise . Dr. Sanjiv Pasala, one of Hardig's attending physicians, says doctors immediately started treating Hardig with a new experimental anti-amoeba drug they received directly from the CDC. They also reduced the girl's feverish body temperature to 93 degrees. Doctors have used that technique in some brain injury cases as a way to preserve undamaged brain tissue. Several weeks ago, doctors checked the girl's cerebral spinal fluid and could not find any presence of the amoeba. Willow Springs Water Park in Little Rock is the most likely source of Hardig's infection, the Arkansas Department of Health says. Another case of the same parasite was reported in 2010 and was possibly linked to Willow Springs, a three-acre sand-bottom, spring-fed lake. ""Based on the occurrence of two cases of this rare infection in association with the same body of water and the unique features of the park, the ADH has asked the owner of Willow Springs to voluntarily close the water park to ensure the health and safety of the public,"" the health department said. Willow Springs' website says its water is pH-balanced, chemically treated, chlorinated and routinely monitored by the health department. What's in your pool water? The first symptoms of primary amoebic meningoencephalitis appear one to seven days after infection, including headache, fever, nausea, vomiting and a stiff neck, according to the CDC. ""Later symptoms include confusion, lack of attention to people and surroundings, loss of balance, seizures and hallucinations,"" the government agency's website states. ""After the start of symptoms, the disease progresses rapidly and usually causes death within one to 12 days."" Here are some tips from the CDC to help lower the risk of infection: . • Avoid swimming in fresh water when the water temperature is high and the water level is low. • Hold your nose shut or use nose clips. • Avoid stirring up the sediment while wading in shallow, warm freshwater areas. • If you are irrigating, flushing or rinsing your sinuses (for example, by using a neti pot), use water that has been distilled or sterilized. CNN's John Bonifield and Caleb Hellerman contributed to this story.","NEW: Family says Zachary Reyna is receiving same drugs as Kali Hardig .

"Editor's note: Ted Sorensen was special counsel and adviser to President John F. Kennedy. Ted Sorensen says the Kennedys are not American royalty, but have dedicated themselves to service. NEW YORK (CNN) -- With the death of John F. Kennedy's brother, Senator Edward M Kennedy, and their sister, Eunice Shriver, the founder of the Special Olympics for the developmentally challenged, there has been a wealth of news stories -- obituaries and otherwise -- about the recurring tragedies endured by what some call America's ""royal family."" All of these comments are well intended but off the mark. The Kennedys have been a remarkable family since its founding roughly a century ago by Joseph P. and Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy. But, its members have never asked for pity or privilege. Their history has emphasized more success than tragedy. Their love of family and country stood out during some of the most cynical and selfish periods in recent American history. Like any large family, particularly one which deservedly remained in the public eye for many decades, a large number of afflictions and setbacks, also in the public eye, was unavoidable. Nevertheless, the members of that family have never considered themselves ""royal"" or entitled to special privileges. We have no royalty in America, but ever since the Adams family sent several generations to public service in the earliest days of our nationhood, other families have demonstrated similar interests and commitments to public service. The Kennedys were taught as children and genuinely believed that American citizenship was a special privilege and honor, in return for which every citizen had an obligation to serve and help the country. Even the youngest generation of Kennedys today acts not out of a sense of entitlement but a sense of commitment. From the beginning, those members of the family who held or sought public office had the courage to take public positions on controversial issues, not always approved by the leaders of their party, church or respective constituencies. Nevertheless, they stood up and spoke out for what they believed was right, regardless of political and personal consequences. In short, they have had a proud tradition of becoming -- not merely writing about -- profiles in courage. As the result of the elder Joseph P. Kennedy's success in business, many of his descendants could have lived lives of luxury and ease. After all, they liked family fun, in the sun, on the water, sometimes competing with as well as teasing each other. Yet, they devoted and donated more of their valuable time than most families to the service of others, their country, their communities, and those who did not have their good fortune, good education and good opportunities to lead. President John F. Kennedy was their star, their pride, their model and their leader. But his siblings, Robert, Edward, Eunice, Pat and Jean all played their own special roles, making their own special contributions throughout their lives. This country has long been a wealthy country, with all its wealth of brilliant and devoted leaders and traditional ideals. But it would have been a much poorer country without the Kennedys. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ted Sorensen.","Ted Sorensen: People have focused on the tragedies endured by Kennedy family .

"Buenos Aires, Argentina (CNN) -- Latin America's first same-sex marriage, set to be held in Argentina on Tuesday, appeared derailed after a judge filed an injunction to stop the union until the issue can be reviewed further. Judge Marta Gomez Alsina's ruling blocks an earlier holding by another judge that found city laws banning same-sex marriage unconstitutional, the court said in a statement. Alex Freyre and Jose Maria di Bello had planned to make their marriage official at a civil ceremony and chose December 1 because it is World AIDS Day. The registrar responsible for the civil marriages in Buenos Aires has been notified of the ruling, the court said. The couple would attempt to get their wedding license anyway, the official Telam news agency reported. ""We're continuing with the preparations because we, as planners, nor the couple itself, have not been notified"" of the injunction, said Maria Rachid, president of the Argentine Federation for Lesbians, Gays, Bisexuals and Transsexuals, according to the news agency. Gomez Alsina's injunction could not overturn the earlier ruling because she is a trial-level judge and not an appellate judge, Rachid said. The original ruling was made on November 10 by another trial-level judge, Gabriela Seijas, who responded to a petition made by Freyre and di Bello. Seijas ruled that the ban on same-sex marriage was illegal and ordered the proper authorities to grant the couple a marriage license if they applied for one. The court's decision applied only to Buenos Aires. Same-sex unions in most of Argentina remain illegal. ""The law should treat each person with equal respect in relation to each person's singularities without the need to understand or regulate them,"" Seijas said in her ruling. Buenos Aires Mayor Mauricio Macri said after the ruling that his government would not appeal the decision. Monday's ruling was a temporary measure to postpone the marriage until Seijas' original ruling could be reviewed in depth, presumably by an appeals court or the supreme court, the court statement said . Countries in Latin America, a region strongly identified with the Catholic Church, have recently given more attention to gay rights. In September Uruguay became the first Latin American country to allow same-sex adoption. Brazil, Colombia and Ecuador are also addressing the issue of same-sex civil unions.","Freyre and Di Bello's marriage was to coincide with World AIDS Day on Tuesday .

"(CNN) -- An Amnesty International report issued Wednesday blasts Shell Oil Co. for its handling of the hundreds of oil spills that occur each year in Nigeria and accuses the company of ""serious deficiencies and abuses"" that render ""wholly unreliable"" its claims about how much oil is spilled and how often. The 80-page report, titled ""Bad Information -- Oil Spills in the Niger Delta,"" cites corrosion, poor maintenance, equipment failure, sabotage and oil theft as causes of oil spills. But it challenges the company's assertion that the vast majority of the spills are caused by sabotage and theft. ""There is no legitimate basis for this claim,"" the report says. ""It relies on the outcome of an oil spill investigation process -- commonly known as the Joint Investigation Visit or JIV process -- in which the companies themselves are the primary investigators."" Reliable data about the spills is critical to limiting the harm they can cause to the environment, livelihoods and human health, the report says. Determining their cause is critical because communities affected by spills blamed on sabotage or theft get no compensation in Nigeria, which is itself a flaw, the report says. ""Oil companies should be held responsible for a spill that is due to sabotage or theft if the operator has failed to take sufficient measures to prevent tampering with its infrastructure,"" it says. In response, Shell -- in a statement sent to CNN by spokesman Ross Whittam -- said: ""The Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Ltd (SPDC) firmly rejects unsubstantiated assertions that they have exaggerated the impact of crude oil theft and sabotage to distract attention from operational performance. ""We seek to bring greater transparency and independent oversight to the issue of oil spills, and will continue to find ways to enhance this. These efforts include publishing spill data online since January 2011 and working with Bureau Veritas, an independent third party, to find ways to improve the immediate response to a spill."" The Amnesty report acknowledges improvements since 2011, but says ""serious flaws remain"" in the company's oil spill investigation process. ""These include weaknesses in the underlying evidence used to attribute spills to sabotage and the fact that the JIV reports are filled out by Shell after the joint investigation process -- not as part of the joint investigation process. There is, consequently, a lack of transparency and oversight in terms of what is recorded on the new JIV reports."" But Shell said in its statement that SPDC cannot control the joint investigation process, since it involves representatives of regulatory bodies, the Ministry of Environment, the Nigerian Police Force, the state government and affected communities. The company cited a recent report from Britain's Chatham House that said an average of 100,000 barrels of oil were stolen each day in the first quarter of this year. ""Coordinated action from the industry, government, security forces, civil society and others is needed to end this criminality, which remains the main cause of oil pollution in the Delta today,"" it said. ""SPDC regrets that some NGOs continue to take a campaigning approach rather than focusing on on-the-ground solutions that bring societal benefits."" Audrey Gaughran, director of global issues for Amnesty in London, rejected the company's characterization of the report's claims as ""unsubstantiated."" ""The assertions are very well substantiated in the report,"" she said in a telephone interview. ""We've taken the process down step by step, with expert advice, and provided individual cases, and all of this was provided to Shell beforehand to seek responses, and we got no responses to anything."" She also disputed the company's description of Bureau Veritas as independent. ""Bureau Veritas is hired by Shell,"" she said. And she said the Chatham House report is irrelevant. ""Yes, it documents significant theft,"" which is a serious issue, she said. But, she added, ""Theft is not oil spills. Proving there's loads of theft doesn't prove there's lots of oil spills due to the theft.""","Amnesty International cites ""serious deficiencies and abuses""

"Washington (CNN) -- U.S. officials warn the threat posed by a lone gunman or a group with small arms is a serious concern to law enforcement. A joint intelligence bulletin issued by the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI cites the July attack in Norway as one very deadly example. Anders Behring Breivik allegedly shot and killed 69 people on the Norwegian island of Utoya. Authorities say earlier that day a vehicle bomb made by Breivik exploded in Oslo and killed eight people. The U.S. law enforcement bulletin issued Tuesday warns Breivik's preparations went undetected. The memo, which was obtained by CNN, says Breivik ""is believed to have acted alone and used legal methods to procure the vast majority of materials and weapons needed for his operation, successfully avoiding law enforcement suspicion."" In an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Tuesday, President Barack Obama expressed concerned about lone wolf actors ""being able to carry out wide-scale massacres of the sort that we saw in Norway."" He called the lone wolf worry ""the most likely scenario that we have to guard against right now."" A law enforcement official told CNN the alert sent to state and local law enforcement was a ""cautionary kind of thing"" and was not the result of intelligence concerning a possible upcoming attack. The official noted the upcoming 10th anniversary of the September 11 terror attacks, but quickly added law enforcement is always worried about catching lone actors before they strike. The document lays out the singular challenge for law enforcement presented by lone wolves: ""Attacks by lone offenders -- which by definition lack co-conspirators, and therefore provide fewer opportunities for detection -- may be more difficult for law enforcement and homeland security authorities to disrupt."" Transportation Security Administration chief John Pistole says the lone wolf scenario remains a concern, and intelligence is the ""best tool"" to prevent it. ""There are a number of trip wires in place around the country that the FBI and others have, state and local police. Those are the best opportunities to detect and deter a possible terrorist. That being said there are those individuals -- lone wolves that I referred to -- that do things on their own,"" Pistole told CNN. Speaking before the U.S. Chamber of Commerce at a ""See Something, Say Something"" public awareness event on Wednesday, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said, ""We're seeing smaller plots using a variety of techniques ... we're also seeing the rise of activities by individuals who are actually in the country. And they're acting by themselves. And that kind of attack is the most difficult to prevent."" However, the United States has had success detecting lone wolf plots. The bulletin points to the July 27 arrest of an AWOL soldier named Naser Abdo who allegedly wanted to attack soldiers at gathering spots near Fort Hood in Texas. The document says law enforcement found bomb-making materials in Abdo's hotel room but law enforcement was alerted in time to avert an attack thanks to a warning from a gun store employee who found Abdo's behavior suspicious. But another plot involving Fort Hood was not detected, which resulted in tragic consequences. In November 2009, Army Maj. Nidal Hasan allegedly opened fire in a center where soldiers were preparing to deploy overseas. Armed with two pistols, Hasan allegedly killed 13 people and wounded more than 30 others. The bulletin also warns terrorist groups overseas ""have long favored small unit assault tactics, in which small teams of operatives storm a target using small arms to defeat security."" U.S. officials say they have found ""no information indicating transnation terrorists have attempted to execute a small-unit assault operation in the homeland."" But the document lists two homegrown plots that were disrupted. One involved six people found guilty of plotting to attack a military base at Fort Dix, New Jersey. A second one listed by DHS and FBI officials concerns two men who allegedly wanted to strike at a Military Entrance Processing Station in Seattle. CNN's Jim Barnett contributed to this report.","Homeland Security cites the July attack in Norway in its bulletin .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Massachusetts Sen. Edward Kennedy on Wednesday made his first appearance in Congress since being diagnosed with brain cancer nearly two months ago, casting a single vote to help break a Republican filibuster of an important Medicare bill. Colleagues greeted Kennedy with a lengthy standing ovation on the Senate floor just after 4:15 p.m. The bill would reverse a 10.6 percent cut in Medicare payments to doctors. The cuts in Medicare payments -- part of a scheduled cost-saving formula -- went into effect July 1, although the Bush administration said it will hold off processing claims until mid-July to give Congress time to reach a compromise. In a written statement, Kennedy said, ""I return to the Senate today to keep a promise to our senior citizens -- and that's to protect Medicare. Win, lose or draw, I wanted to be here. I wasn't going to take the chance that my vote could make the difference.""  Watch the senators applaud Kennedy's arrival » . A vote on the bill before the July 4 recess fell one shy of the 60 needed to clear a Republican filibuster and advance in the Senate. Senate Republicans joined the White House in objecting to the Democratic-backed bill because it trimmed government support for private insurance programs that provide coverage to Medicare patients. The private Medicare programs are a top policy initiative for Republicans. White House spokesman Tony Fratto says the president's senior advisers would still advise the president to veto the bill in its current form. The vote to end the GOP filibuster on the Medicare bill was 69-30, nine more than the 60 votes needed and two more than needed to override a presidential veto. The senators agreed to consider the bill passed if the filibuster were broken. Kennedy had surgery to remove a tumor June 2 and is now undergoing chemotherapy and radiation treatment. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid talked to Kennedy's wife, Vicki, twice since Sunday about having Kennedy return for the vote, the source said. Reid ""was not pushing, just asking,"" the source said.  Interactive: A closer look at Ted Kennedy » . Kennedy is chairman of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee and is an influential Democrat on health-care issues.

"Dachaoshan, China (CNN) -- Rural China intrigued me because I have never lived there before. The only memory I have is from when I was a child. When I was in primary school, one of my distant relatives died and I attended her funeral in a village in Zhejiang province. I remembered the wooden houses, running dogs and chickens, and the smelly latrine â€” I always feared that I would fall into it. I also tripped a million times on the muddy and rocky roads. I guess I am the Alice who didn't go down the rabbit hole until older. After I arrived in Dachaoshan, a tiny town of 17,000 people, in August 2012, what shocked me most was not the stunning beauty of the terraced fields or the fact that most residents here lived below the poverty line, but how globalized everyone was. More than 10 cell phone stores were crowded into the condensed downtown area. Young people wore fake Armani and Gucci clothing and used smart phones that resembled iPhones. They played ""Gangnam Style"" by South Korean rapper Psy at loud volume and watched NBA together on TV. However, I never saw a single person hold a newspaper or a book outside the school I was assigned to. The only reading materials are either about pig feed and pesticide or the family planning campaign. Families don't attach much importance to education and many students quit even though education is compulsory until the age of 16. At the beginning of the school year, 68 students registered in my 7th grade class of 12 and 13-year-olds. At the end of my first year, the number had dropped to 54. Most of the drop-outs became underage migrant workers in nearby cities; some stayed at home to farm. Two girls I knew got married and are now bearing babies. The ones who chose to stay were not easy to teach either. Due to a lack of early education and a poor academic foundation, many students are far behind the curriculum. Every day, I felt like coaching 54 teenagers afraid of walking to run a marathon with me. Together we faced many difficulties, such as lack of motivation and a sense of inferiority. It's hard to blame the parents. I held a parent conference at the beginning of the school year. The parents of 42 of the 54 students showed up. When I asked them to sign their names, half of them couldn't and had to ask my student to help write; the other half who could kind of did it with shaky hands and squiggly handwriting. I visited the homes of my students more than 70 times in my first year of teaching and got to know more about the community. They live in houses made of wood or cement. Even though electricity is available; families still use firewood or dried corn stalks as fuel to cook so the kitchen usually looks dark and smoky. In almost all encounters with parents, I felt hospitality and respect. They seemed to trust me in every educational decision made for their kids, even though I am an outsider and much younger than them and I occasionally needed translation to understand the local dialect. Many of the parents told me: Please scold and beat my son or daughter whenever necessary. You cannot blame local teachers either. Even though they earned an unexpectedly low salary, had a heavy class load, and worked for six days a week, some made time to learn and improve their teaching. They eagerly came to observe my classes and asked for advice about how to make their classes lively and engaging. They also celebrated my birthday with me and invited me to events like karaoke and barbecues. I felt grateful for their acceptance and the responsibilities offered to me. This semester my classroom was equipped with a ""smart' whiteboard and a computer but students still have to share dilapidated wooden desks due to lack of funds. Before I joined Teach for China, I wanted to pursue academic study in anthropology. This goal has changed due to my experience in the classroom. I fell in love with teaching. I want to become an exceptionally excellent teacher -- a person who listens to and answers her students' needs, who kindles a fire to learn in each kid and turns every possible moment into a learning fiesta.

"(CNN) -- Disgust, anger and shock greeted official statements from South Korean authorities that texts and social media posts from survivors trapped inside the stricken ferry had been faked. Messages such as ""I am still alive... in the cafeteria please help me my battery is running out please believe me,"" and ""My phone is not working I am inside the boat I can't see anything"" were spreading on social media on Thursday -- as late as over 24 hours after the incident. The messages gave extra substance to hope at least some of the hundreds of missing passengers were alive and awaiting rescue. News and rumors of the texts circulated around families of the missing. The purported texts contained so much detail, they made relatives ""surprised and excited,"" one mother said earlier this week. The texts also fueled a tense atmosphere at Jindo -- where distraught families viewed them as proof several passengers were alive. This led to remonstrations and the hurling of objects at authorities, who relatives accused of not doing enough to save their children. ""An investigation from the Police Cyber Terror Response Center verified that all texts in question [from passengers still within the ship] are fake,"" South Korea police posted on its official Twitter account. ""Please stop such actions that are causing pain to the families of missing passengers. The malicious distributors of these texts will be strictly dealt with."" South Korea has been gripped by this tragedy and the pronouncement of these fake social posts added to the collective anguish -- especially as social media has been playing a crucial role in relaying information from the site. Police successfully put out a call on social media to find any relatives of a rescued six-year-old girl who had been on board with her parents and older brother. The revelations of fake posts have added to a growing sense of public confusion, mistrust and escalating frustration -- particularly among the passengers' relatives -- over the handling of the search and rescue operations, media coverage and official releases of information. Nationwide grief . Across the country, scheduled festivals, concerts and school field trips are among the events that have been canceled. TV networks have been carrying the search virtually non-stop since the incident. All news and top searched keywords on the main Internet portals remain linked to the ship, while wishes for good news are flooding social media. ""Hoping everyone will be returned to the arms of their families ... Please be strong. Remembering the SEWOL disaster ..."" tweeted Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Hyun-Jin Ryu. ""All I can hope for is that our friends will return alive ..."" tweeted Kim Min Hyuk, a senior at the high school that sent 325 students and 15 teachers on a field trip aboard the ill-fated ferry.

"(CNN) -- For the first time in more than 60 years, America is without a Kennedy on the national stage and it's more than just a sentimental loss to President Barack Obama. The coffin of Senator Edward Kennedy is carried by an honor guard. The last of the Kennedy brothers, Senator Edward Kennedy, died this week of brain cancer at age 77. ""We shouldn't underplay the adverse effect this has on the president's healthcare fight,"" said Democratic strategist James Carville. Kennedy was the youngest of four brothers, the only one who died peacefully. John F. Kennedy, was elected to Congress in 1947, then the White House in 1960 and assassinated in 1963. Brother Robert was running for president when he assassinated in 1968. Their eldest brother, Joe, was killed years earlier in World War II. There are too many surviving children and relatives to count. A few have been in public life, but none of them fully profits from the family's nearly mythical place in the American imagination. Edward Kennedy diminished his own share of that inheritance. He had a well-known fondness for drink in his early years and in 1969, he drove off a bridge with a young woman in the passenger seat. He swam to safety; she drowned. Kennedy persevered and went on to a 47-year career as a prominent and productive member of the Senate. His early endorsement of Barack Obama helped Obama win the White House. After the victory, the new president needed his help for something more. For decades, Kennedy was an ardent advocate of reforming the U.S. healthcare system. Obama has made it the centerpiece of his administration. But support for the plan is slumping across the country and in Congress as well. The rules of the Senate normally require 60 votes to pass legislation without impediment from the opposition. Now the Democrats are down to 59. ""The White House is worried about getting 60 votes,"" said CNN analyst Gloria Borger. ""He was very important to healthcare reform in many respects, not least of which was his vote."" Already some Democrats are saying that his death could actually help win the reforms he wanted. They see him still as an ally in the effort, absent but inspiring. Can the Democrats fill the hole left by Edward Kennedy's death? Sound off below . But the president needed his respected voice, his veteran's skill at negotiating a deal and, of course his vote. Obama will miss him.","Edward Kennedy's death marks end of a dynasty in American political life .

"(CNN) -- A South Carolina mother on Friday asked for forgiveness and mercy, in the eyes of God and a judge, after pleading guilty to two counts of murder for killing her two toddler sons -- saying she hoped to someday reunite with them, ""even though it's not on this side of eternity."" ""I know what happened is ... unusual and it's not my character,"" a tearful Shaquan Duley said in an Orangeburg court after entering her plea. ""I don't know what went on with me."" Authorities have said that on the night of August 15, 2010, Duley suffocated 2-year-old Devean Duley and 1-year-old Ja'Van Duley by putting her hand over their mouths in a room at the Trumps Inn just outside Orangeburg. She then put their bodies into their car seats, drove across town to a boat ramp, put the Chrysler sedan in neutral and sent it into the North Edisto River, they said. Duley's then-5-year-old daughter was not with them at the time. Orangeburg County Sheriff Larry Williams said soon after the incident that authorities believed the deaths were ""a direct response"" to an argument between Duley and her mother, who lived together, the night before. ""I believe she was just fed up with her mother telling her she couldn't take care of the children,"" Williams said. The next month, Helen Duley described her daughter as ""a very loving and kindhearted person"" and a ""good mother"" during a court hearing to consider whether the suspect should be granted the opportunity to post bail. ""My daughter has never been in trouble with the law until now,"" Helen Duley said. Speaking in court Friday, Duley did not delve much into her rationale beyond saying, ""I know I was depressed for a long time, and I hurt for a long time."" She also did not deny any facts as presented by law enforcement, apologizing to her family and ""to this community, to this court (and) to this state for all that has happened."" But, pointing to her lack of a criminal record, she insisted, ""I'm not a bad person at all"" and ""I have a good heart."" Duley also said she prays every day for the opportunity ""to keep (her sons') memory alive by sharing the love that I have for them."" ""My heart hurts every single day because I do not have them anymore,"" she said, addressing Judge Ed Dickson. ""I miss them so much, your honor, and there's nothing that can fill that void."" First Circuit Solicitor David Pascoe pointed out that there was no plea deal, as Duley pleaded guilty to the charges filed. ""I wanted to make sure Shaquan Duley was held accountable for the horrific death of these two boys and that she pled to murder as she was charged,"" Pascoe said. ""I was not willing to plead this case to any charge that carried less than 30 years in prison."" Duley is expected to be sentenced during the week of March 26, according to Pascoe. The judge could sentence her to 30 years -- assuming the two sentences are served concurrently -- to a maximum of life in prison without the possibility of parole, Pascoe said. Even with a less stringent sentence, Duley would get no credit for good behavior or a chance at early release on parole. A month after her arrest, Duley's lawyer, Carl Grant, argued then that his client was suffering from mental illness. He called her ""a very quiet, reserved, caring and fun-loving person who ... was going through a very tough time,"" citing the deaths of two family members, a bout with bone cancer and the challenge of being a single mother. InSession's Jessica Thill contributed to this report.","NEW: ""I don't know what went on with me,"" a mother says after pleading guilty to murder .

"(This Old House Magazine) -- As American as fireworks in July, official state flowers honor the natural diversity of our country. The idea dates back to 1893, when, for a national garland at the Chicago World's Fair, each state was asked to nominate a floral emblem. The sunflower was a shoo-in for Kansas, suggesting ""the majesty of a golden future."" But debates raged in other states as they struggled for consensus on a single bloom. In some close contests, legislators turned to botanists to break a tie. Or they consulted schoolchildren, who, in Colorado, chose the Rocky Mountain columbine and, in Rhode Island, the violet. Most of these picks are common natives that bloom on summer roadsides or are familiar transplants, comfortably at home in their adopted state. Many are also such great all-around garden plants that—no matter where you live—they'll thrive with little fuss, adding notes of carefree Americana to your landscape. No bloom holds more titles than the rose. It's an official emblem for New York, Georgia, North Dakota, Iowa, and Oklahoma, as well as the national flower of the U.S.A. Here, we present 15 state flowers (find the 35 other state flowers at This Old House Magazine), along with growing tips and recommended varieties. Show off your national pride with these favorites. Alabama: Camellia . Camellia japonica . Though native to Asia, the camellia replaced goldenrod as Alabama's state flower in 1927, when the ladies of the state successfully lobbied for the change because they felt its elegance was more appropriate than the wildflower's weed-like looks. Camellia, with its glossy evergreen leaves and large cupped flowers, blooms when few other plants do—in late winter to early spring. Plant partial-shade-loving camellias such as 'Rubescens Major,' shown here, in slightly acidic soil that drains well. This Old House Magazine: 12 Deadliest Garden Plants . Alaska: Forget-Me-Not . Myosotis alpestris . Before statehood, Alaska's territorial legislature picked the wild forget-me-not as its bloom, calling it ""the emblem of the pioneers upon the rugged trail"" in the bill's descriptive marginalia. With its mounding habit and flocks of true-blue spring and summer flowers, it's a charming filler around bulbs and in rock gardens or containers. Fragrant at night, the self-sowing perennial thrives in full to dappled sun and moist, free-draining soil. The cultivar 'Ultramarine' (shown) has a more compact habit than the species, growing only 6 inches high and a foot across. Arizona: Saguaro Cactus Blossom . Carnegiea gigantea . Even before Arizona achieved statehood, the saguaro cactus blossom was selected as the territory's symbol, in 1901; its status was officially signed into law 30 years later. This fragrant, creamy white flower blooms from the tips of saguaro cacti in late spring, opening up at night and early into the morning. It is found exclusively in the Sonoran Desert. This Old House Magazine: Best Garden Flowers for Color All Summer . Arkansas: Apple Blossom . Pyrus coronaria . At one time a major apple-producing state, Arkansas decreed the apple blossom its official flower in 1901. The pink-and-white blooms of Pyrus coronaria (American crabapple tree, shown) are extremely fragrant, appearing March through May, followed in September by clusters of light green to reddish bitter fruits. The tree's relatively small height (6 to 14 feet) and three seasons of interest make it a good candidate for a focal point in the residential landscape. California: California Poppy . Eschscholzia californica . By the 1700s, when Spanish sailors dubbed poppy-blanketed California the ""land of fire,"" indigenous peoples had long valued the wildflower for food and medicine. Emblematic of the Golden State, it's a drought-tolerant, easy-to-sow perennial in mild climates and a winning annual elsewhere, blooming in spring sunshine and closing at night. Sow seeds in well-drained soil and pull most plants once they've faded, but let some go to seed. The most familiar California poppy is orange-gold, but selections range widely: 'Carmine King' has red ruffles with white centers, 'Mission Bells' is a semi-double mix of hues (shown), and 'Thai Silk Lemon Blush' is yellow-cream. This Old House Magazine: Vibrant Blooming Plants for a Late Summer Garden . Colorado: Rocky Mountain Columbine . Aquilegia caerulea . Blue stands for sky, white for snow, and yellow for the state's gold-mining history in this hardy perennial, which got the Colorado children's vote in 1899. Later, ""Where the Columbines Grow"" became the state song, enhancing the appeal of the fragrant wildlife magnet. If you sow seeds in fall, the plants sprout in spring but take another year to bloom. For a head start, plant seedlings in spring, keep them moist, and deadhead flowers to encourage more. Though the Colorado native (shown) is the familiar blue and white, cultivars include dwarf variety 'Red Hobbit' and multihued 'Origami Mix.' Connecticut: Mountain Laurel . Kalmia latifolia . This fragrant, star-shaped flower was first recorded in America in 1624 by Captain John Smith and was designated Connecticut's state flower in 1907. A plant with a past—Native Americans made spoons from the wood—this dense evergreen shrub adapts to a variety of light conditions (partial shade to full sun). Mountain laurel blooms from late spring to midsummer. All parts of the plant are toxic if ingested, so keep away from children and pets. This Old House Magazine: Front Yard Plantings to Make an Entrance . Delaware: Peach Blossom . Prunus persica . In the late 19th century, Delaware's orchards were producing so many peaches—more than 800,000 fruits annually—that the state came to be known as the Peach State. This moniker prompted lawmakers to pass an act, in 1895, adopting the peach blossom as the state flower. A deciduous tree with glossy leaves that follow showy spring flowers, it grows to a modest 25 feet tall, making it a good candidate for a backyard orchard in warmer zones. Florida: Orange Blossom . Citrus sinensis . Adopted as the state flower by the legislature in 1909, millions of these legendarily fragrant white flowers scent the air throughout central and south Florida each spring. Upright, pyramidal flower clusters turn into fruit the following autumn or winter. A compact, evergreen tree that's easy to grow in warmer climates, this citrus tree can be successfully grown as an indoor plant where winters dip below freezing. This Old House Magazine: Avoid Invasives: Plant This, Not That . Georgia: Cherokee Rose . Rosa laevigata . This spring bloomer achieved state-flower status in 1916 under the false impression that it was native to the region. Despite its Chinese origins, the rose has grown naturally throughout the southeast for centuries and became a symbol of hope to the Cherokees who were forced to march the infamous Trail of Tears in 1838. The sprawling climber easily reaches 20 feet in height, and while its sweet-scented flowers are fleeting, its plump orange hips and evergreen foliage offer color in later seasons. Hawaii: Yellow Hibiscus . Hibiscus brackenridgei . Though the hibiscus was designated the territorial flower in 1922, it wasn't until 1988 that the particular species Hibiscus brackenridgei was chosen by the Hawaii state legislature. A sun-loving, profuse bloomer, this shrub is covered in large, pure yellow flowers in spring and early summer. Due to its status on the federal endangered species list, Hawaiians are encouraged to plant this hibiscus, known to the locals as ma'o hau hele, in their home gardens. This Old House Magazine: Grow a Healthy Vegetable Garden . Idaho: Lewis's Mock Orange . Philadelphus lewisii . First discovered and collected by Meriwether Lewis—half of the famed explorer duo—and noted in his journal in 1806, this deciduous shrub was a favorite of Native Americans for making bows, arrows, cradles, and other utilitarian goods. Designated Idaho's state flower over a decade later, in 1931, Philadelphus lewisii grows in full sun or partial shade and tops out at about 10 feet tall. Clusters of small white flowers with a rich orange-blossom scent bloom from late spring to midsummer. Illinois: Common Violet . Viola sororia . Voted in by schoolchildren in 1908, the native wildflower, with its purple-to-white-petaled blooms and heart-shaped leaves, is a common sight in the state's fields and woodlands. Despite its dainty appearance, the violet makes a tough garden plant. The self-sowing groundcover is highly deer resistant, tolerates clay soil, and thrives in full sun in cooler climates or partial shade in warmer zones. Indiana: Peony . Paeonia lactiflora . The peony was designated the Hoosier State's flower in 1957. It was the fourth different bloom to hold the title in less than 100 years, replacing the carnation, the flower of the tulip tree, and the zinnia. Once established, peonies are winter hardy, relatively pest-free, and can live for 50 years or longer. Early-summer bloomers, peony blossoms may be single, semi-double, or double (such as 'Sarah Bernhardt,' shown), in a range of colors from white to pink to dark red.

"Missoula, Montana (CNN) -- The defense and prosecution agree on this much: Jordan Linn Graham pushed her husband of eight days, and he fell off a cliff to his death in Glacier National Park in Montana. The question for jurors will be whether Graham's act was murder or a case of self-defense that ended tragically. The two sides set out their opening arguments Monday about what took place as Graham's trial began in U.S. District Court in Missoula, Montana. Prosecutors said they would show that Graham, 21, was having serious second thoughts about her marriage before her husband's death and willfully lied to police after it. But her defense lawyers said that the death plunge was an accident resulting from an argument. Graham initially lied to police, they said, because she was afraid she wouldn't be allowed to explain what happened on the cliff edge. Her husband, Cody Johnson, disappeared July 7. Four days later, the FBI says, Graham led friends and relatives to a popular spot in the park, where they found Johnson's body. The young bride at first maintained that she had simply speculated Johnson, 25, might have gone there. But an FBI agent said that she changed her story when she was shown a surveillance photo of the couple entering the park together. Did Montana newlywed blindfold husband before pushing him off cliff? What exactly Graham said next to the FBI will be fiercely contested at the trial. At a pretrial hearing November 15, Graham testified, ""We went on a little stump part and we were in the middle of an argument and he thought I was going to run away. Cody had grabbed me and I thought he was going to push me down. My first instinct was to get him off."" In a court filing, the defense said Graham pushed Johnson away as she removed his hand from her arm, and her husband tumbled over the cliff. But the criminal complaint against her says that in an FBI interview, ""Graham stated she could have just walked away, but due to her anger, she pushed Johnson with both hands in the back and as a result, he fell face first off the cliff."" Her attorney, federal public defender Michael Donahoe, has said the FBI did not record the first hour and 20 minutes of Graham's interrogation. He accused an FBI agent of then making ""an epic effort"" to get Graham to use ""key words"" in a recorded session that would support a criminal conviction. A defense motion says that in two subsequent recorded FBI interviews, Graham said she acted in self-defense and that her husband's fall was an accident. Graham, who had been a part-time nanny, is accused of murder and making false statements. In court on Monday, prosecutors said they would draw on text messages that they say show Graham was unhappy in her marriage and testimony that tracks the formation of her actions to deceive police, including sending herself e-mails from a fake e-mail address. The prosecution's evidence will ""give you a window into Jordan Graham's mental state,"" said Kris McLean for the U.S. Attorney's Office. Speaking for the defense, Andrew Nelson portrayed Graham as young, naive and socially inept, somebody whose own family describes her as withdrawn. She wove a web of lies to police to ""run from the reality of the situation -- instinctively, like a frightened rabbit,"" Nelson said. Graham was scared that no one would let her explain what happened, he said, because everyone loved Johnson but no one liked her. Nelson said Graham admits a degree of responsibility in her husband's death, which he described as the result of an ""argument-grab-push-fall."" But she is not guilty of first- or second-degree murder, he said. The first prosecution witnesses in the case testified that Graham seemed unhappy in her marriage to Johnson. The court also heard text messages that Graham sent around the time of Johnson's death that showed her panic and then her efforts to hide what had happened. Kimberly Martinez, Graham's best friend and matron of honor at her wedding, said Graham had expressed regret just days after marrying Johnson. ""I should be happy and I'm just not,"" Graham wrote in a July 1 text message to Martinez. In texts on July 5 and 6, Graham alluded to possible aggression by Johnson, telling Martinez that he had a temper. Graham told Martinez that she would talk to Johnson about her concerns on July 7, the day of his death. ""If you don't hear from me at all again tonight, something happened,"" she said in text message. That night, after Johnson had plunged to his death, Graham sent Martinez several panicked texts, saying she was ""freaking out."" Jennifer Toren, a friend of Johnson, testified that Graham had lied to her in text messages the day after Johnson's death. In one text, Graham asked Toren if she'd heard from Johnson ""last night or today?"" ""The last thing he said to me was that he was going for a drive with some friends that were visiting,"" Graham tells Toren. The case is being prosecuted in federal court before U.S. District Judge Donald W. Molloy because the incident occurred in a national park. Woman pleads not guilty .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Some New Yorkers may want to reconsider exclaiming ""Thank God"" when arriving at their destination subway station beginning Monday. A coalition of atheist groups will place ads in New York subway stations next week. Or at least that's what a coalition of eight atheist organizations are hoping, having purchased a month-long campaign that will place their posters in a dozen busy subway stations throughout Manhattan. The advertisements ask the question, written simply over an image of a blue sky with wispy white clouds: ""A million New Yorkers are good without God. Are you?"" On October 26, a dozen bustling New York City subway stations will be adorned with the ads as ""part of a coordinated multi-organizational advertising campaign designed to raise awareness about people who don't believe in a god"", according to a statement from the group, the Big Apple Coalition of Reason. New York City's subway system is one of the busiest in the world with more than 5 million riders per day and more than 1.6 billion total passengers in 2008, according to the Metro Transit Authority. Recognizing this, the Big Apple Coalition of Reason decided the ""best bang for the buck"" was to place posters in popular subway stations to capitalize on the amount of potential viewers, says Michael De Dora Jr., executive director of the New York Center for Inquiry, one of the associated atheist groups. De Dora says the ambitions behind the advertisements are threefold. First, the coalition hopes the promotion will enhance awareness of New York City's secular community. He explained that the coalition also hopes to encourage ""talking and thinking about religion and morality,"" as well as support involvement in groups that encourage a sense of a social community for non-believing New Yorkers. John Rafferty, president of the Secular Humanist Society of New York, another member group of the coalition, said the ads are in no way an anti-religious campaign. They are looking to reach out to more people who have similar feelings, but might not be aware of an outlet to express their beliefs, he said. Rafferty and De Dora cite the American Religious Identification Survey, released earlier this year, as evidence of a shift away from organized religion. Those checking ""none"" for religion rose from 8 percent of the population in 1990 to 15 percent in 2008, effectively making ""no religion"" the fastest growing religious identification in the United States. De Dora said that the ""million"" New York nonbelievers mentioned in the advertisements is the result of an extrapolation based on the survey's findings. With more than 8 million residents living in New York's five boroughs, the organization projects more than a million potential atheist New Yorkers. De Dora said individuals ""don't need religion to be good people and productive members of society"" and ultimately he feels that groups of nonbelievers are ""adding to cultural life of NYC."" The United Coalition of Reason, which is a national organization that helps local groups advocate atheist ideas, approached the New York nonbeliever associations in August with an offer of a donation from an anonymous source to help pay for the subway station ad campaign. The donation amount was for exactly $25,000 and specifically allocated for the subway advertising promotion. Rafferty says the groups involved expect no substantial backlash over their ads. Since news of the campaign was made public early this week ""reaction has been mixed,"" De Dora said. He emphasizes that the Big Apple Coalition of Reason ads are not ""forcing issues, they're just getting ideas out there,"" with the hope of fostering discussion in New York. The ads are ""not poking fun at religion and not being outright nasty,"" he said. A year ago some unease was caused by advertisements that ran inside subway cars promoting Islam. While the ads themselves weren't controversial, they were partially funded by an imam of a Brooklyn mosque who served a character witness for convicted 1993 World Trade Center bombing mastermind Sheikh Omar Abdel-Rahman. In a statement to CNN, Metro Transit Authority spokesman Aaron Donovan said, ""The MTA maintains basic advertising guidelines with prohibitions on nudity, four-letter words, and the like. Beyond that, to accord with the First Amendment, our advertising guidelines are written so as to not prohibit the free exercise of religion or abridge the freedom of speech."" According to the Big Apple Coalition of Reason in their statement, the New York City campaign is just one component of a ""nationwide effort"" by the United Coalition of Reason that will see billboards and postings in transit systems across the United States.","On October 26, New York City subway stations will be adorned with the ads .

"(CNN) -- Chiefs of every military branch told a Senate committee Tuesday they opposed letting prosecutors, rather than commanders, handle sexual assault investigations, as one senator has introduced legislation aimed at doing just that. Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin said there may be public confusion about the military's reporting process. Referring to media reports that there is only one way to report sexual assault, the Michigan Democrat asked each of the military heads at a hearing if there currently are multiple options in addition to notifying a unit commander. They replied yes. They also told the committee that instances of commanders ignoring their judge advocate generals' advice in sexual assault cases are extremely rare. Sen. James Inhofe, the top Republican member of the Armed Services Committee, earlier called sexual assault in the military ""an enemy to morale and readiness"" and urged his colleagues to tread carefully in tackling the issue. Inhofe said he is opposed to any legislation ""removing commanders from their indispensable roles"" in the military justice system and noted that military and civilian courts are different animals because members of the military do not enjoy the same rights as civilians. ""There's a risk of unintended consequences if we act with haste without thorough and thoughtful review,"" the Oklahoma lawmaker said. Representatives knock Sen. Saxby Chambliss' comments on sexual assault . The congressional committee called the unprecedented hearing, which includes testimony from the Joint Chiefs of Staff and top military lawyers, after Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-New York, introduced legislation that would remove the chain of command from the process victims go through to get their claims heard. Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; Gen. Raymond Odierno, chief of staff of the Army; Adm. Jonathan Greenert, chief of naval operations; Gen. James Amos, commandant of the Marine Corps; Gen. Mark Welsh, chief of staff of the Air Force, and Adm. Robert Papp Jr., commandant of the Coast Guard, each acknowledged that sexual assault is a serious problem but one that commanders are equipped to handle. They all used their opening statements to the committee to express opposition to Gillibrand's proposal. ""These crimes cut to the heart of the Army's readiness for war. They destroy the very fabric of our force -- soldier and unit morale,"" Odierno said. But while there may be derelict commanders, he said, those are anomalous, and the chain of command must be ""fully engaged and at the center of any solution"" to the issue. The general later said that it was a misconception that commanders handle complaints independently of the military justice system. ""You have a very experienced judge advocate by your side the whole time,"" he said. ""They are taught to rely on their judge advocate generals."" Navy football players investigated in sex assault complaint . Gillibrand was undaunted, emphasizing that commanders would be removed from the process only for the most serious crimes, such as rape and murder. She said she agreed with the military chiefs that ""the chain of command is essential for setting the climate,"" but there is a difference between setting a tone and dealing with serious crime, especially when one of the compounding factors in reporting sexual assault is a lack of trust. ""You have lost the trust of the men and women who rely on you, that you will actually bring justice in these cases,"" Gillibrand said. ""They're afraid to report. They think their careers will be over."" Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Virginia, said 90% of victims who don't report said they didn't do so out of fear of retaliation or because they were deterred after witnessing the treatment of other victims who reported sexual assaults. Gillibrand said there are commanders who are not objective, who don't want women in the military in the first place, who don't know the difference between a ""slap on the ass and rape."" Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina; and Claire McCaskill, D-Missouri, also previously expressed concerns about the military lumping all sexual assault and sexual harassment cases under the category of unwanted sexual contact, rather than breaking out the more severe crimes of rape, sodomy and assault. Gillibrand added that the United States should follow the leads of allies like Israel, Australia and the United Kingdom, all of which, she said, have taken the chain of command out of investigations into serious crimes. Soldiers and sex: Can men evolve? Dempsey replied that he'd prefer a ""constellation of checks and balances"" to help empower commanders and hold them accountable. Amos said he'd be open to removing the chain of command if he thought it would work, but he had no proof it would. A second panel of military commanders, convened after the military chiefs, followed suit with their superiors, saying not only would removing commanders from the investigative process undermine their troops' trust in them, but it would also deny them the effective tool of nonjudicial punishment, known as Article 15. Commanders also must be able to decide whether an allegation should be investigated, or the subject of a court-martial, they said. ""I need to be able to take action against any perpetrator and hold people accountable,"" Air Force Col. Jeannie Leavitt, commander of the 4th Fighter Wing. The commanders' ability to convene a court-martial acts as a deterrent, and Marine Col. Tracy King, commander of the Combat Logistics Regiment 15, said he suspected that an ""overwhelming"" number of Marines would take their chances that an independent prosecutor might be more lenient. ""If you remove my authority to convene a court-martial, the majority of Marines will refuse (nonjudicial punishment),"" King said. The colonel said he was unaware of any instances in which a chain of command retaliated against a serviceman or servicewoman for reporting sexual assaults, but he said there is ""peer pressure against reporting right now,"" an attitude that is changing. McCaskill said she was disappointed in the commanders' testimony. ""It sounds like you all are very bullish on the status quo,"" the senator said, calling the status quo ""not acceptable."" Earlier in the hearing, Dempsey said he has seen numerous proposals that have merit. Among them: prohibiting people convicted of sexual assault from joining the military, administrative discharges for those convicted while serving, requiring commanders to report all claims up to the next commander, and increasing the transparency of commanders' actions. Hagel: Scourge of sexual assault 'must be stamped out' ""Our goal should be to make commanders more accountable,"" he said. Pressed by Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, about whether there are sufficient regulations to prevent convicted sexual predators from joining the military, Dempsey said no. Presently, there are ""inadequate protections for precluding that from happening, so a sex offender could, in fact, find their way into the armed forces of the United States,"" Dempsey said. McCain, a decorated Navy veteran and former prisoner of war, said he could not give a mother ""unqualified support"" if she asked him whether her daughter should join the military. Amos said that the Marines have tackled scourges in the past -- namely, racism after World War II and drug use after the Vietnam War -- and prevailed. Discipline and behavior problems must be handled from the top down, he said. ""A unit will rise or fall as a direct result of the leadership of its commanding officer,"" Amos said. ""They should never be forced to delegate their authority."" He further said that in 43 years, he couldn't think of an incident in which he opposed a judge advocate general's recommendation to prosecute, but he recalled many incidents in which he had ordered prosecution when the JAG advised against it. Levin appeared to agree with the military chiefs. ""The chain of command has achieved cultural change before. For example, two generations ago when we faced problems with racial dissension in the military, and more recently, with the change to the 'don't ask don't tell' policy, and the chain of command can do it again,"" he said. Gillibrand wants to give military prosecutors -- rather than commanders -- the power to decide whether cases are investigated because, she asserts, the current system opens the victim up to retaliation. Gillibrand and others feel commanders cannot be impartial figures, especially if both the victims and perpetrators are under their command. Army suspends general due to allegations of misconduct . Speaking on a third and final panel of the day, Anu Bhagwati, executive director and co-founder of Service Women's Action Network, expressed support for Gillibrand's legislation, saying it would help stop retaliation. ""The first thing it'll do is restore faith and trust in the system. Right now victims don't have any of that. They've lost all hope in the military justice system unfortunately,"" she said. ""I have not met a woman in the military yet who has not experienced some form of discrimination or harassment. When that is, sort of, the average experience of a woman in the military, a culture of harassment is created, and sexual predators will thrive in that culture."" The military has been hit hard over the issue of sexual assault among its ranks, with the Defense Department reporting an estimated 26,000 cases of unwanted sexual contact, ranging from rape to groping, in 2012. That was a 35% jump from 2010, the Defense Department said. The report prompted President Barack Obama, during May 24 commencement exercises at the Naval Academy, to tell graduates, ""Those who commit sexual assault are not only committing a crime, they threaten the trust and discipline that makes our military strong."" A handful of recent high-profile incidents have brought this issue to the forefront: . -- An Army sergeant first class assigned to the sexual assault prevention unit at Fort Hood, Texas, is being investigated for alleged sexual assault, pandering, abusive sexual contact and maltreatment of subordinates. -- In early May, an Air Force officer who worked with an assault prevention unit was charged with sexual battery after being accused of grabbing a woman and groping her buttocks and breasts in a parking lot not far from his Washington office. -- Three U.S. Naval Academy football players are under investigation in an alleged sex assault involving a female midshipman at an off-campus ""football house"" party in April 2012, according to a Defense Department official. The victim says she learned from friends and social media that the players claimed to have had sexual intercourse with her while she was intoxicated, her lawyer said.

"(CNN) -- The racially charged email that led to Atlanta Hawks controlling owner Bruce Levenson giving up his team was discovered after another member of the Hawks leadership made a racial comment, the team's CEO said. In an exclusive interview with CNN, Hawks CEO Steve Koonin said the comment during a June conference call about free agents prompted an internal investigation. That comment was made by Hawks general manager Danny Ferry, Koonin said. Koonin told CNN that Ferry has been punished ""in excess"" for the comment, but gave no details. CNN spoke with a source with knowledge of the Hawks probe who said that Ferry was relaying information that an outside party had given him about player Luol Deng. Deng now plays for the Miami Heat. Hawks owners were on the call, the source told CNN. It's common for a team, when discussing free agent players, to gather information about those players, because they could be given multimillion-dollar contracts. What Ferry relayed was racially insensitive, and that prompted one of the team's owners to say that a closer look at the organization was needed. An investigation began. During that probe, Levenson's email was uncovered. Attempts to reach Ferry on Monday were unsuccessful. On Sunday, Ferry told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution: ""I support Steve (Koonin)'s leadership and greatly appreciate his support. I look to learn from this situation and help us become a better organization."" What we know so far . A two-month investigation . After the June conference call, the Hawks brought in an outside law firm to review the organization from top to bottom, in an investigation that took two months to complete. ""There were 19 people interviewed, 24,000 pieces of evidence looked at, and in that discovery -- that internal investigation -- this email that we released this morning was found, from Bruce Levenson,"" Koonin told CNN's Martin Savidge on Sunday night. ""Bruce was confronted with this email from 2012, and he decided that instead of fighting it ... he thought it was best for the city, for the team, for his family, to walk away."" The email to Ferry -- which bemoaned the high percentage of black cheerleaders and said that white fans may have been scared away by black fans -- led Levenson to announce Sunday that he will sell his controlling stake in the team. Levenson's 2012 email addressed the troubles the franchise faced in attracting more affluent white season-ticket holders. The owner said he had taken a look around Philips Arena and noticed a few things. First, the audience was 70% black, he wrote. The stadium's bars were 90% black. The cheerleaders were black. There were few fathers and sons at the games. The music played in the arena was hip-hop, and the after-game concerts were either rap or gospel acts. ""Then i start looking around at other arenas. It is completely different. Even (Washington) DC with its affluent black community never has more than 15 pct black audience,"" he wrote. Koonin has been the Hawks' CEO for two months. He said he was ""mortified and angry"" about the email and met with the team's players Sunday night. ""It was like walking into a funeral,"" Koonin said of the meeting. ""These are young men who wear our city's name and our logo on their chest. They play for a team, and they are supposed to be supported by their ownership. And ownership failed in supporting them."" Read the email in its entirety . 'I trivialized our fans' In his announcement Sunday, Levenson said he will sell his controlling stake in the team after an ""email two years ago that was inappropriate and offensive."" A man answering the phone at his Maryland home told CNN that Levenson was not taking any phone calls. In focusing on low attendance at Hawks games and the need to boost season-ticket sales and corporate sponsors, Levenson said in his statement, he had spoken with executives about diversifying the fan base and including more suburban whites. During those discussions, ""I shared my thoughts on why our efforts to bridge Atlanta's racial sports divide seemed to be failing,"" he wrote. ""I trivialized our fans by making cliched assumptions about their interests (i.e. hip hop vs. country, white vs. black cheerleaders, etc.) and by stereotyping their perceptions of one another (i.e. that white fans might be afraid of our black fans),"" he said in his statement. ""By focusing on race, I also sent the unintentional and hurtful message that our white fans are more valuable than our black fans."" 'The black crowd scared away the whites' In his 2012 email, Levenson wrote that before his Atlanta Spirit Group bought the Hawks in 2003, thousands of tickets were being given away, mostly to the black community, in an effort to make the arena appear less empty. It was a trend that continued for a couple of years after the Atlanta Spirit Group took over, he wrote in a seemingly informal email rife with punctuation errors and misspellings. ""My theory is that the black crowd scared away the whites and there are simply not enough affluent black fans to build a signficant season ticket base,"" he wrote. ""i never felt uncomfortable, but i think southern whites simply were not comfortable being in an arena or at a bar where they were in the minority."" Levenson derided claims on fan websites that the arena is unsafe or in a bad part of town as ""racist garbage,"" but then suggested an array of changes inside the stadium, all based on race. 'I want some white cheerleaders' ""I have been open with our executive team about these concerns. I have told them I want some white cheerleaders and while i don't care what the color of the artist is, i want the music to be music familiar to a 40 year old white guy if that's our season tixs demo,"" he wrote. He continued, ""i have also balked when every fan picked out of crowd to shoot shots in some time out contest is black. I have even bitched that the kiss cam is too black."" Things had changed since Levenson implemented these suggestions, he wrote, boasting that the crowd was closer to 40% black by 2012, by his admittedly unscientific estimate. That was still four to five times higher than other NBA franchises, he wrote, ""and my further guess is that 40 pct still feels like 70 (percent) to some whites at our games. Our bars are still overwhelmingly black."" While noting this was a sensitive issue, Levenson went on to declare it ""far and way the number one reason our season ticket base is so low. And many of our black fans don't have the spendable income which explains why our (food and beverage) and merchandise sales are so low. At all white thrasher games sales were nearly triple what they are at hawks games."" The year before Levenson wrote the controversial email, the Atlanta Spirit Group sold its NHL team, the Atlanta Thrashers, to a Canadian ownership group that moved the team north of the border. It's now called the Winnipeg Jets. Comparisons to Donald Sterling . In his Sunday statement, Levenson said the NBA should have no tolerance for racism, a sentiment he also expressed during a CNN interview earlier this year when he talked about Donald Sterling, the Los Angeles Clippers owner who was caught making racist remarks on tape. Team owners behaving badly . Discussing Sterling's reluctance to sell the team after the scandal broke, Levenson said in May that, as a fellow team owner, he couldn't be partners with someone who holds those types of views. ""I think I speak for all of my partners when I say we were all deeply offended. We all quickly spoke out against the words we heard on that tape,"" Levenson said. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver, who brought the hammer down on Sterling, called Levenson's 2012 email ""entirely unacceptable"" and commended Levenson for self-reporting to the league office. Levenson told the league in July about the August 2012 email, and the NBA conducted an investigation, the statement said. ""(Levenson) shared with me how truly remorseful he is for using those hurtful words and how apologetic he is to the entire NBA family -- fans, players, team employees, business partners and fellow team owners -- for having diverted attention away from our game,"" Silver said. The league will work with the Hawks to determine the appropriate sale process for the team, Silver said. Koonin, the Hawks CEO, will oversee team operations, the league said. In closing his statement, Levenson said he was embarrassed by the email and apologized to the team and its fans. ""To the Hawks family and its fans, you have my deepest gratitude for the past ten years,"" Levenson wrote. ""Working with this team and its extraordinary executives, coaching staff, and players has been one of the highlights of my life. I am proud of our diverse, passionate, and growing legion of Hawks fans, and I will continue to join you in cheering for the best team in the NBA."" According to the Hawks website, Levenson, a former journalist, co-founded United Communications Group, a portfolio of business information companies, and is a founding shareholder and former board member for TechTarget, a technology media company. Koonin said that while Levenson will make money from the sale, he is still paying a price. ""The only thing we all have in our life is our reputation, and his was damaged today -- by him, and not by anyone else."" Opinion: Levenson and the Hawks' real problem .

"(CNN) -- Hope smells like eucalyptus and lemongrass for the farmers of Ikirezi. The Rwandan co-operative is a producer of essential oils, with ambitious plans to reconstruct communities still scarred by genocide. This month will see the launch of Ikirezi's designer scent ""Patchouli of Rwanda"" in upscale Selfridges of London, as well as many of the world's leading department stores, making its debut alongside the offerings of Chanel and Estee Lauder. This dream comes true courtesy of Canadian entrepreneur Barbara Stegemann, for whom it is all in a day's work. She is the founder of ""7 virtues,"" an enterprise with the rare mission of producing exotic, luxury fragrances of uncompromising quality, and also building successful businesses in the most devastated regions of the world. ""We are up against giants and we shouldn't really exist,"" Stegemann admits happily. ""But you just have to follow your gut and hope that people will connect with what you're doing."" Personal journey . The mission has been deeply personal from the outset for the ex-journalist, which began after a near-fatal ax attack on a serviceman friend in Afghanistan that made her determined to find a way of supporting development in the country. She found it in Abdullah Arsala, a Jallalabad supplier of oils, on the verge of quitting under pressure from the Taliban. Stegemann extended her credit card to its limit to buy a single cup of orange blossom for $2,000, and via a Canadian perfumer released the first bottles in a few local stores. An appearance on entrepreneurial reality TV show Dragon's Den secured her publicity, investment and a long-term business mentor in philanthropist W. Brett Wilson, enabling her to scale up production. Four years later, 7 Virtues has produced fragrances from Afghanistan, Haiti, Iran and Israel, and now Rwanda. Stegemann's line is carried in the boutique stores of Europe and North America, and airlines such as Virgin Atlantic. She has been named one of Canada's most powerful women and her reputation has grown to the point that Bill Clinton invited her on a development trip to Haiti. Giving back to local economies . The business has also delivered for her suppliers, with an estimated $250,000 reaching these local economies. Arsala's distillery in Jallalabad has found new buyers and now employs several thousands in harvest season, with knock-on improvements in local infrastructure and education. Government funding has boosted the business further, as perfume oils are recognized as viable alternative crops to the poppy. ""Barb has become our ambassador,"" says Dr. Nicholas Hitimana, founder of the Ikirezi group. ""I have already received a request for oil because of the story of Patchouli of Rwanda."" Key to Stegemann's approach is the insistence this is business not charity. ""It's not even philanthropy,"" she says. ""I need my suppliers and they need me, so we are equal. That's what separates us from other companies that will donate a dollar for a cause...I was raised in poverty and I know enterprise is the solution, not charity."" Surprisingly, operating from some of the most dangerous parts of the world has not negatively affected the business. ""People say it's a risky supply chain, and I always buy a little extra to be sure, but we have never had a problem. DHL run the most dangerous routes in the world. I have more problems with our local shipping networks."" Stegemann credits persistence and belief for the company's success -- ""forgetting the people that say no."" She has been happy to sacrifice, forgoing a salary to constantly reinvest in order to compete in the elite fragrance world, supplementing her income through a bestselling book about her experiences. She works long hours researching potential supply sources, and is prepared to fly across the world for a meeting. She has also been forced to confront constant risk and rejection, and even the possibility of oblivion, in a cut-throat industry in which most new companies don't survive the first year. The ethical choice . But the 7 Virtues have unique selling points, informed by the production process, that enable them to position their fragrances as the transparent, ethical choice, with more than a trace of feminism. ""We don't use skinny models, movie stars or expensive imagery, just the farmers' stories and their oils with no added chemicals,"" says Stegemann. ""People who can't wear most fragrances can wear ours because of the composition."" ""I have never been comfortable going to a beauty counter because I never felt airbrushed or thin enough - that's scarier for me than Haiti or Rwanda. So I'm happy to be sharing something that doesn't impose upon women or make them feel they need to be externally beautiful in the way that airbrushed imagery tells us to be. We want to change the model at home too, to make the beauty counter a place women that can feel empowered."" The entrepreneur is aware that the finest of ethical credentials would fall flat without an elite product, so she does not compromise on quality and the fragrances' growing popularity suggests they compete on their own terms. Stegemann still has grand plans. Syria and Palestine are among the targets for future scents, and she hopes to deepen her involvement in international development efforts with leading organizations and public figures, to lend her insight to making support for local economies count. But her primary ambition now is about taking business to the next level and making it pay. ""We have gone from thriving to surviving and now I want to prove this business model works. Each year we make more money, and its time to ramp it up now and show people that social enterprise can pay dividends.""","Entrepreneur creates luxury fragrance brand with ingredients from war and disaster zones .

"Columbia, South Carolina (CNN) -- Before the football game, there was lunch. And before lunch, Rick Perry said a prayer. Perry, a devout evangelical Christian, prayed for the health and safety of the Republicans in the room and their families. He prayed for American troops overseas. And he prayed for President Obama. ""We ask you to be with our President, give him wisdom, and open his eyes. In your most holy name. Amen."" He paused. ""OK, fried chicken."" At that, the two-dozen garnet and black-clad South Carolinians made for the barbecue, mac-and-cheese, fried chicken and banana pudding laid out before them in all their high-caloric splendor. South Carolina back in 2016 spotlight . Perry, the Texas governor and likely 2016 Republican presidential candidate, was here at Doc's Barbecue last week headlining a small fundraiser for a state representative named Kirkman Finlay -- the kind of early, IOU-collecting legwork one does in a key primary state when running for president, and the kind of back-slapping environment in which Perry, a masterful retail politician, thrives. We decided to track Perry throughout this spectacle for the first episode of ""Hambycast,"" our new weekly digital series that will look at campaign politics as it actually happens, far away from the scripted events, the self-serious punditry and the kind of buttoned-up Washington tedium that turns so many of us off. Rick Perry takes back tweet . I figured South Carolina, my favorite political state, would be a good place to start. I also figured I could drink a beer and watch some football in the process. I was right on both counts. Perry framed most of his two-day visit to the Palmetto State last week around the South Carolina versus Texas A&M football game, the nationally televised season opener for the SEC and the official start of college football season. He appeared on local television and sports radio to talk up A&M, his alma mater, in a tried-and-true strategy to make him seem like just-one-of-the-guys. It's the kind of thing that Mitt Romney, who once praised ""the crucible of sport"" during an appearance on ""Monday Night Football,"" was never good at. In New Hampshire, Rick Perry says he's getting prepared . Coming off a grand jury indictment back home, Perry was touring New Hampshire, South Carolina and Iowa and basking in the attention of GOP activists who saw the criminal charges in exactly the way Perry hoped they would: as a Democratic witch hunt conducted against a governor who was just doing his job. People were lining up to see him. It was hard to imagine him getting the same kind of reception before the August 15 indictment. 4 reasons why Rick Perry's exercise of power got him in trouble . Perry, holding court in the stadium parking lot in a tailgate-friendly ""Cockaboose"" owned by a local Republican power broker, greeted a cascade of GOP well-wishers, including South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson, Rep. Joe Wilson and a small horde of college Republicans. At Perry's side were his state fixer, former GOP chairman Katon Dawson, as well as a trio of loyal political aides and a retinue of state troopers. Check out the episode to see it for yourself.

"(CNN) -- What happens when you ask a super-car designer to create a super luxurious train? Magic, judging by the above images released by Japanese rail company JR East. Yamagata-born Ken Okuyama, well known in automobile design circles, was brought in to style the company's super slick new Cruise Train, due to start chugging down the tracks in spring 2017. Holding a maximum of 34 passengers, the Cruise Train will have 10 carriages made up of five suites, one deluxe suite, two glass-walled observation cars, a dining car and lounge. Okuyama has worked as a chief designer for General Motors, a senior designer for Porsche AG and design director for Pininfarina, the company behind the Ferrari Enzo and Maserati Quattroporte. According to his company, Ken Okuyama Design, he wanted to create a train that would allow passengers ""to appreciate the flow of the time and space,"" while enjoying Japan's landscapes and culture throughout the journey. One of the more unique features is the observation carriage at the front of the train, which allows passengers to see onto the tracks ahead. The other observation car is at the end of the train. JR Rail says the train will be fitted with furniture that conveys the nobility of traditional Japanese culture. The Lounge, for instance, is wrapped in graceful curves and features decor inspired by trees. All suites will have a private bathroom with a shower and toilet, but the top sleeping space is the split level deluxe suite, which sleeps four. On the bottom are two double beds, on the top a traditional Japanese dining area, with seats on the floor. The train will be able to run on both electric and non-electric rails. Can't wait till 2017? JR East's upcoming Cruise Train won't be the first Japanese train to take the super-luxury route. JR Kyushu's Seven Stars train, which features Japanese and Western design elements, hit the tracks in the fall of 2013. This one only travels through the island of Kyushu and has 14 luxury guest rooms, two deluxe suites, three presidential suites, a lounge car, dining car and bar. Guests can choose either the two- or three-night experience. The name ""Seven Stars"" represents the seven prefectures of Kyushu, the seven carriages of the train and the seven main tourist attractions of the island (nature, cuisine, hot springs, history/culture, spiritual sites, local hospitality and sightseeing). Those who want to take a Seven Stars journey need to apply online. Prices start from Â¥180,000 ($1,765) per person for the two-night trip. No first come first serve here. The company says that in the event that applications exceed available places, a lottery will be conducted to select participants.","Yamagata-born Ken Okuyama designed JR East's new Cruise Train, due to debut in 2017 .

"(CNN) -- As the new school year approaches, President Obama has been traveling around talking about the high cost of education. In a speech given on August 22 in Syracuse, New York, he laid out a plan to rein in the costs, describing affordable and accessible education as ""Washington's highest priority."" But the education system isn't broken -- it's ""fixed."" If we're serious about tackling the issue of affordable education and student debt, we need to strike at the root of the problem -- the influence of money in politics. Private corporations like Sallie Mae -- which own 15% or $162.5 billion dollars of total student debt -- rake in private-island-purchasing profits while students suffer. It's impossible to be on a college campus -- especially a state university -- and not notice the impact of the student debt crisis. The debt weighs on our students. It is as if you could see it in their slumping postures and staggering gaits as they haul boulders and lug chains from class to class. Approximately 37 million students currently hold debt, averaging $27,500 per person and totaling over $1.1 trillion. Saddled with debt, students are giving up on the idea of the American Dream. You know, like the idea that you and your buddy can open up a small ice cream shop in an old gas station and grow it into a multimillion dollar business that cares for the community and delights the world. The truth is, if Jerry and I had had $27,000 of debt in 1978, we would never have taken the risk of opening our first scoop shop. More likely than not, we would have been underemployed and buried in back payments. Obama gets it. In Syracuse, he said: ""The idea used to be that here in America anybody could make it. ... And, unfortunately, what's happened is it's gotten tougher for a lot of folks. So we've got to reverse these trends."" But while Obama talks about creating policies that will benefit the middle class, corporations like Sallie Mae are dedicated to preserving the status quo by showering Capitol Hill with cash. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, Sallie Mae has donated over $1.26 million to federal candidates and parties in the last four election cycles and bankrolled $1.93 million dollars lobbying Congress in the first half 2013. During that time, Congress crafted a student loan bill that tied interest rates to financial markets, which President Obama signed it into law in August. While in the short term, the bill prevented interest rates from doubling, students are more vulnerable in face of an adjustable interest rate that could top 8.5%. Corporations like Sallie Mae borrow at dirt cheap interest rates (subsidized between .23% and .34%) from the Federal Home Loan banks. In contrast, undergraduate students borrow at an adjustable 3.85% and graduate students borrow at an adjustable 5.4%. That's a sweetheart deal for Sallie Mae which raked in $2.5 billion in interest payments from student loans last year, but a terrible deal for students. In a letter to Sallie Mae's CEO, Sen. Elizabeth Warren wrote: ""While Sallie Mae is finding unique ways to profit from government programs, its borrowers are paying interest rates that are far in excess of the low cost of funds supported by the U.S. taxpayers."" It's time to dam the deluge of cash and corporate influence in Washington once and for all. Whether you're a college student, a debt holder, a parent or simply someone concerned about the future of our country, you can help. There is a stampede rumbling across the country to amend the Constitution to declare: 1) Money is not free speech; and 2) Corporation are not people. At StampStampede.org, we're helping to build that movement by legally stamping messages like ""Not to be Used for Bribing Politicians"" on our nation's currency to spread the word and get money out of politics. Every bill is seen by 875 people, so the more stamped bills that enter circulation, the more movement will grow. And it's growing. Thanks to the leadership by groups like People for the American Way, Move to Amend, Common Cause, Free Speech for People and Public Citizen, 16 states have passed referendums calling on Congress to take action and over 150 members of Congress support the amendment strategy. As the new school semester begins, pick up a stamp and help take back our campus and take back Congress. This is our future and our fight to win.

"(CNN) -- A growing number of Chinese are keeping their cash in their wallets this Lunar New Year as the traditional exchange of red packets of money is moving from the physical world into the digital space. The tradition of giving cash gifts of ""lucky money"" (""hong bao"" in Mandarin and ""lai see"" in Cantonese) goes back centuries and can be particularly lucrative for the young and the unmarried. As the country increasingly embraces online transactions and e-commerce models, tradition is taking a back seat to convenience as more and more lucky money recipients prefer to receive their money via electronic means. A recent study conducted by Shanghai-based Avanti Research Partner showed that 58% of respondents preferred their hong bao directly deposited into their accounts. The country is becoming increasingly connected -- over 90% of 18 to 30 year olds in China own an internet-connected smartphone, according to a Global Times survey published last year. Of course, China's internet giants have not been slow to capitalize on this trend, with Shenzhen-based Tencent last week launching their 'New Year Red Envelope' app, an add-on to its phenomenally popular WeChat messaging service. The company's 600 million-plus WeChat users can send each other lucky money through their profiles, provided both the sender and recipient have signed up to the company's in-app payment service. ""I am really happy that I can use a new and fashionable way to send my holiday greetings to my family and friends, especially for people who have kids but live far away from us,"" said Mr. Cheng, a user of the service. The service reportedly banked 18 million RMB ($2.9 million) worth of transfers in its first 24 hours, according to a report in the Beijing Youth Daily newspaper. While Tencent's rival Alibaba also has a similar service, called Hong Bao, which launched last year, WeChat's app allows users to randomly distribute up to 200 yuan ($33) within a group of friends, adding a fun element of unpredictability to the process. Some analysts believe that linking the payments to WeChat's in-app payment service could be a game-changer, as it streamlines the process of paying for microtransactions, potentially making users more likely to make in-app purchases in the future. ""The tradition of giving red packets is a symbolic gesture,"" said Steve Wang, Chief Economist, Reorient Group. ""It's a way to get people more comfortable dealing with money online, and to expand their subscriber base. It leverages the old and the new, and is a great example of the kind of creative idea that we're seeing come out of China these days."" Other online money operations are looking to boost their business by tapping into the cash-giving tradition. In Hong Kong around $64,000 worth of bitcoin vouchers are being distributed by ANX, one of the city's biggest bitcoin exchanges. It is billed as the biggest bitcoin giveaway to date, although each packet, distributed at certain shopping malls, will contain only a HK$10 ($1.29) voucher, which currently translates into 1.4 mBTC. ""The Hong Kong public is increasingly willing to embrace non-traditional ways for lai see,"" says Ken Lo, CEO of ANX. ""We are the first bitcoin lai see that we know about, but can definitely see this as a growing trend especially to give to other people that don't live in the same country. ""The responses so far have been very positive with many people being very happy to learn they have just received their first bitcoin.""

"(CNN) -- Switzerland might not have the magic of Lionel Messi, but in Xherdan Shaqiri it has a player who is desperate to shine on the biggest stage of all. The Bayern Munich star scored a hat-trick to help his nation book a last-16 tie with Messi's Argentina at the World Cup, following Wednesday's 3-0 win over Honduras in Manaus. The Swiss finished with six points from three matches, one behind group winner France, which drew 0-0 with Ecuador. France, which faces Group F runner-up Nigeria in the next round, wasted a number of good opportunities against a side which played the majority of the second half with 10 men. Ecuador captain Antonio Valencia was shown a straight red card for a poor tackle on France's Lucas Digne. Switzerland, ranked sixth in the world, won its opening game before suffering a 5-2 thrashing by the French. But it bounced back against Honduras with the impressive Shaqiri stealing the sow. The diminutive midfielder curled home the opener on six minutes and then ran clear to add his second before the break. Shaqiri then rounded off a counterattack with 19 minutes remaining to seal the win, his third set up by Josip Drmic. It was all too much for Honduras coach Luis Fernando Suarez who told reporters he would leave his role after losing all three group games. ""I am not satisfied by what we achieved at the World Cup,"" he said after the game. ""I think the team will have good results in the future. But I think someone can replace me and produce different results. ""Today is the last day of my contract and I have taken the decision unilaterally not to continue. I want to do something else."" While Honduras heads on home, Switzerland will travel to Sao Paulo to face an Argentina side which won all three of its Group F games. France, meanwhile, will take on Nigeria in Brasilia on Monday following a low-key contest with Ecuador. Didier Deschamps' side had plenty of opportunities to win the game but found Ecuador goalkeeper Alexander Dominguez in inspired form. Dominguez saved from Paul Pogba and Andre Griezemann in the first half as Les Bleus attempted to make the breakthrough. Ecuador, which needed to match Switzerland's result to qualify for the next stage, then suffered a setback when Valencia was sent off for a reckless, studs-raised tackle. But the South Americans still had the opportunity to win the game when Cristian Noboa ran clear on goal only to fire hopelessly wide. France, which threw on Olivier Giroud in attack, had chances late on to win the game but Pogba headed agonizingly wide.","Switzerland defeats Honduras 3-0 to secure second place .

"(CNN) -- Deep down on the bottom of the Baltic Sea, Swedish treasure hunters think they have made the find of a lifetime. The problem is, they're not exactly sure what it is they've uncovered. Out searching for shipwrecks at a secret location between Sweden and Finland, the deep-sea salvage company Ocean Explorer captured an incredible image more than 80 meters below the water's surface. At first glance, team leader and commercial diver Peter Lindberg joked that his crew had just discovered an unidentified flying object, or UFO. ""I have been doing this for nearly 20 years so I have a seen a few objects on the bottom, but nothing like this,"" said Lindberg. ""We had been out for nine days and we were quite tired and we were on our way home, but we made a final run with a sonar fish and suddenly this thing turned up,"" he continued. Using side-scan sonar, the team found a 60-meter diameter cylinder-shaped object, with a rigid tail 400 meters long. The imaging technique involves pulling a sonar ""towfish"" -- that essentially looks sideways underwater - behind a boat, where it creates sound echoes to map the sea floor below. On another pass over the object, the sonar showed a second disc-like shape 200 meters away. See also: Quest for Sir Francis Drake's remains . Lindberg's team believe they are too big to have fallen off a ship or be part of a wreck, but it's anyone's guess what could be down there. ""We've heard lots of different kinds of explanations, from George Lucas's spaceship -- the Millennium Falcon -- to 'it's some kind of plug to the inner world,' like it should be hell down there or something. ""But we won't know until we have been down there,"" said Lindberg. The Head of Archaeology at Sweden's Maritime Museums, Andreas Olsson, admits he's intrigued by the picture, but remains sceptical about what it could be. The reliability of one-side scan sonar images is one of his main concerns, making it difficult to determine if the object is a natural geological formation or something different altogether. ""It all depends on the circumstances when you actually tow the [sonar] fish after the boat,"" he said. See also: World's oldest warship gets facelift . ""What are the temperature conditions, the wave conditions, how deep is your fish in relation to the sea bed etcetera and all those parameters also affects what kind of image you have in the end,"" he explained. Even Lindberg agrees the image ""isn't the best it could be."" But his crew are still planning to return to the site in the calmer waters of spring to investigate their find. It's a risky and expensive business, and not one that always pays off. British maritime historian, Professor Andrew Lambert, says the costs of recovery are now too high for most. ""If you want to stand in a cold shower tearing up Â£50 notes, go shipwreck hunting,"" he said. ""Most shipwrecks are rotting away, or carrying dull things -- all the romance has been taken out of it."" It's a problem Lindberg and his team are aware of. ""It's a very difficult industry to be in -- it's money all the time,"" he confessed. ""The best thing it could be, would be 60 meters of gold -- then I would be very happy."" ""This thing is very far out, it's really off-shore, so first of all we need a bigger ship... more equipment.. and we have to do bottom sampling, water sampling, to see if it is something poisonous."" But even if the mystery object doesn't contain retrievable treasure the site could still prove to be a gold mine for the Ocean Explorer team, with tourists and private investors paying to see it up-close, in a submarine. See also: How to survive a shipwreck . ""The object itself is maybe not valuable in the sense of money it can be very interesting whatever it is, historical or a natural anomaly,"" said Lindberg. In the North Atlantic, one American salvage company is also hoping to beat the odds. Odyssey Marine Exploration -- a company made up of researchers, scientists, technicians and archaeologists -- have at least 6,300 shipwrecks in their database that they are looking to find. Their latest discoveries include two British war-time shipwrecks off the coast of Ireland that could be laden with hundreds of tonnes of silver. Mark Gordon, president of Odyssey, says at least 100 ships on their watch-list are known to have values in excess of $50 million dollars. ""When you think about the fact until the mid 20th century, the only way to transport wealth was on the oceans and a lot of ships were lost, it adds up to a formula where we have billions of dollars worth of interesting and valuable things on the sea floor,"" he said. The lure of treasure has lead to an increasing number of discoveries in recent years. But one which doesn't come without its dangers, warns Olsson. ""I think recently we're entering a time of a lot of discoveries,"" he said of the technological advancements in finding shipwrecks. ""The professional shipwreck discoverers are doing a great effort for cultural heritage management in the long run... what we don't support is the action of actually taking up items and selling them,"" he said.","Swedish treasure hunters have captured images of a mysterious object in the Baltic Sea .
It's estimated around 100,000 objects, mostly shipwrecks, are littered throughout the Baltic .

"(CNN) -- Mention the Italian city of Florence, and people think of history, conjuring images of a classical city that was once Europe's Renaissance capital. In truth, the structure of the city has changed little since the 15th century when Michelangelo, Botticelli and the other great painters and sculptors of the era paraded through its piazzas. But what's it like to explore these ancient streets using the tools of the 21st century? Is it possible to survive in Florence and see it properly armed with just a smartphone? This was the challenge I set myself when visiting the city. No guides or guidebooks. Nothing written down at all, and definitely no help from a friendly local. Getting there . Traveling to Florence using technology is easy. New high-speed rail company Italo has an app and e-booking service. All I need is my phone and booking code to take my seat for the 180 mph (290 kph) journey from Turin. Accommodation is a breeze, too. Florence is one of more than a dozen Italian cities covered by last-minute room booking app Hotel Tonight. The app suggests a couple of places in the humdrum neighborhood near the city's station, but also a riverside artisan workshop turned boutique hotel, Riva Lofts (Via Baccio Bandinelli 98, Florence; +39 055 7130272). A couple of swipes later the room is mine, for $210. When I get there, all rooms in the cheapest category are gone. I get an upgrade to a two-floor suite, with kitchen, bathroom and a floating staircase up to a loft room beneath the original workshop ceiling. So far, so good. A quick check of another hotel reservation app suggests I've saved nearly $70 on my booking. 'Upside-down palace' Like all big European cities, Florence has its share of apps that translate the tried-and-tested format of a paper guidebook onto a screen. Among the best is Too Much Florence, available free for both Android and Apple phones. I appreciate the app's eye for the offbeat. It leads me to Piazza del Limbo, a sad little square close to the Santi Apostoli church. The square earned its name during the medieval period, when children who died unbaptized were buried here. The same app also takes me to the extravagant ""upside-down palace"" of Borgo Ognissanti. The Palazzo Baldovinetti was supposedly decorated with an inverted facade during the 16th century, to thwart the building regulations of a Medici duke. Untappd isn't supposed to be a travel app, but it's exactly the tool you need to find a decent pint anywhere in the world, even here in the heart of wine country. It points me to Beer House Club (Corso Tintori 34r, Florence; +39 055 2476763), a modern bar with neon, foosball, snacks and 10 pumps of artisan beers, including their own brews made in the neighboring city of Prato. Thanks to my four-inch screen, I'm enriched, fed and watered. Sightseeing seems easier than ever. In fact, tech-friendly travel logistics get ever easier, even in the heart of ""old Europe."" When I'm due to meet my family for an onward trip to Naples, a quick search on Trenitalia's Pronto Treno app tells me their train is running 10 minutes late. I don't need to rush in vain. The app even seemed to know their platform before the arrivals board did. (It was wrong, however.) No spare change for Florence's new tram? No problem: a text message to 488-0105 and an SMS comes right back to me, the fare deducted from my prepaid phone account. When on roam . It's not all plain surfing. Mobile phone battery technology hasn't kept speed with the power-hungry HD screens and super-quick quad-core processors inside modern smartphones. On both mornings I set out with a fully charged battery. On neither day did my phone last beyond 3 p.m. The situation with data is perhaps even worse. In 36 hours, I consumed more than 180 megabytes. Seeing Florence from the small screen would have been prohibitively expensive if I was being billed by the megabyte. Roaming charges for travelers originating within the European Union will likely be phased out by late 2015, but that offers no comfort to many visitors, especially with arrivals from China and the rest of Asia growing rapidly. Ubiquitous free Wi-Fi would help. In April, Rome's Fiumicino airport announced it was rolling out free Wi-Fi to all passengers, but for truly wireless travel, connectivity needs to go beyond the gates of the airport parking lot. Of course, none of that is Florence's fault. Behind its medieval walls and ancient traditions, the city is getting ready for a new generation of visitors -- and their gadgets, too. Donald Strachan is a food and travel journalist and co-author of ""Frommer's EasyGuide to Rome, Florence and Venice 2014.""","Is it possible to visit Florence, Italy, and see it properly with just a smartphone?

"(CNN) -- One of Holland's most prestigious pottery makers, the Royal Delft Group, is promoting its heritage to combat the rise of copycat producers selling cheaper versions of traditional blue and white earthenware. Royal Delft Group, now 360-years old, is the only Delft Blue potter with a seal of approval from the Dutch royal family. The company hosts more than 120,000 visitors a year to its Rotterdamseweg base, to showcase how the pottery is made. Watch more: DSM: Europe needs innovation . But the traditional producer is facing challenges from imitators keen to grab a share of the market. Royal Delft Group CEO Henk Schouten, speaking to CNN, said the style was now being copied ""everywhere in the world."" He added: ""It's not a solution for us to get rid of that."" While other producers can claim a Delft Blue style, they cannot say they are original makers. And the Delft Blue Group will jump on any misuse of its logo, Schouten said. ""When people use our logo or our name then of course it will be going to a solicitor."" Watch more: Film studio in funding cap crisis . Royal Delft itself was influenced by Chinese pottery, after Dutch tradesman brought back porcelain from the Far East in the 1600s. It proved popular with the Dutch, and potters began developing a similar style with local clay. Hundreds of years later and with the backing of the monarchy, Royal Delft is the sole remaining plant of 32 earthenware factories established around the industry.

Each piece is inspected and hand-painted by a master painter who trains for four to five years, after which they are able to develop their own designs. Schouten added: ""When you see a product here hand-painted then I think three quarters of the price is craftsmanship and only a quarter of the price is the cost price of all kinds of material."" According to spokesman Saifya Yilmaz, the copycat products don't have a trademark and are sold as souvenirs. ""The large objects, such as tulip vases, you only see at the original producers,"" he said.","Royal Delft influenced by Chinese pottery, after Dutch tradesman brought back porcelain from the Far East in the 1600s .

"(CNN) -- For Colombia this week, two worlds collide. Its captivating side -- led by the tournament's star man James Rodriguez -- is preparing for its first ever World Cup quarterfinal on Friday, hinting at a future full of promise. But that glamor tie against hosts Brazil also comes 20 years after perhaps Colombian football's darkest hour -- the murder of former national team player Andres Escobar. The 27-year-old defender was a victim of a volatile and violent chapter in the country's history, seemingly executed as punishment for scoring an own goal at the 1994 World Cup. Escobar's error contributed to a 2-1 defeat at the hands of hosts USA and six days after Colombia's tournament ended, on July 2, he was shot six times by gunmen in his home town of Medellin. The murder was linked to drug lords who had suffered big gambling losses due to Colombia's exit at the group stage but nothing was ever proven. Two decades on as Colombia prepares for one the biggest clashes in its history -- delivered by a squad that is seen as a symbol of hope -- the significance of the Escobar anniversary is not lost on the country. Just like in 1994 it has a crop of gifted players ready to gatecrash the party at soccer's top table. Rodriguez has been the stand out star, his sublime goal in the last 16 win over Uruguay a signpost for the country's emerging potential. Their jaunty choreographed goal celebrations have also struck a chord with the watching world, who are ever more connected through social media. This vivacious side has also energized Colombia, the public hoping this verve and swagger can help chart a new path for a country that has for so long been synonymous with drugs and violence. Whether that happens or not, Escobar will not be forgotten. ""Andrés Escobar - always in our hearts,"" wrote Colombia's most capped international and Escobar's former teammate -- Carlos Valderrama on Twitter. ""We'll never forget your kindness, your humility and your fight. I miss you bro, I miss you."" The Escobar name will be also present in Fortaleza on Friday. As Colombia take on not just Brazil's players but also a fervent home nation, Andres' brother and sister will be present, as they have been for every Colombia match in the competition so far. Maria Ester and Jose will be bedecked in the team's famous yellow kit, complete with Escobar's name and his famous number 2 on the back. The defender's former teammates Faryd Mondragon and Mario Yepes are with the current squad, but all of them will know what became of one of its illustrious predecessors. ""Andres is with them and the rest of the team in spirit,"" Maria Ester told FIFA's official website. ""People should enjoy football with passion, but never forgetting it's a game. (What happened to Andres) should serve as a cautionary tale: there is no place for violence. ""Football should unite the country around a message of peace and love. ""Twenty years is a long time and it's really upsetting to think about, but I prefer to thank God for having given us the chance to have him with us for 27 years, for lending him to us. ""His life was cut short, but he did important things in that time."" The pair accepted an invitation from world football's governing body to attend Colombia's matches, partly to be away from home when the 20th anniversary came around. ""I wanted to escape Medellin, because there Andres's death will be talked about in all the news programs and papers and it would be very tough,"" Maria Ester explained. ""I'd rather spend it here, with the family, and then hold a memorial service when we go back home."" Escobar was rumored to be on the verge of a switch to Italian giants AC Milan prior to his death after seven years at Colombian club Atlético Nacional. He also had a spell at Young Boys in Switzerland but it was in his native Colombia he is remembered most fondly, and afforded the nickname ""El Caballero del Fútbol"" which translates as ""The gentlemen of football."" ""Sometimes I think it'd be better if people didn't remember Andres every day, because it's really painful,"" his brother Jose explained. ""But he left a mark, so it's normal.""","Colombia faces hosts Brazil on Friday in its first ever World Cup quarterfinal .

"(CNN) -- As expected, President Barack Obama announced Bob McDonald as his choice to head the troubled Department of Veterans Affairs on Monday. He described McDonald, a West Point graduate and former CEO of Procter & Gamble, as one of the ""nation's most accomplished business leaders and managers."" ""He's no-nonsense. He's pragmatic. He does not seek the limelight,"" Obama said about his pick. McDonald's nomination must be confirmed by the Senate. The VA, a massive bureaucracy with more than 300,000 full-time employees, is under fire as it deals with allegations of alarming shortcomings at its medical facilities. The controversy, as CNN first reported, involves delayed care with potentially fatal consequences in possibly dozens of cases. Eric Shinseki stepped down as head of the department in May after Republicans, Democrats and veterans' advocacy groups joined in calling for his resignation. ""Let me state the obvious: This is not going to be an easy assignment,"" said Obama, announcing McDonald's nomination. ""He understands that grand plans are not enough; what matters is the operations that you put in place and getting the job done. Bob is an expert at making organizations better,"" the President said. A statement from the White House touted McDonald's 33 years at P&G and described his as the ""perfect person to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs during this important time."" At P&G, he is said to have overseen more than 120,000 employees, reaching more than 5 billion customers worldwide. In the Army, McDonald served as a captain, primarily in the 82nd Airborne Division and received the meritorious service medal. He received a bachelor's degree in engineering from West Point and an MBA from the University of Utah. It remains to be seen what kind of reception McDonald will receive on Capitol Hill, but members of Congress are adamant that change is needed. ""Bob McDonald is a good man, a veteran, and a strong leader with decades of experience in the private sector. With those traits, he's the kind of person who is capable of implementing the kind of dramatic systemic change that is badly needed and long overdue at the VA,"" said House Speaker John Boehner. Rep. Jeff Miller of Florida, chairman of the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, said in a statement to CNN that if McDonald is confirmed by the Senate, he would inherit a department ""under a specter of corruption that may very well surpass anything in the history of American government."" ""He'll need to root out the culture of dishonesty and fraud that has taken hold within the department and is contributing to all of its most pressing challenges. Quite simply, those who created the VA scandal will need to be purged from the system,"" Miller said. Since Shinseki's resignation, the White House has deepened its investigation into what went wrong at the agency. On Friday, a White House report said the agency's health care system is in need of complete overhaul because of unresponsive leadership and a ""corrosive culture"" that affects the delivery of medical care. The report was prepared by Rob Nabors, who is Obama's deputy chief of staff and who the President dispatched to assess the situation at the troubled agency. ""It is clear that there are significant and chronic systemic failures that must be addressed by the leadership at VA,"" the reports reads. ""The department must take swift and appropriate accountability actions,"" the report said. ""There must be a recognition of how true accountability works.""","NEW: Obama describes McDonald as ""an expert at making organizations better""
