"Amnesty International has admitted to writing a letter to the Australian Government in support of crazed Sydney siege gunman Man Monis seeking asylum after the conman was successfully convincing in his perception of an Iranian spy. Monis approached the human rights body in April 1997, under the name Mohammed Hassan Manteghi, claiming that his life was in danger after writing poetry published by an Iranian anti-regime outlet. Amnesty wrote a letter of consideration to the Immigration Department to be taken into account in their determination of the Iranian national's refugee application before his visa was granted in 2001. Scroll down for video . Man Monis - under the name Mohammed Hassan Manteghi - (pictured protesting outside the Downing Centre's local court in November 2009) convinced Amnesty International that was an Iranian spy in 2007 . Amnesty wrote a letter supporting Monis' refugee application after reviewing Iranian anti-regime poetry he had published . 'Mohamed Hassan Manteghi’s status as a cleric, his involvement with the Ministry of Intelligence, and his connections with high level individuals are relevant considerations which add objective weight to his fear of persecution, and to his fear of being targeted by the authorities outside Iran,' The Daily Telegraph reported the supposed letter from Amnesty International stated. Amnesty refugee coordinator Dr Graham Thom highlighted the political nature of Mr Manteghi's poetry published in Iran, after reviewing copies of the work printed in the Payam-e Daneshju publication. 'As detailed in this letter, we confirmed that the Iranian authorities had arrested the publisher of this poetry in July 1996 for ""publishing lies and causing public confusion"",' he said. 'The editor of this publication continues to be in and out of jail in Iran for his writing.' However, Dr Thom conceded if he had been the coordinator at the time then he would have been written the letter differently. 'Amnesty's processes have certainly changed … today when I get evidence we will only state something as a fact when we're able to verify it,' The Daily Telegraph reported. 'I'm not sure why (Monis's claims) were taken at face value.' He said Monis gave names that matched those of Iranian officials which was presented as evidence to the Australian government. Monis held 17 hostages for up to 16 hours in the Lindt cafe in Sydney last month . The floral tribute outside the cafe in Martin Place following the siege that took Monis' life and two hostages . Terrorism expert Greg Barton said part of the issue was that Monis was a 'brilliant individual' who was 'very manipulative'. 'He was a good con artist - certainly not a regular person,' he told Daily Mail Australia. He also praised Amnesty for the handling of the costly blunder. 'It's easy to be critical - kudos to them for admitting to making a mistake.' Monis approached Amnesty International for a second time in August 2010 under the guise of Sheikh Haron. He visited the Sydney office without notice and requested support. 'Amnesty International declined to provide him with assistance, as his case did not meet the organisation's human rights criteria,' Dr Thom said. 'After declining this request for support, Amnesty International had no further involvement in his case and advised him to contact police.' Amnesty declined to provide Monis for assistance when he appraoched them a second time in 2010 under the name of Sheikh Haron .","Amnesty wrote a supportive letter to the Australian government for Man Monis' refugee application in April 1997 .

"Sony will release its controversial movie 'The Interview in UK cinemas on February 6, it has been announced. The movie, which features the fictional assassination of North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un was initially withdrawn by the film company after it was targeted by hackers in November 2014. The attack was blamed on North Korea who were angry about the subject of the comedy starring Seth Rogen and James Franco. Scroll down for video . Sony has announced that The Interview, pictured, will be shown in UK cinemas from February 6 . The film starring James Franco, left, and Seth Rogen, right, had its US release delayed after threats . Sony's top executive Kazuo Hirai, told a press conference in Las Vegas today that his employees had been subjected ot a 'vicious and malicious cyber attack'. He added that he was proud that the company was standing against 'the extortionist efforts of criminals'. The company was hacked in November by a group calling themselves 'Guardians of the Peace', but they are believed to be a front for North Korean cyber warfare experts. Mr Hirai said it 'would be remiss' if he did not address the scandal surrounding the controversial movie. Kazuo Hirai, presidentof Sony, pictured,  said he was proud his company was standing up to criminals . The main launch of the movie last month was abandoned after theatres were threatened with 9/11-style terrorist attacks if they carried the feature. Following the major cyber attack, South Korean intelligence sources claimed that the hermit state has a 6,000 member cyber army, which has doubled in size in recent years. The United States government believes that North Korea is behind the attack on Sony, however this has been denied by the secretive state. South Korean security officials believe that their country has been hit by half-a-dozen cyber attacks by their northern neighbour since 2007. North Korea has denied that it is behind the massive cyber attack on Sony in November 2014 . North Korea has attacked the United State's decision to impose sanctions over the illegal hacking of Sony's computer network. An unnamed source in North Korea's foreign ministry said the U.S. was 'groundlessly' stirring up hostility aimed at Pyongyang. A report on North Korean state TV said: ''The policy persistently pursued by the US to stifle the DPRK [North Korea], groundlessly stirring up bad blood towards it, would only harden its will and resolution to defend the sovereignty of the country. 'The persistent and unilateral action taken by the White House to slap ""sanctions"" against the DPRK patently proves that it is still not away from inveterate repugnancy and hostility toward the DPRK. North Korea claimed that the sanctions would not weaken the nation's military might. The Interview has become Sony's highest grossing online release ever, taking in $15million in online rentals, as well as $2.8million from 331 theatres within 72 hours of opening on Christmas day. In one series of leaked emails, the head of Sony Pictures UK Peter Taylor criticised the movie - not for its content - simply due to James Franco's lack of comedy skills. According to the email from Mr Taylor: 'The unanimous point of view here is that this (is) another misfire from the pairing.' He said the movies was 'desperately unfunny and repetitive.' He added: 'James Franco proves once again that irritation is his strong suit which is a shame because the character could have been appealing and funny out of his hands.' Taylor and other executives agreed that the first half hour of the film, which features a satirical interview with hip-hop artist Eminem, was amusing but was later overshadowed by 'realistic violence that would be shocking in a horror movie'.","UK film fans will finally get the chance to see The Interview on February 6 .

"Mother-of-one Joanne Mjadzelics, 39, (pictured outside Cardiff Crown Court today) is on trial for sharing indecent images with disgraced Ian Watkins . Disgraced paedophile singer Ian Watkins and his ex-lover fantasised in online chats about kidnapping children from outside a school to kill and abuse, a court heard today. The trial of Watkins' former girlfriend Joanne Mjadzelics – who is accused of possessing indecent images and sharing them with the Lostprophets singer – heard how the pair discussed kidnapping a brother and sister, to 'kill one and rape the other'. Watkins, 37, was jailed for 35 years in December 2013 for a series of sex offences, including the attempted rape of a baby. Mother-of-one Mjadzelics claims she tried to report the Lostprophets singer to police in 2009 but alleges that officers didn't take her seriously. The 39-year-old from Doncaster, South Yorkshire, is accused of four counts of possessing indecent images of children, two charges of distributing indecent images of children and one charge of encouraging Watkins to send her an indecent image of a child. However, she claims she kept the images and online chats on her computer because she was trying to 'trap' Watkins and wanted the police to 'take her seriously'. Cardiff Crown Court heard today how detectives trawled through pages and pages of transcripts of online chat they recovered from Watkins' computer. In one file entitled 'Jo Filth', the pair discussed cross dressing, child abuse and kidnapping a brother and sister from outside a school, killing one and raping the other. Watkins also talked of getting Mjadzelics pregnant so that he could rape their baby. Asked about the online chat during police interview, Mjadzelics told detectives: 'I don't remember. I don't have any explanation for what's said or what's going through my mind when I said it.' Mjadzelics told the interviewing officers that she reported the singer four years before he was convicted but that 'nothing had been done about it'. 'I knew I needed to do something,' she said. Mjadzelics said she needed Watkins to 'trust her' and 'get evidence'. 'The only time I contacted him was to try and trap him and I had to go that far,' she told police. Jurors have previously been told that Watkins and Mjadzelics made a sex tape in a Cardiff hotel where they shared his fantasies of child abuse and death. The court heard how Mjadzelics reported Watkins to police and social services in early 2009 – four years before he was convicted – and raised the alarm over his child sex crimes. However, the court heard how police failed to carry out searches of his home and computers and missed his child abuse images and videos about raping infants. Michael Wolkind QC, defending Mjadzelics, told the court today how the trial is part of a cover-up by police who didn't investigate Watkins because he was famous. Mr Wolkind said: 'This trial is a mission to cover up the failings of the police. The police didn't listen. 'They didn't take Joanne's information seriously because of biased and lazy thinking. 'To them she wasn't someone who worked in retail, in banking, had enlisted in the army or become a special constable - that is not the person they saw or listened to. 'To the lazy and biased police officers she was a prostitute who had been sectioned - only she has never been sectioned in her life . 'But that lie found its way into police documents and it went from force to force.' Mjadzelics, from Doncaster, South Yorkshire (pictured outside court today), allegedly discussed child abuse with Lostprophets singer Ian Watkins before he was jailed for 35 years for a series of child sexual offences . Mr Wolkind told the jury that the police had failed to protect babies from Ian Watkins and mothers who 'donated their own for abuse for their excitement for sexual turn on'. He said: 'To police, Joanne became a nuisance and she had been harassing that nice Mr Watkins. 'Babies could have been saved if Joanne had been taken seriously but Watkins was a famous rock star so it was different. 'She wasn't believed and it wasn't properly investigated. What was she supposed to do? 'We are not talking about theoretical ways in which she could have done better. She did pretty well in the face of police incompetence. 'If she had not kept on seeing Watkins would he and the two mothers be locked up now? No. 'She played Watkins to expose him. 'This is a case filled with sadness but she had a legitimate reason to possess those photographs. 'She desperately played along with Watkins to track him.' Turning to Mjadzelics, he said: 'On behalf of decent members of society, thank you for what you did.' At the end of his speech Mr Wolkind added: 'Let's see if a jury cares if the police got it wrong for years.' Earlier today, the court heard how Mjadzelics kept child abuse images and online chats on her computer so police would 'take her seriously'. After her arrest in 2013, she told how she reported Watkins' to police and social services four years earlier because she was worried about the safety of a young girl close to him. The court heard Mjadzelics said: 'I was worried about her and the way he [Watkins] spoke about her. 'He spoke about how she was ""super flirty"" - but she was four years old. 'That is when I knew I had to do something because I knew she was in danger. The rest of it was just fantasy talk until then.' Cardiff Crown Court heard how mother-of-one Mjadzelics raised concerns with police and social services about Watkins' (pictured) child sex crimes four years before he was finally convicted of a series of offences . 'May 2011 is when I decided I needed to do something and get more evidence of him and get more confessions out of him. 'I had reported him and nothing had been done so I knew I needed to do something again. 'I had to make him trust me so I had to take drugs with him again and go along with what he said. 'I needed to get evidence and confessions and the only way I could do that was to earn his trust again.' The court was told how Mjadzelics first met Watkins at the end of 2006 and began a sexual relationship. Mjadzelics said Watkins began talking about abusing and raping children during August 2007. She told officers in a police interview that she had told Watkins she needed to tell police about his child abuse in the summer of 2008 but he had silenced her. Mjadzelics said: 'He made me sign a gagging order because I said I needed to speak to police. He made me sign the gagging order to shut me up.' Ian Watkins was jailed for 35 years in December 2013 after being convicted of a number of horrific sex crimes including the attempted rape of a baby . Prosecutor Jim Davies said that when Watkins was arrested and his home was searched they discovered a sex tape from 2008 titled 'Jo Paedo Talk Cardiff'. Mr Davies said: 'While they were having sex they were talking about him getting her pregnant so they could have a child to abuse.' During online sex chats in 2011, indecent images of children were sent by Watkins to Mjadzelics and she sent replies saying she wanted to 'play for real and ruin little s***s' lives'. In another exchange, Mjadzelics told Watkins: 'Part of me feels you get off on showing me stuff you can get away with, knowing that is what I have wanted since forever.' She also told Watkins she thought they had a 'deep connection that couldn't be matched' and signed off one message: 'Child molesters till we die.' Mjadzelics was arrested as part of Operation Globe - a worldwide investigation into Watkins' vile paedophile activities. Mr Davies said there was no dispute from Mjadzelics that she was in possession of four indecent images of children, had sent an indecent image of a child and had twice encouraged Watkins to send her an image of child rape. But the jury heard she claimed she kept the images to trap Wakins and bring him to justice. Mjadzelics denies all of the charges against her. The 13 sex offences Watkins pleaded guilty to last November included the attempted rape of an 11-month-old child. Police also found a stash of child porn videos - some of which he had made himself. Originally, Watkins had pleaded his innocence to a string of offences - despite damning video evidence. He changed his plea at the last minute - averting a trial - but then complained he had not realised that his guilty plea had made him 'look guilty'. While awaiting sentencing in December 2013, he was recorded by prison officials saying the whole thing was 'megalolz' during a telephone call to a friend. The trial of Mjadzelics continues.

"Online greeting card service Moonpig has suspended its mobile apps following claims that a security flaw allowed access to any of its three million customer accounts. Mobile app developer Paul Price discovered the apparent bug while examining the security settings of the code Moonpig uses in its Android and iOS applications. He claimed that when submitting requests to the website through its app, it failed to authenticate the customers username and password. Scroll down for video . A warning on Moonpig's mobile app tells customers to use its main website after the company suspended access while investigating claims of a security flaw in the software the apps use to communicate with servers . Instead he said he found it was possible to put in any customer ID to access their account. This would allow potential hackers to place orders, retrieve portions of their credit card details and obtain other personal information from their account. 18 August 2013: Paul Price says he emailed Moonpig to alert them to the flaw he claims he found in the API used by their app to communicate with the company's server. He says he received a few emails back before they finally said it was legacy code and that they would 'get right on it'. 26 September 2014: Mr Price sends a follow up email to Moonpig saying the issue had still not been resolved. Moonpig replies to say it will be 'before Christmas'. 5 January 2015: Vulnerability still exists. Mr Price decides to go public and publishes blog post about the flaw he discovered. He said: 'Initially I was going to wait until they fixed their live endpoints but given the timeframes I've decided to publish this post to force Moonpig to fix the issue and protect the privacy of their customers. 17 months is more than enough time to fix an issue like this. It appears customer privacy is not a priority to Moonpig.' 6 January 2015: Moonpig suspends access to its mobile apps and posts a statement on its website. He said he first discovered the problem in 2013 and when he contacted Moonpig they replied they would 'get right on it'. Writing on his blog, Mr Price said that as of 5 January, the glitch was still in place and he decided to go public. Moonpig, which allows customers to order and send personalised greeting cards, responded by immediately shutting down access to its mobile apps and launching an investigation into the claims. Moonpig's mobile apps, which are used by 1.5 million customers, carried a message urging customers to use its normal website instead, which is unaffected. The company, which was bought by Photobox for £120 million in 2011 and sells around 12 million cards a year, said all customer password and payment information was safe. In a statement posted on its website, Moonpig said: 'We are aware of the claims made this morning regarding the security of customer data within our Apps. 'We can assure our customers that all password and payment information is and has always been safe. 'The security of your shopping experience at Moonpig is extremely important to us and we are investigating the detail behind today’s report as a priority. Moonpig is the market leader in online personalised greeting cards and dispatched six million cards last year . Moonpig said that it had temporarily removed its app from Apple's App Store while it investigated the claims . 'As a precaution, our Apps will be unavailable for a time whilst we conduct these investigations and we will work to resume a normal service as soon as possible. 'The desktop and mobile websites are unaffected.' Although a message on Moonpig's website said it had removed its app from Apple's App store, it was still available for download. However the app carried a message saying it could not take orders. Mr Price said he found the problem when looking at application programming interface that Moonpig's mobile apps use to communicate with the company's servers. He found that rather than sending information protected by a username and password, it tended to send static credentials that read '*redacted*:*redacted*'. He said he created a second account, added an address and entered the new customer ID into the app and found he could access this and the saved address. The statement posted on Moonpig's website insisted that payment information had not been compromised . Moonpig's apps have helped the company capture 90 per cent of the UK's personalised greeting card market . He said: 'I've seen some half-arsed security measures in my time but this just takes the biscuit.' 'There's no authentication at all and you can pass in any customer ID to impersonate them. 'An attacker could easily place orders on other customers accounts, add/retrieve card information, view saved addresses, view orders and much more.' He also found he was able to obtain the credit card expiry date, the last four digits from the credit card and the name on the card when he carried out his test. Passwords were not leaked nor enough credit card data to make a full purchase. He said: 'I hit my test users a few hundred times in quick succession and I was not rate limited. 'Given that customer IDs are sequential an attacker would find it very easy to build up a database of Moonpig customers along with their addresses and card details in a few hours - very scary indeed.' It is not the first problem with a greeting card website that Mr Price has found. In October 2013 Mr Price exposed a vulnerability in the website of another greeting card company Funky Pigeon. This allowed an attacker to take over a user's account and gain access to personal data. This was fixed within a week. Mr Price said he first contacted Moonpig about the fault in August 2013 and they responded to say it had been legacy code. He said he followed up with an email in September 2014 and was promised it would be fixed by Christmas. However as of 5 January 2015 the vulnerability still existed, he said. Perhaps embarassingly for Moonpig, the company has also been recently advertising for an IT Security Officer. The advert was taken off its website after Mr Price reported the flaw. David Emm, principal security researcher at internet security consultancy Kaspersky Lab, said: 'As we understand it, the reported vulnerability has not so far been used to steal personal information of Moonpig customers. 'However, it seems that the vulnerability, if confirmed, would allow an attacker to access the account details of other customers. 'It's important that companies take information about a vulnerability in their products very seriously. ' If this vulnerability is confirmed, and it's true that Moonpig has previously failed to take any action to protect their customers for almost a year and a half, this is alarming - especially for a provider of an online shopping application used to transmit highly sensitive data.'","App developer Paul Price claims to have found a flaw in the software used by Moonpig's mobile apps to communicate with the company's servers .

"A nine-ton block of sandstone found on a Utah mountain late last year holds the biggest fossil trove ever found of the giant predatory dinosaur known as utahraptor, researchers have said. Scientists have found the remains of six dinosaurs in the rock so far, and more may be trapped there. Covered in feathers, with a huge sickle claw on each second toe, the Utahraptor looked similar to the Jurassic Park star dinosaur Velociraptor, experts say. Scroll down for video . The Utahraptor was the largest of a group of lightly-built carnivores, called the dromaeosaurs ('swift lizards'). The remains were excavated in a massive effort that has spanned more than a decade, led by Utah state paleontologist James Kirkland, according to National Geographic. The recent finds include never-before-seen bones that are already changing scientific views of the Utahraptor anatomy. 'We're really going to have a different view of this guy,' Kirkland says. Part of the emerging picture is that while young Utahraptor dinosaurs were lightly built and turkey size, Kirkland explains, the adults were heavily muscled, 'Arnold Schwarzenegger' versions. By chipping off smaller pieces of the block, Kirkland and his team uncovered bones from a 16-foot-long adult, four juveniles, and a baby that would have been only about three feet long from snout to tail. If the dinosaurs died together, they might provide some long-sought evidence of group hunting, the researchers hope. The Utahraptor was the largest of a group of lightly-built carnivores, called the dromaeosaurs ('swift lizards'). It had large eyes, long grasping hands and powerfully clawed feet. Clearly it was carnivorous, but was distinctive in relying on a wickedly hooked, slashing claw on each foot rather than the jaws and teeth of a typical predator. Its toe joints were specially enlarged so that its massive claw could be raised upward and backward to avoid damage while running. The dromaeosaur group also included Velociraptor, made famous by Steven Spielberg in 'Jurassic Park'. Last year a dry wash full of 112-million-year-old dinosaur tracks that include an ankylosaurus, dromaeosaurus and the Utahraptor was unveiled. There are more than 200 tracks in an area smaller than a football field from 10 different ancient animals that lived during the early Cretaceous period. They were first discovered in 2009 by a resident. The dromaeosaur group also included Velociraptor, made famous by Steven Spielberg in 'Jurassic Park'. The tracks include a set of 17 consecutive footprints left by Tyrannosaurus rex ancestor and the imprint of an ancient crocodile pushing off into the water. There are footprints from duckbilled dinosaurs, prehistoric birds, long-necked plant eaters and a dromaeosaur similar to a velociraptor or Utah raptor that had long, sharp claws. The foot of a dinosaur similar to Utahraptor, making a track that was preserved at a track site north of Moab, Utah. Since then, paleontologists led by a team at the University of Colorado at Denver have studied them and prepared them for display, according to Utah Bureau of Land Management paleontologist ReBecca Hunt-Foster. The tracks include a set of 17 consecutive footprints left by Tyrannosaurus rex ancestor and the imprint of an ancient crocodile pushing off into the water. The site is one of the largest areas of dinosaur tracks from the early Cretaceous period known to exist in North America, she said. 'We don't usually get this,' said Hunt-Foster, a paleontologist for 16 years. 'It is a beautiful track site, one of the best ones I've ever seen.' There are footprints from duckbilled dinosaurs, prehistoric birds, long-necked plant eaters and a dromaeosaur similar to a velociraptor or Utah raptor that had long, sharp claws. In one rock formation, a footprint left behind by a large plant eater is right in the middle of prints from a meat-eating theropod, Hunt-Foster said. The imprint of an ancient crocodile shows the chest, body, tail and one foot. Paleontologists believe it was made while the crocodile was pushing off a muddy bank into water. Paleontologists believe the tracks were made over several days in what was a shallow lake. They likely became covered by sediment that filled them up quickly enough to preserve them but gently enough not to scour them out, Hunt-Foster said. Over time, as more sediment built up, they became rock. They are near a fault line, where the land has moved up and down over the years, she said. Rains slowly eroded away layers of the rock, exposing the footprints. This undated photo provided by the Bureau of Land Management shows theropod tracks found north of Moab, Utah. These tracks were left by large, three-toed, meat-eating dinosaurs, closely related to the new dinosaur Siats. Earlier this year, a Utah man was arrested and slapped with the federal charge after authorities say he pried a piece of sandstone with a three-toed ancient dinosaur track from the Sand Flats Recreation Area near Moab. He pleaded guilty while accepting a deal that calls for him to serve one year of probation with six months under house arrest. Paleontologist Martin Lockley of the University of Colorado at Denver has taken the lead in studying, cleaning and preparing the tracks. Their uniqueness has lured paleontologists from several countries, including from Poland, Korea and China, Hunt-Foster said. 'It's such an important site that they are coming here to study it,' she said. Researchers and volunteers clean the surface of a new track site on BLM lands north of Moab, Utah. A dry wash full of 112-million-year-old dinosaur tracks are set to be opened to the public this fall.","Nine-ton block of sandstone found on a Utah mountain has six specimens .

"Israel and Hamas have agreed to extend a ceasefire by a a further 24 hours as negotiations over a long-term peace agreement continue. The announcement that the temporary truce would be extended came just moments as it was due to expire, averting a resumption of the fighting that has caused devastating damage across Gaza and disrupted life throughout southern Israel. Negotiations for an agreement that would allow the reconstruction of the Gaza Strip are currently taking place in Egypt as mediators look to resolve the month-long dispute in which more than 2,000 people have been killed. Scroll down for video . Ceasefire: A Palestinian boy picks flowers in front of the destroyed and deserted main gate of the Gaza Strip's former international airport in Rafah,  as Egyptian-brokered indirect negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians continued . Debris: A Palestinian woman sits among the debris of a building destroyed in Israeli shelling in Johr al-Deek Gaza, as negotiators between the two sides tried to bring about the end of the month-long dispute . 'Palestinians and Israelis agreed on extending the cease-fire by 24 hours to continue current negotiations,' the Egyptian government said in a statement, while Palestinian and Israeli officials confirmed they had accepted Egypt's request for an extension. A Palestinian negotiator said the sides had exchanged draft proposals for a long-term truce that were to be addressed during the 24-hour extension in talks. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to brief the media. Since last week, Egypt has been hosting indirect talks between Israel and Hamas aimed at ending the war. Gaza Health Ministry official Ashraf al-Kidra said last night that the death toll from the fighting had jumped to more 2,000 Palestinians, the majority of them civilians. However, U.N. officials, who often take more time to verify figures, have put the number at 1,976. Demolished: Palestinians stand in what is left of the home of Amer Abu Aisheh in Hebron, one of three Palestinians identified by Israel as suspects in the killing of three Israeli teenagers . Anger: The three teenagers were killed in June in the West Bank, their deaths followed by the killing of a Palestinian youth in Jerusalem in what was an alleged revenge attack . Thousands of homes have been destroyed, and tens of thousands of people remain huddled in U.N. shelters. Some 67 Israeli have died in the conflict, all but three of them soldiers. Despite attempts by the Egyptian mediators, the two sides appeared to remain divided. Hamas is demanding an end to a seven-year Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza that has devastated the local economy, while Israel wants guarantees that Hamas, which fired thousands of rockets into Israel during the fighting, will be disarmed. In an apparent attempt to put pressure on Hamas, Egypt said  it would co-host an international fundraising conference for Gaza, but only if a deal can be reached. Israel, meanwhile, said in recent months it had arrested nearly 100 Hamas operatives in the West Bank in an alleged plot to topple Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. Aftermath: Palestinians at the destroyed home of Hussam Kawasma, another man identified by Israel as a suspects in the killing, which sparked the war in Gaza . The Gaza blockade, imposed after Hamas seized control of Gaza in 2007, remains the main stumbling block. It has greatly limited the movement of Palestinians in and out of the territory, which is home to of 1.8 million people, restricted the flow of goods into Gaza and blocked virtually all exports. Israel says the blockade is needed to prevent arms smuggling, but critics argue that the measures have amounted to collective punishment. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu already said this week he would not allow Hamas to win a diplomatic victory at the negotiating table. An Egyptian compromise proposal has called for an easing of the blockade to allow more movement of goods and people in and out of Gaza. Although it would not disarm Hamas, it would give Abbas, whose forces were routed by Hamas in the 2007 takeover, a foothold back in Gaza and put him in charge of border crossings and internationally backed reconstruction efforts. Larger issues, including Israel's calls for disarmament and Hamas demands to reopen Gaza's sea and airports, would be left for later talks. An official in Abbas's office, also speaking anonymously, said the Palestinian leader was supposed to arrive in Qatar, the base for top Hamas leaders, later today and stay until Friday. A Palestinian man surveys the remains of Kawasma's home. Israeli troops also demolished the home of another militant suspected in the abduction and killing of the teens . Upset: Minor clashes were reported during the demolition, with Palestinian youths hurling rocks and stones at armored Israeli vehicles . He is due to hold meetings  with Hamas leader Khaled Mashaal and the emir of Qatar today. The official said Abbas would urge Mashaal and the Qataris to support the Egyptian cease-fire efforts. Robert Serry, the U.N. special coordinator for the Middle East peace process, urged the parties 'to reach an understanding on a durable cease-fire which also addresses the underlying issues afflicting Gaza.' 'At the very least, we hope that the cease-fire will be extended and the situation will remain quiet,' he said. Palestinian negotiators said there was no desire for a return to fighting. 'The war is behind us now,' said Ziad Nakhleh, head of the Islamic Jihad faction within the Palestinian delegation in Cairo. 'We are not returning to war.' Protest: Palestinian protesters face Israeli soldiers, following a demonstration to support people in Gaza and Palestinian negotiators in Cairo, Egypt, during clashes near the West Bank city of Nablus . Action: A Palestinian protester throws a glass bottle at Israeli soldiers during clashes, following a protest . Hamas repeatedly has said it will not give up its weapons, while Israel says it needs to maintain some degree of control over Gaza crossings to prevent the smuggling of weapons and weapons production materials into the coastal strip. In a possible move to encourage Hamas to soften its stance, Norway's foreign minister Boerge Brende said that his country and Egypt were planning to co-host a donor conference in Cairo for the reconstruction of Gaza, and that invitations would be sent out once there is an agreement in the Egypt-mediated truce talks with Israel. Meanwhile, Israel's Shin Bet security service claimed it had thwarted what it described as a Hamas coup attempt in the West Bank aimed at toppling Abbas, though it offered few details. The security agency said Hamas operatives had tried to stir up an uprising that would have led to the collapse of Abbas's Western-backed Palestinian Authority. In recent months, the Shin Bet said it had arrested more than 90 Hamas operatives, confiscated dozens of weapons that had been smuggled into the West Bank and more than $170,000 aimed at funding attacks. It produced photos of the confiscated weapons and cash and a flowchart of the Hamas operatives who had been questioned. Talks: Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas (left) is due to hold meetings with Hamas leader Khaled Mashaal (right) and the emir of Qatar today . Shin Ben said the plot was orchestrated by a senior Hamas official, Salah Arouri, who is based in Turkey. Abbas said he had ordered authorities to look into the reports, saying the 'implications' could be 'very serious.' 'This new information constitutes a real danger to the unity of the Palestinian people and its future,' Abbas said in a statement issued by the Palestinian news agency Wafa. There was no immediate comment from Hamas. The latest round of fighting was precipitated by Israeli arrests of Hamas members in the West Bank following the abduction and killing of three Israeli teenagers. Shin Bet said it uncovered the coup plot due to information gleaned from the arrests. The three teenagers were killed in June in the West Bank, their deaths followed by the killing of a Palestinian youth in Jerusalem in what was an alleged revenge attack. Yesterday, Israeli troops also demolished the homes of two militants suspected in the abduction and killing of the three Israeli teenagers and sealed up the home of a third. Minor clashes were reported during the demolition, with Palestinian youths hurling rocks and stones at armored Israeli vehicles.","Temporary truce would be extended moments before it was due to expire .

"The Cornish pasty would lose its legal protection and faces being swamped by American imports under a transatlantic trade deal, a German minister has warned. Celebrated regional foods like cheese, cider, clotted cream, seafood and meat are protected under European law to stop cheap copies being passed off as being from specific regions. But German farming minister Christian Schmidt suggested the rules would not continue if the trade agreement with the United States goes ahead. The Cornish pasty would lose its legal protection and faces being swamped by American imports under a transatlantic trade deal, a German minister has warned . There are currently 62 British products covered by the EU Protected Food Name scheme which highlights regional and traditional foods whose authenticity and origin can be guaranteed. It gives legal protection against imitation throughout the EU. Mr Schmidt warned that the protections would be eroded if European markets are opened up to American imitators under the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. He told Spiegel magazine: 'If we want to take advantage of the opportunities of free trade with the huge American market, we can no longer have every type of sausage and cheese each protected as a speciality. To be a Cornish pasty it must be made in Cornwall and be ' savoury 'D' shaped pasty which is filled with beef, vegetables and seasonings' While the likes of Cumberland sausage and Melton Mowbray pork pies are unlikely to be copied by US firms, the Cornish pasty was taken across the Atlantic by copper miners and there are now versions sold in parts of the US. Cornish pasty producers insist there is no question of giving up their legal status. Ruth Huxley, the managing director of Cornwall Food and Drink and spokesman for the Cornish Pasty Association, told MailOnline: 'It would be fair to say that the suggestion that there should be an element of compromise over the protection of names is not something we agree with. 'We would not really say there should be any compromise.' She insisted that the protected name status was not to stop people making pasties, but to ensure they did not call them Cornish if they were made elsewhere. To be a Cornish pasty it must be made in Cornwall and be ' savoury 'D' shaped pasty which is filled with beef, vegetables and seasonings'. It must contain sliced or diced potato, swede and onion, and the vegetable content must be at least 25 per cent of the whole pasty. Diced or minced beef must account for at least 12.5 per cent. Seasoning is also required 'primarily salt and pepper' The European Commission said: 'There is no question of weakening the existing protection for recognised EU products. 'In the framework of TTIP as of any other trade agreement negotiation, the goal of the Commission is to extend the protection certain products already get on the EU market to the concerned market.' Some American food firms want the protections dropped on products which have become common in the US. A government spokesman said: “TTIP will provide a valuable opportunity for the UK food and drink industries to promote their products in the US market worth millions to our economy.""

The collection included two different Bugatti Veyrons, a Bugatti Veyron Grand Sport, two Ferrari 458 Spiders, a Lamborghini Aventador, a Porsche 911 Turbo S and a Ferrari 599 GTB Fiorano. The fastest car on show was the Bugatti Veyron, which has a top speed of 267mph. The Bugatti cars are also the most expensive, coming in at around £1.5m each, while the cheapest is the Porshe 911 – a bargain at £150,000. The total cost of vehicles on show reaches a staggering £5.55m, and that's before the price of the plane is included.

Mayweather and his son Koraun with a birthday Bentley golf cart in November . This isn't the first time the 37-year-old has taken to social media to brag about his wealth. He recently posted photos online of his collections of shoes, sunglasses and watches. Away from the boxing ring and the cars, Mayweather has colourful and often controversial past. In 2002, he was charged with two counts of domestic violence and received a six-month suspended sentence, while two years later he was again on the wrong side of the law - handed a one-year suspended sentence for battery of two women. Another suspended sentence followed 12 months later, this time for 90 days. Mayweather did spend time in prison in 2011, however, when found guilty of battery against his ex-girlfriend. He was behind bars for 90 days. One man who isn't impressed with Mayweather's latest act of ostentation is his great rival Manny Pacquiao. The 36-year-old Filipino, who has been attempting to arrange a fight with Mayweather for years, said on Monday: 'Floyd brags about his lifestyle and everything! I don't care! I'm just waiting here for him to sign the contract!' If the fight does happen, both boxers will find themselves in line for their greatest ever financial windfalls, with some predicting the bout could be worth as much as $250m (£163m). Mayweather also bought 15-year-old son Koraun a Bentley golf cart for his birthday in November, posting: 'My son @kingkoraun wanted a Bentley golf cart for his 15th birthday so I made it appear. Stay on the look out for his gift for his 16th birthday!' That came just days after Mayweather had uploaded a photo of stacks of $100 bills on his table and before that similar amounts in bed with him.

"Not many people would turn to a sat nav, a photograph or a pendulum to find a lost pet. But that's exactly what one cat lover did, using powers of the supernatural to find missing moggies and reunite them with their owners. 'Dowsing' is the dangling of a pendulum and using the direction in which it moves to find a lost object. Brian Bowes from Consett uses the anciant method of Dowsing to find missing cats . Although some may think this slightly strange, Brian Bowes, 48, says that the ancient art of dowsing shouldn't be knocked after he found four cats using his pendulum which he bought on eBay and is made out of crystal. The father of two from Shotley Bridge, County Durham, is regularly contacted by panic-stricken owners asking to help find their missing pet and explained that the process of finding the stray tabbies has been proven to work. Mr Bowes believes his work can help owners be reunited with their lost cats (File Photo) He said: 'People contact me through Facebook, and send me a picture of their lost cat, its name and the area where it went missing. I keep a picture of the cat on the laptop next to me with a sat nav map on my phone. 'First I have to clear my head of absolutely everything so my mind is completely empty. 'Then I hold the pendulum above the map on my phone and ask questions, such as: 'Is the cat alive? Is it injured? Is it being kept in a house?' The pendulum will move clockwise for yes and anti-clockwise for no. 'When I ask it to show me where the cat is, the pendulum will then sway to a certain area on the map. 'I keep zooming in on the area until I can zoom in no more and I get to a street name. In total it usually takes about half an hour for me to find where the cat might be, and I contact the owner to let them know. 'Where I've been successful I usually get within 50 metres of where the cat was found, which is good considering I only started to do this seriously a few months ago.' Brian, who delivers catalogues for a living, also used his psychic powers to find his own pet cat Sam nearly four years ago when she went missing. He said: 'This was the first time I decided to use a sat nav map instead of a map in a book, and the pendulum guided me to an area not too far away from where I live. 'I put up leaflets straightaway and on that same day, someone got in touch to say she was sleeping in their shed - in the same place that the pendulum guided me to.' But this wasn't the last time the method of dowsing would come to the rescue when another of Brian's cats went missing a year later. This time, Merry the cat was found stuck in a tree close to home but thankfully Brian, who now has five cats, hasn't needed the pendulum again for his own pets. But the dowsing enthusiast is clearly in high demand as up to three or four people a day contact him for his help. He said: 'I saw some owners putting pleas for help on the Consett Cats charity Facebook page after their cats went missing. I thought I could help these people out, and in October I posted an offer to dowse for cats on the charity's lost and found Facebook page. 'So far I have done it thirty times- for some owners I've done it once or twice, and for others I have done it for them many times. 'Up until now I've managed to find a missing cat in Sunderland and another in the Chester Le Street area. The owners were absolutely over the moon, they couldn't believe it. 'The owner of the cat found in Chester Le Street went exactly to the estate where I told her to go and at first there was no luck. 'But when she went back a second time, she shouted for her and the cat just walked up to her from out of nowhere. Mr Bowes used his psychic powers to find his own pet cat Sam nearly four years ago when it went missing . Mr Bowes is confident his methods can be most effective to help owners find their lost pets . 'That was really spooky. 'After that it has just sort of snowballed from there. I've even had people messaging me to help find their dogs. 'I do try to help people as often as I can but it's usually no more than a few times a week after work in my spare time.' He added: 'I had heard of dowsing rods but the first time I heard about dowsing using a pendulum was when I saw someone on the TV using one to find a lost child. 'I decided to try it for myself and at first, I got my son to hide a push pop around the house. Using a map of the house that I drew and the pendulum I bought on ebay, I managed to find where he had hidden it.' Although Brian admits that dowsing is a more unconventional way of finding lost pets, he tells sceptics to give it a try first. He said: 'It is unusual. If I had never heard of it before I would think that I'm losing the plot! 'I've been dowsing for four years now and finding the cats has totally proved to me that it does work. It could be a ghost pushing the pendulum for all I know. 'I can't explain it and I don't know how it actually works, but it does, and I'm going to keep on doing it as long as I'm helping people. 'Give it a go and see for yourself.'","Brian Bowes, 48, says he found four cats using his pendulum and a photo .

"A Tory MP yesterday branded his accuser ‘vindictive’ and called for a change in the law after a rape case against him was dropped by police. Mark Pritchard, 48, said he was maliciously targeted by a former lover and called for those accused of rape to be allowed anonymity until they are charged. The MP for The Wrekin said the law on sex offences – which grants alleged victims anonymity but not the accused – should be reviewed so that ‘fairness plays a greater role’. Scroll down for video . Mark Pritchard was arrested and questioned over the allegation last month . Testing time: Mar Pritchard, pictured with ex wife Sondra at a charity dinner . Anyone who makes an accusation that they are the victim of a sexual assault is given anonymity for life, under the Sexual Offences Act 2003. But the same protection is not granted to the alleged perpetrator. Critics claim the system is unfair because it allows innocent suspects to have their reputation dragged through the mud. But the Government has defended the system - with many MPs arguing that naming suspects has often encouraged other victims to come forward, helping to convict attackers who may otherwise have escaped justice. David Cameron today said there were ‘real issues’ with rape suspects anonymity. He said: 'I think it needs very careful thought before going down that road.' But the outspoken backbencher could face a fresh police inquiry after revealing sensitive details that could identify the woman who accused him. Among his remarks, Mr Pritchard disclosed that the pair were in a ‘consenting’ relationship, described the woman as ‘single, well-educated’ and gave her approximate age. Senior figures in the criminal justice system will take a dim view of Mr Pritchard’s actions if they threaten to discourage other women from contacting police. Last night Scotland Yard refused to be drawn on whether the politician has broken the law but a spokesman said it would ‘assess’ any complaint carefully. Mr Pritchard’s ordeal began in early December when he attended Holborn police station in Central London and was arrested over the rape claim. Speaker John Bercow published details of the arrest in a Commons daily order paper. But after six weeks on bail Mr Pritchard – who divorced his wife Sondra in 2013 – was told yesterday he will face no further action as there is not enough evidence. Speaking outside the House of Commons, Mr Pritchard claimed the woman had ‘concocted a vindictive and outrageous story’. ‘To be falsely accused of anything is an awful thing,’ he said. ‘Sadly, as an MP, sometimes you have a target on your back. Of course she remains anonymous. The law on anonymity does need to be reviewed and fairness does need to play a far greater role in these cases.’ Mr Pritchard is a prominent member of the Tory Right and a leading Eurosceptic who was secretary of the 1922 Committee of Conservative backbenchers . Mr Pritchard, MP for The Wrekin in Shropshire, was arrested and questioned by police on Tuesday following an allegation that he raped a woman earlier this year . Mark Pritchard is one of Parliament's most-colourful MPs – a self-made businessman who grew up in an orphanage before entering the Commons in 2005. The Tory backbencher is one of the party's most Eurosceptic MPs and admitted that he came close to joining UKIP earlier this year. Since his election almost a decade ago, Mr Pritchard has been involved in a series of high profile political clashes – including with the Prime Minister. During the 2005 leadership election he asked David Cameron if he had ever taken a Class A drugs. He was also briefly the toast of the Tory backbenches after taking on Commons speaker John Bercow – shouting at him that he was 'not f****** royalty'. He added: ‘The last few weeks have been a testing time. I’m glad it’s all over.’ Victims of rape and other sexual offences were given anonymity under the 1976 Sexual Offences Act. Government ministers, prosecutors and police chiefs are desperate to encourage victims of sex crimes to come forward. New figures are expected to show that the number of rape cases going to court has risen significantly after years of decline. Legal expert David Banks said Mr Pritchard’s comments will be examined closely and could land him in court. ‘Regardless of the outcome of any police inquiry or prosecution, anyone who makes an allegation of rape is entitled to anonymity for life,’ he said. ‘Any comment that identifies the victim to anyone by revealing specific details is potentially a breach of the law.’ He added: ‘The Crown Prosecution Service has been quite aggressive in pursuing that kind of publication as it could put off others from coming forward.’ Mr Pritchard’s call for those accused of rape to be granted anonymity has re-ignited a long-running debate. He was backed by fellow Tory MP and former Deputy Speaker Nigel Evans, who was cleared last year of a string of sex offences. Mr Evans said: ‘Sex crimes have a special stigma … I know the weight that will have been lifted from his shoulders … that has been progressively crushing him for the past six weeks.’ But Downing Street made it clear the Government is unlikely to revisit the issue after a 2012 review found it could interfere with the judicial process. Speaking on local radio, Prime Minister David Cameron said it ‘needs very careful thought before going down that road’. Last year, Mark Pritchard and his estranged wife became embroiled in a row on Wikipedia over who was to blame for the break-up of their marriage. In July 2013, Sondra Pritchard, wife of Mark Pritchard, allegedly used the website to accuse her husband of 'abandoning her by text message after 16 years of marriage' even though he claimed to be a 'devout Christian'. Under 'spouse' it refered to his wife by her maiden name of Sondra Spaeth and added that divorce was pending. Shortly afterwards the entry was deleted. But a tit-for-tat Wiki war ensued as the account of their split was changed on the MP's profile, reflecting conflicting versions of events. Most of the alterations were made from computers traced to the Houses of Parliament where both worked at the time – Mrs Pritchard as her husband's Commons office manager. Even more remarkably, some of the anonymous Wiki entries appeared to involve a code which echoed opera buff Mr Pritchard's role as treasurer of the Parliamentary opera group. One of the entries favourable to him was made by a user known as Figaro2000, after Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro. In a statement, he confirmed he had texted her to say he wanted a divorce but claimed he had already informed her 'in person'. He said: 'I informed my ex-wife, in person, that I was going to file for divorce the day I left home. Over subsequent days, I confirmed that decision through another conversation, a legal letter, and by text. 'Since then, friends claim she may have abused the Wiki site to try to cause me embarrassment and make inaccurate claims. I did not edit any item on my Wiki page.' The 'text' claim was added to Mr Pritchard's profile on August 1: 'The couple separated in April 2013, following Mr Pritchard, a devout Christian, abandoning Sondra and the marriage on 29th April by text.' Mr Pritchard's fightback started on August 6, when allegations against him were deleted by Figaro2000. The only mention of his wife of the Wikipedia page now reads: 'In July 2013, Mark Pritchard announced that he was divorcing his wife of 15 years, Sondra, following their separation in April 2013.'","Mark Pritchard was arrested and questioned over the allegation last month .

'I just stuck my leg out to protect myself and it hit the sole of my foot and broke my ankle but luckily it pushed me out of harm’s way. 'It could’ve been so much worse. It could’ve killed me. Mr Greaves-Lord now has to wear a prosthetic leg and has had to give up his job. He has just been awarded a massive payout from the motorcyclist's insurers following a four-year battle . 'I was in extreme pain and was conscious the whole time and aware something was seriously wrong. 'I thought I’d lost my leg right then and there. 'But my friend who was a medic explained everything would be okay and an ambulance came. 'It took eight minutes apparently but it was the longest eight minutes of my life.' Mr Greaves-Lord underwent a year of operations before doctors advised that he would need to have his leg amputated. Now, four years later, he has received a compensation payout after a legal wrangle in the High Court, in London. He added: 'I am pleased and relieved that my legal battle has come to a conclusion and I can now focus completely on rebuilding my life and continue with my recovery and rehabilitation. 'The last four years have been devastating and the injuries I sustained in France have had a huge impact on my life. 'I had always been a very active and independent man but I have struggled to come to terms with the impact the injury and subsequent amputation has had on my life.' The settlement will serve as compensation for the loss of his leg and to cover the financial losses since the crash in October 2010 as well as the ongoing costs of his rehabilitation. Demetrius Danas, a lawyer for Irwin Mitchell who helped Mr Greaves-Lord receive the settlement, said: 'We are delighted that we have been able to secure a settlement which reflects Noel’s complex needs as understandably he and his family have been concerned about what the future might hold. 'Noel has been incredibly courageous throughout this most challenging time and his determination and spirit are inspirational.'","Noel Greaves-Lord was filming Ducati superbikes in the south of France .

"The revelations are acutely embarrassing for Lord Mervyn King, who was governor throughout the crisis before stepping down in 2013 . The extraordinary complacency of the Bank of England in the run-up to the financial crisis has been laid bare in records of secret meetings held between officials. They reveal how blundering officials in the Bank’s ‘Court’ – its inner circle of regulators, executives and independent directors including former governor Mervyn King – grossly underestimated the scale of the impending meltdown. Damning revelations include how Sir Callum McCarthy, the former chairman of the Financial Services Authority and a member of the Court, described the UK banking system as ‘sound’ just two days before the run on Northern Rock in September 2007. Sir Callum also played down the financial problems at the stricken Newcastle lender, praising its ‘good quality loan book’ on the day before the run on the bank. Two months later, officials on the Court dismissed the prospect of a full-blown banking crisis, with minutes of a meeting recording that ‘they do not perceive this as a likely scenario’. The minutes of crisis talks held behind closed doors in Threadneedle Street, in the heart of the City of London, have been published today for the first time, after the Bank agreed to publish them as part of reforms designed to make it more transparent under new governor Mark Carney. The revelations are acutely embarrassing for Lord King, who was governor throughout the crisis before stepping down in 2013. The records, dated between June 2007 and May 2009, also reveal how the Bank chose to award its staff 5.5 per cent pay rises and bonuses just weeks after the near collapse of Northern Rock. Tory MP Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the Commons Treasury Committee, accused directors in the Bank’s Court of being ‘cheerleaders’ who failed to the ‘provide an effective challenge’ to the executive headed by Lord King. He said: ‘The executive rarely acknowledged possible weaknesses in its views or, other than grudgingly, admitted that it might have been unprepared for the crisis.’ Mr Tyrie also accused the Court of ‘back-covering’ in the heat of the meltdown, after failing to pay enough attention to the warning signs. Sir Callum McCarthy, the former chairman of the Financial Services Authority and a member of the Court, described the UK banking system as ‘sound’ just two days before the run on Northern Rock in 2007 . Mr Carney described the financial crisis as a ‘turning point in the Bank’s history’, adding the minutes provide ‘further insight into the Bank’s actions during this exceptional period’. But the papers show officials were slow to recognise the scale of the problem, even as Northern Rock teetered on the brink of collapse. In a meeting convened on September 12, 2007, the day before Northern Rock submitted a formal request for an emergency loan, Sir Callum emphasised that the ‘UK banking system was sound’. The following evening, an emergency meeting was called as the BBC’s then-business editor Robert Peston broke the news that the bank had applied for the loan. Again Sir Callum appeared to underestimate the scale of the problems pointing out that Northern Rock only had a small exposure to risky ‘sub-prime’ loans, was well capitalised and ‘had a good quality loan book’. The records, dated between June 2007 and May 2009, also reveal how the Bank chose to award its staff 5.5 per cent pay rises and bonuses just weeks after the near collapse of Northern Rock . The full scale of the crisis and the potential threat to other UK banks appeared to dawn on Bank officials only following the collapse of US bank Lehman Brothers in September 2008. ‘The crisis had become much more serious,’ the records of an October 2008 meeting state. ‘Some of the UK’s largest banks were facing failure without intervention and the complete seizure of the banking system threatened.’ But records also showed officials were pleased with how they had responded to the problems in the financial system. ‘There was now a real sense that a corner had been turned and the Bank could be proud of its work and contribution … the disease was no longer life threatening but recovery would take time.’ ALEX BRUMMER'S ANALYSIS: This utterly breath-taking complacency . There has always been an air of mystery surrounding the secrets buried inside the temple of the Bank of England. So today’s release of extensive minutes from the Court, the Bank’s governing body, covering the period of the 2007-09 banking crisis, is an event in itself. It effectively marks the end of 320 years of confidentiality. Running to more than 500 pages, the papers show that far from being an effective watchdog for the Bank during the most gripping crisis for a century, the Court was largely a resting place for the great and good of the establishment who were rarely prepared to tackle all-powerful governor Mervyn King and his colleagues on issues of national importance. In fact the Court was not formally told about several billion pounds of emergency loans made to Northern Rock (under what is known as the ‘lender of the last resort’ facility) until the rescue had been leaked to the BBC, prompting a public run on deposits that proved an enormous embarrassment to Gordon Brown’s government. Rash lending: Northern Rock was bailed by the taxpayer in 2008 and was the first bank in 150 years to suffer a bank run . The overwhelming message from the Court’s minutes, which detail the view of King and his colleagues, is one of enormous complacency. The initial problems of Northern Rock had been caused not just by the bank’s rash lending practices, such as the notorious 120 per cent mortgage, but by the freeze in the credit markets where banks lend to each other. Yet there appears to have been little awareness of this among the Court members or for that matter from the governor and his top deputies. The credit crunch was an arrow aimed not just at a few smaller banks but at the whole financial system. King dispatched a paper to Downing Street in March 2008 arguing that piecemeal rescues of UK banks would not be enough . The Bank remained more concerned about its work in controlling inflation than an earthquake in the money markets, where banks lend to each other, that would eventually bring the whole financial system tumbling down and unleash the deepest recession in modern British history. The smugness of the Bank and the key regulator, the since abolished Financial Services Authority, was at times breathtaking. At a time when Northern Rock was dominating the national agenda, the chairman of the FSA Sir Callum McCarthy gently informed his colleagues on the Court that ‘the UK banking system was sound’. He could not have been more wrong. Within months the Bank of England was secretly keeping Royal Bank of Scotland and HBOS afloat with £61.6billion of covert loans designed to stop cash machines from seizing up. Reality was that King and his colleagues may not have been sharing their concerns with the Court because of paranoia about leaks. But behind the scenes the Bank was preparing for the worst. On March 17, 2008, King dispatched a paper to Downing Street arguing that piecemeal rescues of UK banks would not be enough and what was needed was wholesale recapitalisation with the Bank-Government taking share stakes in all the major banks. The governor, however, did not share this view with the Court until October 15, after the collapse of the American investment bank Lehman Brothers brought the global capitalist system to the brink. It was only then that Bank officials explained to the Court the ‘traumatic events’ for financial markets in the wake of the Lehman collapse. King’s memo to Downing Street is of enormous significance because it takes some of the shine off then-prime minister Brown’s later claim to have ‘saved the world’. In his memoir Beyond The Crash, Brown claims to have invented the idea of a recapitalisation, as a means of saving the UK banks, on a returning flight from Washington in September 2008. It now seems it was King who came up with the concept six months earlier.","Sir Callum McCarthy said UK banking system was 'sound' before crash .

"There seems to be no end of people queuing up to mock Kim Kardashian's Paper magazine cover, but one man decided that while he was there, he might as well imitate a few others. Mina Gerges, from  Ontario, Canada, is the brain behind the Instagram account Keeping Up With Mina, and has recreated dozens of iconic celebrity images including Kim and Kayne's wedding and posted them on his account. The Western University student, 20, prides himself on spending hours making everything for each hilarious image. Scroll down for video . Canadian student Mina Gerges spends two hours creating each image parodying a celebrity photograph . Here he uses a wig, plasters for eyebrows and a pillow to imitate Miley Cyrus's sultry naked bed pose . Mina said he wants to help people see overexposed celebrities in a new light, even highlighting the extremes to which A listers will go with Photoshop. Every picture parody is a personal DIY project that takes around two hours. 'I make everything myself,' he told Buzzfeed. 'I purchase curtains and hold them with pins, and everything else I put on them I stick with glue.' On his Twitter biography, Mina describes himself as a 'Kardashian-obsessed third year media student'. The pictures, in which he copies the likes of Beyonce, Kim Kardashian, Nicki Minaj, Lady Gaga and Rihanna, have gained him nearly 40,000 followers on Instagram. A pair of holey tights, some long nail tips and a black wig is all Mina needs to recreate Katy Perry's pose . Mina Gerges recreates Kim Kardashian's ecstatic expression with Kanye West while clutching a slice of pizza . Even Beyonce gets the Mina Gerges treatment as he dons a jewelled bra and headdress to copy her . Kim Kardashian and the pizza slice are back in Mina Gerges' parody of her wedding picture with Kanye West . As a student Mina is on a budget and admits to searching the Dollar Store for props as well as raiding his own stockpile of make-up, jewellery and wigs. He told Stylelist that he started the pictures about a year ago. 'I got to the point where I knew I needed to do something different. I wanted to recreate these photos, to have that hair, that make-up, and those outfits - essentially I wanted to be in the photo instead of pretending to be.' He welcomes all reactions to his work, saying: 'I want to show people it's okay to do whatever if it makes them happy. Mina Gerges, who makes all his props and costumes himself, copies Nicki Minaj's sequined corset . He recreates Lady Gaga's famous clear bubble outfit with white balloons and a wig made of straw . 'I want people to see that there are others out there happy to support you through whatever it is you want to do, whether that's painting your nipples purple for a Rihanna impersonation, or whatever else you might be into.' The pictures showcase his ingenuity, such as using shredded paper to replicate Beyonce's frazzled bob on the Grammy's red carpet. Meanwhile in his Kim Kardashian parody photos, Kanye West is played by a giant slice of pizza. When recreating Lady Gaga's clear plastic bubble dress, Mina substituted the orbs for half-filled white balloons and made a raffia wig, to send up the bizarre pop star. The Instagram star painstakingly cut out flower shapes to channel Beyonce's fishtail dress look . A pair of floral pants and a blonde wig transform him into Iggy Azalea in a moment of rapt concentration . One favourite is Nicki Minaj and Mina has recreated a variety of her photographs including her provocative pose naked in a bath of milk in which he used white blankets, carefully arranging them to protect his modesty. And it's not just Kim Kardashian who gets the Mina treatment - Kylie Jenner has provided new inspiration with her series of pouty selfies, which have sparked online debate about  her fuller-looking lips. He added green extensions to his hair and painted a huge, clownish pink block around his lips to mock Kylie's  Instagram pictures. But he's unashamed about his picture projects and recently tweeted: 'When someone hates on my pics i think 'What Would Kim Do' & the answer is to feel bad for them bc they're not as fab as us.' Strategically-placed blankets help Mina recreate Nicki Minaj's seductive pose stark naked in a bath of milk . Kylie Jenner has sparked discussion about her lips so here Mina shows off a heavily painted pout .

"The family of a mother and wife killed in the AirAsia disaster are struggling to come to terms with the last words she uttered before boarding the plane, in which she said she would 'spend time alone at sea' for her birthday. When fashion store owner The Meiji Thejakusuma bid goodbye to her relatives before boarding AirAsia's Flight 8501, she quipped she would 'spend time alone at sea' on her upcoming  birthday, which she planned to mark with a luxury cruise. But 40 minutes after takeoff, the plane crashed into the sea off the island of Borneo in a disaster believed to have killed all 162 people on board. The Meiji Thejakusuma pictured with her family. Prior to boarding the AirAsia flight, she said she would 'spend time alone at sea' for her upcoming birthday . Workers carry the coffin of The Meiji Thejakusuma at a funeral home following the recovery of her body . On January 3, when she would have turned 45 on the celebratory cruise visiting Malaysia and Thailand, her body was instead being returned to her family in Surabaya, Indonesia, after it was recovered from the Java Sea. Her nephew Eric Edi Santo, a cafe owner, has now relayed his aunt's haunting last words to him as he spoke at the funeral parlour where a vigil was being held, attended by abound 100 friends and relatives. He said: 'We asked her how are you going to celebrate your birthday. She said jokingly: ""I'll spend time alone at sea"". 'Maybe God was trying to be good to her, and didn't want her to spend her birthday alone at sea, so he brought her back.' Thejakusuma got on the plane in her home city of Surabaya on December 28 with her husband, mother, three children and prospective son-in-law. They were headed for Singapore where they would start their cruise, but 40 minutes later disaster struck and the aircraft crashed into the water. Her body, and that of her 10-year-old daughter Stevie, are among the 37 that have so far been recovered, with teams still searching for the remains of the other 125 passengers, most of them Indonesian. They include Thejakusuma's 48-year-old husband Jie Charly Gunawan, her mother Jo Indri, 82, and her two other children, 19-year-old Steven and Stephanie, 28. Stephanie's fiance Christanto Leoma Hutama was also with them. Left, Indonesian military chief General Moeldoko shakes hands with the crew of a U.S. helicopter.

Right, an Indonesian Air Force crew prepares its aircraft prior to beginning its search and rescue operation . Her nephew added: Mr Santo said: 'We hope for a survivor... at least just one of them. I hope that one of them can come back alive.' 'If not, we hope that all of their bodies at least will be here, we don't want any missing bodies. They died so tragically, at least I want them to have a proper burial.' Thejakusuma was the owner of clothes store 'Planet One' in Surabaya, and was known for being hard-working and humble despite her own affluence, said another of her nephews, Agus Panjaya. A devout Buddhist, she regularly made financial contributions to her local temple as well as to orphanages, and she was always quick to help her relatives. Panjaya recalled when he was still at high school and living in a dormitory in the east Java city of Malang, when his aunt and uncle would take turns to drive two hours at weekends to visit him and take him sightseeing around the city. 'They did not want me to feel lonely,' he said. 'It was in my aunt's character to just help people whenever she could, poor people, her own family, anyone. That's why everyone feels a deep sense of loss.' Meanwhile, strong currents have forced Indonesia to expand the search area for the crashed plane, as rough seas and bad weather moved debris and made it difficult to reach suspected chunks of the fuselage on the ocean floor. Two members of the Indonesian National Transportation Safety Committee look through  debris recovered from the crashed AirAsia plane . Rows of seats, some torn apart and others intact, lie scattered across the floor while a man from the Indonesian National Transportation Safety Committee inspects them . Indonesian police display one of the plane's safety information modules found among the recovered debris . With only a fraction of the bodies recovered since the crash, there are also concerns that it will become harder to find the remaining victims. 'Time is of the essence,' said the National Search and Rescue Agency's director of operation, Suryadi B Supriyadi. 'But it seems like it is hard to beat the weather.' The search operation will expand by about 71 square miles (185 sq km). Sonar has identified five large objects which are believed to be pieces of the fuselage on the ocean floor, but strong currents, silt and mud have prevented divers from seeing or reaching the objects. No pings have been detected from the plane's all-important cockpit voice and flight data recorders, because high waves have prevented the deployment of ships which drag ping locators, but the black box may have been located after an Indonesian naval ship discovered what is believed to be the tail section of the doomed jet. The tail is where the crucial data recorder is located and holds the key to finding out what happened to the Airbus when it crashed on December 28. The batteries in the pingers on the black boxes are likely to die in about 20 more days.","Plane crash victim told her family she wanted to 'spend time alone at sea'

"Having been in cohorts for the past five years, you would think the Cabinet members would know one another pretty well by now. But so many were called to the first meeting of the new year yesterday that they needed name cards to tell who was who and where to sit. After the fun of tearing chunks out of each other in the outbreak of election hostilities, the Tories and Lib Dems seemed to be suffering from political hangovers as they squeezed elbow-to-elbow around the table at Number 10. There were glum faces all round as they gathered for the Cabinet meeting, with Lib Dem Nick Clegg - who yesterday rejected a suggestion  to join the Tories - surrounded by some of his biggest critics including George Osborne and Theresa May. Elbows in: Attorney General Jeremy Wright (front left); Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills Vince Cable (sixth from left); Prime Minister David Cameron (eighth from left); Leader of the House of Commons William Hague (ninth from left).

Minister of State for Business and Enterprise Matthew Hancock sits front right . Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg looks glum surrounded by Tories, including (left to right) Theresa May, George Osborne, Philip Hammond and Iain Duncan Smith . David Cameron sat in his usual place in the centre of the table, with Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable two places to his right . There were glum faces at the far end of the table too, where Tory Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villers was surrounded by Lib Dems including . Energy Secretary Ed Davey (second left), Lib Dem Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael and schools minister David Laws . Mr Clegg sat opposite David Cameron, who he accused on Monday of playing 'footsie' with Nigel Farage ahead of the election following the Prime Minister's revelation that the EU referendum could take place earlier than 2017. The Prime Minister sat two seats away from Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills Vince Cable on one side, with Leader of the House of Commons William Hague on his left. Huddled together at the end of the table were Transport Secretary Patrick McCloughlin, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, Energy Secretary Ed Davey, Secretary of State for Scotland Alistair Carmichael and Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Theresa Villers. There was also Minster of State for the Cabinet Office David Laws, Baroness Anelay of St John's and Francis Maude, Minister for the Cabinet Office. Minister for Government Policy Oliver Letwin, Education Secretary Nicky Morgan and Leader of the House of Lords Baroness Stowell of Beeston were also in attendance. Mr Clegg had used a press conference on Monday morning to attack his coalition partners: 'You have the Conservatives unveiling posters saying we should stay on 'the road to a stronger economy'. 'We should. But they don't plan to stay on the road, they want to stray far from it. They're trying to sell you an ideological approach to cuts to public services packaged up as continuity. 'It's a con. It's like a mobile phone salesman offering to renew your existing contract and then cutting the amount of calls you can make.' Mr Osborne and four other senior ministers also used their own press conference to attack Labour spending plans. Asked later what the Chancellor thought of the Lib Dems' spending plans, an aide laughed at the idea they were even relevant. 'I don't think we need to worry about the Lib Dems,' a Treasury source said. Lib Dems Vince Cable and Nick Clegg emerged from Downing Street looking stony-faced after the meeting ended . Tory Chief Whip Michael Gove is responsible for ensuring coalition laws continue to pass, but is also a close adviser to David Cameron on how to beat the Lib Dems and Labour in May's election . Tory Communities Secretary Eric Pickles and Esther McVey, who attends Cabinet as employment minister, outside Number 10 . However today in the Commons it was suggested that Mr Clegg has done such a good job of defending the Government he should come over and join the Tories. Tory MP Peter Bone, who has spent much of the past five years ridiculing the Deputy Prime Minister, told MPs he had made a new year resolution not to be 'mean' to the Liberal Democrats. But as Mr Clegg's regular Commons questions session drew towards the end, Mr Bone suggested he should defect. The Liberal Democrat leader said Mr Bone was just one of many reasons why he could never join the Conservatives. Mr Bone asked: 'May I wish you a happy new year, I made a resolution not to be nasty to the Liberal Democrats. I'm not going to break it. 'You have been very courageous, you have been a courageous leader of the Liberal Democrats, you have socked it to the Labour Party at the Despatch Box today, you're supporting the Prime Minister, you even sound like a Tory. 'Have you thought of joining us?' Mr Clegg replied: 'There are so many reasons I could give you why I would never join and I... without in any way seeking to breach the festive spirit, say you stand as a constant reminder why I would never join your party.'","Glum faces - and name badges - all round as bitter election rivals held elbow-to-elbow meeting in Number 10 .

"The French government has in the past repeatedly rejected demands to sell the Mona Lisa (pictured), but a parliamentary report has suggested it sell thousands of pieces of art to pay off national debt . Cash-strapped France could sell thousands of artworks to pay off its vast national debt, a parliamentary report has suggested. The radical plan to flog paintings and sculptures from the nation's prized collections was mooted by MPs studying ways help clear France's £150billion deficit. It comes after state-run news channel France 24 last year even suggested selling the Mona Lisa - the world's most famous painting which hangs in the Louvre museum in Paris. Now lawmakers have consulted Guillaume Cerutti, the head of Sotheby's auctioneers in France, for his opinion on the sale of publicly-owned art. He said France should move closer to a model used in the United States, where museums sometimes sell unseen parts of their collections to free up resources for the purchase of more relevant artworks. Cerutti told the BFM news channel: 'Action is needed to tackle the grotesque waste in national collections. In the Louvre alone, some 250,000 works are currently hidden away in overflow rooms. 'Museums should also be given the option of selling works that have been in public collections for at least 50 years.' It would not be the first time France has sold off treasures to prop up its finances. In 2013 the presidential Elysee Palace in Paris announced it was selling 1,000 bottles of fine wine to fund renovations. Last summer, France also said it was selling a luxury state-owned apartment on New York's 5th Avenue for around £40million. In December, the government faced accusations of treason when it announced plans to sell half of Toulouse's airport, the country's fourth largest and home of aircraft maker Airbus, to a Chinese-led consortium. The government has repeatedly rejected demands to sell Leonardo da Vinci's painting the Mona Lisa, which is often called 'priceless' but was valued at £60m in 1962 for insurance purposes.

"Labour was plunged into civil war over its mansion tax last night amid Scottish MPs’ plans to use millions of pounds raided from England to pay for 1,000 extra nurses north of the border. MPs queued up to attack the party’s new Scottish leader, Jim Murphy, after he boasted that he would boost the NHS in Scotland by using up to £250million raised from the controversial tax in England. Just 0.3 per cent of the £1.2billion raised by the tax – around £3.6million – will come from Scotland, but it will receive a huge share of the revenues. Labour's Scottish leader Jim Murphy said 95% of mansion tax will be levied in the South East but that its 'benefit will be felt across the UK' Mr Murphy said this enabled him to make a ‘uniquely Labour pledge’ to increase spending on the Scottish NHS without having to increase taxes on Scots. Former Labour leadership candidate Diane Abbott accused Mr Murphy of trying to ‘buy Scottish votes with money expropriated from London’. And former Labour Cabinet minister Tessa Jowell warned him against treating the South East as a ‘cash cow’. In an angry on-air clash with Mr Murphy, Miss Abbott accused him of acting in a ‘highly unscrupulous way’. Dianne Abbott slammed Mr Murphy’s proposal. She said: ‘He just thinks he can buy Scottish votes with money expropriated from London' Mr Murphy mocked Miss Abbott after she mistakenly referred to him as John, saying: ‘It’s hard to take this argument seriously when she didn’t even remember my name.’ He said the levy will go towards funding an extra 1,000 nurses in Scotland - even though just 0.3% will be raised north of the border (file picture) He also told BBC Radio Four’s World At One programme that he doesn’t ‘have to clear things with Ed Miliband’, adding: ‘That’s not the way it works in the Labour Party these days.’ London Mayor Boris Johnson accused Mr Murphy of ‘mugging’ families in the South East to win votes in Scotland. The row erupted after Mr Murphy launched Labour’s election campaign in Scotland with a pledge to use the proceeds of the mansion tax to recruit an extra 1,000 nurses. Labour’s new mansion tax will levy an annual charge on all properties valued at more than £2million. Full details have yet to be announced, but Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said last year that homes worth between £2million and £3million will face an annual bill of £3,000, regardless of income. Critics warn that the tax will disproportionately hit London and the South East, where many ordinary family homes will be caught by the plans. Fewer than 900 homes in Scotland would be affected – 0.3 per cent of the UK total. Tory Party chairman Grant Shapps said the row had plunged Labour into ‘chaos’. He said: ‘Jim Murphy’s comments show once again that Ed Miliband simply does not command the respect of his party. They don’t listen to him or consult him because he is a weak leader.’","95% of mansion tax will be levied in South East England, Jim Murphy said .

"Power giants and airlines were warned last night to pass on plummeting fuel prices to families or face Government sanctions. George Osborne insisted they should quickly follow the lead of petrol retailers and slash their charges. The wholesale price of gas has plunged almost 30 per cent in a year while crude oil has more than halved in six months. A barrel cost just $53 last night – the lowest level in five years. George Osborne has started a Government investigation into whether key sectors such as utilities are reducing consumer bills with Brent crude trading at just 52 US dollars a barrel . The Chancellor insisted it was ‘vital this was passed on to families at petrol pumps, through utility bills and air fares’. ‘The Government is conducting studies of industries like the utilities and the airlines. We are examining if any action needs to be taken,’ a Treasury spokesman said. A source said ministers would be watching utility companies and airlines closely to ensure they cut prices. ‘Consumers could feel the benefit in many other ways if the fall in oil and gas price was passed on to final product,’ one official said. The Chancellor has put energy firms, airlines and others on notice that they must pass on the benefits of a dramatic fall in global oil prices - or face possible state action (file picture) ‘We’re going to be watching them like a hawk. So far this has worked with fuel prices. Pump prices are coming down. We believe it can work with other industries.’ Asda announced a 2p cut in its petrol price this week with a new maximum charge of 107.7p a litre. Other supermarkets have followed suit and experts say petrol prices are heading below £1 a litre. Treasury Chief Secretary Danny Alexander wrote to fuel suppliers and distributors late last year demanding they pass on falling oil prices to customers or face action. All four of Britain's big supermarkets have announced a 2p cut in the cost of a litre of petrol . Oil price: Brent crude has fallen to levels not seen for more than five years . A source close to him said last night: ‘Anybody involved in the supply of energy in terms of petrol, diesel, domestic heating, air fares and domestic gas and electricity must make sure they are passing on the reductions in full. ‘And they must be in no doubt that they should do it very quickly.’ Ed Davey, the Energy Secretary, told LBC Radio: ‘It is vital we get the fall in oil and gas prices through to consumers. I am glad the Treasury is now looking at this.’ Ministers hope lower bills will undermine Labour leader Ed Miliband’s proposal to introduce a 20-month energy price freeze if he wins power in May. Such a move would make it impossible for firms to pass on the benefits of falling wholesale prices. Npower said fears over Labour’s planned freeze was a reason they were not cutting prices. Danny Alexander said the fall in oil prices was a benefit to 'most of the UK economy' - provided savings are passed on . Industry regulator Ofgem last month accused the ‘Big Six’ energy firms of failing customers for not passing on oil and gas price cuts. Its chief executive Dermot Nolan said at least two firms should have slashed prices by now, adding: ‘I am concerned about this and about the lack of competition this would appear to show.’ But British Gas, the UK’s biggest energy firm, defended its decision not cut bills. A spokesman said: ‘We buy our gas well in advance – up to three years in some cases – to ensure security of supply and to smooth out price volatility, so movements in wholesale prices do not feed through immediately to retail prices. ‘The wholesale cost of energy is now less than half the bill – we have other costs that are rising such as network costs, which have risen 40 per cent in seven years. ‘We are certainly not increasing profits on the back of lower wholesale gas prices. Our July 2014 half-year results showed a 26 per cent fall in pre-tax profits.’ Virgin Atlantic cut fuel surcharges by £10 on its long-haul flights last month, but other firms, including British Airways, have not followed suit. The Treasury has written to the bosses of all the major British airlines insisting they should pass on fuel price savings to consumers by cutting surcharges or reducing ticket prices. Mr Alexander said: ‘Airline ticket prices appear not to be falling as significantly as customers might expect given the very significant fall in oil prices.’","Chancellor has told Cabinet colleagues firms will be 'watched like hawks'

"A Detroit man convicted in the kidnapping and brutal murder of his girlfriend's 5-year-old niece was sentenced today to life in prison without the possibility of parole. A jury in December found Darnell Cheatham, 23, guilty of first-degree felony murder, arson, child abuse and other charges in the July 2011 death of Mariha Smith. An earlier jury deadlocked in July. According to prosecutors, Cheatham took Mariha from her east side home, then raped and strangled her. Justice for Mariha: Darnell Cheatham (left), 23, has been sentenced to life in prison without parole in the brutal 2011 rape and murder of his girlfriend's 5-year-old niece, Mariha Smith (right) Guilty: Darnell Cheatham, pictured in a yellow jumpsuit at his sentencing Tuesday, was convicted of first-degree felony murder, arson, child abuse and other charges last month . Mother's regret: Mariha Smith's mother Konesha Smith, right, said in court Tuesday it hurts her to think that she trusted her sister's boyfriend around her children . They said he crushed her skull and set her body on fire on a mattress in a vacant house about a mile from her home. Wayne County Circuit Judge Ulysses Boykin handed down the mandatory sentence under Michigan law Tuesday. 'My daughter is dead at 5 years old,' Konesha Smith told the judge before the sentencing. 'She couldn't enjoy her life. She couldn't see her little brothers and sisters anymore. 'It hurt me so bad that I trusted him around my kids and this is the way he did me.' Mariha's father, Curtis Smith, also got a chance to speak during Cheatham's sentencing, telling the court that he had found out that he had a daughter only a short time before Mariha's death, reported The Detroit Free Press. 'I never had a chance to tell my daughter I love her, touch her, even hold her and tell her that I'm her dad,' he said. Horrific find: The burned body of Mariha was discovered in this abandoned Detroit house near to her home in July 2011 . Bad parenting: Konisha Smith said at the time she couldn't remember anything about the disappearance because she was passed out drunk . Defense lawyer Kareem Johnson told the judge that the outcome of the retrial was 'an absolute travesty of justice' and said the testimony of the witnesses 'changed dramatically between the first trial and the second trial.' 'From the very first time I met Mr. Cheatham, he has maintained he had nothing to do with what happened to that young lady.' Johnson said. Asked if he wanted to speak, Cheatham told the judge: 'Ain't nothing I can say. ... I said all I could say. Nobody believed me.' 'There really isn't anything I wanted to editorialize on because this is a very horrific situation,' Boykin told Cheatham. 'That's been done, the jury has issued its ruling, and all I can do is sentence.' The judge then issued the life sentence for murder and lesser sentences for the other crimes, among them arson, torture, child abuse and disinterment and mutilation of a body. Police said Cheatham abducted Mariha from the house she shared with her mother, Konesha, and aunt, Quanita, who he was in a relationship with. Maintaining his Innocence: Defense lawyer Kareem Johnson slammed the outcome of the retrial as 'an absolute travesty of justice,' and said that his client has always insisted he had nothing to do with Mariha's death . Konisha Smith said at the time she couldn't remember anything about the disappearance because she was passed out on a sofa after a night of drinking. While the search for her daughter was still in progress, the then 24-year-old told CBS Detroit that she had last seen Mariha when the little girl and her three siblings settled down for the night on the living room floor. It was not until two years later that Quanita Smith has revealed to investigators that on the night of Mariha's disappearance, she awoke to find the little girl lying in bed on top of her boyfriend. She said she didn't anything about it because she was too drunk. The child's badly burned body was found July 24, 2011, inside a fire-ravaged abandoned home in the 2900 block of Waverly, about a mile from her house. The toddler had been raped and her skull had been crushed. The cause of death was asphyxiation.","Darnell Cheatham, 23, was convicted of first-degree murder, arson and child abuse in the death of 5-year-old Mariha Smith .

"Sony Pictures' 'The Interview' has made more than $31 million from its online and on-demand release, according to the studio. Sony announced digital figures Tuesday for the film spanning its first 11 days of release since debuting December 24. Sony had previously said the film made $15 million in its first four days online, so demand for the Seth Rogen comedy has slightly declined as Sony has added more platforms. Scroll down for video . Sony Pictures' 'The Interview' has made more than $31 million from its online and on-demand release, according to the studio. James Franco, left, and Seth Rogen, right, star in the film . While $31 million constitutes the most lucrative digital release for a Hollywood film, 'The Interview' stood to make more in a wide theatrical release. It had originally been forecast to earn about $30 million in its opening weekend alone. Still, the significant total represents a sizable recoup for Sony after the film appeared dead. The film follows a entertainment television talk show host and his producer, who score an interview with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. The CIA recruits the two men to assassinate Kim. James Franco plays television host Dave Skylark, with Seth Rogen playing his producer Aaron Rapoport. Randall Park portrays Kim Jong-un. After hackers the FBI have said are North Korean threatened violence in theaters showing the film, North America's top theater chains pulled out of showing 'The Interview' and Sony canceled its release entirely. Premise: 'The Interview' follows a entertainment television talk show host and his producer, who land an interview with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. The CIA recruits the two men to assassinate Kim . Sony said in a December 18 statement picked up by media outlets 'In light of the decision by the majority of our exhibitors not to show the film, we have decided not to move forward with the planned December 25 theatrical release. We respect and understand our partners' decision and, of course, completely share their paramount interest in the safety of employees and theater-goers.' But cobbled-together release in independent theaters and digital outlets has proven modestly successful. Playing in select theaters, 'The Interview' has made about $5 million in two weeks. It's currently playing in 558 theaters, far less than the approximately 3,000 it originally planned to open in. Sony has steadily increased digital operators in the last week, adding cable on-demand providers to a range of streaming options like YouTube and iTunes. The studio said the film has been rented, streamed or purchased 4.3 million times. While the grosses will be divided with each distributor, Sony could potentially earn back the roughly $40 million production budget for the comedy.

"Hundreds of British troops will no longer be sent to help with the fight against Islamic State militants in Iraq this month, amid fears of further casualties on the battlefield in an election year. Downing Street were last night said to be worried that significantly stepping up the UK’s military campaign in the Middle East could influence the general election campaign. Senior officials apparently fear there would be a public backlash if serving UK soldiers were killed while training Iraqi security forces against jihadists. Scroll down for video . Not going: British military advisers instruct Kurdish Peshmerga fighters in Arbil,  Iraq, in November last year. Hundreds of British troops will no longer be sent to fight Islamic State militants in Iraq this month . Michael Fallon, the Defence Secretary, announced in December that hundreds of British troops would be sent to Iraq in January in a dramatic escalation of the war on terror. But in an embarrassing mark of cross-party disarray, the Ministry of Defence yesterday admitted there will be nowhere near that amount sent to the war-torn country within that timescale. Plans to train the Kurdish Peshmerga and Iraqi security forces to counter threats from roadside bombs and defeat militants are still being ‘scoped’, an MoD spokesman said. This was the same line given by the department in early November. Whitehall sources told the Mail: ‘Downing Street does not want any news of UK troops heading for Iraq overshadowing the election campaign. 'They are now looking at delaying the training announced by Michael Fallon.’ The MoD was unable to provide any timescale as to when the hundreds of soldiers would be deployed to the battlefield. It is understood a decision to consider delaying the plans came following a US report into deaths of serving personnel in Iraq. A source added: ‘The Conservative’s concern about Iraq and the potential for soldiers being killed has been reinforced by the US report which was raised at a recent meeting.’ Original claim: Michael Fallon (pictured), the Defence Secretary, announced in December that hundreds of British troops would be sent to Iraq in January in a dramatic escalation of the war on terror . The US Department of Defense announced late last year that Marine Corporal Jordan L Spears had died while taking part in Operation Inherent Resolve – the codename given to the military campaign against Islamic State. The 21-year-old was lost at sea after the MV-22 Osprey he was in lost power shortly after take-off from the USS Makin Island in October. The plane was operating in support of the mission in Iraq and Syria, Navy officials said at the time. Days later, Lance Corporal Sean P Neal, 19, died in a ‘non-combat related incident’ in Baghdad. His death was described as the first death of an American service member in the fight against Islamic State. On Monday, Defense Department spokesman Colonel Steve Warren said US soldiers and Marines at Al Asad air base in western Iraq had been coming under ‘regular’ mortar fire from insurgent forces. Mr Fallon announced in December that hundreds of British service personnel would be training Iraqi and Kurdish forces to fight Islamist jihadists as soon as this month. A ‘force protection’ deployment of combat-ready soldiers was also expected to be sent to defend the military training teams, who would be based at four US bases inside Iraq, Mr Fallon said. Casualties: Marine Corporal Jordan L Spears (left) died while taking part in Operation Inherent Resolve. Days later, Lance Corporal Sean P Neal (right), 19, died in a ‘non-combat related incident’ in Baghdad . The new mission would mark the first significant deployment of ground forces since the last British troops withdrew from Iraq three years ago. Soldiers were set to teach the Iraqi army vital skills, such as how to counter deadly roadside bombs, in a mission which was likely to lead to claims of ‘mission creep’. He announced: ‘Our role now, apart from the air strikes, is increasingly going to be on training. ‘Particularly, a key skill we are going to be helping with its counter-IED, particularly vehicle explosive devices which the Iraqi army hasn’t come across for some time, they don’t know how to handle, they haven’t got the kit or the bomb disposal people to deal with it. ‘So the training we are going to be offering in January will be in infantry skills and some of the basics but particularly on how you deal with IEDs, given all the lessons we have learnt from Afghanistan.’ A handful of British trainers have already been deployed to Iraq to work with the Kurdish and Iraqi security forces. But the move signified Britain’s commitment to a ‘large-scale venture’ in which US-led training programmes are set to be rolled out to soldiers fighting against militants taking over swathes of the country. Kurdish Peshmerga fighters monitor Islamic State positions at the front line in Khazir, Iraq, last September . They were expected to join four large American training bases that will be established within weeks to train and advise the Iraqi army on a wider scale. It is understood they were to include soldiers from the 2nd battalion Parachute Regiment, who would protect the training teams. Islamist jihadists have started laying IEDs to take out Iraqi forces as part of a change in tactics after UK airstrikes blasted their vehicles and killed their fighters. British soldiers – who have learnt how to detect the deadly bombs after fighting against the Taliban in Afghanistan – were asked to help by the Iraqi government due to their specialist knowledge. The announcement by Mr Fallon came after the UK and other allies agreed to support the initiative, which will be spearheaded by 3,500 US troops. The US-led Coalition Training Force was set to include 1,500 troops from Britain, France, Australia and Germany who would train Kurdish and Iraqi troops at the bases in Baghdad and Erbil. An MoD spokesman said the details had not been finalised but the Government remained fully committed to playing an ‘active role’ in the international coalition to defeat Islamic State. A spokesman said: ‘The National Security Council agreed that we should do further work to scope the additional assistance we could offer to the Iraqi military. 'As the Defence Secretary has made clear, details have not been finalised. At this stage no firm decisions have been made.’","Senior officials 'fear public backlash if UK soldiers are killed in Iraq'

Victor Micula (pictured left and right) has said his father's 7,000 employees will not get a payrise but he will be buying a new Bugatti . Victor (pictured second from right) holds a Romanian flag up with friends during a night out . The news left many company staff and their families - totalling around 28,000 people - disappointed after they had hoped for pay rises following news of the court victory. However, Victor's father Viorel Micula tried to play down the fact that salaries would not be raised saying that the money earned was what the firm had been due as a result of a court judgement last year which had not been paid. Mr Micula, who built a business empire with his twin brother Ioan in tourism, property, the media and industry, said: 'We have now won the right to execute the final decision that was given a year ago after which the state refused to pay. 'They tried to offer us shares in the state-owned energy company Petrom. But we wanted the money, we're not interested in shares. 'We need to use the cash to pay our current business expenses. We tried to sort this out in a friendly way, but the state doesn't seem to be interested and we needed to go back to court. 'We should have had the money last year and as a result of not getting it we've had major losses. This sort of situation always favours the state. 'The state can take what they want anytime and they can block any company.' Victor Micula, the son of buisnessman Viorel Micula, takes a mirror selfie as he gets a haircut . Victor Micula (pictured far left and far right) is often in the Romanian media glare for his scandals . But his son Victor lives his life in the spotlight of the Romanian media, with the most recent scandal involving his failure in his exams. He was also criticised earlier when he drove his Ferrari down a pedestrian-only street to go shopping at a jewellery shop with his girlfriend, and was banned from driving for three months when he was caught speeding. Earlier this year, he told reporters he wanted to go to a Romanian monastery to pray and find peace from exam pressure - but angered those meditating at the building by turning up in his private helicopter.","Son of businessman says he will buy a Bugatti while staff denied payrise .

"Plans for a cap on the number of European migrants coming to Britain were dropped by David Cameron just 48 hours before they were due to be unveiled after protests by Angela Merkel, Government sources say. The German Chancellor is in London today for talks with the Prime Minister – and has decided not to meet Labour leader Ed Miliband. She was vehemently opposed to the idea of an ‘emergency brake’ that could be applied if EU migrants exceeded forecasts. Angela Merkel was vehemently opposed to idea of an 'emergency brake' that could be applied if EU migrants exceeded forecasts and David Cameron dropped the plans just 48 hours before they were due to be unveiled . One senior source said the proposal had been included in drafts of a speech by Mr Cameron late last year until a ‘very late stage’. Another official confirmed the proposal had been ditched from the speech setting out his plans for EU reform – 48 hours before it was delivered. Mr Cameron used his long-awaited remarks to set out plans to limit the numbers of people taking advantage of the EU’s right to free movement to come to Britain. He warned Britain’s future in the EU is at stake unless Brussels acts to tackle immigration, suggesting that he will back a British exit unless he gets what he wants. The Prime Minister proposed curbs on tax credits, child benefit, jobseeker’s allowance, housing benefit and council housing for incomers. The payment of out-of-work benefits will be stopped altogether, while tax credits, which top up low paid wages and are seen as the major ‘pull factor’ for immigrants from the Continent, will only be paid to people here and paying in for four years or more. Mrs Merkel is understood to have indicated she is prepared to back proposals for strict limits on migrant access to benefits and public services . But some Eurosceptics were dismayed that Mr Cameron omitted any mention of an even more ambitious plan for an annual quota or an ‘emergency brake’ on EU migrants. Mrs Merkel is understood to have indicated to the Prime Minister that she is prepared to back his proposals for strict limits on migrant access to benefits and public services. British officials hope the German leader will signal support for new rules to persuade British voters to vote ‘in’ in a referendum on EU membership planned if Mr Cameron remains in Number Ten after May’s general election. However, she is thought to have warned the Prime Minister that she is prepared to let Britain leave the EU rather than give ground on its founding principle of free movement. The disclosure that the idea of an emergency brake was dropped from Mr Cameron’ s speech at such a late stage, following warnings from Germany, is likely to further anger some Conservative MPs. Chancellor George Osborne is also said to have been firmly against seeking to negotiate such a system, which was supported by some senior Cabinet ministers. A Downing Street source insisted that while emergency controls that could be applied if numbers of incomers exceeded predictions had been explored, they were deemed ‘unworkable’. Forecasts would have been determined by the European Commission and set too high because of other countries – including Germany, whose population is shrinking – want more migrant workers than Britain, the source said. ‘We could have ended up with a very complex system, determined by Brussels, which was never triggered,’ he added. ‘Our focus is on the in-work benefits like tax credits which act as a very big economic incentive to people to come to this country.’ Arch-Eurosceptic MP Sir Bill Cash warned Britain would be unable to reduce the level of immigration from the European Union without imposing a cap on numbers. ‘Our economy is doing pretty well, and actually that means more people are going to come in. Therefore the cap is really the key question, and if you don’ t have a cap then it won’t work… unfortunately that seems to have been abandoned,’ he said. As well as EU reform, Mr Cameron and Mrs Merkel are today expected to discuss how best to secure growth and tackle the instability in the global economy. Mr Cameron and Mrs Merkel are today expected to discuss how best to secure growth and tackle the instability in the global economy . Britain and Germany are the two fastest growing major economies in Europe, and have pursued similar approaches in recent years – cutting spending, implementing structural reforms and calling for a more competitive, business friendly European Union. Ahead of their meeting, Mr Cameron and Mrs Merkel said in an unusual joint statement: ‘We must do more to make the EU more stable and competitive than it is today. We have both taken steps at home to consolidate our public finances and it is important that we continue to pursue this long-term plan. The German Chancellor  has decided not to meet Labour leader Ed Miliband (pictured) today . ‘We must do more to harness the potential of the single market and reduce regulation that is hampering business. We must also dismantle further barriers to trade, in particular by agreeing an EU-US trade deal in 2015.’ Labour sources said they were ‘irritated’ that Ed Miliband will have no meeting with the German Chancellor, blaming the Government for not telling his office that Mrs Merkel was coming to London. Government sources said opposition leaders were always only informed in advance of official state visits by foreign leaders, unless they indicated they wanted to meet them. Labour’s shadow Europe minister Pat McFadden said Mrs Merkel ‘will no doubt be publicly supportive of Britain’s continued membership of the European Union’ during today’s visit. ‘But in private her message to David Cameron may be a little different. She will of course urge him to keep Britain inside Europe, but she is also likely to reflect German concerns that there is a danger of him and his party expecting too much of Germany, and she will make clear that Britain has responsibilities of its own,’ he added. ‘Merkel’s warning last year that the principle of free movement was for her non-negotiable was a clear and deliberate signal to Cameron. But beyond issues of principle there are also practicalities. 'Put bluntly, Germany does not believe that it should simply be expected to bail out the periphery of Europe financially and Cameron politically. ‘There is a limit to how far Germany will go to help keep the UK in Europe while Cameron continues to play internal politics over our membership of the EU.’","Angela Merkel was vehemently opposed to idea of an 'emergency brake'

"This is the terrifying moment a driver was caught on camera driving the wrong way around a busy roundabout. Driving instructor David Tomlinson, 51, was on his way home after a lesson when he was forced to swerve out the way of the silver Renault Megane. The near-miss took place at Cheriton roundabout in Folkestone, Kent, and was caught on Mr Tomlinson's dashboard camera. Dashcam footage shows the Renault Megane travelling the wrong way around a busy roundabout in Kent . Driving instructor David Tomlinson, 51, said he was forced to swerve out of the way after the vehicle drove towards him on Cheriton roundabout in Folkestone, Kent. His dashcam recorded the vehicle's movements . Mr Tomlinson, a father of two, said the driver was in his late 60s and could have been confused after returning from the continent. He said: 'It would be understandable if it was a foreign driver but it wasn't a foreign car. 'The roundabout is quite near Dover so maybe they had just come back from France and forgot they were on the wrong side of the road. 'He was driving at about 30mph. He just had a normal expression on his face, he didn't look panicked or anything. 'It was pretty lucky that there was nobody in the left hand lane as the guy wasn't stopping and it could have been a pretty bad accident.' Mr Tomlinson said he keeps a dashcam in his car to help show those who he teaches to drive the mistakes they made. He said he was able to keep calm during the incident because of his years working as a driving instructor. He said: 'Doing the job that I do I think I'm used to these things happening unfortunately. 'I’m just glad that at the time there wasn’t a learner in the car because it probably would’ve put them off driving. The father of two said the driver appeared unfazed after driving the wrong way around the busy roundabout . 'It could’ve been a lot worse, if there had been a car in the lane I needed to move into, I wouldn’t have been able to pull across. He just kept on coming. 'The problem with the roundabout is its quite big and fast, so cars go around about 25-30mph. 'If that left lane had been blocked I would’ve been involved in a head-on or a side swipe.

"A U.S. brewery has been forced to apologize for naming an ale after the teetotal Indian leader, Mohandas Gandhi. The New England Brewing Co. in Connecticut was slammed for its Gandhi-Bot pale ale by consumers, who claimed the beverage was an an 'illegal insult' to India.

Underfire: The New England Brewing Co. in Connecticut was slammed for its Gandhi-Bot pale ale by consumers, who claimed the beverage was an an 'illegal insult' to India . A U.S. brewery has been forced to apologize for naming an ale after the teetotal Indian leader, Mohandas Gandhi. Following a legal complaint about the beer in Hyderabad, India, the New England Brewing Co issued an apology to Facebook. It said in a statement that its intent wasn't to 'offend anyone but rather pay homage and celebrate a man who we respect greatly.' Despite the backlash, the company says it has no plans to withdraw the beer, which is not sold internationally. It claims that Gandhi's granddaughter and grandson have seen the label and have 'expressed their admiration' for it. Icon: What particularly caused upset was the can artwork, which reimagines Gandhi (seen here in 1948) as a robot with one hand raised in blessing . However, the company's stance could change when the case hits the courts Monday. A petitioner in India contends that Gandhi’s image on the alcohol cans and description of the father of the nation by the brewery is highly condemnable and punishable under Indian laws. However, there are also those who fully-support the drink. One fan wrote on Facebook: ' Gandhi-Bot is best. Keep the craft up. 'I'm an Indian and proud to drive five hours often to [the The New England Brewing Co] just for Bot.' Another added: 'My only problem with your beer is that it is always sold out. Keep up the great work.' On the website Gandhi-Bot is pegged as an intensely hopped double India pale ale with a blend of three varieties of American Hops. It is also described as 'fully vegetarian' and an 'ideal aid . . . for the seeking of truth and love.'","The New England Brewing Co. in Connecticut has been slammed for its Gandhi-Bot pale ale .

"Precious: Allison Noyce with husband Richard and their daughter Sophie, now 16 months old . After going through the menopause aged 20, Allison Noyce was told she could never have children naturally. So when she went to the doctor with stomach pains 15 years later, she was astonished to learn that she was pregnant – and the baby was due within days. The 36-year-old was afraid she had cancer when she felt pain and found a lump in her stomach. Instead, medics told her she was eight months pregnant, and just 12 days later she gave birth to daughter Sophie, who weighed 6lb 4oz. Mrs Noyce said: ‘Sophie is truly a miracle. We simply couldn’t believe it when doctors said I was not only pregnant – but so close to delivery.’ The fitness instructor became alarmed when she felt unusually tired after one 40-mile bike ride. She said: ‘Around the same time I noticed pains in my tummy, and over the past few weeks, I had thought I could feel a lump. Terrified, I booked an appointment with my GP.’ Her doctor believed the lump was ‘probably a large cyst’ and quickly sent Mrs Noyce to hospital for tests. She was sure pregnancy was not a possibility because at the age of 30, after marrying her husband Richard, she had gone back to the doctor’s to double check that she would never conceive naturally. She recalled: ‘Richard and I were worried it was something serious. So we were overcome with emotion when the woman doing an ultrasound said I was eight months pregnant. Relief that it wasn’t cancer and sheer joy that we were having a baby. ‘We were also in shock – when a midwife arrived to discuss birthing arrangements I thought I was dreaming. ‘In hindsight I’d had other signs, but put morning sickness down to a virus and tiredness down to being busy.’ Mrs Noyce was told she would never have children naturally after going through menopause in her twenties. Most women experience the menopause – a natural change in the body’s sex hormones – between 45 and 55. Scroll down for video . 'She was perfect': Mrs Noyce with Sophie as a newborn in July 2013. She could hardly believe she was a mum . Concern: The fitness instructor became alarmed when she felt unusually tired after a bike ride. Right, Sophie . Surprise: Medics told her she was eight months pregnant, and just 12 days later she gave birth to Sophie . In rare cases, some women experience menopause before they reach 40, often for no known cause. This premature ovarian failure affects about one in 100 women before 40, and five in 100 by 45. Mrs Noyce said: ‘I only had scanty periods in my teens and they stopped completely when I was 20. But it was still terrible to be told so young that I’d never have a family. The average age at which women go through the menopause in Britain is 51. Menopause occurs when a woman’s ovaries run out of eggs, meaning she can no longer have children. One in 20 women goes through an early menopause, before the age of 45, because her ovaries stop working properly, a British study found last year. The process can be gradual, with a woman producing eggs and having periods intermittently. During this perimenopause stage, which can last years, a woman may still conceive, although experts usually describe the chance as negligible. There may be no medical reason for early menopause, or it may be caused by hysterectomy, radiotherapy or chemotherapy. The Daisy Network is a support group for women going through early menopause. ‘We’d already given up all thoughts of having a baby, we’d never used contraception and in fact since I’ve been with Richard I’ve never had a period. But it was still terribly sad when tests confirmed I’d definitely gone through the menopause and that I’d never be a mum or make Richard a dad. He gave me a hug and said perhaps being parents wasn’t for us.’ Instead, Richard, 41, wrote a ‘bucket list’ of things they could look forward to as a childless couple. Over a decade the pair, from Southampton, travelled the world and pursued hobbies such as long-distance bike riding and hill walking. But they were delighted to learn the doctors had been wrong, and couldn’t wait to tell their stunned friends and family the news. Mrs Noyce said: ‘Richard and I rushed round in a haze of excitement buying baby clothes. One friend donated a pushchair, another gave me a book about pregnancy – I skipped to the last month. ‘It was strange telling people our baby was due in the next four weeks.’ After 12 days, in July 2013, she woke with contractions – and five-and-a-half hours later Sophie was born. Mrs Noyce said: ‘She was perfect, beautiful. After my 12-day pregnancy I could hardly take it in – I was a mum.’ Delighted: Richard, 41, had written a ‘bucket list’ of things they could look forward to as a childless couple . 'Perfect': Sophie, above on her birthday, is now 16 months old and the Noyces still can’t believe she’s here . Mystery: Mrs Noyce said that doctors have no idea why she conceived so many years after the menopause . Sophie is now 16 months old and the Noyces still can’t believe she’s here. Mrs Noyce explained: ‘Doctors have no idea why so many years after going through the menopause I suddenly conceived. Since her birth I still haven’t had a period, so while we’d love another baby, it might be she is our only child. ‘We are just enjoying our precious daughter – she is the miracle baby we never thought we’d have. We look at her and feel incredibly lucky.’","Allison Noyce was told she could not have children after early menopause .

"Strange, sad and macabre, the discovery of the skeletal remains of twin brothers Andrew and Anthony Jonson has left their neighbors baffled. Just how did two 63-year-old men die sitting in their easy chairs inside their modest Chattanooga, Tennessee home and lie undiscovered for three years? Despite their reputations as hermits, why did no family members ever check on them and just who was cutting their front lawn regularly, while the two men slowly decayed indoors? Scroll Down for Video . Home: The badly decomposed bodies of two identical twins Andrew and Anthony Johnson, 63, were found sitting in recliners in their living room in Chattanooga, Tennessee, Saturday . Even while they were alive, though, the 63-year-old twins were something of a mystery to their neighbors, who occasionally saw them wearing surgical masks while gardening but never saw them with visitors. 'I didn't even know their names,' said retiree Linda Maffett, who lived across the street. In an interview about the Johnsons she added, 'It's a strange story, it's a sad story. I think it's sad that they were sitting there that long with nobody checking on them.' Police went to the home March 29 after being asked to check on the brothers by a relative who had a key. Officers found the twins' decomposing bodies sitting in recliners in the living room. Their conditions suggested that both men had been dead since 2011. An autopsy helped confirm their identities, but preliminary results revealed no obvious signs of trauma or foul play, Chattanooga police spokesman Tim McFarland said. He said there was some flesh on the brothers' skeletal remains. Watch Video Here: . Baffled: Police found the skeletal remains of Andrew and Anthony Johnson sitting in their recliners in a living room in their home Saturday. The conditions of the bodies suggested that both men had been dead since 2011 . The Hamilton County medical examiner is working on toxicology tests. In the meantime, McFarland said police are not speculating on a cause of death. But Chattanooga residents are formulating their own theories. Was there a gas leak that killed them? Was it a double suicide? Were they poisoned? Or did they just sit down one day and die together? Neighbors said they had not seen the brothers in at least a couple of years. They said the Johnsons kept to themselves and didn't associate with others in Chattanooga's Hixson community. They might be seen working on their lawn or going for groceries together. But blinds blocked any view into the white house on Acorn Court in the quiet, hilly neighborhood of one- and two-story homes. The Johnsons' house remained dark, with no exterior lighting, even at night, neighbors said. Police made a welfare check on them in 2011 at the request of a relative, but found nothing untoward to lead them to break into the house. They said a relative told them that it would be unsurprising if the twins moved without telling anyone in the family. Some just assumed the house was vacant. Chattanooga Police Officer Tim McFarland said neighbors had no idea anything was wrong because there was no odor coming out of the house and the brothers lived like hermits and had little contact with family or anyone else . Although the Johnson brothers had stopped cutting their own grass, neighbors said it kept getting cut. No one has been able to say who maintained it, whether a neighborhood volunteer, relative or someone else. A note inside the mailbox indicated that mail delivery had stopped because the postal service thought the Johnson brothers had moved. Maffet, one of their nearest neighbors, said that years ago the short, stocky brothers could be seen at times working on their lawn while wearing surgical masks. It is not clear if they had health problems, though one day Maffett went to help one of the men whom she found lying on his front porch after he had fallen down. Maffett offered to get his brother but he said his sibling was deaf. Maffett called 911 for assistance but never entered the house, and it was the only time she over spoke with either of them, she said. 'I never heard them say anything to each other,' she said. A Census worker even approached Maffett one day to ask about the whereabouts of the Johnsons. Tragic: The men were hermits who rarely spoke with family or neighbors . Police say the brothers owned vehicles and had a valid driver's license. They had insurance and there were even records of them owning their own business. Investigators say there was no indication that the brothers suffered from mental illness. But they had little to no communication with others. 'While this incident is tragic and unfortunate, Andrew and Anthony lived a hermit lifestyle and did not communicate with family or anyone else,' a police news release said. The Johnsons' bodies were found just a few weeks after the mummified remains of a woman were found in the garage of a suburban Detroit home. Relatives said that while those remains have not been formally identified, they belong to homeowner Pia Farrenkopf, who had been missing for years while her bank automatically paid her bills. Both her case and that of the Johnsons have prompted conversations about how well Americans keep in touch with their neighbors. Finally found: On Saturday, family members called police after finding a key to the residence and officers found the deceased men inside . No one has been able to locate any relatives of the Johnsons. A man who was at the house Thursday ordered a reporter to get away from the property. He declined to identify himself. The Johnson brothers were already living on Acorn Court when Maffett moved in about 18 years ago. Hamilton property records show the brothers bought the house in 1984 for about $43,000. Built in 1955, it is currently worth about $116,000. Maffett said she felt something was wrong, but she did not check on them. She had not seen them for at least a couple of years by the time the bodies were found. 'I really felt bad that it happened and I didn't have the courage to go barging over there and knock on the door when I had that gut feeling,' said Maffett, who is 73. Cory Hall, 38, and his wife have been renting a home in the neighborhood since December. Hall said he and other neighbors have talked about the deaths and they all are speculating about what happened. 'I would just like to know a little bit of the history about how they became such hermits,' Hall said. 'They had to be off everybody's radar for quite a while.'","The remains of Andrew and Anthony Johnson, 63, were found at their Chattanooga home on Saturday .

"Two Saudi border guards and their commanding officer have been killed  following a suicide bomb and gun attack near the Iraqi border. The deadly attack along the 745-mile border is the first since the country joined the U.S.-led coalition conducting airstrikes against Islamic State (ISIS) militants in Syria. Two of the assailants were shot dead during yesterday's attack, while one detonated an explosive belt he was wearing. The other was shot dead by security forces, the interior ministry said. Three guards were killed at a border crossing between Saudi Arabia and Iraq in a suicide and gun attack . No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack, which also left three border guards wounded. But Mustafa Alani, an Iraqi security analyst with close ties to Saudi Arabia's interior ministry, said the use of a suicide bomber pointed to ISIS. He said: 'It is the first attack by Islamic State itself against Saudi Arabia and is a clear message after Saudi Arabia entered the international coalition against it.' The incident took place after four gunmen, believed to have come from inside Iraq, opened fire on the guards. Interior Ministry spokesman Mansour al-Turki said four 'terrorists' had fired on the patrol at around 4:30 am in the Northern Borders Province. They had been spotted crossing the border near Judayyidat Arar  at dawn. The incident took place after four gunmen, believed to have come from inside Iraq, opened fire on the guards near Judayyidat Arar in Northern Borders . Judayyidat Arar is close to the border with Iraq's western province of Anbar, parts of which are controlled by IS and its Sunni Arab allies. The Interior Ministry said the guards returned fire, killing two attackers. The other two tried to flee and hide, the ministry said. 'The terrorists opened fire and the patrol responded accordingly. As a result, one of the terrorists was killed while another terrorist detonated an explosive belt he was wearing when the patrol tried to convince him to surrender himself,' the spokesman said. 'The patrol called on them to surrender, but one of them blew himself up while the other was killed by security men.' Saudi government websites said the commander of the border guard in the area, Brigadier General Oud Awad al-Balawi, was among those killed. The government-linked Sabq news website reported that the gunmen were armed with hand grenades, pistols and explosive belts. Residents in the area told how the Saudi military aircraft could be seen overhead throughout the day. In November, Saudis living nearby were asked to relocate for at least a year to allow a 20km (12-mile) buffer zone to be created. The order also included widening buffer zones in the Eastern Province border city of Hafr al-Batin, near Kuwait and Iraq, and Tabuk Province, near Jordan. The decision was announced around the same time that IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi called on supporters to launch attacks inside Saudi Arabia in retaliation for the airstrikes. Saudi Arabia has spent billions of dollars reinforcing security and building a heavily fortified fence along the border following the U.S.-led war in Iraq and its violent aftermath.","Four gunmen, believed to have come from Iraq, opened fire on the guards .

"Apprentice boss Lord Sugar has been accused of bullying behaviour after calling a plus-size model 'fatty' on Twitter. The multi-million pound business tycoon, 67, became embroiled in a Twitter row after sending the 'cruel' message to beauty queen Elena Raouna, 23. The row unfolded after she sent him a cheeky message on Sunday night, which said: 'Evening sugar ;-) can I call you that? Lol.' He replied: 'yes no problem as long as I can call you fatty,' which sparked outrage from some her 2,800 followers who branded him 'a bully', 'arrogant' and a 'miserable old goat'. Miss Raouna, who won Miss British Beauty Curve in 2013, is now demanding an apology from the no-nonsense TV personality, who made his name founding British electronics company Amstrad. Scroll down for video . Apprentice star Lord Sugar (left) has become embroiled in a Twitter row after replying to a cheeky message from plus-size model, Elena Raouna, 23 (right), from Doncaster, and saying: 'As long as I can call you fatty' Miss Raouna had messaged the multi-million pound business tycoon because she was a 'massive fan'. She is now demanding an apology from the Amstrad founder, and has received support from fellow Twitter users . Lord Sugar replied to Miss Raouna's tweet asking if she can 'call him sugar', by saying: 'Yes no problem, as long as I can call you fatty.' He received a wave of abuse for the 'cruel', 'disgusting' Twitter message (above) She said she was 'absolutely fuming' at his 'cruel' tweet and said she had only sent him a message to get his attention because she was a 'massive fan' of BBC's The Apprentice. His reply was seen by his 3.8million followers, retweeted more than 1,400 times and favourited by 900 Twitter uses. Miss Raouna, from Doncaster, said: 'The worst thing about it is I was actually a fan and all I wanted was a simple hello. 'I kind of got excited when I saw his name come up in my newsfeed until I read the end of the tweet. 'I think it’s just really rude and disrespectful, there’s no need to respond with that kind of attitude, and the fact that he can’t even apologise. And why block me? I didn’t do anything wrong. 'I just would really like it if he said sorry. He’s not just offended me, but a lot of plus sized people all over Britain. 'I never got personal with him, I just wanted a friendly tweet.' She said she is a size 16 – the average size for a woman in Britain – and claimed the tweet was an insult to all women, not just her. She added to the Mirror: 'I'm still absolutely fuming. It was so cruel. 'I can see people joking about it online and it's as if he's sent out a message to his followers saying it's ok to call people fat. 'It was just a friendly tweet to say 'hi' but my face froze in shock with his reply and I had to check it was his official Twitter page because I couldn't believe he would be so abusive. 'It's cyber bullying.' Lord Sugar, who founded British electronics company Amstrad, has been branded a 'cyber bully' for his tweet .

However, she is now demanding an apology from the wealthy businessman . Writing on Twitter, she said: 'A light hearted commented to get someone's attention who you are a big fan of for a simple hello did by no means deserve the response I got. 'Over 1300 retweeted and almost 900 favourites #LordSugar s***** comment. That Lord is representing it's ok to call people Fat anywhere! Tut. (sic) 'Sugar doesn't deserve to have the title Lord in front of his name after his childish immature rude choice of message. And no apology! 'Who would want that kind of man as your child's role model? Terrible...' Many Twitter users also took offence to Lord Sugar's tweet, with one branding it 'disgusting'.

"A father of two who became a YouTube sensation by filming himself as he learnt to cook is giving Jamie Oliver a run for his money – after being announced as the new face of a Sainsbury's campaign. Barry Lewis, from Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, didn't even know to poach an egg five years ago and started filming himself in his kitchen as he taught himself to cook with his daughter Phoebe, now six. The 32-year-old, who has a degree in IT from Bath Spa University, has racked up nearly 10million views, 150,000 subscribers, a best-selling book called 'Dinner's On' and has featured on Jamie Oliver's Food Tube channel. Now, the married father of two has been chosen to front Sainsbury's 'Love Your Freezer' campaign, which promotes cooking nutritious family meals straight from the freezer. Scroll down for videos . Barry Lewis, 32 (pictured), from Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, became a YouTube sensation after uploading videos of himself learning how to cook. He has now been revealed as the face of a new Sainsbury's campaign . The married father of two, who is a fan of Jamie Oliver (pictured together above), wants to follow in the famous chef's footsteps and quit his full-time job as a quantity surveyor to pursue his newfound career . The former quantity surveyor fronts Sainsbury's new 'Love Your Freezer' advertisement campaign (pictured) Mr Lewis, who quit his full-time job as a quantity surveyor two years ago to concentrate on his new career, said: 'I never thought I'd ever make any money out of it. 'It just snowballed from the first film. I uploaded poached egg on toast and it has gone mad ever since. 'Food has become more than just a hobby, so I spend most weekends cooking and coming up with recipes. 'It has become a passion to me and I am on an incredible journey.' He said he had even started exercising due to the amount of food he is now cooking and eating. 'I've had to start going to the gym because I'll end up putting on weight because of cooking from home,' he said. Mr Lewis used to rely on takeaways but was inspired to learn to cook after watching Jamie Oliver poach an egg during a Christmas special. His first video 'poached egg on toast' was posted on YouTube in January 2010 and was soon followed by 'ratatouille'. Since then he has posted more than 700 videos which have attracted 9.6 million views and he now has his own website www.myvirginkitchen.com. Many of the videos feature him cooking with daughter Phoebe in the kitchen of the family's  £150,000 home in Weston-super-Mare, and they often wear fancy dress as they lark around in front of the camera. Mr Lewis didn't even know how to poach an egg five years ago, but has now taught himself a host of recipes . He has attracted nearly 10million views and 150,000 subscribers with his regular cookery videos on YouTube . Mr Lewis used to rely on takeaways but was inspired to learn to cook after watching Jamie Oliver poach an egg during a Christmas special. He now features on the supermarket's 'Love Your Freezer' campaign (above) His other daughter Chloe, two, has also appeared, although his camera-shy partner Rebecca has never voluntarily featured in the videos. He said: 'Sometimes I get a bit of help from Phoebe as she likes to join in. 'But you'll never see much of Becky. She's like a Tom and Jerry character in my videos - you will just see a bit of an arm or a leg as she gets out of the way of the camera.' Mr Lewis also performs daft cooking stunts with titles such as 'Cooking in My Pants' and 'Builder's Cake', where he uses a cement mixer in his kitchen. He said it wasn't his parents - his father Steve is a postman and his mother Anne, a school nurse assistant - who inspired him to take up cooking, but instead his idol Jamie Oliver. He never had an interest in food growing up, when he attended Priory Community School - an academy trust in the Worle area of his hometown. Instead, he spent four summers working as a lifeguard in the U.S. as part of Camp America in his 20s, before returning to the UK to work at Halifax bank for seven years. He became a quantity surveyor in September 2008 but quit two years ago after sending a clip of one of his recipes to Jamie Oliver. As a result of sending the video, Mr Lewis became a regular contributor to the star's Food Tube channel and said he quit his job as a quantity surveyor - which involved a daily commute to Newport, south Wales - to concentrate on his cookery career. He has since appeared on The Apprentice, This Morning and The Gadget Show. All of his videos are still filmed in his kitchen but his success has allowed him to splash out on essential equipment such as a tripod. He said: 'At the start I was getting ideas from food websites, but I soon started to get a bit more creative and a lot of the recipes these days tend to be more of my original ideas. 'I've got a tripod now for the camera. I was balancing it on some biscuit tins before. 'It's very much real cooking in a real kitchen. The father of two often dresses up in fancy dress for the videos, and gets help from his daughter Phoebe, six . The 32-year-old from Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, who has an IT degree from Bath Spa University, will front Sainsbury's 'Love Your Freezer' campaign, which promotes cooking nutritious family meals from the freezer . Mr Lewis sent a clip of one of his recipes to his idol Jamie Oliver and became a regular contributor to the star's Food Tube channel two years ago. He has since seen his popularity rise and received millions of views . 'There are no food stylists, and instead of a live audience of about 100 people, as there was for the launch of Food Tube, it's usually just me on my own.' Mr Lewis now wants to inspire other 'kitchen virgins' to try out new recipes. 'I want to inspire other people to cook instead of feeling intimidated about giving it a try,' he said. 'My philosophy is that if I can do it, then anyone can. 'Everything you see me cook I am cooking for the first time - it is all about trying to inspire people who have never cooked to give it a go. 'I have done more than 700 videos to date, mainly recipes ranging from simple one-pot dishes, quick dinner ideas to cooking with kids or naughty desserts. 'I like to have fun, too, and often taste things people have been sending me or try and overcome food fears. Basically, anything goes.' 'What is nice is the way My Virgin Kitchen has become a real community. I really enjoy the reaction I get from people who follow me. 'My phone doesn't stop vibrating these days, as I'm always getting messages on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.' Mr Lewis is a big fan of the frozen food he is seen preparing in his Sainsbury's TV ads, which aired on screen last Friday. 'The freezer is great for storing meals ahead of time,' he said. 'If you can get into the habit of batch cooking at the weekend and storing in the freezer for a quick week night fix, you'll save having to cook from scratch and still get a great meal.' The 'Love Your Freezer' campaign will run on TV and online until mid-February.","Father-of-two Barry Lewis revealed as new face of Sainsbury's campaign .

"Salvage experts believe that an inadequately-secured JCB could have dug a hole in the side of a ship which was deliberately grounded on a sandbank in the Solent. The engineers say the Hoegh Osaka may have been thrown off balance because one of the 105 excavators broke free from its restraints as the ship began its voyage. It comes as experts abandoned today's plans to re-float the vessel, after warnings it had taken on more water than previously thought. This picture shows some of the JCB vehicles on Hoegh Osaka's cargo deck before it set sail . Engineers say the vessel may have been thrown off balance because one of the 105 excavators broke free from its restraints as the ship began its voyage . Speaking about the dramatic incident, Bram Sperling, from salvage company Svitzer, said an excavator shifted on the sixth deck, knocking a hole in the hull of the vehicle carrier. Despite being quickly repaired by engineers, it is thought the hole could have caused the ship to list. Mr Sperling added that members of his 18-strong team had been on board the vessel and inspected the cargo, most of which had remained in place. A single Rolls-Royce Wraith, estimated to be worth about £260,000, was on board, among more than 1,000 Jaguars and Land Rovers and 65 Minis. The £35million cargo - all destined for Middle Eastern customers - could be scrapped, even if the vehicles are retrieved with little damage. He said: 'We have not looked in detail at the cargo, we have only looked if we have some displacement of the cargo and we have seen a few vehicles, big ones, that have.' Salvage experts had said they planned to attempt to refloat the giant vessel at high tide today. But the Maritime and Coastguard Agency have now confirmed that plans have been delayed. The 180m Singapore-registered ship is currently listing at 52 degrees and the salvage operation is expected to take days, possibly weeks. A spokesman said: 'Following the completion of the salvors' calculations this evening, it has been decided that there will not be an attempt to re-float the Hoegh Osaka tomorrow. 'The salvors' calculations revealed that more water has entered the vessel than previously thought. 'The preparation for the re-float will therefore take longer than the weather window will allow tomorrow. The Hoegh Osaka was deliberately run aground on a sandbank called the Bramble Bank between Southampton and the Isle of Wight on Saturday night to prevent it capsizing . 'The alternative option of securing the Hoegh Osaka will be followed and preparations for the re-float will continue when the weather allows.' The 51,000 tonne ship was deliberately run aground on Saturday night on a sandbank called the Bramble Bank, between Southampton and the Isle of Wight,  to prevent it capsizing. The vessel, which has a cargo of 1,400 cars and 80 pieces of construction equipment, began to list as it left the port, forcing the captain and the pilot to take the emergency action. A bid to pull the ship free at high tide using four tugs failed on Monday, leaving the 180 metre long Hoegh Osaka grounded because the tides were not high enough to refloat her. A 200m exclusion zone has been set up around the ship to prevent small vessels interfering with the tugs and other shipping. The vessel, which has a cargo of 1,400 cars and 80 pieces of construction equipment, began to list as it left the port, forcing the captain and the pilot to take the emergency action . A massive rescue operation was launched on Saturday night involving four lifeboats and four tugs working to save the entire crew of 25, which was eventually winched off the vessel and taken to safety. According to an RNLI spokesman, some of them had to be rescued from the water. A helicopter and lifeboats from Calshot, Yarmouth and Cowes were scrambled to the scene. A total of 22 crew were initially rescued from the doomed ship, leaving three senior officers aboard. However, the last three had to be winched to safety at 2am, when then the ship listed forther. Mark Clark, spokesman for Hoegh Autoliners which owns the vessel, said that the cause of the incident would be the subject of a marine accident investigation. He said the company was currently assessing damage and stability issues on board its vessel and that the primary concern had been for the crew on board. It has been confirmed that one crew member was injured. He was airlifted to Queen Alexander Hospital in Portsmouth with non-life threatening injuries. One of the major problems facing salvage workers is the immense weight of the ship and its cargo. Sources say that one way to assist in refloating the boat would be to remove the cars from its cargo hold. But such an operation is expected to present an immense logistical headache. Bramble Bank is a well-known sandbank in Southampton Water and is the scene of an annual cricket match between two yachting clubs when the sands are exposed in low spring tides. In November 2008, the Cunard liner Queen Elizabeth 2 with 1,700 passengers on board ran aground on Bramble Bank but was able to continue its journey on the rising tide after four tugs pulled it clear.","Excavator allegedly shifted on the sixth deck, knocking a hole in the hull .

"They were the foot soldiers of the American Revolution, and are set to be at the center of new History channel miniseries Sons of Liberty. And on Tuesday night a time capsule buried by war figures Paul Revere, Samuel Adams and William Scollay in 1795 was opened up, some 220 years after it was first put in the ground. Officials at Boston's Museum of Fine Arts spent hours pouring through the 10-pound, corroded copper box and the artifacts inside. Among the finds were five folded newspapers and at least 24 coins - dating from 1652 to 1855 - including half-cent, one-cent, half-dime, 10-cent and 25-cent coins. Another set of coins included a pine tree shilling  and a copper medal showing George Washington. Scroll down for video .

Priceless: Pam Hatchfield from the Museum of Fine Arts Boston  displays a coin dated 1652 as she removes it from the time capsule . There were at least 24 coins in the time capsule, including half-cent, one-cent, half-dime, 10-cent and 25-cent . Treasure: Items removed from the time capsule will be on display for a while, but eventually the time capsule will be placed in the cornerstone again . Coins, including a copper medal depicting George Washington (lower left), sit in an archival box after being removed from a time capsule, which was placed under a cornerstone of the State House in 1795 . An engraved silver plate contained a message from the men who left the box behind and as dated July 4, 1795. It had been personally engraved by Paul Revere. There was also a seal of the Commowealth of Massachusetts, some cards . and a title page from the Massachusetts Colony Records. The original capsule was made of cowhide and believed to have been embedded in a cornerstone when construction on the state Capitol building began in the same year. Adams, the celebrated brewer, was governor at the time. The contents were shifted to the copper box - measuring at 5½ inches by 7½ by 1½ - in 1855, which was only unearthed last month at the Statehouse. Workers stumbled across it while doing repairs for a water leak at the building. Officials say old records and X-rays taken in December after the box was located and removed indicated the contents, so there were few surprises during the unveiling on Tuesday night. The main mystery was the condition of the items, which experts believe partially deteriorated over time. Pamela Hatchfield, a conservator at the museum, said the capsule initially was unearthed accidentally in 1855 when some modifications were made to the building, according to CNN. 'The paper is in amazingly good condition,' Hatchfield said as she went through the box. Heroes: The capsule was buried by American Revolution figures, patriot Paul Revere (left) and statesman and political philosopher Samuel Adams (right) in 1795 .

Price two cents: The contents of the 1795 time capsule,which was removed from the Massachusetts State House in December . Message in a box: A silver plaque inscribed by Paul Revere, found in a 1795 time capsule, is displayed at the Museum of Fine Arts . Hatchfield said the tools she was using to remove objects from the time capsule included a porcupine quill, a bamboo tool and her grandfather's dental tool. It took four hours just to loosen the screws on the box's lid, Hatchfield said. She then spent at least another three hours looking through the capsule. Secretary of State William Galvin said notes from that era indicated that officials washed some of the contents with acid before putting them in the new copper box. He also said records show it was a humid day when the items were restored and the corner of the Statehouse where the capsule was reinstalled has had a water leakage problem for decades. It's the second time capsule to resurface in Boston in recent months. In October, a capsule dating to 1901 was uncovered in a lion statue adorning the Old State House. That contained newspaper clippings, letters and a book on foreign policy. The latest time capsule may be but back in the ground with its orginal items and some new things. For now the items will be displayed at the museum until officials decide what to do with the capsule. Upcoming: Actors portray Revolutionary War soldiers in a scene from Sons of Liberty, a new miniseries premiering in January on the History Channel . New series: Sons Of Liberty will tell the stories of war figures Paul Revere, Samuel Adams and William Scollay . The History Channel will debut their miniseries Sons of Liberty later this month. It is a three-part, six-hour series that tells the back stories of the Founding Fathers and their furtive efforts to turn a colony into a country. It will feature Revere's  famous ride of April 18, 1775, to warn the colonists the British were coming. 'Most people think of this time as a bunch of guys in wigs who got in a room and wrote up the Declaration of Independence, but it is so much more than that,' Dirk Hoogstra, the History Channel's general manager, said. 'I’m not sure people really understand how crazy it was to make the decision they made to go to war with the most powerful military in the world, being untrained and unorganized.'","Capsule was buried by war figures Paul Revere, Samuel Adams and William Scollay in 1795 .

"How often you call your mother, what time you head to a bar or even how often you text your friends can all give clues to your mental and physical health. A new app hopes to harness this information to tell phone owners their mood - and even help them work with doctors to improve problem areas. Called Ginger.io, the app can track how often people messaged, how long they talk for, and how far they travel, as well as monitoring sleep and exercise. The first commercial products focus on depression, co-morbid depression, anxiety disorders, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. Called Ginger.io, the app can track how often people messaged, how long they talk for, and how far they travel, as well as monitoring sleep and exercise. It analyses messages and calls to work out how many people you have interacted with, and also asks users questions at key points through the day to work out how they feel. 'We use your smartphone to map out your day, look at how you move around and how many other people you talk to,' the firm says. 'When something seems off, we send an alert to you and those who care about your health.' The first commercial products focus on depression, co-morbid depression, anxiety disorders, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. The firm works with doctors to give patients the app, and has partnered with Kaiser Permenente, Novant Health, and over 20 hospital systems and academic centres across the country. In addition, they are actively pursuing research partnerships, with universities to develop the app for long terms trials, including heart disease work with UCSF. 'Like providers, academic medicine is looking for better ways to understand how patient behaviors affect health outcomes,' said Dr. Anmol Madan, co-founder and CEO of Ginger.io. 'Ginger.io's smartphone app and analytics engine is essentially a new class of microscope that helps quantify and understand real-world behavior at scale, in many different disease areas. 'For our academic partners, this offers new insight about clinical characterization, and it may lead to better diagnosis and new therapeutics and interventions for these conditions.' With those hospitals that already have patient outreach operations, Ginger.io hopes to make these programs more efficient and proactive. The traditional method of outreach involves randomized check ins. Co-founder and CEO Anmol Madan said often only about 20% of patients who are experiencing symptoms get a call. 'We use your smartphone to map out your day, look at how you move around and how many other people you talk to,' the firm says. Dr. Ilan Elson, Head of Research and Development at Ginger.io said: 'Our partners are either deploying Ginger.io's existing core behavioral health (i.e., mental health) programs in new and exciting ways, or they are using the Ginger.io platform on new conditions like heart disease and chronic pain.' 'We're very excited about the approach Ginger.io is taking to engage patients suffering from depression,' said Dr. Patricia Arean, Professor of Psychiatry at UCSF. 'Patient feedback on the experience has been overwhelmingly positive thus far, and we're excited to learn more about what digital interventions can do for mental health.' Researchers at UCSF, are collaborating with Ginger.io to help patients suffering from heart disease, multiple sclerosis and post-operative recovery. As part of the Health eHeart Study, for example, Ginger.io is helping world-class cardiologists detect early-warning signals for the development and exacerbation of heart disease. 'Heart disease is the No. 1 killer in the United States and the developing world, and identifying heart disease risks and addressing them in advance is much needed,' said Dr. Jeffrey Olgin, chief of the UCSF Division of Cardiology and a principal investigator of the Health eHeart Study. 'Our ultimate goal through this study and others is to provide a thermometer or 'check engine' light for people to be empowered in managing their own health and risk.' Researchers at Duke University also see the potential of Ginger.io to help patients in postoperative recovery settings. Patients undergoing joint replacement surgery use the Ginger.io app to track their recovery, pain and return to functionality. Drs. Laura Tully, Cam Carter and Tara Niendam of UC Davis, for example, recently shared their findings from a partnership with Ginger.io in an early psychosis study. Results announced at this year's Society for Biological Psychiatry showed the identification of specific 'smartphone signatures' and patterns of behavior for symptoms of psychosis in adolescent populations. 'This isn't science fiction,' said Dr. Elson of Ginger.io. 'We're touching a huge number of patients in a wide array of clinical settings. Working alongside our partners, we're having a real impact on population health management and improving patients' lives—in some cases almost immediately.' ' This could be a turning point in the history of healthcare delivery, and that's very exciting for us at Ginger.io.'","App monitors text, calls and how much exercise owners get .

"Susan Patton, better known as the Princeton Mom, is coming out against a plan to teach children about rape and molestation in schools, claiming reports of sexual assault are exaggerated and most can be chalked up to 'bad manners'. Appearing on Fox & Friends with host Elisabeth Hasselbeck, Patton said that sexual education has no place in schools and should be taught at home. Then, when presented with a statistic from the Center of Disease Control that stated 42.2 percent of rape victims were younger than 18, she asked, 'Is that rape?' Scroll down for videos . Outraged: Susan Patton (left), known as Princeton Mom, said in an interview with Elisabeth Hasselbeck (right) that she believes many reported rapes are just the result of 'bad manners' She continued by saying; 'I think the numbers that have been thrown around as to the frequency with which rape and sexual assault occurs have come into question, and have been debunked in a of number platforms.' Patton then added; 'I think it’s a huge exaggeration, a reckless exaggeration of what actual rape statistics are or what actual sexual assault statistics are.' This all came in response to a measure in California that aims to begin teaching children about rape, molestation and acceptable sexual behavior beginning as early as Kindergarten. Patton however does not think that rape is the issue with these individuals, but rather bullying, and the idea of people not keeping their hands to themselves, which she believes is being reported as rape. 'And just like I don’t think sex ed belongs in school, we shouldn’t be teaching sex ed in school, that’s something parents should be teaching their children - manners, which is really what we’re talking about here,' she said. 'Keep your hands to yourself, don’t be bullying anybody, you don’t touch somebody, you don’t want them to touch you, you tell them not to. Again, this is manners, this isn’t sex ed. And even that should be taught at home.' This after just last month Patton said that most reports of rape on college campuses are just the result of 'clumsy hook-up melodrama.'","Susan Patton, better known as the Princeton Mom, has said that she believes many reports of rape are just a case of 'bad manners'

"The wife of a Mexican mayor whose police force turned 43 students over to a drug gang that allegedly killed them has been charged with organized crime and money laundering. Maria de los Angeles Pineda is the wife of Jose Luis Abarca, the former mayor of Iguala, a city in southern Guerrero state. Pineda's brothers were leading members of the Guerreros Unidos drug gang, according to prosecutors. Federal prosecutor Tomas Zeron said Monday that Pineda has been charged with organized crime related to drug trafficking, and use of illicit funds. Scroll down for video . In custody: Maria de los Angeles Pineda was  transferred to a Mexican state prison on Monday. She has been accused of turning a group of 43 students over to a gang to be mass murdered when the students threatened to interrupt a speech she was giving . Going behind bars: Pineda was the wife of the former mayor of the city of Iguala, and her brother was a member of the Guerrero Unidos drug gang . Out of comfort: Pineda has been under house arrest since her arrest on November 4 in Mexico City. Pictures above on Monday, as she was being transferred to the federal prison . Abarca and Pineda were arrested November 4 in Mexico City.  Abarca was charged with organized crime, kidnapping and homicide in November, for events previous to the students' disappearance. Pineda had been held under a form of house arrest, but has now been transferred to a federal prison. It is unclear if the charges against her were related to the students' disappearance. Video footage showed a grim-faced, stolid Pineda being escorted aboard a truck and then a plane as she was transferred to prison. Abarca's police force allegedly worked hand-in-glove with the Guerreros Unidos gang. When students from a rural teacher's college went to Iguala to hijack buses on September 26, Iguala police detained them and turned them over to the gang, which then allegedly killed them and burned their bodies.

"Rapist: Frank Van Den Bleeken is to be put to death after a court granted him the right to euthanasia . A rapist and murderer has had his permission to commit assisted suicide overturned by the Belgian government . Justice Minister Koen Geens said Frank Van Den Bleeken, who  has been locked up for almost three decades, would be given a chance for a 'qualitatively decent life.' The prisoner had argued that he had no prospect of release because he cannot overcome his violent sexual impulses and wants to end years of mental anguish. Van Den Bleeken, 51, was set to commit medically assisted suicide at a prison in Bruges this week. A spokesman for Belgian justice minister Koen Geens earlier told the newspaper De Morgen: 'Euthanasia will indeed be implemented. The time has come.' Now that decision has been reversed, Van Den Bleeken will instead be taken to a special facility for observation. The ruling by the justice ministry allowing the death was the first involving a prisoner since the country's euthanasia law was introduced 13 years ago. Van Den Bleeken, who has been in prison for nearly 30 years, said he preferred to die because there was no therapy for his condition in Belgium. The country is not the only one in Europe to provide a right to die but it has pioneered the use of the law beyond the terminally ill. Among cases that hit the headlines were those of deaf twins who were losing their sight, and a transgender patient left in torment by an unsuccessful sex-change. Jail: Van Den Bleeken, 51, will commit medically assisted suicide at a prison in Bruges (above) this week . It is also the first country to allow euthanasia for terminally ill children at any age. Belgium legalised euthanasia in 2002, the second country in the world to do so after the Netherlands, and logged a record 1,807 cases of euthanasia in 2013. Its strict conditions for a mercy killing include that patients must be capable, conscious and have presented a 'voluntary, considered and repeated' request to die.","Frank Van Den Bleeken had wanted to end years of mental anguish .

"For most people a chance to taste the food in a city they're visiting is one of the most important parts of the experience. However it seems that many of the best spots are hidden, even from the locals. After returning from the US, Melbourne-based woman Jonette George was astounded that although there were cookbooks galore on Australian shelves no one was unearthing the already established restaurants and eateries. 'My girls had gone to school in America … and we came back to Australia and said ""God, why isn't anyone showcasing our region's culinary destinations?"",' Ms George told Daily Mail Australia. 'So we thought we would enter into the sphere. Scroll down for video . Two new books showcasing the best culinary destinations in Sydney have been released, with Bloodwood in the inner-city suburb of Newtown making the cut . The Apollo Restaurant in Potts Point, famed for its Greek cuisine features in one of the editions, Flavours of Sydney . 'I think there are lots of cookery books but there aren't as many culinary destinations,' Ms George said before adding: 'People want to know the best place to go and not waste a night on an average restaurant.' What began as a small book focusing on Noosa on Queensland's Sunshine Coast quickly turned into an internationally acclaimed series of 'pictorial registries' of various city's hot-spots. The latest editions - Flavours of Sydney and Flavours of Urban Sydney - focus on the NSW capital, while those before them have looked at the best restaurants, bars and cafes in Melbourne. 'They used to say Melbourne was ahead of Sydney in terms of food, but it’s not', said Ms George. Flavours of Sydney features establishments such as The Apollo Restaurant in Potts Point, which prides itself on its Greek cuisine, and Spanish tapas hub El Bulli in Surry Hills. The recipe for this Pig’s Tail Salad, with walnuts, sorrel, currants, pomegranate and farro by Apollo's executive chef Jonathan Barthelmess can be found in the book for readers to recreate at home . The Arglye bar in The Rocks in Sydney's CBD is also showcased in the 'pictorial registry' Created by Apollo's executive chef Jonathan Barthelmess . Serves 6, as a side dish . Ingredients . 1 bunch sorrel leaves . 1kg pig tails . 50ml red wine vinegar . 2 tablespoons pomegranate seeds . 1 bunch mustard leaves . 2 tablespoons walnuts . 200g faro . 100ml extra virgin olive oil . 100ml pork jus . Method . Clean the pig tails, and then cryvac them and cook for 12-15 hours on 84°C until tender. Then once cooked debone and clean in colander keeping all juices and bones for the pork jus. Place the pig tails on a tray lined with baking paper. Place another tray on top and press in the fridge until cooled. Place the pigs tails in a non-stick pan and cook over a low heat until crisp. Cook the farro in boiling salted water until tender for approximately 15 minutes. To Serve . Place prepared pigs tails, warm faro, sorrel leaves, red wine vinegar, currants, pomegranate seeds, mustard leaves, walnuts, extra virgin olive oil, pork jus. Season to taste. Stir and serve . Also making the list from Sydney is China Republic located at World Square among many other destinations of varying size, price and culture. Recipes for Pig's Tail Salad at Apollo, China Republic's Sweet and Sour Pork Spareribs and El Bulli's Spanish paelle are included for readers to recreate. Bars such as Bloodwood in Newtown, The Argyle and Ananas Bar & Brasserie both in The Rocks and Bentley in the Sydney CBD feature in the latest books too. All editions are brimming with stunning pictures, taken by head of photography Kaitlyn Wilton, Ms George's youngest daughter, along with Amanda Davenport and Alana Dimou. Kaitlyn's elder sister Daniele also plays a major role in the family business heading up design and administration. They also include recipes from a select number of locations which are tried and tested by members of the team ahead of their publication. 'Some are more complicated than others but it gives you a chance to emulate different restaurants,' said Ms George, Editor-In-Chief of the series. Ananas Bar and Brasserie is one of the must-see establishments for Sydney-siders and visitors alike . Flavours of Sydney and Flavours of Urban Sydney are the latest in a series of books, with editions on Queensland, South Australia and Tasmania in the works . Bentley Restaurant and Bar in Sydney's CBD was also given the thumbs up from the team . One of the latest books - Flavours of Sydney - focuses on inner-city spots, while Flavours of Urban Sydney takes in the city's outer suburbs and more multicultural cuisines. Criteria for selecting the establishments is simple: 'Our criteria is we would recommend it to our best friends', Ms George revealed. 'We put together a database of all the restaurants we can find in that destination then we start visiting them. 'It needs to have either unique food, service or a venue,' she added. The Flavours of Melbourne and Flavours of Urban Melbourne books have won a series of international awards including best culinary travel cookbook in Australia atThe Gourmand World Cookbook Awards, a bronze medal at the International Publishers Awards (IPPY), and another bronze at IPPY for best International Travel Guidebook. Next on the hit-list is the sunshine state of Queensland, and despite some initial apprehension the team have been pleasantly surprised by the talent the state has turned up. Chin Chin restaurant in Melbourne featured in the original Flavours of Melbourne installment . It is located in the city's famous Flinders Lane in the heart of Melbourne's CBD . Criteria for selecting establishments comes down to one thing: whether the team would recommend the place to their best friend . 'We were a bit wary of going to Queensland because it doesn't have an amazing rep for its food, but we’re discovering some amazing chefs,' Ms George revealed. After Queensland's culinary spots have been visited, the team hope to take on the rest of Australia. 'We’re tossing up at the moment whether we do South Australia or Tasmania next, but both should be out this year,' Ms George said. 'It’s like an adventure, where do we go next?' Flavours of Sydney and Flavours of Urban Sydney are now available from Smudge Publishing.","Jonette George's books unearth the best eateries in Australian cities .

"A former cop who posted a picture on Twitter of himself pointing a gun has denied the photo was a threat against anti-police violence protesters and claimed that the activists were 'blatant racists' for demonstrating in places they deemed 'white spaces'. John Cardillo, who served as an officer with the NYPD in the 1990s, is now a self-styled, right-wing media commentator and runs a data analytics company. On Sunday, demonstrators showed up at popular brunch spots in New York and California to protest the police killings of Michael Brown and Eric Garner. Carrying banners, the chanting activists entered a number of venues that they had identified as 'white spaces'. In response, Mr Cardillo took a selfie in his American flag baseball cap, with the camera looking down the barrel of a gun. He added the words: 'I'm really enjoying these Eggs Benedict so move along now. #BlackBrunchNYC' Scroll down for video . Inflammatory: Former cop John Cardillo posted this picture on Twitter in response to anti-police violence protesters storming restaurants in New York and California on Sunday, organized by #BlackBrunchNYC . The chanting #BlackBrunchNYC activists entered a number of venues that they identified as 'white spaces' on Sunday to protest police violence, including the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner . Mr Cardillo, 45, who now lives in Florida, told Daily Mail Online on Tuesday that it was 'ludicrous' to suggest he was threatening protesters with a picture of himself raising and pointing the gun. He said: 'My photo is protected by the First Amendment. I was sitting in my own home, with no one else there, pointing an unloaded firearm. 'I published the photo as an experiment to expose the left-wing protest community - those people who support violence, encourage and cheer the murder of police officers, along with rioting and looting.' 'Those same people who were offended by my photograph, weren't offended by people being hurt in the real world.' Mr Cardillo said that he was a fan of legitimate protests -  even if he didn't agree with the message. However he slammed the activists who descended on restaurants on Sunday. He said: 'I don't support what they were doing because they entered private businesses and harassed people. 'I found those protesters to be blatant racists because they targeted ''white faces.'' What is more racist than finding a place that certain races go to and targeting those places?' Mr Cardillo said on Tuesday that Sunday's protesters were blatant racists because they targeted 'white faces' 'A war on black lives': Alongside an image of protesters inside a New York restaurant, Sharmin Ultra (above) tweeted: 'We interrupt your brunch time to let you know there is a war on Black lives. We will not stay silent' Zane Jones offered a simple message to Mr Cardillo on Twitter following his gun selfie picture . Mr Cardillo added: 'You could argue because of the level of criminal harassment that their actions were hate crimes.' The former police officer went on to say that he did not believe that his Twitpic was inflammatory but was 'controversial', adding that it had brought him widespread media coverage. He said that he felt the image had nothing to do with his former job as a member of the NYPD. He added: 'It's my First Amendment right and was absolutely the right thing to do. I posted the picture to spark debate. It's controversial but harmless.' However some fellow Twitter users appeared to disagree with the former cop's defiant stance. ‏@TillmanRaymond tweeted: 'should protesters take this as a threat for there lives? B/c it would taken as one for cops if they did this.' While ‏@zanejones426 wrote: 'some people just don't get it there enough pain in the usa right now think I pray u and other just grow up.' A Twitter user called Ted wasn't pleased with the disruption and tweeted: 'How dare folks go out for an omelette with friends and family on a Sunday! #BlackBrunchNYC #BlackBrunch' Dozens of demonstrators stormed restaurants and targeted white diners in New York and California as part of a 'Black Brunch' protest against alleged police violence at the weekend. Once inside, they 'disrupted' customers' meals by reading out the names of African-Americans killed by police, including Michael Brown, 17, who was shot dead by officer Darren Wilson last August. Addressing staff and patrons, they shouted: 'Every 28 hours, a black person in America is killed by the police. These are our brothers and sisters. Today and every day, we honor their lives.' Throughout the day, many of the three dozen protesters - who also targeted 'predominantly white' restaurants in Oakland, California - posted photos of the 'Black Brunch' demonstration online. Alongside an image of protesters inside a New York restaurant, Sharmin Ultra, tweeted: 'We interrupt your brunch time to let you know there is a war on Black lives. We will not stay silent.' Although the demonstration were largely peaceful - with no arrests made - there were reports of protesters getting into heated discussions with staff and customers. And while many have applauded the nonviolent tactic online, other social media users mocked it and some have even criticized the protests as 'pathetic' and 'ridiculous'.

"A man has been charged with murder following a brawl outside a wedding reception where a father-of-two died and two others were injured. Richard Stroud, 46, who it is believed was attending a relative's wedding, died in hospital in the early hours of Sunday following the social club fight. Fellow guest Matthew Boyd, 32, was charged with murder, grievous bodily harm and actual bodily harm after the attack on three men. Forensic investigators were today still inspecting a cordoned off area outside the Guildford City Social Club in  Surrey. Arrest: Matthew Boyd, 32, was charged with murder, grievous bodily harm and actual bodily harm after Richard Stroud, 46, died in a brawl outside this Guildford wedding venue . Tributes: Family have left flowers at the scene saying that Mr Stroud was 'taken from this world too soon' Mr Stroud's mother Francine told the Evening Standard today: 'We are heartbroken. We don't want to say any more at the moment but I hope they get to the truth. He was a beautiful man'. Relatives have left flowers paying their respects at the scene of the death. One, signed 'your little sister Boo', read: 'You were taken from this world too soon. God help heaven with you and Dabbers reunited.' Another, written to 'Uncle Richard', read: 'Rest in peace. You will always be in our hearts.' A bar worker at the club, which remains closed following the fight, said they are 'still trying to get their heads together'. She said: 'He was at the wedding party that was here. My head's all over the place. It's horrendous.' Police were called to the scene at around 10pm on Saturday and Richard was taken to St George's Hospital, in Tooting, south London, where he later died. Investigation: Police are still at the scene as they try to piece together what happened on Saturday night . Detective Chief Inspector Paul Rymarz, from the Surrey and Sussex Major Crime Team, urged witnesses to come forward. He said: 'This is a tragic incident in which a man has sadly lost his life, our thoughts are with the family and friends of Mr Stroud at this extremely difficult time.' Boyd was remanded in custody after he appeared at Guildford Crown Court yesterday morning.

"Snowflakes  are understood to be unique - at a molecular level at least. But scientists have revealed that each and every one of them can in fact be sorted into 35 general shapes, which in turn tell experts  how they formed. The shapes, which include column crystals, irregular snow particles and plane crystals - which make ‘traditional’ hexagonal snowflakes - vary according to temperature and humidity. Snowflakes can occur in a huge variety of shapes. This infographic shows the basic levels of classification for the 35 shapes, which are then subdivided into 121 categories, decided by researchers at the Kitami Institute of Technology in Hokkaido, Japan . Bournemouth-based chemistry teacher Andy Brunning, created an infographic based on recent research to show the different shapes, which he published on his blog, Compound Interest. It shows 39 types of ‘solid precipitation’ or snow, including the 35 types of snowflakes and their names, which can be further divided into 121 subtypes. Simpler snowflake shapes such as germ of ice crystals, are more common at low humidities, while more complex flakes, such as plane crystals are formed in areas of high humidity. Simpler snowflake shapes such as germ of ice crystals, are more common at low humidities, while more complex flakes, such as plane crystals (a stock image is pictured) are formed in areas of high humidity . ‘We still don’t know the precise variables behind the formation of particular shapes, although researchers are continually working on theoretical equations to predict snowflake shapes,’ Mr Brunning wrote. The latest study by researchers at the Kitami Institute of Technology in Hokkaido, Japan, splits the classification into three levels: general, intermediate and elementary, with the graphic showing the 39 intermediate categories. These are sorted into eight groups: Column crystals, plane crystals – which are what many people imagine snowflakes look like – a combination of column and plane crystals, aggregation of snow crystals, rimed snow crystals, germ of ice crystals and irregular particles, one of which looks a little bit like a fern. The number of elementary categories used to explain snow crystals has increased from 21 in the early 1930s, to 42 in the 1950s, 80 in the 1960s and now stands at 121, as of 2013. Snowflakes are of interest to scientists who not only want to understand their formation, but also wish to find out how crystals could be used in different applications, such as in silicon and semiconductors. The study of snowflakes falls within crystallography – the exploration of crystal structures – which allows chemists to determine the arrangement of atoms in solids. ‘Crystallography works by passing X-rays through the sample, which are then diffracted as they pass through by the atoms contained therein,’ Mr Brunning explained. ‘Analysis of the diffraction pattern allows the structure of the solid to be discerned.’ The technique was used by Rosalind Franklin to photograph the double helix arrangement of DNA prior to Watson and Crick’s confirmation of its structure. Last year, a man has created a beautiful video showing how snowflakes flakes grow to form their shapes under a microscope. Russian video maker Vyacheslav Ivanov filmed the formation of hexagonal ice crystals to produce a two minute ‘microscopic time-lapse'. The flakes are created when a water droplet freezes around pollen or a speck of dust in the air, creating an ice crystal. Russian video maker Vyacheslav Ivanov filmed the formation of hexagonal ice crystals to produce a two minute ‘microscopic time-lapse'. This is a still from the video, which shows a water droplet freezing around a speck of dust to create an ice crystal . Then more water molecules land on the crystal, creating the hexagonal shape as they extend six ways along the ‘arms’. These ice crystals that make up snowflakes are symmetrical because they reflect the internal order of the crystal’s water molecules as they arrange themselves in predetermined spaces to form a six-sided snowflake, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) explained. The reason that some flakes have six lines of symmetry is because of the hydrogen bonds in water crystals. As the water freezes, bound-together water molecules crystallise into a hexagonal structure so that each point on a hexagon is an oxygen atom with hydrogen bonded to an oxygen atom on each side, iO9 reported. As the freezing process continues, more water molecules are added to the microscopic structure, causing it to bloom outwards along its six sides and transforms into what we recognise as a snowflake. The precise nature of the shape created depends upon the temperature and the humidity. Long, needle-like crystals form at slightly warmer temperatures like-5 degrees Celsius, whereas flakes that form in cooler temperatures such as -15 degrees Celsius are flatter and more circular in shape.","Bournemouth-based chemistry teacher Andy Brunning, created an infographic to show the different shapes .

"Vice President Joe Biden is famous for his off-beat humor, but when he swore in the new Congress on Tuesday his jokes took on a remarkably creepier tone. When introduced to Utah Senator Orrin Hatch's teenage granddaughter Emily, Biden commented: 'I hope you have a big fence around the house!' The comment was made as Biden posed with the 80-year-old Republican senator's large family, on the day he officially became president pro tempore of Congress. Biden thought the joke about the girl's good looks so funny, he whipped it out again when he met the daughter of freshman Senator Joni Ernst. Pictures from the event show Biden with his arm around the Republican's daughter Libby, as Senator Ernst placeh her hand on a Bible to be sworn in. He  probably won't be calling Senator Ernst up for favors anytime soon.

Excruciatingly awkward C-SPAN footage shows the moment he leaned in to kiss the red-headed daughter of Senator Christopher Coons of Delaware...and got rejected. Throughout the rest of the day, Biden continued to throw out flattery left and right. 'As they say in southern Delaware, ""Boy, you married up,""' he told the husband of Maine republican Susan Collins. Biden likely felt free to let out these more casual comments since he spent more than three decades in the Senate.

"New recruits to a vicious Mexican drug cartel were forced to eat the hearts of murder victims in a twisted scheme to prove their loyalty, officials said. Hopefuls who wanted to join La Familia Michoacana were reportedly fed the internal organs during gruesome initiation ceremonies designed to roof out infiltrators or other disloyal elements. Witnesses told government security bosses how La Familia, and offshoot an offshoot group called the Knights Templar, would also sometimes force potential cartel members to dismember victims while they were still alive. Accusations: A Mexican government official said the heart-eating ceremonies were being carried out by La Familia Michoacana gang. Pictured above are two suspected gang leaders at a 2010 news conference . Loyalty: The macabre displays are reportedly a way to make sure prospective cartel members are not simply trying to infiltrate the organization . Alfredo Castillo, the federal security commissioner for gang-ravaged Mexican state Michoacan, told local television: 'The ritual ranged from dismembering people they intended to kill to sometimes serving up the heart.' He said that the practice was not widespread, but was emphatic that it had taken place, seemingly on several occasions. He did not elaborate on who provided the testimony and did not specify when and where the alleged initiation rituals took place. Castillo could not immediately be reached for comment. Both of the allegedly cannibal gangs were founded by Nazario Moreno, or 'The Craziest One,' a cultish crime boss who was finally killed in March 2014.

"Petco said Monday it has removed all remaining Chinese-made dog and cat treats from its website and stores over fears they were linked to 1,000 dog deaths and made thousands more sick since 2007. The San Diego-based company made the move  after the FDA revealed in May it had had more than 1,000 reports of pets dying, and more than 4,800 of illnesses, after dogs ate the treats in the US. The illnesses and deaths were linked to a number of treats, including chicken, duck or sweet potato jerky. A dog and her owner at a Petco store in Chicago. The company will no longer be selling  jerky made in China . At the time, the store vowed to pull the products from its shelves - a promise it has now made good on, despite the fact the FDA has yet to find a definite link between Chinese jerky and rawhide treats and the complaints. The agency is still investigating. Rival chain PetSmart also vowed to ban the snacks, but it has yet to ban the treats from its stores. However, the Phoenix-based company said it plans to have them out of its 1,300 stores by March. Petco made the decision after the FDA revealed it had received 4,800 reports of pets getting ill after eating Chinese-made treats - as well as 1,000 reports of deaths . Back in May, Petco CEO Jim Myers said his company's decision was made 'in the best interest of the pets'. 'We know some pet parents are wary of dog and cat treats made in China, especially Chicken Jerky products, and we’ve heard their concern,"" he said in a statement. 'As a leader in the industry and the trusted partner for our pet parents, we’re eager to make this transition and to expand our assortment of safe and healthy treats, the majority of which are made right here in the U.S. 'Very simply, we feel this decision is in the best interest of the pets we all love and, ultimately, for our business.'

"The collapse of Easter Island's civilisation is often used as a cautionary tale to show the folly of humans who over-exploit their surroundings. But a group of leading U.S scientists now believe the tale - which documents how the population collapsed due to deforestation - is completely false and 'misleading'. Legend says the island's landscape was washed away by the destruction of the palm forests, which ruined the fertile soil and forced the population to descend into  cannibalism. A group of leading U.S scientists says that the tale about Easter Island's demise due to deforestation and cannibalism is completely false and 'misleading' But research published yesterday says the population was actually decimated by the arrival of Europeans - who brought syphilis, smallpox and slavery onto the land. The scientists believe that many inhabitants survived perfectly well after the final tree was cut down, which goes against the wide belief that the island's inhabitants caused their own downfall. The academics reached their conclusion by looking at tools used by the islanders for farming, which were scattered around the land. They found that, instead of there being a sudden collapse in farming, there was a much more gradual decline in some areas. The findings by the Virginia Commonwealth University have now been published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The study will come as welcome news to the Rapa Nui - the indigenous name for the islanders - who have never been keen on the narrative about how their own stupidity ruined Easter Island. Easter Island is one of the most remote inhabited island in the world, more than 2,180 miles away from the coast of Chile and 1,289 miles from the nearest inhabited island . Speaking about the concept of 'collapse', Professor Sue Hamilton - who was not directly involved in the study - told The Times: 'It is a terrible presumption to say there was a food shortage.'She added: 'Starvation is not an automatic result of tree removal and neither is warfare.' Easter Island is one of the most remote inhabited island in the world, more than 2,180 miles away from the coast of Chile and 1,289 miles from the nearest inhabited island. Yet the main belief is that it is thought that shortly before 1200 AD, Polynesians sailed to the island and began to settle there. The population on the island grew quickly as settlements were formed, thriving for hundreds of years. Some scientists estimate that at its height, Easter Island's population may have been as much as 20,000 people. Some experts believe the fertile land allowed the population time to develop a rich culture and gave them time to carve the distinctive moai stone heads that the island is now famous for. Around 1200 AD, the inhabitants apparently began cutting down the island's subtropical trees and giant palms in large numbers to build canoes and to transport the giant stone statues. However, the destruction of the palm forests that covered the island led to much of the fertile soil washing away, damaging the natural wildlife. That's when people began to starve. In a last ditch effort at survival, they became cannibals. Legend says that the collapse of the island's ecology and civilization was so complete that by the time the Dutch arrived in the 1700s, Easter Island was a sandy grassland void of nearly all its native wildlife. Its human inhabitants were reduced to a starving population of 3,000 or less, scientists say.","Legend says island washed away due to deforestation and cannibalism .

"A new documentary has shed light on the cloistered world of London's Russian super-elite. With more than 100,000 expats living in the capital, Russian-born millionaires have fuelled constant headlines in recent years as they buy up properties in some of London's wealthiest areas. But despite renewed attention amid their home country's economic woes, there is still little that is known about the everyday lives of those who have become some of Britain's richest residents. Scroll down for video . Glamorous: A new documentary has shed light on the cloistered world of London's Russian super-elite, including supermodel Katia Elizarova (pictured) who says: 'I'm devoted. I'm in love with London forever' Glamorous: The programme's makers attended the annual Russian ball, where tickets cost from £390 to £790 . The one-off BBC documentary last night, Rich, Russian and Living in London, followed some of Moscow's most prominent expats, from an art collector to a political dissident. Supermodel Katia Elizarova told the programme: 'I'm devoted. I'm in love with London forever. Maybe there is some English person living inside me but I'm still quite Russian too.' The show's creators aimed to debunk many of the myths about Russia's diaspora - though they also fuelled new ones. There was the firm of estate agents which has drawn up a map for buyers with famous hotels,  buildings from the elite flats One Hyde Park to Kensington Palace, and even the Russian embassy. They said every Russian who spends £10million on a flat spends £4.5million in the British economy, and the centre of the house-hunting is Mayfair - the traditional home of London's super-rich. Traditional: Russian society still has its debutantes, including Katerina Daminova, pictured at the ball . Ease: Roman Grigoriev (right) and estate agent Dmitriy Zakirov (left), who is used to selling £10m homes . And there was testimony - set between glamorous images of London's annual Russian ball, where tickets cost between £390 and £790 - from millionaire art collector Igor Tsunkanov, interviewed in his all-white apartment. 'Those guys who are worth let's say £100million, they say ""we are not wealthy because there are guys who are worth a billion"",' he said. 'But those guys worth a billion say ""we're not wealthy, there are guys worth tens of billions"". It's all about perception.' The show interviewed luxury wine shop owner Evgeny Chichvarkin, who spent four years as a teenager on street markets before the Soviet Union collapsed. He was 17 at the time, and started selling mobile phones when the country opened up to western business ideas. 'I just wanted money,' he said - adding he didn't even realise when he had become a millionaire. 'Our accounting manager said when we reached 2million,' he said. 'It was 24/7 non-stop, buying and selling'. Envy: Millionaire art collector Igor Tsunkanov (pictured) said billionaire businessman do not feel rich . Luxury: Tsunkanov spoke from his all-white apartment in London, where sales to Russians have soared . He moved to London's exclusive area of Mayfair and opened his store, which now caters to the wealthiest members of the elite. He is thought to be worth hundreds of millions. The programme tried to answer why many remain staunchly patriotic while obsessing about English 'high society' icons such as private schools, polo and the monarchy. There was an entrepreneur chased out of Russia for his liberal views and growing bank balance on one hand, and two debutantes preparing for the glitz and glamour of the Russian ball on the other. The film met Princess Olga Romanov, the granddaughter of Tsar Nicholas II's sister, and questioned what the Russians think of the locals in their new-found home. Wealthy Russians have flooded into London since the fall of the Soviet Union, and particularly in the last few years as it has become a fashionable destination. Last month MailOnline revealed how hundreds of Russian oligarchs were preparing to buy swathes of ultra-expensive property in London to protect their wealth against the country's crumbling economy. Rags to riches: Evgeny Chichvarkin, who now owns a luxury wine merchant, was 17 when the Soviet Union collapsed. The entrepreneur spent four years as a teenager on open markets in temperatures of minus 20C . A former mobile phone tycoon, Mr Chichvarkin's wealth is  thought to run into hundreds of millions of pounds . Luxury agents Beauchamp Estates said six buyers requested £100million homes each in upmarket Mayfair, Belgravia and Kensington in just a few days to get their money out of Moscow. It came after the rouble went into free-fall yesterday as its value dropped by up to 20 per cent against the dollar, an all-time low. It has since risen, but remains unstable. Gary Hersham, the firm's managing director, said: 'Wealthy Russians are desperate to get their money out of Moscow at present. 'We have seen a 10 per cent upturn in Russian clients since the decline in value and the international sanctions biting into the Russian economy. 'I currently have half a dozen Russian clients urgently looking to spend over £20million each on buying a new home in prime Central London. 'For them the address must be Belgravia, Knightsbridge, Mayfair and Regents Park. It's got to be a prestigious postcode and ideally a park-side or leafy address.' Rich, Russian and Living in London aired last night and is available on BBC iPlayer.","Documentary examined lives of some of 100,000 Russians in capital .

"Old Navy is at the center of yet another controversy regarding its treatment of plus size customers. Just six weeks after the retailer was forced to defend its decision to charge its female shoppers more money for larger sizes, a plus size customer on Reddit has slammed the store for making its online plus size menu option twice the size of every other menu. 'Thanks for reminding me that I take up enough space for two categories, Old Navy,' user iChasedragons commented alongside an image of the offending menu, which seems to only appear on the brand's Canadian website. 'Thanks Old Navy': Reddit user iChasedragons said that the menu layout on the brand's Canadian website was a cruel reminder that she 'takes up enough space for two categories' The menu shows the different clothing categories offered in the online store, each of which feature an image of a model showcasing one of the store's chosen fashion looks. However under the 'Women' and 'Men' options, which sit aside one another, the 'Women's Plus' link sits astride two columns, a layout which - once pointed out - has caused outrage with a number of other Reddit users. Many users have gone on to question why the Women's Plus category requires its own menu option in the first place, when the men's plus size selection - Big and Tall - is just included in the main menswear category. 'The weird part is, Old Navy DOES have a Big and Tall selection in their men's clothing, but you don't really see it until you click on the item you want to buy,' user lilfunky1 pointed out. 'But the women's stuff is separated out as a whole new category of Women's Plus.' According to one beady-eyed user, the reason for the bizarre menu layout is that the Canadian version of the website doesn't appear to offer a maternity section for women - the category which sits alongside Women's Plus on the main US site. '[The Canandian site] don't have a Maternity category for some reason,' arnaudh explained. The smaller the size, the smaller the price: Old Navy's popular Rockstar Super Skinny Jeans are $34.94 if bought in sizes 0 to 20 . Unfair increase: Any women who buy a pair of the Rockstar Super Skinny Jeans in a plus size fit will be charged an additional $10, bringing the total price up to $44.94 . 'If you go to the US version, it doesn't display that way because of the additional category. starmartyr added: 'Why wouldn't they have a Maternity section in Canada? Does Old Navy believe that Canadians are hatched from eggs?' In November, New York-based merchandiser Renee Posey called for Old Navy to scrap its 'discriminatory' plus size up-charges, saying that the discrepancy between the prices for larger men and women is nothing other than 'straight up fat shaming'. And while the store insisted that 'unique fabrics and design elements' were to blame for its female customers being charged more money for larger sizes - while the menswear designs remain the same price regardless of size - Ms Posey insisted that the explanation wasn't good enough. 'Plus size women like myself are kind of fed up with being treated like second-class citizens by retailers,' the 34-year-old told Today.com. 'I think it's reached critical mass and people are ready for a change.' After Ms Posey started a petition on Change.org, calling for the brand to change their gender-biased price policies, a spokeswoman for Gap Inc, Old Navy's parent company, released a statement blaming the increased costs for plus-size womenswear on the fact that the larger designs require additional details not found in the smaller sizes . Fed up: Renee Posey (pictured) started a campaign in November to try and force Old Navy to scrap its 'discriminatory' prices . Fighting for change: Ms Posey's petition was signed by more than 33,000 people in a matter of days . 'For women, styles are not just larger sizes of other women’s items, they are created by a team of designers who are experts in creating the most flattering and on-trend plus styles, which includes curve-enhancing and curve-flattering elements such as four-way stretch materials and contoured waistbands, which most men's garments do not include,' spokeswoman Debbie Felix explained. 'This higher price point reflects the selection of unique fabrics and design elements.' But Ms Posey insisted that the statement did not address why there is not a single increase for any of the larger menswear designs, particularly as they also require the use of additional materials. 'Every woman knows how hard it is to find a good pair of jeans: a pair that is the right fit at the right price,' she wrote on the petition. 'That’s why I was shocked when, during a recent visit to Old Navy’s website, I noticed that they were charging $12-$15 more for plus-sized women's jeans - but not up-charging jeans for “big” men. 'If they are charging plus-sized women more to cover the cost of the fabric being used, then why aren’t they doing the same for men?' According to the prices on the Old Navy website at the time of publication, the same differences in price between the plus size styles and the regular styles are still in effect.","A Reddit user posted a screen grab from the store's Canadian site which shows the plus size menu option as being double the size of all the others .

"These are the incredible images of mushrooms that could be magic. However, this effect is anything but supernatural, and rather highlights one of the fascinating aspects of nature. Here some of the 65 species of bioluminescent mushrooms are seen lighting up at night - although they are luminous throughout the day as well. These are the incredible images that prove mushrooms really are magic. Taylor Lockwood, 68, has hunted through the rainforests of the world to capture the stunning pictures of the bioluminescent mushrooms as they emit a stunning green glow . Taylor Lockwood, 68,  hunted through the rainforests of the world to capture the stunning pictures of the bioluminescent mushrooms as they emit a stunning green glow. The effect is triggered by a chemical reaction between luciferin, a light-emitting pigment, and the enzyme luciferase. It can occur in fungi as well as in a range of animals including jellyfish, squid, scorpions and other insects. The photographer, from New Orleans, has travelled to countries around the world, including Brazil, China and Madagascar, to capture the brightly lit fungi on camera. He said: 'I moved to Northern California thirty years ago from New Orleans and I saw some beautiful mushrooms outside my cabin. 'I bought a camera that week to get some pictures and the rest as they say is history. 'I've done many shoots over the years - too many to recall.

"A pensioner has lost a bitter legal battle with a multi-millionaire Tory peer over a patch of land next to his recycling yard that he has used for more than 17 years. Tom McAllister, 68, said he decided to clear the disused plot, which was used as a dumping ground, after he was unable to find the legal owner in government records. But lawyers insisted the land in Rigside, Lanarkshire, belonged to the estate of David Douglas-Home, son of ex-Prime Minister Alec Douglas-Home, and took legal action against Mr McAllister. Tom McAllister, right, said he decided to clear the disused plot, which was used as a dumping ground, after he was unable to find the legal owner in government records. Lawyers said it belonged to Lord Home (left) Mr McAllister, who runs a pallet recycling firm, said he spent around £10,000 clearing the 0.3 acre site and had been using it to park his trailers and to hand out free firewood to the local community. Lawyers acting for Lord Home, former chairman of private bank Coutts & Co, said the land was part of the Douglas Estate, and an adjoining estate owned by the Carmichael family. Mr McAllister was ordered to vacate the site in Rigside, Lanarkshire, but appealed all the way to the Court of Session where judges have now found in Lord Home's favour. Today, Mr McAllister told of his disappointment at the outcome and said he was bracing himself to be thrown off the land. He said: 'I can't believe I was dragged to court over this in the first place but when the decision went against us we decided to take it all the way. 'This will mean that I will be thrown off the land and it will cost me a fortune. Mr McAllister, who runs a pallet recycling firm, pictured above, said he spent around £10,000 clearing the 0.3 acre site and had been using it to park his trailers and to hand out free firewood to the local community . In a written judgement, Lord Carloway found that the two estates had a valid title to the land near Mr McAllister's business (above) as he could not produce definitive evidence that it was owned by another party . 'I have been portrayed as a squatter but I have looked after the land for 17 years when nobody else was bothering with it. 'It's a piece of land which is of no use to the estate but they have been determined to remove me from it. I'm really disappointed, I think it's ridiculous.' He added: 'We have been here for 17 years and have spent a lot of time and money clearing the site which was previously a dumping ground. 'We checked with the Registers of Scotland and couldn't find a clean title for the land so we decided to clear it ourselves. 'We use the site to park trailers and to dispense fire wood for free to the local community, which is much appreciated in an area of high unemployment.' In a written judgement, Lord Carloway found that the two estates had a valid title to the land as Mr McAllister could not produce definitive evidence that it was owned by another party. Lord Home had earlier sparked fury by brokering a deal to let Scottish Coal mine his land in Lanarkshire for a fee. In 2012 environmental protesters invaded the ground of his mansion on the estate and dug up his lawn. Yesterday, no one from Douglas and Angus Estates, Lord Home's family business that manages the estate, was available for comment. The estate's factor Henry Birch has previously said that they believe they are the legal owners of the land along with the Carmichael estate and had offered in the past to lease it to Mr McAllister. Legacy: Lord Home is the son of former Tory Prime Minister Sir Alec Douglas-Home, pictured above . The Douglas family's connections can be traced back to 767 AD when Sholto Duglass 'turned' a battle in favour of King Solvathuis. But it is William Douglas, born in 1174, who is widely acknowledged as the founder of the Black Douglas family and the Douglas Estates. The Earls of Home can boast similar lineage to the Douglases. The family are associated with the Hirsel Estate, which was purchased from Sir William Ker in 1611 by the first Earl of Home. The two families and the two estates came together in 1832 when Lady Lucy Montagu Douglas married Cospatrick Alexander Home – the 11th Earl of Home. The union resulted in the joining of the Estates – geographically separate, but run as a single integrated trading business. The set-up is one that remains today. The estates are focused on the Hirsel at Coldstream and Douglas in South Lanarkshire, extending to about 36,000 acres. The Douglas Estate in South Lanarkshire has been the seat of the Douglas family for some 800 years. But the fortunes of the estate ebbed and flowed with each generation. Douglas Castle, which once stood on the estate, was sieged, destroyed, burnt down before it was finally demolished in 1938 – leaving behind it only the remains of Castle Dangerous (built in 1457). In 1689 James, Earl of Angus, raised the Cameronian Regiment - later to be known as the Scottish Rifles - at Braidlea in Douglas. The Regiment served both their country for 300 years before being disbanded at Douglas in 1968.

"Authorities in Oklahoma released a mysterious ticket receipt signed with three initials as evidence in a 1981 murder  on Monday - as they continue to investigate the cold case of a college student who was discovered stabbed to death on her 21st birthday. Victim Tracey Neilson completed errands on January 5, 1981 before returning to her Jamestown Square Apartment in Moore, Oklahoma, ahead of 12pm, the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation (OSBI) said. Neilson did not pick up when loved ones made birthday phone calls - and the Oklahoma University student's body was later discovered with multiple stab wounds by her husband Jeff Neilson at 5pm, according to the agency. The couple had been married for five months. Scroll down for video . Victim: Tracey Neilson, pictured, was 21 years old and studying at the University of Oklahoma at the time of the slaying . Over 1,500 leads were pursued by authorities as part of the 34-year investigation into the young woman's murder, OSBI said. Though a single fingerprint was recovered by investigators, authorities have not yet found a match, the agency said. It noted that Jeff Neilson's family was part of a campaign to establish an Automated Fingerprint Identification System in Oklahoma. OSBI said that a cold case initiative was launched, and that it has already completed new DNA testing on some of the evidence. 'For decades, agents have worked to identify the owner of a cable trouble assignment ticket book,' the agency said in a Monday release. 'The last ticket in the book is for work at Tracey’s home at 11:51 the morning she was murdered. On the bottom left corner of the book is a box for the employee name. We want to identify the three letters written in that box.' Investigation: A newly-released cable ticket receipt from that day shows work was completed at Tracey Neilson's apartment on the day of the slaying . OSBI spokeswoman Jessica Brown told FoxNews.com that authorities never found a motive for the slaying and that Jeffrey Neilson was eliminated from being considered a suspect. He was in classes during the day, she said. Brown also told FoxNews.com that witnesses claimed to observe a white male close to the apartment front door when the murder was thought to have taken place. She told the website 'We believe someone came to [Neilson's] door. She let them in and that’s when the homicide occurred.' The victim's sister Cindy Young told News9.com 'We've had to live with the fact that we may never know who took her life that day and we have to wonder every day why did they do that, how could they do that?' 'I'm begging you; please come forward,' she also said. 'Please just do the right thing because it's time. It's time to do the right thing.'

"Drivers in some of Sydney's inner west and southern suburbs were ecstatic to find petrol prices drop as low as 99 cents on Tuesday, for the first time since 2009. Independent retailers in the suburbs of Tempe and Hurstville have continued to sell cheap E10 petrol on Wednesday, with low prices expected to continue across the country for the next couple of weeks due to heightened global supply. An employee from Metro Petroleum in Revesby told Daily Mail Australia that the station had queues of excited people taking advantage of the offer by filling their tanks straight to the top. Petrol prices fell to 99 cents in Sydney's inner west and southern suburbs suburbs of Tempe and Hurstville . 'They're all taking pictures and saying they haven't seen it for so long, like for 20 years or something,' the employee, Elie, said. Petrol prices have been slowly falling across Sydney over the last few weeks and are unlikely to stop soon, according to National Roads and Motorists' Association spokesperson, Peter Khoury. 'The average price for petrol is currently around $1.12 and we believe it will go below $1.09 and we think it'll happen in days,' Mr Khoury told Daily Mail Australia. 'We want to be really careful not to forecast too long term because the determining factors are complete beyond Australia's control and prices can change suddenly, but we don't expect prices to go up any time in the next few weeks.' National Roads and Motorists' Association spokesperson, Peter Khoury, said the average price for petrol was likely to drop below $1.09 in the next few days . An employee from Metro Petroleum in Revesby told Daily Mail Australia that the station, which was selling E10 petrol for 99 cents a litre on Tuesday and Wednesday, had queues of excited people filling their tanks to the top . 'They're all taking pictures and saying they haven't seen it for so long, like for 20 years or something,' the employee said . Mr Khoury said that global factors were driving prices down, adding that independent retailers had a hand in lowering costs due to creating competition in the market. 'Supply is out-shipping demand - we don't see that very often in the industry,' he said. 'There is significant production in the US at the moment and Saudi Arabia are competing by increasing their own production so there is more oil in the market and that's why it's so cheap.' 'Consistently, the cheapest places for petrol are the outer suburbs of major capital cities because there are more independent stations so there's more competition. Independents are the ones putting downwards pressure on prices. Global factors are driving prices down: 'There is significant production in the US at the moment and Saudi Arabia are competing by increasing their own production so there is more oil in the market and that's why it's so cheap,' Mr Khoury said . 'There also tends to be a lot more traffic going through them [outer suburbs] so there's more volume being sold and more competition than say on the coast of Sydney where you have more local traffic.' On the contrary, Mr Khoury said that the further out of capital cities that commuters travel, the less likely prices would fall, with some areas consistently paying about 20-30 cents per litre more than the average price in the city. Of national prices, he added that Adelaide often had cheaper prices than Sydney, reaching $1.13 recently, while Melbourne was often on par with Sydney's prices. 'Brisbane for some bizarre reason never fell and has quite high petrol prices in comparison to the others,' he said. 'How cheap the prices will get down there depends on what the local independents are doing.'","Petrol prices fell to 99 cents in the Sydney suburbs of Tempe and Hurstville on Tuesday and Wednesday .

"Derryn Hinch is back. 20 years after he last hosted his own program, the broadcaster dubbed 'The Human Headline' will front a current affairs show on Pay-TV channel Sky News. And it'll be the tried and tested no-holds-barred Hinch approach, which has served him well over the years .. and also landed him in hot water. 'It feels pretty good,I do enjoy the stuff I do at the moment but to have your own program again, it has been 20 years since the Hinch program,' he told Daily Mail Australia on Wednesday. Scroll down for video . 'They approached me'. Derryn Hinch will become a host of his own current affairs show again, Hinch Live on Sky news, some 20 years after his last program was shelved by Network Ten . Hinch's recent career has been dominated by radio  and appearances on the Sunrise program on Channel Seven, while also filling in on Sky News for other presenters . Hinch is the first to admit he's made plenty of his own headlines, aside from reporting on those in them. He has battled liver cancer, was given little hope by doctors but underwent a transplant three years ago. He reportedly found love again at age 70, with with former detective Natasha Chadwick, 36 years his junior. But it is his professional career which has been colourful and controversial, to the extreme. In 1987, he served a short time in jail for revealing details of an alleged paedophile priest's prior conviction during a trial. He was then placed under house arrest for five weeks in 2011 for breaching suppression orders on the names of sex offenders, as a consequence of his belief that the public have ‘a right to know’ who they are. And he was forced to spend his birthday last year behind bars in Victoria's Langi Kal Kal Prison. The shock jock jailed for 50 days for failing to pay a court fine of $100,000 imposed on him for breaching another suppression order, this time relating to Jill Meagher's killer. The veteran broadcaster has been jailed twice and placed under house arrest on another occasion for breaking contempt of court and breaking suppression orders . Derryn Hinch has always argued for the public's right to know. Here the broadcaster held a news conference outside the State Law building in Brisbane in July last year after meeting with Queensland's attorney-general to discuss his proposal to introduce a US-style sex offender register . But he hasn't changed and won't be changing, Hinch promised. 'It will be a fair bit of the old Hinch (style) and a touch of Larry King in there too with a lot more interviews and a bit of entertainment,' he said. 'Remember that I hosted the Midday Show, did a lot of showbiz and spoke with a lot of authors, getting a guest on the set on a Saturday night will be interesting. 'They (Sky News) approached me, I wasn’t out there shopping for a job. 'Two shows on a weekend will be a challenge, we all know that Saturday night is a wasteland on TV but that is the challenge for me. 'Saturday night, especially, will be hard core, plenty of people have said to me ""oh, it will be great I have nothing to watch on Saturday night"" so we’ll see what happens. 'It won't be as political as the other stuff on Sky News, which is so politically skewed with panellists, I am just putting it together, a work in progress and I have already been bumped from the planned opening program because of the Queensland election.' Anyone thinking he may be getting soft in his slightly advanced age, would be sadly mistaken. 'Just because it’s the weekend I'm not going to be suddenly become the homogenised version of Hinch,' he said. 'I got into trouble recently when I was filling in when I said that Tony Abbott walks as if as it he's got Haemorrhoids - I speak my mind and I am too old to change and not interested in changing. 'There won't be this makeover thing, it's just me. 'I've got a new venue, they (Sky News) are very committed, I'm in a brand new studio at Southbank. 'It's Melbourne based but not Melbourne-centric.' He says the hunger for news and current affairs is still there, 55 years after beginning as a cadet on the Taranaki Herald in New Zealand. The other challenge will be to get the big names to open up and find up and comers to interview. 'Two shows on a weekend will be a challenge, we all know that Saturday night is a wasteland on TV but that is the challenge for me,' Hinch admitted . 'When you’ve been around a long time, it's a big advantage, you have a sense of history,' he told DMA. 'The GST, for example, I remember raising it with Kerry Packer before (John) Howard brought it in and I told KP that I supported it and he said ""you're f***ing mad"" and went on to tell me why and he was righ about some other taxes and all the promises that weren’t kept. 'It's those sorts of anecdotes and experiences I can draw on. 'They (interesting characters) are still out there, I must say, and I do admit the better stoushes did come with the older pollies like Bob Hawke and Paul Keating. 'Hawke would revoke your insults sarcastically, delivering a Darren or a Darryl in his response,' he said, delivering an almost perfect Bob Hawke impersonation in making the point. 'But Keating, was so smart, he was actually charismatic. Women would flock to Paul Keating when he walked into a room, he wasn't all just Zegna suits.' Politics will not be the dominant subject, for fear of turning viewers off on the tricky Saturday night programming. 'I won't be heavily political and when we can, it will be about the week that was as well, it’s a work in progress.' Daily Mail Australia found him in quite jovial mood and when asked who he would like to line up as guests for the early shows, Hinch quipped: 'Obama on the first show and the Pope on the second.' He's back. Hinch says he's always ready to go toe-to-toe with the biggest names. 'They (interesting characters) are still out there. Bob Hawke would revoke your insults sarcastically, delivering a Darren or a Darryl in his response but Keating was so smart, he was actually charismatic.

"Imagine stepping into a room where, at the touch of a button, you could visit any city on Earth, have any experience you wanted and do anything you wanted to do. That’s what was envisaged in the various series of Star Trek in the form of a holodeck, and now scientists are one step closer to making the fictional technology a reality. Using an Oculus Rift headset and a room full of cameras, researchers have been able to partially simulate travelling to mysterious, virtual worlds. The technology has been developed by scientists at the Max Planck Institute for Science. In the demonstration (pictured) the participant, wearing a wireless Oculus Rift headset, 'sidles' her way through chairs on a virtual airplane and then sits down in a seat provided for her in the real world . A . terminally ill grandmother with cancer is using an Oculus Rift virtual . reality headset to experience life outside a virtual Italian villa, from . her armchair in Seattle. The . idea to use virtual reality to give Roberta Firstenberg an outdoor . experience without leaving her home came from her granddaughter, . Priscilla, who works as an artist designing video games. She emailed Oculus about her idea and they sent her a headset, for free, for Roberta to use. Before long, Roberta was walking through a virtual Tuscan villa, trying to catch butterflies and admiring the sunshine. 'Her favorite part was just being able to walk up and down the stairs again of the villa in the Tuscany demo,' said Priscilla. 'I guess we take a lot of things for granted.' The technology has been developed by scientists at the Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics in Germany. To replicate the experience of being in a Star Trek holodeck, the team use a wireless virtual reality Oculus Rift headset. This means their test subjects can walk around the room unhindered. In the video by Computerphile the researchers explain how they set up multiple infrared cameras around the room, which communicate with the wireless headset. The sides of the square room each measured 32 feet (10 metres), giving the subjects ample room to wander around. According to the scientists each of the test subjects can be tracked down to millimetre precision. 'I got to try out the holodeck and the experience was crazy, really realistic,' Sean Riley of Computerphile tells MailOnline. 'They're using it to simulate in-flight comfort for a project called VR-Hyperspace - the idea is that going into VR it might be a way to improve in-flight experience. 'They are looking at whether changing your avatar's size causes you to feel like you have more space.' 'Most of the research they're doing is to test what prevents nausea and so on - I have to say I felt a little nauseous after I got a bit cocky in there; generally though you feel like you are there.' In the Star Trek TV series and movies, people would often travel to far-flung locations, or places they enjoyed visiting, by entering the holodeck (pictured) and asking the computer to create a virtual world for them. They were then free to interact with the world as they saw fit . The Star-Trek inspired technology allows users to walk in a virtual room. The team used the homemade wireless headset with motion-sensing technology attached that was tracked by infrared cameras. This could track them to within a millimetre . To create the experience the researchers attached markers on top of the headset similar to those used for motion capture in movies. The team can then give the user a virtual world within which they can walk around. Unlike the actual holodeck in Star Trek, however, players cannot interact with their environment, leaving some of the subjects to reveal the experience feels slightly odd. In the video shown, one of the subjects dons the headset and makes her way up and down the aisles of an airplane. A seat is provided for her in the real world, which she can sidle towards and sit in. The technology is still very much in its infancy, so there is no news yet if there will be attempts to create public locations that people can use, but for those who want to see the holodeck become a reality this is certainly a step in the right direction.","Scientists at the Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics in Germany have created a 'holodeck'

Manning River Farm Sanctuary in Kimbriki NSW rescues farm animals from abuse and neglect and lets them live out their final days in peace. The footage shows Stephie feasting on the delicious snack, licking her lips right on top of the camera's lens . 'She is able to roam free about the property and often invites herself into our kitchen for some delicious snacks' the filmer - an owner of the farm - later wrote online. The Sanctuary took to their Facebook page to commend Stephie on her new status as the 'it' goat of Australia and to bring the goat back down to earth. 'Our beautiful Stephie is a world wide hit. One little video of her eating peanut butter has gone crazy viral. We do hope she doesn't get all diva-ish on us.'

"A mother-of-two who lost her memory after a brutal eight-hour attack at the hands of her boyfriend has brought him to justice - after she was hypnotised into remembering the assault. Zoe Dronfield, 38, from Coventry, West Midlands, was stabbed in the neck by her estranged boyfriend Jason Smith, 31, who then stamped on her head, leaving her with horrific injuries. She passed out and didn't remember the attack at all - until she was hypnotised into reliving the traumatic ordeal to give evidence. Scroll down for video . Zoe Dronfield, 38, from Coventry, West Midlands was stabbed in the neck by her on-off boyfriend Jason Smith, 31, who then stamped on her head, leaving her with horrific injuries . Smith was found guilty of GBH with intent last month at Warwick Crown Court and is now awaiting sentence. Ms Dronfield suffered a cracked cheekbone, a bleed on the brain from her head being stamped on and a stab wound on her neck, just 1cm from her jugular vein. She said: 'After the attack I was a shell of my former self and I've never been so low in my life. 'Many women take their own lives after such events but I had to find a way to fight through it and that's why I wanted to get hypnotherapy- to build me back up mentally and fill in the blanks. 'I couldn't remember anything but thanks to the hypnotherapy I have been able to put my life back together and come back fighting.' Ms Dronfield worked with cognitive behavioural hypnotherapist David Kilmurry a month after her ordeal, and through their sessions was able to piece together what happened on the night she was attacked - and bring Smith to justice. She said: 'I was able to give evidence in court against Jason all thanks to the hypnotherapy- I would not have been able to do that without David's help.

Both of her arms were cut in the attack. Smith was found guilty of GBH with intent last month at Warwick Crown Court and is now awaiting sentence . 'I want to show other women they can do the same, we do not have to let abusers win.' Ms Dronfield had been in a relationship with Smith for a year and he showered her with gifts and meals out at expensive restaurants. But when he became increasingly controlling she decided to have time out from the relationship. It was during this separation that the couple met on February 2 2014, before Smith brutally attacked her while she slept. She said: 'My bedroom was covered in blood and the bed was sodden. It was like a scene from a horror film. 'Jason had never previously showed any signs of being a violent man - quite the opposite - in fact he made me feel like the most precious person in the world. 'He would call me his soul mate and his princess and even said he was my protector. It is shocking I was with this man and not aware of this capability. ' She said the pair met through Facebook: 'He added me on Facebook and we had about 100 mutual friends so I assumed I knew him. 'We got chatting online and he came across as a very professional car salesman and a family man. 'He showered me with compliments and offered to take me out.

But when he became increasingly controlling she decided to have time out from the relationship. It was during this separation that the couple met on February 2 2014, before Smith brutally attacked her . 'We started dating and he would take me to posh restaurants and top hotels. 'He held doors open and called me his princess. I was very flattered of course. 'I didn't realise coming on so strongly so early was a red flag.' It was after her father became seriously ill that Jason's behaviour started to change. She said: 'My dad would help me a lot with my children and Jason stepped in to help out. He was amazing and would look after the children for me when I worked. 'But I realise now this was a way of him controlling my life. At that point he was my saviour - little did I know what destruction was around the corner. 'Jason changed and would stop me from seeing my friends and always just make plans for the two of us. She asked Smith to move out so he could sort himself out before agreeing to meet a week later to talk things through. She said: 'We spent the night talking and eventually Jason fell asleep on my sofa, and I went through to bed. 'The next thing I knew, I woke up covered in blood.' Ms Dronfield Zoe recovering in hospital. Ms Dronfield worked with cognitive behavioural hypnotherapist David Kilmurry a month after her ordeal . 'My first thought was I wasn't going to die because I needed to be there for my children. 'I grew up without a mother and I didn't want that for my children. 'The whole house was covered in blood. The bedroom was red and the bed was sodden. 'The bath was filled with water and he was cleaning knives in the bath. There was an 8-inch knife and a meat cleaver. She said: 'With David's help I have been able to put this whole terrible ordeal behind me. Seeing Jason found guilty has given me closure and allowed me to move on with my life. Mr Kilmurry, 39, a cognitive behavioral hypnotherapist, from Coventry, said: 'Zoe has made an amazing recovery from devastating physical and psychological injuries, to go to court and give evidence. Hypnotherapy has been approved for use by the British Medical Association since 1955 and is also recognised by the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE). The form of therapy enables you to enlist the help of your conscious and unconscious/subconscious mind to deal with a range of mental, emotional and physical conditions. For those who have experienced a traumatic experience practitioners will tend to use cognitive hypnotherapy or analytical hypnotherapy, which uses the unconscious mind. Ms Dronfield worked with cognitive behavioural hypnotherapist David Kilmurry a month after her ordeal, and through their sessions was able to piece together what happened on the night she was attacked - and bring Smith to justice. Their sessions involved regression and  Mr Kilmurry said her progress was 'amazing'. He said: 'Directly after the event Zoe had no recollection of what had happened to her. It wasn't until later on down the hypnotherapy line that the trust built up and she was confident enough to go to 'parts unknown' we embarked on some regression to the event and the detail she remembered was quite amazing even in and out of unconsciousness.' Through their sessions was able to piece together what happened on the night she was attacked - and bring Smith to justice . 'I have worked with Zoe and I am proud to have helped her to retrieve her memory and rebuild her confidence following the trauma. 'I feel that her development has been quite amazing. Her head injury was described as moderate to severe closed head. Of the people that survive this type of injury 75 per cent never return to work. Zoe has not only returned to work but has gone and got a better job and set up a charity and has been helping others less fortunate as herself.

"The blond-haired, blue-eyed killer called out to the campers and asked them to come closer. Unsuspecting and trusting, they came over but when they did he killed them in a random and unprovoked attack. According to one witness, he then shouted for them to come and said: 'It's safe to come out. You'll be saved.. I'm a cop!' The gunman, who has been identified as Anders Breivik, 32, killed at least 80 people at an island summer youth camp north west of Oslo on Utoeya island. Massacre: Rescue workers evacuate young people from the summer school meeting in Utoeya . His boots crunching along as he sought out his victims and wearing what appeared to be a police uniform, he shot at them twice to make sure they were dead. One witness Thorbjorn Vereide, 22, said Breivik first started shooting then persisted that it was safe for people to come out. He said: 'We were 30-40 people standing together when he started shooting. When he was done [with us] there were only five or six left of us.' Mr Vereide then escaped to a nearby cave where he hid with a number of other youths. 'People were seriously injured, lying all around us. We didn't dare to go out of the cave, fearing that the gunman would discover our whereabouts,' he said to Norwegian newspaper VG. ""I've never lost anyone close before. Considering that, it's pretty dramatic to start off by losing 85 great friends."" Mr Vereide described the assailant as very calm, as he made sure his victims were indeed dead by shooting them twice. ""He just didn't seem to care,"" he added. One of Breivik's victims, Adrian Pracon, who was shot in the shoulder as he lay face down, playing dead, said he heard the killer shouting about how everyone was going to die. The 21-year-old said: 'He yelled out that he was going to . kill us all and that we must all die. I started speculating and thinking . this can't be real because Norwegian people wouldn't attack Norway.' Gunman: Anders Breivik has been arrested by police after the shooting in Utoeya . Mr Pracon also described how he could . hear the blue-eyed gunman's boots as he walked along the rocks and felt . his breath moments before he shot him in the back. 'I was lying on a rock, face down and I could hear him coming. I could feel his breath. 'As he approached, he shot at me to see if I was dead and fortunately I didn't move so he thought I was dead. 'I was laying there for two hours, still healthy but very cold.' Before he was shot Mr Pracon said he . had tried to escape the island by swimming into the ocean but only . managed a short distance before deciding to turn back. 'I jumped into the water like the rest of the people but I did not have time to take my clothes off and it had started to rain. 'When I had swum about 100 metres I . felt I had to turn back because I started to get very cold and felt I . might meet a certain death.' Once he reached the shore he saw Breivik who pointed his gun at him. 'I screamed to him, please no please. I didn't know if he didn't want to just kill me because I was one . person or if he preferred to kill a group of people. Another teenager, aged 15, who took refuge in the village of Sundvollen after the massacre said she stood just feet away from the gunman when he opened fire on the camp. 'I saw many dead people,"" said 15-year old Elise. The teenager said she had just come out from an information meeting in a nearby building when she heard gunshots. Tragic: A survivor of the shootings is comforted by a paramedic after the attack at the summer camp . Rescuers take away and injured person brought ashore from the camp site . She saw a police officer and thought she was safe, but then he started shooting. 'He first shot people on the island. Afterwards he started shooting people in the water,"" she said. Elise said she hid behind the same rock that the killer was standing on. ""I could hear his breathing from the top of the rock,"" she said. In panic, the girl phoned her parents, whispering to them what was going on. 'They told me not to panic and that everything would be OK,"" she said.Her parents also told her to get rid of a brightly coloured jacket she was wearing to not draw attention to herself. Suspect: Breivik is being questioned by police over the shootings . She said it was impossible to say how many minutes passed while she was waiting for him to stop. Survivors described a scene of sheer terror at the camp, which is organised by the youth wing of Norway's ruling Labour party. Hundreds of young people were eagerly awaiting a speech the prime minister was to give there today. Police said the man arrested in the shooting is Norwegian and had set off a bomb that killed seven people outside the prime minister's headquarters in Oslo, about 20 miles from the camp. Several of the survivors seemed calm as anxious parents picked them up at a Sundvollen hotel, but the stories they told were of utter terror. Dana Berzingi said the fake police officer ordered people to come closer, then pulled weapons and ammunition from a bag and started shooting. Several victims ""had pretended as if they were dead to survive,"" the 21-year-old said. But after shooting the victims with one gun, the gunman shot them again in the head with a shotgun, he said. ""I lost several friends,"" said Mr Berzingi, whose trousers were stained with blood. He said he used the mobile phone of one of his fallen friends to call police. Emilie Bersaas told Sky News she ran inside a school building and hid under a bed when the shooting started. 'At one point the shooting was very, very close (to) the building, I think actually it actually hit the building one time, and the people in the next room screamed very loud,"" she said. Emergency: A helicopter hovers above the rescue area preparing to take victims of the attack to hospital . 'I laid under the bed for two hours and then the police smashed a window and came in. It seems kind of unreal, especially in Norway. This is not something that could happen here.' Another camper, Niclas Tokerud, stayed in touch with his sister through the attack through text messages. 'He sent me a text saying 'there's been gunshots. I am scared (expletive). But I am hiding and safe. I love you,'"" said Nadia Tokerud, a 25-year-old graphic designer in Hokksund, Norway. As he boarded a boat from the island after the danger had passed he sent one more text: ""I'm safe.'

"They were supposed to be ordinary people appearing on a Labour political broadcast, venting their fury at energy price hikes. But closer inspection reveals that, far from being average citizens, the participants actually included a millionaire restaurant owner and a Guardian journalist. The party broadcast last night featured interviews with people struggling to pay fuel bills. One of them was Beresford Casey, owner of a posh burger chain, who lives in the plush Primrose Hill area of north London – half a mile from Ed Miliband’s childhood home. Scroll down for video . Jack Monroe, blogger and campaigner, appeared in the Labour party broadcast . And another was Jack Monroe, a campaigner and journalist who has written for the Guardian and the Independent. Last night a Tory MP slammed Labour for using left-wing activists to masquerade as ‘ordinary people’ for political attack campaigns. Priti Patel said: ‘Labour’s party political broadcast would be a lot more effective if they used real people rather than their own coterie of left-wing campaigners and champagne socialists. Beresford Casey in his Shoreditch restuarant Hache . ‘Under this Government, unemployment . is down and the economy is growing – these are real measures to help . with the cost of living, but Labour have opposed them. ‘This is same old Labour – instead of standing up for hardworking people, they’d rather scaremonger.’ Ed Miliband announced at the Labour conference last month that if he wins the next election he will freeze energy bills until 2017. The Conservatives have derided this as a ‘con’. Mr Casey met Mr Miliband earlier this month, when the Labour leader visited the Camden branch of his restaurant. The pair discussed the party’s policy on energy costs and business rates, according to local newspaper the Ham & High. Miss Monroe is a food blogger and freelance journalist. She writes about her experience of living on benefits after giving up her job in 2011, saying the commuting and childcare costs were unsustainable on her £27,000 salary. In the broadcast, she says: ‘Hot water and a comfortable living environment are things that you should be providing for your child. ‘You know in your head it’s not normal to put your child in a fleecy babygro and a jumper to go to bed, or to go to bed at 6 or 7 o’clock in the evening because you’ve got nothing else to do, nothing to entertain yourself with and the flat is cold and dark. ‘They’re making huge profits for their shareholders but people are turning off their heating and unscrewing their light bulbs.’ Beresford Casey is co-founder of the Hache Burger Connoisseurs, a chain of hip restaurants in trendy parts of London with prices at the upper end – £10.95 for a ‘Hache scotch beef steak burger topped with the celebrated Reblochon cheese’. The restaurants also sell champagne for £54.95 a bottle. After leaving his job as an art director at an advertising agency, Beresford Casey opened one of London’s most popular gourmet burger restaurants. The 68-year-old, also known as Berry, is the co-founder of the Hache burger chain, which boasts four restaurants in some of the capital’s trendiest areas. The entrepreneur lives with his wife Susie at a £1.5million terraced home in Primrose Hill, north London, less than a mile from Ed Miliband’s family home. Their daughter Camilla is responsible for the chain’s PR and marketing, and Susie also helps to run the business. Mr Casey held a meeting with the Labour leader and other business-owners earlier this month after which Mr Miliband promised to ‘stand up’ for small businesses. Mr Miliband even pointed out Hache’s Camden branch during a walk around the area, stating that ‘energy costs and business rates are massive, massive issues’ for Mr Casey’s business. The burger boss has previously said that the restaurant’s ‘dining concept’ originates from his ‘love of France’. In an interview earlier this year, Mr Casey said that he had plans to expand the business, which he said had been  ‘privately financed’. He and his wife opened the  restaurant chain’s first branch in 2004. Its four restaurants are located in Chelsea, Camden, Shoreditch and Clapham. According to Companies House records, Mr Casey lives on Waterside Place in Primrose Hill, where the average property price is more than £1.5million. In the broadcast, he says: ‘You’ve got this industry which is very unprofessional … doing their very best to rip you off. ‘There are about six enormous companies and when ministers talk about competition it’s a bit of a joke really – because it looks very much like a monopoly.’ It also emerged that a mass email sent out by Labour from someone complaining about the impact of bills this week, was written by a council officer who has accused the Conservatives of being like the BNP. Russ Tennant tweeted in August: ‘Be better if the Conservatives stopped using the BNP’s divisive tactics and language.’ Last night a Labour source defended the inclusion of Miss Monroe, who blogs about cheap meals, saying: ‘Like millions of people around the country struggling to make ends meet, she is showing how to make a little go further during these tough times.’ She insisted she was an ‘ordinary person’ but was also ‘proud to call myself an activist’. Mr Casey said he had ‘no affiliation’ to Labour, adding: I am just an independent business guy.’ She is a young single mother and left-wing activist whose columns attacking government cuts – and blogs about meals that cost less than £1 – have been adopted by the Guardian newspaper. Jack Monroe created a media career for herself after she chose to leave her job in the Essex Fire Service in 2011 to look after her young son full-time. But two years on, she is the photogenic poster girl of austerity Britain with a successful writing career based on her budget recipes. The 25-year-old from Southend has rallied against government cuts in the form of a food blog that espouses the benefits of baked beans and chopped tomatoes. She documented how she fed herself and her three-year-old son Jonny on just £10 a week in her blog ‘A Girl Called Jack’. Miss Monroe, described in profiles in the left-wing press as ‘the face of modern poverty’, began writing when she was living on benefits because she felt single mothers were misrepresented.","Labour broadcast featured interviews with people struggling to pay fuel bills .

"Kim and North West, Beyonce and Blue Ivy, Kate and Prince George, we are often exposed to photos of idyllic parenthood. But one photographer was determined to uncover the real chaos that most families suffer at the hands of their young children. Danielle Guenther, from New York, wanted to showcase the sentiment that parenthood isn't a walk in the park with her photo series Best Case Scenario. Scroll down for video . Danielle Guenther has created a series of photographs that capture the true chaos of parenting - including struggles in supermarkets . The collection of images sees parents dealing with the most testing of situations, from dinners out with their kids to the simplest of tasks - such as crossing the road - ending in anarchy. Danielle, who has a five-year-old son, began creating her comedy photographs after attempts to take traditional family portraits would 'spiral out of control'. She said it was one particularly trying session that saw her move on to her humorous family portraits. The series aims to capture the true struggles parents face on the daily with the simplest tasks - such as crossing the road . Danielle began her series after several traditional family portrait sessions spiralled out of control. Left, a family meal in a restaurant with children eating spaghetti and a mum screaming. Right, a mum tries to shower as her little boy draws on the glass - while a baby looks on . This photo 'Parenting is exhausting' was the first taken in the series after clients at a photo shoot asked the photographer to 'take a funny one' She told Popsugar: 'I have a regular client that I photograph, and I was over at her house. It was at the end of the session, and the mom, [who] is always a total blast, just laid down on the couch, and I [said] we should do a funny one. 'She has a wonderful sense of humor, [and] she was all about it! And then it just spiralled out of control in a really great way.' The result was Danielle's first photograph of the series called 'Parenting is exhausting' which sees a couple flopped on the sofa while their kids wreak havoc. Although the images are hugely exaggerated Danielle hopes to capture the difficulties parents face - such as balancing everything at once . Danielle wanted to strip away the pristine facade that often comes with family portraits in her series . Many of Danielle's images focus mainly on the  mum's struggle with getting children ready . From this successful experience, the photographer was inspired to strip away the pristine facade from family portraits in order to reveal the pandemonium that often accompanies everyday life with small children. Although the images are humorously exaggerated, Danielle hopes to capture many of the feelings that parents may experience as they try to balance everything from work and chores to sleep and childcare. Danielle's unorthodox approach to family portraits has proven popular.  After seeing some of Guenther's creative shots other parents began reaching out to the photographer to request their own 'chaotic portraits'. The photographer is a mother herself so the series is particularly personal - including this shot of parents trying not to disturb their baby . Her photos have become so popular that Danielle now regularly photographs unpredictable family situations - in this one, a new father is pictured holding a sleeping baby as he reaches for his mobile phone . Danielle says that although parenting can be really ugly there are some really beautiful moments . Since then, Guenther has been kept busy photographing the unpredictable moments of many different families. Danielle said she believed it was the honesty of her photographs that makes them so enchanting. 'This is real, this is life, this is parenting. Parenting is so ugly, but there are moments that are so beautiful. Just when you think you have it under control and you're like, ""Oh, yeah, this is great. My kid's using his manners,"" they slam the door in your face and they scream at you! 'But nothing in life is perfect.'

"Caught in startling close-up detail, these stunning images give an unusual perspective on the animal world. Award winning Hungarian photographer Bence Mate's breathtaking images capture wildlife unbelievably up close and personal. His nickname - 'the invisible wildlife photographer' - offers an explanation as to just how he manages to capture such intimate snaps. Bence can spend days, weeks or even months quietly tucked away in a hide that he himself has carefully designed and built. These often utilise one-way glass, which is what enables him to get so close to his oblivious subjects. Bence comments: 'When walking in the wild with a pair of binoculars around our necks, we often witness breathtaking moments in nature. 'But at such moments, factors such as distance, light, background, environment and the miracle of surprise, seldom enable us to pass on our visual experience to others. 'In my work, I have strived to ""forecast"" when such moments will occur and capture them in photographs.' He adds: 'Planning and lots of patience are usually behind a well executed natural history photograph. Along with a dose of good luck!' 'Indeed, I have crouched for hours, days, weeks, sometimes even months waiting for fortune to shine.'

"She is the sex shop queen most well-known for bringing the Rampant Rabbit to Britain. So it is perhaps surprising that Jacqueline Gold has been unveiled as the Tories’ latest campaign weapon. The Ann Summers boss was paraded by the party as its newest supporter, sitting in the front row as George Osborne and his colleagues attacked Labour over spending. Ann Summers boss Jacqueline Gold was unveiled as the Tories’ latest campaign weapon . At the event, Chancellor George Osborne, flanked by four senior Cabinet colleagues, unveiled Treasury figures suggesting that Labour has already made almost £21billion of unfunded spending pledges. Conservative strategists are planning to echo the party’s ‘tax bombshell’ warning about Labour ahead of the 1992 election – the last time it won power outright. Miss Gold, 54, who has a £240million fortune, transformed her father David's business Ann Summers by making the sex-toy and lingerie chain more female-friendly. It has 150 stores and 7,000 party planners, and annually sells two million of the Rampant Rabbit vibrator. After attending an at-home Tupperware party, she saw the potential to use a similar concept to introduce sex toys and lingerie to women. The all-male board initially rejected the idea of having Ann Summers parties, but when they started they proved a success and Miss Gold was made chief executive in 1993. In a 2013 interview, Miss Gold said that she most wants to be remembered ‘for liberating women between the sheets, for bringing sex to the high street, and financial independence to thousands of women via our party planning’. She added that she was often asked if she thought about going into politics, adding: ‘As a woman in business for the past 30 years, I’ve felt like I’ve been in politics all my life.’ Chancellor George Osborne (centre) took the fight to Labour flanked by (left to right) Culture Secretary Sajid Javid, Education Secretary Nicky Morgan, Home Secretary Theresa May and Commons leader William Hague . Businesswoman and Apprentice star Karren Brady, a Tory peer, was in the audience at the event in Millbank Tower, Westminster . Miss Gold’s unveiling as a supporter comes after Karren Brady, who used to work for Mr Gold’s downmarket Sport Newspapers, was made a Tory peer last year. Baroness Brady’s big break came when she was asked by Mr Gold to take over the running of Birmingham City football club. Yesterday, Baroness Brady was also sat on the front row over the Conservative Party event. A Tory source said it had not been decided how prominent she would be in the campaign, but added: 'She's a successful entrepreneur. I think we should praise success rather than follow Labour's culture of envy.' Last night Miss Gold told the Mail: ‘I have always been a supporter of the Conservative Party and was proud to support the event. ‘As a British businesswomen I believe that only the Conservatives have the long term economic plan this country needs and that it is essential that David Cameron is returned to Downing Street after the general election to deliver it.’","Ann Summers boss Jacqueline Gold paraded by party as  newest supporter .

Mr Sarkozy has returned to the public spotlight recently as he lines up a new bid for the Elysee Palace . Mr Chancel, who presented popular French TV shows, will be buried on January 8 Miramont Castle, a property he owned in the Hautes-Pyrénées mountains. Mr Sarkozy was invited to the grand eighteenth century residence several times by Mr Chancel in the early 2000s, and the pair were pictured attending social events together around the same time. He lead tributes to Mr Chancel on the day of his death, telling Le Point: 'Jacques Chancel was a man of immense culture. I cannot name a single subject that did not know passionately. 'This is a man who never said ill of anyone. He preferred to see rather than criticize. He loved life passionately. His was full of discoveries, love for others, joy of living, and of great humility. 'France has lost a great man of television. Culture has lost one of its best servants. And we all lose a friend whose loyalty never faltered.  It is a sad day for us all.'

"They might not have had Botox or Photoshop at their disposal, but the Hollywood icons of yesteryear still reign supreme in the beauty stakes. That's according to a new survey, which named Hollywood star Audrey Hepburn as the ultimate beauty icon of all time. The screen legend – best known for her role in Breakfast at Tiffany’s – fought off tough competition from Beyoncé, who despite being the most googled female of 2014, came fifth. Beyonce (left) was voted fifth most beautiful woman of all time, while Kate Moss (right) came eighth . A new survey, which named Hollywood star Audrey Hepburn as the ultimate beauty icon of all time . Sitting in second place is Marilyn Monroe, while fellow Hollywood star Grace Kelly came third in the survey which quizzed over 2,000 Brits. Even Scarlett Johansson couldn’t compete with the big beauty hitters from Hollywood’s golden age to make the top five. Kate Moss only scooped two per cent of the votes, which placed her in eighth position on the list. The survey carried out by leading cosmetics and skincare brand Artistry by Amway also asked 2,000 women across the UK to reveal their views about beauty and their beauty regime. Scarlett Johansson (left) came tenth but couldn’t compete with the big beauty hitters from Hollywood’s golden age, including Marilyn Monroe (right) , who came in second, just ahead of Grace Kelly . American actress and sultry stunner Ava Gardner (1922-1990) was voted ninth top beauty icon of all time . Asked what is it that makes women feel more beautiful more than two thirds (68 per cent) said confidence is the holy grail of beauty. Over half (57 per cent) claimed being in love makes woman more attractive and 38 per cent said they felt better about themselves when they have their make-up on. Rather than being negative about the impact of ageing, women aged 55 and over are more content with their own beauty (26 per cent) versus younger women aged 18 to 24 (22 per cent).

Also, younger ladies aged 18 to 24 admit to wearing a lot of make-up to help them feel more beautiful (20 per cent) while the more mature lady is less inclined to rely heavily on cosmetics (4 per cent). And as the old adage goes, wisdom comes with age. Women aged 55 and over understand that a healthy diet and exercise regime contributes to one’s own beauty (62 per cent) compared to women aged 35 to 44 (55 per cent). On the spending front, Brits still remain pretty thrifty when forking out on beauty products. Almost half said they spend less than £10 a month on beautifying themselves. Demonstrating some national confidence, the survey also found Brits ranked themselves first for being the most beautiful, whilst placing the French  in fifth place. Swedes, Brazilians and Spanish came in third, fourth and fifth place.

"The bushfires that tore across the Adelaide Hills over the last six days have been declared 95 per cent contained as satellite images of the heavy destruction emerge. NASA released a photo captured by a Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on their Terra satellite on only the second day of the ongoing disaster, which shows thick smoke billowing out across the fire's path. Meanwhile, Geoscience Australia also shared a satellite image, captured on January 4, which showed both the active fire front at the time and what they dubbed as the 'fire scar' that the inferno left across the Adelaide Hills.

The images show smoke billowing out across the Adelaide Hills where infernos continues to rage through a sixth day . Geoscience Australia has also shared an image, captured on January 4, showing the active fire front and 'fire scar' in Adelaide Hills . Up to 600 firefighters worked to battle 40 degree temperatures and 30 kilometre per hour winds on Wednesday, in an effort to take control of the raging bushfires. Country Fire Service chief officer Greg Nettleton confirmed that 95 per cent of the fire has been contained by Wednesday afternoon, with only two ‘hotspot’ areas of concern remaining. He also announced that interstate firefighters were heading home as the declaration of major emergency for the area had been rescinded. It comes as thunderstorms roll into the area, bringing in winds of up to 120 km/h. However Mr Nettleton said that the rain was likely to aid firefighters, adding that the only concern was that strong wind gusts could cause new fires, initiated by lightning, to spread. The South Australian Country Fire Service confirmed that 95 per cent of the fire had been contained on Wednesday afternoon . With only two ‘hotspot’ areas of concern remaining, the declaration of major emergency for the area has been rescinded . Kevin Knight, the Mayor of Tea Tree Gully which was hit by the raging bushfires, praised the efforts of volunteers and firefighters amidst the unpredictable conditions. 'The fires could have been so much worse. 38 houses lost sounds bad but it could have been 238 if the blaze had gone south,' Mr Knight told Daily Mail Australia. 'The firefighters have been unbelievable, but the weather conditions today are already very oppressive. Who can predict what will happen, anything could go wrong in this hot dry weather,' he said earlier on Wednesday. 'We have white collar, blue collar people, housewives, all fighting. They put on that CFS uniform and become superheroes.' Mr Knight, who has also been heading up the Golden Grove Recreation Centre's relief centre, said he believed the last week of bushfires to be worse than those that devastated the state on Ash Wednesday in 1983. 'I'm old enough to remember the bad bushfires in the 1980's, but I've been on council for 17 years and this is the worse one I've seen,' he said. 'The sheer area of the fire, 230 kilometers is so hard to control… It's just total devastation at the moment.' Wednesday saw the biggest firefighting effort since the fire began on Friday afternoon, with a total of 31 aircraft and 110 trucks on the ground. Up to 600 firefighters battled 40 degree temperatures and winds of 30 kilometres an hour to take control of the raging inferno on Wednesday . About 359 firefighters also fought the blaze throughout Tuesday night . It comes after about 359 firefighters fought the blaze throughout Tuesday night, according to the ABC. Over 12,500 hectares of land has been destroyed or damaged in the blaze so far, including 32 homes, 125 other buildings and four businesses. The results of another damage assessment is expected to be carried out before 5pm. As of Wednesday morning, over $13 million worth of insurance claims had been lodged by vicitms. In a press conference on Tuesday, South Australian premiere Jay Weatherill confirmed that 134 people had been injured in the bushfires, including one person being treated for exhaustion and another individual who was hospitalised after being hit by a fallen tree.

"Enquiry: The new investigation into princess Diana's death found there was no evidence to support Soldier N's claims . Extraordinary claims that the SAS was involved in the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, were officially dismissed last night. Scotland Yard said there was ‘no credible or relevant evidence’ that members of the elite unit were linked to the tragic car crash in Paris 16 years ago. In a letter to the Queen and Prince Charles, Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley said there were no facts to substantiate rumours of Special Forces involvement. As a result, the criminal inquiry will not be reopened and the matter will not be referred back to coroner Lord Justice Baker, he said. The decision will come as a relief to senior members of the Royal Household, who have been frustrated at the controversy surrounding the outlandish claims. In August, police were passed material from an SAS sniper, known as Soldier N, via his former parents-in-law. They said he claimed members of his regiment assassinated Diana seconds after her Mercedes smashed into an underpass pillar. Seven detectives were given access to Special Forces Directorate records and took statements. They liaised with colleagues in other forces as well as with the Royal Military Police and the Ministry of Defence. In a letter to the Royal Household, the coroner and Mohammed Al Fayed – whose son Dodi also died in the crash – Mr Rowley said they found contradictions over whether the claims were or were not made against the SAS. Scene: The Mercedes limousine Diana was travelling in crashed into an underpass close to the Pont d'Alma in central Paris . Credibility: Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley said there was no basis for a homicide investigation to be opened . In a copy of the letter passed to Sky . News, he wrote: ‘The conclusion the investigative team has reached is . that, whilst there is a possibility that the alleged comments in . relation to the SAS’s involvement in the death may have been made, there . is no credible or relevant evidence to support a theory that such . claims had any basis in fact. ‘I am satisfied that there is no evidential basis upon which therefore to reopen any criminal homicide investigation.’ A . summary of the Scotland Yard inquiry enclosed with the letter said the . nature of the tragedy means ‘there will have been those who, for . whatever motivation, will have sought to demonstrate particular inside . knowledge, or to claim some form of kudos or recognition’. Since . the crash on August 31, 1997, millions of pounds have been spent on . inquiries by Scotland Yard and French police and an inquest. The inquest . found that the blame lay with the negligent driving of drunken . chauffeur Henri Paul, who also died, and the distraction caused by . pursuing paparazzi. But .

"Nature is more often a display of  majestic beauty: Imagine peacocks fanning their feathers in the sunlight, graceful cheetahs racing across the savannah and technicoloured fish basking in warm waters. But alongside these exquisite displays is a dark underworld of misfits – creatures so ugly and strange they have been described as the ‘counterculture of the natural world.’ From the ‘hipster toad’ with a weaponised moustache to a ‘werewolf mouse’ who howls at the moon, these animals are the antidote to nature’s show-offs. Scroll down for videos . The hardest bat in the world: This long-eared bat has a taste for scorpions. After killing the scorpion, the bat carries it back to a roost and eats it head-first. Usually it eats the whole thing, including the stinger and poison gland . Now, some of the most bizarre examples of these creatures have been compiled in New Scientist’s ‘Mavericks and Misfits of the Animal Kingdom’ publication. Take, for instance, ‘the hardest bat in the world.’ Lurking in isolated patches of desert across Morocco and the Middle East, desert long-eared bats seem to be fearless. In one experiment a team of scientists from the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Israel, caught eight bats and watched them hunt scorpions in their lab. The bats ignored dead prey, only attacking live ones that moved. They also showed an interest in boxes containing live scorpions, suggesting they were homing in on sound. Misfits: On the left is a hipster toad that boasts a weaponised moustache and on the right is a unique turtle that urinates through its mouth . The mouse that howls at the moon: In the dark expanses of the Sonoran desert in the US, a terrifying creature stalks the night, searching for fresh meat. Anything will do: crickets, rodents, tarantulas – the nastier the better . Fish with its genitals on its head: The male fish, a Phallostethus cuulong, his reproductive organs by his face. He weaves between drifting vegetation in the sluggish waters of a canal. He closes in on a female, swims alongside her and tries to mate . When a bat landed on a scorpion, it immediately tried to bite the scorpion’s head. Once the scorpion was dead, the bat carried it back to a roost and ate it head-first. Another oddity is the Texas horned lizard. To scare other creatures, it first turns side-on advertising both its length and the spines running down its body. If that’s not enough, it inflates its body like a balloon and shows off the two horns on its head. As a last resort, the lizard will assault the predator by squirting a jet of blood out of its eyes. This extreme weapon confuses the predator allowing the crafty lizard to escape. Emei moustache toads, meanwhile, grow spines on their upper lip to spike rivals males. Just like a human moustache is meant to signify masculinity, these toads display their upper lip with pride. The hipster toads can be found showing off their moustaches in New York’s Williamsburg, London’s Hackney and San Francisco’s Mission district. Then there is the turtle that urinates through its mouth. When the Chinese soft-shelled creatures need to urinate, it does so by sticking its heads into a puddle of water and wiggling its tongue. Several years ago, scientists discovered that the turtles carry a gene that produces a specialised protein to help expel urine. However, this gene was expressed in their mouths, rather than their kidneys. Horror lizard squirts tears of blood: If ever there was an animal that said 'don't even think about eating me', it would be the Texas horned lizard. It has more defences than the Death Star, ranging from camouflage to bony spines on its head. It can also squirt a jet of blood out of its eyes . Super-sensing sea cow: Manatees' hairs, it turns out, are like whiskers turning them into super-sensors. However, their sensitive hairs can only pick up objects within a few metres, which doesn't stop them from being attacked by speeding boats . Bigger eyes than its brains: The eyes are the most distinctive thing about tarsiers, rivalling those of orangutans for size. A tarsier’s eyes are truly enormous in proportion to the rest of the body, typically 1.5cm in diameter, whereas the entire tarsier is only 12cm long . The male Iberian emerald lizard has a blue head and green body which helps them blend into their background when viewed from above . It's the holy grail for Harry Potter and Star Trek fans, but it seems a bright blue headed lizard has already developed its own invisibility cloak. Biologists were baffled as to how male Iberian emerald lizards have evolved their vivid blue and green colouring. While the brightly coloured skin it useful for attracting a mate, it should also make them easy for predators to spot. However, researchers from the University of Valencia in Spain and the Unviersity of Porto, Portugal, have found that these 15 inch long lizards have a secret weapon against hungry birds of prey - their own cloaking device. They discovered that the lizards' skin is iridescent and reflects light in different ways depending on the angle it is viewed from. When viewed from above, the creatures blend into their background and become almost invisible to birds. However, when viewed from ground level, the lizards still stand out brightly - meaning fellow lizards can easily spot those looking for mate. Dr Guillem Pérez i de Lanuza, a biologist at the University of Porto, say their findings are the first evidence of iridescent colours being used by animals to alter their visibility depending on viewing angle. He said: 'Our results suggest that the blue heads are less striking for a bird above the lizard than a lizard in the same plane. Birds see a less UV pure colour that is more whitish and less chromatically conspicuous when seeing the lizards from above.' But the Chinese soft-shelled turtle isn’t as bizarre as the ‘werewolf mouse’. In the dark expanses of the Sonoran desert in the US, the creature stalks the night, searching for fresh meat. Dubbed the southern grasshopper mouse, it has a habit of standing on its hind legs and letting out a dramatic, high-pitched howl once it has killed its prey. Another creature to make the list of misfits is the male fish, a Phallostethus cuulong, which is just 2cm (0.7 inches) long. When attempting to mate with a female, a Phallostethus cuulong swims alongside her, with his head is right next to the female’s head. This might seem like a misguided tactic, but actually he’s doing it right – because the fish’s genital are on his head. The spotted salamander, meanwhile, have eggs that often contain single-celled green algae. Biologists strongly suspect it is a symbiotic relationship. The embryos release waste which the algae feed on, while the algae photosynthesis and release oxygen. This makes it the first solar-powered vertebrate. These oddities of evolution have survived for millions of years, and in many cases they have been around far longer than humans have. They are also a treasure trove of information for scientists. In their genes they carry records of past evolution, of how life on Earth has changed over millions of years. They may not be as graceful as a gazelle or as beautiful as a hummingbird, but they are just as fascinating.

"The relatives of an eight-year-old girl who died as she was allegedly sexually abused by her father have heard horrific details in court of how her murdered body was found. Hiawayi Robinson's body was found partially unclothed at a dumping ground in Prichard, Alabama on September 18 - two days after she was reported missing after heading out to meet her father. Her crumpled body was surrounded by trash, her Hello Kitty t-shirt was pulled up and her purple shorts and underwear were pulled off one leg and hanging around the other knee, Agent Deric Taylor of the State Bureau of Investigations testified in court, Al.com reported. The details emerged on Monday during a preliminary hearing in the case against her father, Hiawatha Robinson, 38. After the testimony, the judge ruled that a grand jury should hear the case.

Arrest: Hiawatha Robinson, left, has been charged with murder and sodomy for the death of his eight-year-old daughter Hiawayi, right, who was found killed in Prichard, Alabama in September . Robinson, seen in court on Monday, kept his back to the courtroom, where sobbing family members sat, during his hearing . During the hearing, Hiawayi's relatives cried softly - and one relative became so emotional that she fled from the courtroom, the website reported. Robinson, who joined the search for his daughter when she vanished and made a public appeal for her safe return, has been charged with felony murder and first-degree sodomy. The Mobile County District Attorney's Office believes Hiawayi died during a sexual assault but have not provided further information about how exactly she died. Robinson's attorney, Jeff Deen, said that there is no DNA evidence connecting him to the case. A swab was taken of the little girl's body and, while semen was found, the swab was contaminated and a DNA test could not be carried out, Deen said. 'They don't have any DNA connecting him to the case,' he told Al.com. 'They have some circumstantial evidence. The people that I've talked to that seem to just come up to me, that seem to know Hiawatha, they can't believe that he would be involved in something like this.' Tragic: A court heard how her little body was found partially clothed at a dumping ground off this road in Prichard two days after she vanished. After the testimony, the judge ruled a grand jury should hear the case . But prosecutors believe the young girl's father was to blame. 'The facts will show that while engaging in sodomy in the first degree, Hiawatha Robinson Jr. caused the death of Hiawayi Robinson,' Mobile County District Attorney Ashley Rich said while announcing the charges last month. Rich is waiting for more results from the FBI crime lab in Quantico and said there are 'dozens and dozens' of pieces of evidence. In Alabama, the charge means someone is accused of engaging in 'deviant sexual intercourse' with someone under the age of 12, AL.com reported. Loss: Hiawayi told her grandma she was going to meet her dad on September 16 but never returned . 'Deviant sexual intercourse is defined in the law of the state of Alabama as sexual gratification involving the sexual organs of one person and the mouth or the anus of another person,' Rich said. Rich would not say whether the alleged abuse by the father had been ongoing. On the day she vanished, Hiawayi returned home from school to change her clothes because she was wet from the rain. Her father then called her and they spoke for 17 minutes, Taylor said. Hiawayi then told her grandmother she was heading to her cousin's apartment in the same complex because her father was going to meet her there to give her $150 for her birthday. But the cousin later told police she would not have been at the apartment at that time. Hiawayi headed out and never returned home. She was reported missing by her grandmother around 10pm that evening. Her body was found two days later around a mile from their home. After she went missing, authorities looked at surveillance footage taken from businesses along a strip mall near their home and saw a red SUV driving along the road. That day, her father had been driving his girlfriend's red Chevrolet Tahoe, authorities said. In separate surveillance footage from a store that afternoon, Hiawayi could be seen buying candy and then heading in the direction where the SUV was seen. Fifteen minutes after she left the store, her father called her grandmother to see where the little girl was, authorities said. Plea: After she vanished, her father, pictured, appeared on local TV stations pleading for her safe return . During a later search of his girlfriend's car, police found a clear hair bead, like those worn by Hiawayi, and black duct tape, Al.com reported. After she was reported missing, the authorities and the community searched for her, and her parents, who are separated, appeared on television to appeal for information. 'I'm going through pain,' Robinson told Fox10 as he stood beside her mother, Yosha Populus. 'I've been up for the last 24 hours, I've been up all night searching for her - ain't had anything to eat, anything to drink, I ain't going to stop until it's over with - until she's in her home. That's all I want, that's all I ask for.' When asked what he thought might have happened to her, he said: 'Nothing.' 'I don't believe nothing happened to her,' he said. 'I believe she's out there. She's out there. They just need to let her come home. Her daddy gonna find out what the f*** going on.' Rap sheet: Robinson has had multiple arrests including in July 2000 (left) for possession of marijuana and attempting to elude police and in 2011 (right) for possession of marijuana . Her mother also pleaded for information as she stood beside the girl's father. After the arrest was announced, Populus's godfather, Kourney Adams, told Al.com: 'She's been praying it wouldn't be him.' But he added that they were thankful that finally someone has been arrested. 'We thought they had given up,' he said. 'Thank you to the FBI and the Mobile and the city of Prichard for doing their job.' If Robinson is found guilty of all current charges against him  jurors would be unable to hand him the death penalty as he has not been charged with capital murder.","Hiawayi Robinson was found killed at a dumping ground in Prichard, Alabama on September 18 - two days after she vanished .

"A Romanian bodyguard who filmed himself showering in £20 notes has said Britain is 'racist' towards 'hard-working' immigrants doing jobs the 'indigenous population doesn't really want'. Petre Craete, known at home as 'The Redneck with a Maserati', faced a backlash after he posted pictures of himself in a bath full of cash he claimed he earned in just four hours. Mr Craete, who has been a bodyguard for celebrity clients including reality star Alex Reid, boasted he has more money than he can spend. But today he said the film was made for 'a laugh' and is  upset about the 'racist attitude towards me and towards others' because he 'loves Britain'. 'I came here to work, like most of my fellow countrymen. I didn't come here to steal, to rob or to claim benefits. I am not a disease for the country. I am the cure,' he said. Scroll down for video . Boast: Romanian bodyguard Petre Craete posted pictures of himself in a bath full of notes saying he has more cash than he can spend - today he defended himself and other immigrants . Previous: Petre has in the past posted pictures of himself driving expensive cars and living in a VIP apartment but says he has always worked, paid taxes and never claimed benefits . At work: Mr Craete protecting Alex Reid and his then partner Chantelle Houghton at an event in east London in 2011 . 'I came to this country to stay here, to live here and to die here. I didn't come here to make money and to send it back to my country. I came here most of all because of the British ideologies and because of the freedom. Everyone is supposed to live in harmony with each other no matter what colour your skin is, what is your religion or sexual orientation. I strongly believe in freedom. 'I have never claimed benefits in my life, not even when I was entitled. From what I've seen the indigenous population doesn't really want to work low paid jobs in poor working conditions. 'The immigrants don't really mind. They get the job. The position doesn't remain uncovered, and certainly, they pay their tax, therefore the hostilities against foreigners are totally unfounded and malicious. Having fun: Mr Craete pictured in a sports car in London on his Twitter account . 'I advise all my fellow countrymen and all the immigrants coming or who are already in the UK, to work hard and to pay their tax'. Mr Craete, who has been a bodyguard for celebrity clients including reality star Alex Reid, used a video to boast he has more money than he can spend and filmed himself showering in bundles of £20 notes. He said in the film: 'My biggest worry when I have a quiet moment to myself is where am I going to find a wallet big enough to take it all home with.' 'The reality is that I've got so much money I don't know where to put it. It's enough to make you cry, in Romania I never had any money and now I have so much I can't even carry at all. I wouldn't be able to walk if I tried to stuff it in my trouser pocket'. The Romanian said he moved to London in the past few years where he was able to get work as a bodyguard quickly graduating up to celebrity clients. Between 2011 and 2012 he was the bodyguard for former cage fighter Alex Reid. He was close to  Katie Price's ex-husband  and is known to have socialised with him and Chantelle Houghton, who won the Celebrity Big Brother in 2006. He earned his nickname The Redneck with a Maserati after was spotted driving one of the top of the range cars and living in a penthouse in the UK. Stuffing it in: The bodyguard showed himself showering himself in money before putting it down his top because he didn't have a big enough wallet . The Romanian moved to Britain and quickly became a bodyguard for reality stars like Alex Reid (pictured together) Contrast: In the film he says: 'In Romania I never had any money and now I have so much I can't even carry at all' Message: Mr Craete says he has more cash than he can spend and earned the cash in four hours . Today he said that the film was made for a joke but he has a serious message about how he believes foreigners are perceived in Britain. He said: 'Regarding the video I made...well is (sic) just a video I made for a laugh. Is (sic) not even so much money in it. Everybody can make that money if they work hard'. 'The hate of people and their racist attitude towards me and towards others made me understand that I am a happy man. I am happy because I have love in my heart for everyone even for those who hate me because my skin colour is different or because I was born in another country. 'I love England. I love the Monarchy and I would happily give my life for this country. This is now my home where I want to live until the day I'll die. Don't hate me for being at home.' The bodyguard is said to tell his clients he is so scary he even frightens himself when he looks in the mirror. Petre has posted pictures of himself driving expensive cars and living in a VIP apartment. But some have claimed that   the car belonged to one of his employers and the house also didn't belong to him. In the cash video, from October last year, he said: 'I have a tip for my critics, if you come London buy an umbrella because it rains a lot. As every British person knows it's bad luck to open the umbrella inside a house, so I won't do it, and in my house it only rains with money anyway.' Petre is from Targu-Jiu in Southern Romania's Gorj County. Alex Reid used to call him Ninja Pete and posted messages like: 'At cinema with Miss Houghton and ninja Pete. Very romantic, haha, even managed 2 get her 2 watch super hero film! X'","Petre Craete filmed himself naked showering himself in a bath of cash .

"A stockbroker has been sacked and forced to apologise after tweeting: 'Think I just hit a cyclist. But Im late for work so had to drive off lol.' The apparent boast by Rayhan Qadar - which police are investigating - was made on his Twitter account under the name of 'Ray Pew' at 8.30am yesterday. It prompted a storm from other Twitter users, who reported the 21-year-old Cardiff University graduate to police and called for him to apologise. Apology: Stockbroker Rayhan Qadar, 21, has been sacked after writing this Tweet under the name Ray Pew about hitting a cyclist. He apologised and said he had not been in a crash, but the damage was done . Despite saying it was a 'bad joke' and insisting he had not hit a cyclist, he was promptly sacked from his job at Bristol-based Hargreaves Lansdown, which sells shares and investment funds. A spokesman said: 'One of our employees has failed to conduct themselves to the standards we expect of our staff. 'We find these online comments totally unacceptable. 'Upon becoming aware of this issue we have terminated this person's employment with immediate effect.' Mr Qadar's 'joke' was retweeted 152 times and helped raise his number of followers above 1,300 before he made his account private and changed his description. Appalled Twitter users slammed the man and even Greater Manchester police urged him to come forward. Astronomer Adam Whittaker wrote: 'You know what's dumber than leaving the scene? Tweeting it for the world to see. I'll be following your case'. Consequences: Mr Qadar's bosses at Bristol financial firm Hargreaves Lansdown (above) said his comments were unacceptable. Avon and Somerset Police are also investigating whether an offence took place . Another man tweeting as Joff wrote: 'Not a good day for him - hope he was only joking about running a cyclist over or he's in bother!' Greater Manchester Police wrote: 'If you hit a cyclist, you are obliged to stop. I suggest you call 101 as soon as possible, I will forward the details on.' Twitter user Annabel Staff said: 'Dear oh dear, you ignorant p****, hopefully you won't have a job to get to by the end of the day, enjoy going to court #Scum.' And Marc Etches wrote: 'Some people don't deserve to be on our roads. You obviously don't have a brain as you actually tweeted this to the world. Get ready.' A few hours later Mr Qadar wrote: 'My previous tweet about the cyclist was obviously not true. I did not hit cyclist. Not today. Not ever. A bad joke on my part it seems.' Two minutes later he added: 'Sorry if anyone thought i actually hit a cyclist. Anyone who follows me on Twitter know 99% of the things I tweet is nonsense.' But the damage was done - and a spokesman for Avon and Somerset Police said the force was investigating. 'We are aware of a tweet regarding a collision between a cyclist and a car,' he said. 'We are looking into it and we're asking for witnesses to come forward.' Police are still investigating despite Mr Qadar contacting the force directly to explain that his tweet had been a joke. The drastic consequences for the young stockbroker have prompted a new debate over whether his bosses went too far by sacking him. Getting involved: How Greater Manchester Police's official Twitter account waded into the row this morning . A friend of Rayhan defended him and said it was 'clearly a joke', adding: 'He's genuinely a really nice guy.' One Twitter user wrote: 'What I think is disgusting is the total over-reaction from the righteous Twitter Nazis over a joke tweet. It's a bad joke, end of.' And one of his original critics, writing under the name Atherton Cyclist, added: 'I didn't want him sacked to be honest, it is a bit harsh. An apology would have done for me.' Emma Way, from Watton, Norfolk, was convicted of failing to stop after a collision and failing to report an accident in 2013 after she prompted outrage with a similar tweet. Police became aware of the collision after she tweeted “definitely knocked a cyclist off his bike earlier. I have right of way - he doesn’t even pay road tax!” using the hashtag #bloodycyclists afterwards. Cyclist Toby Hockley suffered bruising and minor damage to his bike in the incident near the village of Rockland All Saints, Norfolk. Miss Way (above) later said she suffered cyber-bullying because of her Twitter post. A third user wrote: 'If I were him I'd check my employment policies. I am not sure a moment of twitter silliness constitutes ""gross misconduct""'. Mr Qadar apologised today from his home in Bristol, saying: 'I am 100 per cent sorry. It was a joke gone bad. I didn't think that would happen. 'I understand now that I can't say things like that. If I did have an accident I would not drive away. 'I was literally late to work - that's the only true bit - and I tweet a lot of nonsense so I go ""I hit a cyclist, I think I hit a cyclist, but I can't stop because I'm late for work"". 'Obviously it's not true. The only true bit is I was late for work. 'I say a lot of things like that on Twitter. People that follow me for a few years, they know I talk a lot of nonsense really. That's all it was. 'It was a really dumb thing to say [...] and now I've lost my job. It's mad, like, you write something and I had no idea it would blow up like that. 'Obviously I regret it and I'm so sorry to anyone who thought I might have hit someone. I wouldn't ever drive away if I did. 'The way I'm looking at it is if I kind of wrote a tweet about one person or a few people or targeted someone, like, specifically or anything then I understand. 'But it was a made up thing, it's not about anyone, it didn't hurt anyone that's why I'm a bit, like, ""I can't believe it cost my job over that"". 'I'm in a bit of shock at the moment. I know it's foolish. I wouldn't do it again.' He also said his Twitter name 'Ray Pew' was meant as a reference to the 'pew pew pew' sound of a laser gun.","Rayhan Qadar made the offensive post on his Twitter account yesterday .

"Call him the social media president – maybe. Jeb Bush, the moderate former Republican governor of Florida, launched a political action committee on Tuesday with a Facebook rollout and a website that asks for visitors' Instagram usernames. The 'Right to Rise' PAC, Bush said in a Vine-like Facebook video, will 'support candidates who believe in conservative principles.' He will begin filling its coffers Wednesday night in tony Greenwich, Connecticut, a 1-percentages' paradise where his father, former President George H.W. Bush, grew up. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . GROUNDWORK: Jeb Bush (second left),  shown at the Jan. 2 swearing-in of his son George P. Bush (2nd right) as Texas land commissioner, is readying a presidential campaign with the launch of a leadership PAC . POWER COUPLE: Craig and Debbie Stapleton, shown chatting with France's then-Culture Minster Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres (right), are hosting Bush's PAC fundraiser on Wednesday; Mr. Stapleton was President George W' Bush's ambassador to France and, before that, to the Czech Republic . 'We will not cede an inch of territory – no issues, no demographic groups, no voters,' the PAC's website says in calculated pre-campaign language, while promising to 'unite our citizens to strengthen America through greater economic growth and widespread prosperity.' 'We believe in the transformative power of conservative ideas to renew America,' it adds. So-called 'leadership' PACs are different from presidential campaign committees. Their funds can be disbursed to other politicians' campaign committees. But the PACs can't coordinate its activities with any of them. Bush's move will help him build a war chest to curry favor with Republican Party insiders, help he'll need it he officially joins the 2016 White House race. The Right to Rise PAC can also spend money to pay a growing Bush enterprise's staff, commission public-opinion polls, and even foot the bill for Bush's travel as he crisscrosses the country in search of financial backing. It also puts him on equal footing with other probable contenders. Every other major GOP pol who has generated presidential media buzz already had a leadership PAC. Bush is also making a play at retail politics, soliciting donations on his PAC's website. 'Hey everybody,' he says in his Facebook video. 'Today we're setting up the Right to Rise PAC which is a PAC to support candidates that believe in conservative principals to allow all Americans to rise up. If you're interested, go to righttorisepac.org.' In a second version of the video, Bush says the same thing in Spanish. He became the first prominent Republican, in December, to talk openly about his presidential aspirations. CBS News noted that the name 'right to rise' may be the creation of Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan, the 2012 Republican vice presidential nominee. Bush quoted Ryan in a 2011 Wall Street Journal opinion essay. 'Congressman Paul Ryan recently coined a smart phrase to describe the core concept of economic freedom: ""The right to rise"",' he wrote then. 'Think about it. We talk about the right to free speech, the right to bear arms, the right to assembly. The right to rise doesn't seem like something we should have to protect. But we do. We have to make it easier for people to do the things that allow them to rise. We have to let them compete.' Politico reported Tuesday that allies of Bush are readying the launch of a separate 'super PAC' that will help him head off efforts by Senators Ted Cruz and Rand Paul, and a longer list of governors, to muscle him out by locking in the early support of potential high-dollar donors. Some of his rivals may ultimately reconsider their chances as Bush collects his checks. Super PACs have no contribution limits. DYNASTY: Jeb Bush (left) has two former US presidents in his family and was governor of Florida from 1999 to 2007 . FAMILY AFFAIR: A Jeb Bush presidential run would likely pick up the same full-throated support from the Bush clan that marked his campaigns for governor; at this 2002 rally, then-first lady Laura Bush, his sister-in-law, showed up to speak . The process begins Wednesday night for Bush in Greenwich at the home of Craig and Debbie Walker Stapleton. Mr. Stapleton is a former U.S. ambassador to France and the Czech Republic under former President George W. Bush – Jeb's brother. Mrs. Stapleton is Bush's cousin. The event's 'host committee' is another who's-who of Bush-era government. It includes Richard Breeden, who chaired the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission under George H.W. Bush, Jeb's father. David McCormick, the president of Bridgewater Associates – the world’s largest hedge fund – is also on that committee. McCormick was a Treasury Department under secretary during the George W. Bush presidency . “It will be an opportunity to discuss the Governor’s background, his future plans and most importantly, ask questions,” read an email invitation to the event obtained by the Connecticut Post. Attendees are being asked to contribute $5,000 apiece.","Bush legally establishes his PAC on Tuesday, just in time to start raising money that he will use to curry favor with GOP insiders in advance of 2016 .

"A New Mexico man has spoken of his anger after buying what appeared to be a winning lottery ticket worth more than $500,000 - only for officials to claim it was a misprint and refuse to honor it. John Wines, who has recently retired, bought the New Mexico Lottery scratcher - featuring the winning numbers '1' and '2' - from a Shell gas station in Roswell, Chaves County, in December. As he started scratching, he was stunned to come across two '1s' - both of which were worth $250,000. He later uncovered another '1' ($75) and two further '2s' ($500 and $50 respectively). Scroll down for video . Angry: John Wines, who has recently retired, bought a New Mexico Lottery scratcher - featuring the winning numbers '1' and '2' - from a Shell gas station in Roswell in December. Above, Mr Wines with the ticket . Misprint: As he started scratching, he came across two '1s' (pictured) - both  worth $250,000. However, he was later told they had been misprinted - and were, in fact, double-figure numbers that were not winners . Assuming that the scratcher's stated maximum prize of $250,000 was wrong, a delighted Mr Wines returned to the gas station to collect his winnings. However, he was told he had not won anything. Instead, the female cashier explained that the 'winning' numbers were, in fact, double-figure numbers that had seen their right-hand-side numbers omitted as a result of a misprint by the lottery. 'I took it back in and she told me that is not a winner,' Mr WInes told KOB 4 News. 'They told me that it was a misprint and they don't pay off for misprints.' Indeed, if you look closely at Mr Wines's ticket, you can see part of several numbers that are supposed to be next to the 1s and 2s. However, it is unclear what figures they are meant to be. More false wins: Mr Wines later uncovered another '1' (worth $75) and two further '2s' (worth $500 and $50 respectively) - two of which are pictured above - that were also revealed to be the result of a lottery misprint . Unhappy customer: 'I mean, if you thought you won $500,000 and somebody tells you that you didn't, and you can prove you did, it's pretty stressful for somebody to say, ""no you're not getting your money"",' said Mr Wines . Furthermore, the letters underneath the 1s and 2s - which are a safety figure designed to prevent fraud by responding to specific numbers (such as 14 = 'FTN') - clearly refer to other numbers. But despite the evidence, Mr Wiles claims the ticket appears to be a winner, saying: 'There’s a 1 right here for $250,000,” said Wines. “Right below that is another 1 and it's a $250,000 winner.' He added: 'I mean, if you thought you won $500,000 and somebody tells you that you didn't, and you can prove you did, it's pretty stressful for somebody to say, ""no you're not getting your money"".'

But an angry Mr Wiles said: 'This is $500,000. That's a half million. It’s like I told them, I didn't misprint it.

"One of the world's top modeling agencies has turned to Instagram in order to scout for new talent. As part of its worldwide We Love Your Genes model search, IMG Models, which looks after the likes of Kate Moss, Karlie Kloss and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, is calling on any eager future fashion stars to upload their best selfies to Instagram, using the hashtag #WLYG. But, determined not to judge the girls on just the one image, the agency's VP of scouting, Jeni Rose, explained to Fashionista that they want each person to create more of a digital portfolio, by posting a series of images which showcase their 'whole personality'. Scroll down for video . Future fashion star: Isabell Klem from Hawaii was one of the first models to be scouted by IMG via her Instagram account. As soon as they spotted her beautiful pictures, they flew her out to New York to meet with them . Blonde hair, blue eyes: Lola Van De Vondervoort posted this image of herself without any make-up on in the hopes of being scouted by IMG's experts . Be yourself: Model Sofia Rivolta, who was recently signed to IMG after they noticed her potential via Instagram, advised other budding fashion stars to avoid using too many filters in their own selfies . 'Instagram allows us to see potential models' natural beauty in their everyday lives,' she said. 'They no longer have to spend lots of money on photo shoots or portfolios. Instead, they can come directly to us with simple smartphone snapshots and a lot of enthusiasm.' While the agency will not yet reveal whether it has successfully signed any of the would-be Instagram models to its books, the official We Love Your Genes Instagram account says that it has already scouted 'dozens' of girls via social media. Ms Rose also admitted that IMG has received more than 14,000 submissions from young women who are eager to join its books. Fresh-faced: Many of the girls include a variety of submissions on their Instagram accounts, in order to showcase a variety of different looks . Lookalike: After being scouted on Instagram, model Gabi Konopko was quickly catapulted to stardom, with many commented on her similarities with fellow IMG model Lara Stone . It is hoped that the idea of a social media model search might one day become a widely-accepted means of finding new talent - not least because it saves the agencies from having to send their scouts abroad in order to meet with potential models. 'We've been scouting via social for a while now and have developed proprietary methods to help us identify the best possible talent,' Ms Rose added. 'Those methods are now informing special tools we're building in-house that will help us move quickly and decisively while tracking thousands of accounts.' The We Love Your Genes Instagram account, which is run by Ms Rose and her colleagues, has now amassed nearly 12,000 followers - however thus far only a hand full of carefully-selected Instagram submissions have been chosen to feature on the account. Strike a pose: In some cases, the girls have gone back through their existing Instagram images in order to add the We Love Your Genes hashtag . Going global: Thus far IMG have received more than 14,000 submissions from around the world, including London, Sweden, Spain and America . The perfect pout: Chloe Logan captioned this image 'bonjour' before later adding the We Love Your Jeans tag . New IMG model Luna Sobrino is quoted on the account, which details her reaction to being scouted: 'I couldn't believe it! Literally not until I spoke to Jeni Rose on the phone I realized that I was given such amazing opportunity!” IMG are certainly not the first to turn to social media as a means of finding models - although this campaign is believed to be one of the biggest ever run. Both Marc Jacobs and Guess have held casting calls on Instagram in the past, with Marc Jacobs opting to use the social media platform in order to choose girls for both its Fall 2014 and Spring 2015 campaigns. 'It seemed like a great idea to me, as casting through Instagram seemed cool, current and strong,' Jacobs told WWD after his fall campaign was unveiled. 'We wanted the ads to shout with youth and energy...to be fresh and reclaim the spirit that the collection had when we first conceived of it - to be another collection, not a second line.' Multi-talented: IMG praised model Gizele Oliveira for her ability to pull of any look . Globe trotter: The 21-year-old Brazilian was flown out to New York to meet with IMG scouts and now lives and works in the Big Apple . Pretty and petite: Mies Magrijn was convinced that she was too short to ever be taken seriously as a model .","The initiative is the work of IMG Models, who look after Kate Moss, Rosie Hungtington-Whiteley and Karlie Kloss .
Girls have been asked to create Instagram-based portfolios, using the hashtag #WeLoveYourGenes, which will showcase their 'whole personality'"
"Two singles in their seventies who married after a chance meeting at a blues concert have proved that love can come at any age. Margie Goldsmith, a 70-year-old travel writer who lives in New York City, had been divorced twice and no longer had marriage on her mind when she met Jamie Anthony, a 71-year-old retired insurance executive, at the Triad NYC, a theater on Manhattan's Upper West Side, in July 2012. 'I had completely decided that it absolutely was not worth it. I'd done it twice and that was enough,' Ms Goldsmith told DailyMail.com. Just married: Margie Goldsmith, a 70-year-old travel writer who lives in New York City, wed Jamie Anthony, 71, on December 13 after meeting at a blues show in 2012 . 'I was very happy with my life as it was. I was living a life as a complete person with a lot of friends. And I didn't feel I had to have a man. I think if you get to a certain age, you get over that - you don't need to have a man in your life,' she added. She and Mr Anthony, who had also been divorced twice and has three grown children, struck up a conversation about their mutual love of the blues after he noticed that her friend was wearing a shirt from the Shack Up Inn in Mississippi, where Mr Anthony had stayed many times. 'I thought he was absolutely charming and I loved his Southern accent,' she recalled of Mr Anthony, who grew up in Sandy Springs, Georgia, and now produces blues bands. 'I was thrilled to meet someone who had a similar passion.' One day later, he invited her to Maplewoodstock, a music festival near his home in Maplewood, New Jersey. The following weekend, he asked her to take a ride on his motorcycle. 'The moment he told me he loved motorcyles, I thought oh God, he's got to have tattoos all over his body. He's probably got black leather, he's got chains and he rides a Harley. But I liked him enough to be willing to give it a go,' she said. First impression: 'I thought he was absolutely charming and I loved his Southern accent,' Ms Goldsmith recalled of Mr Anthony . However, she found the ride exhilarating, telling the New York Times: 'Riding behind him was very sensual. You can choose how much to put your arms around him. I put my arms around him a lot. We were like two teenagers on our first date. By the time we made it back to the city, I was hooked.' The pair went on to experience other adventures together, including a motorcycle ride in the rain on Bavaria's Romantic Road, during which they got lost, not speaking a word of German, and ended up in Austria. It was in Germany that Ms Goldsmith began to realize the relationship was serious, she added to DailyMail.com. 'It was the first time I'd been away with him for more than two or three nights and he was really easy to be with and we had the same values. And I was very attracted to him, which I hadn't been in a very long time. I had just met a lot of men whom I couldn't wait to get away from after a cup of coffee,' she said. On a subsequent trip to Bali, where Ms Goldsmith was working on a story assignment, Mr. Anthony proposed in Balinese, telling her: 'I will love you forever. Please be a part of my life.' The couple married on December 13 at Mr. Anthony’s church, Prospect Presbyterian in Maplewood. Happy couple: 'He was really easy to be with and we had the same values,' Ms Goldsmith said of Mr Anthony . Ms Goldsmith said she was eager to gain 13 new family members, including Mr Anthony's son and two daughters, and their spouses and children. She found an instant rapport with his daughter Ashlee, whom she met on their first date at Maplewoodstock, and was impressed that all three children were 'so beautifully brought up, and so polite'. Ms Goldsmith said that there are two secrets to a happy marriage. 'First of all, respecting the other one's feelings and compromising instead of blowing up or getting resentful. But even before that, being open about your feelings,' she said. 'In both other marriages, I just let the resentment seethe inside of me. I was too afraid to express what I really felt because I thought each respective husband would get angry. But now that I'm older and wiser, I have no trouble telling Jamie if something bothers me and he does the same. I think the resentments are what drive people to divorce. It's empowering to be able to say what you feel.' Ms Goldsmith has kept her apartment in New York City, where she likes to write in her office, while Mr Anthony will maintain his residence in South Orange, New Jersey, where he's since moved, so that neither has to compromise their lifestyle. The couple will spend weekends together and plan dinner dates during the week. Ms Goldsmith said: 'I think at 20, or 30, or 40, as a woman, you're looking for someone to complete you. Even the second time around, you kind of lose your identity to a man. If you were brought up in an age when your mother said find a guy, marry him and  darn his socks and cook his meals, you become an appendage of your husband and you lose whatever identity is your own. 'But when you're 70, if you choose to get married, you have your identity, you're not about to lose it. And if you're marrying someone who's also 70, then they understand that. They're not going to try to mold you into something they want you to be.'","Margie Goldsmith, a 70-year-old travel writer who lives in New York City, married Jamie Anthony, 71, on December 13 after meeting at a blues show .

"A man who was shot and killed by San Francisco police officers left behind a suicide note in his cellphone addressed to police. Officers shot Matthew Hoffman, 32, on Sunday evening after he entered a restricted parking lot at a police station and brandished what appeared to be a handgun. It was actually an air gun, which fires small projectiles such as pellets or BBs. San Francisco police made public one of several notes, this one titled 'Dear Officer(s)' with the permission of Hoffman's father, authorities said in a statement. Scroll down for video . 'I used you': Suicidal man Matthew Hoffman, 32, left a note to police apologizing for tricking them into firing . In the note, Hoffman, 32, said the officers 'ended the life of a man who was too much of a coward to do it himself.' 'Please, don't blame yourself. I used you. I took advantage of you,' Hoffman added. Hoffman was transported to San Francisco General Hospital, where he later died of his wounds. The officers were not injured. The air gun did not have a colored tip on it, which is a standard identifier of a toy gun, Officer Gordon Shyy said Monday. He declined to discuss any other details of the case. San Francisco Police Chief Greg Suhr said Monday that his department, like police across the nation, has heightened concern for officer safety following the ambush killings of two New York City police officers. 'This is a job where very sadly we lose officers,' Suhr said. 'It's on all our minds. But we've got a job to do, so we're going to do it.' The shooting occurred about 5:15 p.m. after three sergeants noticed a man loitering in the parking lot of the Mission District police station. The parking lot is clearly marked as restricted to the public, but a gate is kept open for police vehicles to come and go, Suhr said. Incident: The shooting sparked outrage in the neighborhood where people feared a backlash against police . Police ordered Hoffman to leave, and he began to walk away but then stood in the middle of the driveway, staring at them and blocking them from leaving. The sergeants again ordered him to leave. Hoffman began backing out of the parking lot, facing the sergeants with his hands in his front shirt pockets. They asked him to show his hands. He lifted his sweater and showed what appeared to be the butt of a handgun, Esparza said. When Hoffman reached for his waistband and pulled out the air gun, two of the sergeants opened fire, hitting Hoffman three times. Hoffman had approached officers at the Mission District station earlier in the day and asked them what kind of guns San Francisco police carry, what kind of ammunition they use and if the officers had been involved in any officer-involved shootings, Esparza said. The officers did not speak with the man, and he eventually left. The sergeants involved in the shooting were placed on 10 days of paid administrative leave, which is standard in any police shooting. Their names were not released. Suhr said he will hold a town hall meeting discussing the shooting, which rattled nearby residents. Joann Kuhl, who lives a few blocks away, told the San Francisco Chronicle that her biggest concern was that the shooting might 'fuel the fire of a really bad state of affairs between police and their community.'","Matthew Hoffman, 32, brandished a real-looking air gun at officers .

"David Cameron is preparing to warn German Chancellor Angela Merkel that he is prepared to take Britain out of the EU without major reform. The Prime Minister will use talks in London tomorrow to set out his 'red lines' for renegotiation of EU membership, warning that without big changes he will rule nothing out. They will tour the British Museum before meeting in Downing Street, when Mr Cameron will demand new safeguards for the single market, an end to ever closer union between member states, new 'red card' powers to veto Brussels rules and a major package of welfare curbs. German Chancellor Angela Merkel will arrive in London tomorrow morning for talks with David Cameron which are likely to focus on his demands for EU reform . Mr Cameron has promised that if he is still PM after May's general election he will renegotiate Britain's membership of the EU before staging an in-out referendum before the end of 2017. He has made clear that he thinks his plan will succeed, and he will then recommend staying in the EU. If he fails he admits he will 'rule nothing out', raising the prospect that he will recommend exit from the 28-nation bloc. However, Mrs Merkel has insisted that she will not support any moves to alter the fundamental principle of freedom of movement. She wants Britain to remain in the EU, but senior figures in Berlin have repeatedly said they will not seek to do so at any cost. The German chancellor will arrive in the UK tomorrow morning and they visit the British Museum to see an exhibition on the history of her country. The museum's Germany: Memories Of A Nation exhibition traces 600 years of the history, with exhibits including works of art and a Volkswagen Beetle. Downing Street said that the pair's talks would focus on the German presidency of the G7. However Mr Cameron will reiterate his warning that if he fails to secure the reforms he could back Britain's exit. 'If I don't get what I want I rule nothing out. Ruling nothing out means just that,' Mr Cameron said at the weekend. The leaders will tour the British Museum in central London. The Germany: Memories Of A Nation exhibition traces 600 years of the history, with exhibits including works of art and a Volkswagen Beetle . He used a major in November to set out key demands on banning EU nationals from claiming in-work benefits or social housing in Britain for four years, deporting jobless migrants if they do not get work for six months and refusing to allow other countries to join the EU without imposing controls on the movement of their workers until their economies have reached UK levels. He said: 'EU migrants should have a job offer before they come here. UK taxpayers will not support them if they don't.' However, today there were reports that the European Commission was preparing to block the move. The Guardian said the commission is preparing to let Number 10 know that the proposal would be unworkable because it would be impossible to distinguish between EU jobseekers and tourists entering the UK. Ahead of the visit, Ukip leader Nigel Farage said: 'Germany is facing its own problems at the moment and would not want Britain to start turning away EU jobseekers, potentially redirecting them to seek work there. 'If Chancellor Merkel agreed that UK can close the door on EU jobseekers she would also have to recognise that a great many that were Britain bound would instead seek work in Germany as the continent's biggest economy, and that is a risk she is likely to be unwilling to take.' Labour's shadow Europe minister Pat McFadden said Chancellor Merkel would not be driven by 'the need to pander to the eurosceptics inside today's Conservative Party'. He added: 'Even once her visit is over, the gap between what David Cameron's eurosceptic backbenchers are demanding and what European allies such as Germany will accept, remains unbridgeable. 'Europe does need to change, but the tragedy for Britain is that since being elected, David Cameron has spent more time negotiating with his backbenchers than with other EU leaders.'","German Chancellor arrives in London tomorrow for talks in Number 10 .

"A prolific U.S. anti-vaccine campaigner who will be speaking at child health seminars across Australia has defended them after pro-immunisation parents labelled them as 'disgusting'. Sherri Tenpenny, who has written books such as Saying No to Vaccines and Flu and Flu Vaccines: What's Coming Through That Needle?, will be touring in Melbourne, Adelaide, Brisbane, the Gold Coast and Sydney in February and March. But pro-vaccination campaigners have hit out at the Raising Healthy Children Naturally, and Birth, Baby and Beyond seminars. Scroll down for video . Sherri Tenpenny, who has written books such as Saying No to Vaccines and Flu and Flu Vaccines: What's Coming Through That Needle?, will be touring Australia in February and March . Dr Tenpenny said she found the backlash on social media 'curious'. 'I planned to be in Australia for a holiday and was asked to speak with a few groups who are interested in discussing the pros and cons of vaccines,' she told Daily Mail Australia via email. 'It is curious why the public health, pro-vaccine community is so outraged over my visit and the opportunity to share information sourced from conventional medical journals. 'If vaccines were so effective, so protective and so incredibly safe, no one would be interested in these gatherings. 'The public health community should be willing to openly discuss they problems associated with vaccines, how to improve vaccine safety, and how to restore the health of those who have been vaccine-injured.' As soon as next month, Australians will also get the chance to sit down and have dinner with the high-profile anti-vaccination campaigner, with tickets ranging from $125 to $200. Dr Tenpenny described the public the public health and pro-vaccine communities' outrage as 'curious' Her views on immunisation are further demonstrated by the T-shirts sold on her site . On her website, Dr Tenpenny writes she believes 'vaccines can cause more harm to the health of the individual' and is against 'a system that forces parents to inject their children, against their better judgment'. Her views on immunisation are further demonstrated by the T-shirts sold on her site, which read: 'I didn't deny my children vaccines... I spared them' and 'Fact: 1 in 50 = Autism Overall, Fact: 1 in 25,000 = Unvaccinated, Prove Me Wrong'. But Dr Tenpenny's visit have people so outraged they have vowed to write to local politicians to stop her from spreading her message, with Stop the AVN - a group who are for vaccines - leading the charge. Stop the AVN's Dave Hawkes told Daily Mail Australia the group's concern was Dr Tenpenny 'peddled misinformation'. 'She’s giving information that's not supported by evidence and marketing it to people with alternative views and possibly leaving them in danger by not vaccinating their young children,' he said. Dr Hawkes - who has a PhD in HIV research - said it was also concerning that people who were joining Dr Tenpenny, like Isaac Goldman, were spruiking homeopathic vaccines, which are 'essentially water'. 'The evidence shows they don’t work… and leaves their kids susceptible,' Dr Hawkes said. 'Recently a seven-month-old child who was not vaccinated died from whooping cough.' One of Stop the AVN's supporters wrote on social media she was going to write to federal politicians asking for their intervention. 'I'm writing to the Hons Sussan Ley and Fiona Nash (health minister and assistant health minister). Vaccines are recommended by every state body in Australia. They are incentivised by our federal govt,' one woman said on Facebook. People have taken to social media to express their outrage, with one pro-vaccine group starting a letter writing campaign . The seminars are called Raising Healthy Children Naturally and Birth, Baby and Beyond, and will be held in Queensland, NSW, South Australia and Victoria . While others have expressed their disgust on the social media pages of the venues holding the seminars. 'I am beyond disgusted that you are hosting an anti vaccination seminar in March... Children die each year in this country as a result of this misinformation, is the small amount of money you are going to get... worth it?' a Facebook user wrote on Melbourne's Bayview Eden page. Another wrote: 'Cannot believe you are hosting an anti vaccine seminar in March, disgusting. Never staying here, ever.' This comes after the Federal Court ruled against Homeopathy Plus, finding homeopathic vaccines were not scientifically proven to be effective, and said the health website had mislead people into thinking they could be used as a substitute for medical vaccines, News Corp reported. National Centre of Immunisaiton Research and Surveillance director Peter McIntyre told Daily Mail Australia Dr Tenpenny was tapping into people's 'fear factor'. 'When we've got no disease to see, it's very easy to look at something like autism - unfortunately it's something we still don't understand - and start to suggest it has something to do with being vaccinated. You can understand why people would believe that,' he said. 'But there are hundreds of studies that disprove that.' Professor McIntyre added there was no scientific evidence homeopathic vaccinations protected people against infectious diseases. He said it was like asking someone if they wanted to be vaccinated with 'sterile water'. 'It’s just laughable really,' Professor McIntyre said.","Sherri Tenpenny is a osteopath who believes in not vaccinating children .

"Brendan Rodgers has dismissed rumours Raheem Sterling could move away from Liverpool - stating the talented midfielder could be linked with every club in the world due to his footballing ability. The Reds have made a sluggish start to their Premier League title challenge, sitting in 11th place ahead of the Merseyside derby against Everton on Saturday, with Sterling being one of the plus points in their jittery early season form.

Speaking at the club's pre-match press conference on Thursday, Rodgers said: 'I think it shows that he is playing very well. You could link him with every club in the world. I sit easy with the speculation. Him and his representatives know how comfortable he is here. 'At some point in the future he will be rewarded for his performance but he still has three years left on his contract. There is no rush. He had a breather against Aston Villa.

'Sturridge has responded well to treatment and it is going well. He is out there on the field working. It will be great to have him back,' spoke Rodgers. 'His pace and movement is exceptional. We hope it will be this weekend but we will see. We won't rush him. If he is fit, he won't be match fit. 'Everton have quality. They have not had the results they will have wanted but Roberto [Martinez] is a great manager. Last season was really special. We were excellent in every aspect of the game.

'Playing in the Champions League is very exciting, we have got all these great games coming up and that is what you want as a manager and a player. 'There is an adjustment but it's not a distraction.

"The first human trials of a new Ebola vaccine are today underway, the latest step in attempts to halt the spread of the virus in West Africa. Scientists at Oxford University have immunised the first healthy volunteers with a new drug, which they hope will protect people against the disease. The World Health Organisation said today more than 8,100 people have now lost their lives to the virus, the majority in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. In September a separate trial was launched at the university, to test the effects of another potential vaccine. The Oxford Vaccine Group, part of the University of Oxford Department of Paediatrics, aims to have vaccinated 72 healthy adult volunteers by the end of this month. Scroll down for video . Oxford University scientists have begun immunising healthy volunteers in a trial of a new experimental Ebola vaccine. They hope to immunise 72 adults by the end of the month . The study involves a 'prime-boost' vaccine regime, meaning volunteers are given a first 'prime' injection to stimulate an initial immune response. Two months later they are given an additional booster injection, intended to enhance the body's immune response. The trial organisers stressed the vaccine does not contain any replicating virus, so it cannot cause anyone to be infected with Ebola. The immune responses that the vaccine generates – both antibodies and T cells – will also be measured over a period of one year. The new Ebola vaccine is being trialled by the Oxford Vaccine Group. They aim to have vaccinated 72 healthy adult volunteers, aged 18 - 50, by the end of this month. The study involves a 'prime-boost' vaccine regime in which volunteers are first given a  'prime' injection to stimulate an initial immune response. Two months later they are given an additional booster injection, intended to enhance the body's immune response. The trial organisers stressed the vaccine does not contain any replicating virus, so it is cannot cause anyone to be infected with Ebola. The immune responses that the vaccine generates – both antibodies and T cells – will also be measured over a period of one year. Previous trials showed the vaccine was successful in protecting primates against the Kikwit Zaire strain of Ebola – which is similar to the virus causing the current outbreak in Western Africa. The strain has a mortality rate of up to 90 per cent, according to the World Health Organisation. The trial's main objective is to test the vaccine's safety, and to test in which order the two vaccine components should be given in a prime-boost regime, and how far apart. Developers of the drug, the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson, have now accelerated the trial due to the continued spread of Ebola in West Africa.

Since its outbreak the killer disease has claimed more than 8,000 lives across Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea. Further studies of this vaccine are being planned for the United States and in Africa early next year. Dr Matthew Snape, from the Oxford Vaccine Group, said: 'We aim to immunise all participants within a month; the main aim is to understand the safety profile of the vaccines. 'The devastating Ebola epidemic in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone continues to see hundreds of new cases each week and has placed a huge burden on these countries' infrastructures. 'While public health measures are currently still the best way to bring the outbreak under control, if we have a safe and effective vaccine it could begin to have an impact later this year. 'That is the goal that is seeing manufacturers, public health bodies and research regulators come together to accelerate the first clinical trials of new Ebola vaccines.' Volunteers are given a 'prime' injection to stimulate an initial immune response. Two months later they are given an additional booster injection to enhance the immune response to the virus (pictured) The trial starting today follows another trial launched in September last year, also based in Oxford. Ruth Atkins (right), a 48-year-old NHS communications manager  from Marcham, Oxfordshire, was the first healthy Brit to be injected with an experimental vaccine to fight the deadly Ebola virus. The results are due this month . The trial beginning today is part of a series of safety trials of potential Ebola vaccines aimed at preventing the disease. In September, a trial of another Ebola vaccine developed by GSK/US National Institutes of Health (NIH) began. This vaccine used a single Ebola virus protein to generate an immune response, but similarly could not cause anyone to become infected with Ebola as it didn't contain infectious virus material. The trial vaccinated 60 healthy volunteers and initial results are expected this month. A third Ebola vaccine being developed by the biotech company NewLink Genetics will also soon be trialled, as well as others in development in Russia. Dr Snape said the more vaccines being trialled, the better. He said: 'The fact that there are at least three Ebola vaccines entering these early safety trials is good news. 'We are not playing first past the post here. Having multiple vaccines progressing through clinical trials increases the likelihood of vaccine manufacturers having the capacity to meet production demands should mass immunisation be required. 'The more vaccines and more manufacturers there are working on this, the better.' The trial comes as the Ebola screening system at UK airports has been toughened up after a British nurse who later developed the virus was waived through.

Ms Cafferkey is fighting for her life after being diagnosed with Ebola last Monday, after five weeks in Sierra Leone . Nurse Pauline Cafferkey, 39, is fighting for her life after being diagnosed with Ebola last Monday having spent five weeks treating victims in Sierra Leone. It later emerged that officials at Heathrow had allowed her to board a connecting flight to Glasgow even though she had complained of a fever. UK Health secretary Jeremy Hunt yesterday announced that officials had introduced more rigorous checks for doctors and nurses returning to the UK following volunteer work. Until recently, the screening only involved them having their temperature taken and filling-in a questionnaire about whether they have come into contact with patients. But from now on, anyone who thinks they are mildly unwell will be kept on and made to undergo further checks even if their temperature seems normal. Officials will also seek advice from tropical disease experts and monitor the patient closely for a number of hours. Ms Cafferkey, from Glasgow, remains in a critical but stable state at a special isolation unit at the Royal Free Hospital in North London.","Oxford University scientists begin to immunise volunteers .

"A couple has been awarded £4,200 after contracting gastroenteritis whilst holidaying at Al Diwan Resort, Sharm El Sheikh in Egypt. Barry Stuart Lawton and his partner, Cheryl O'Brien, had travelled for a two-week holiday to Egypt for a 'recuperating' holiday after Cheryl had suffered two miscarriages. But, just half way into their holiday, booked with Olympic Holidays, Mr Lawton and Miss O'Brien began to experience nausea, stomach cramps, diarrhoea and vomiting. Barry Stuart Lawton and partner Cheryl O'Brien have been awarded £4,200 in compensation after their 'recuperating' holiday to Sharm El Sheikh turned into a nightmare . Mr Lawton witnessed flies on food being served in the restaurant, bugs in cakes, dirty plates, cutlery and cups and hot plate lids stained with pre-existing food. Hot food was allegedly left to go cold and Mr Lawton said there was cross-contamination of meat on the cheese platter. Mr Lawton complained to the hotel representative who suggested medical advice be obtained from the local pharmacist. Regrettably, the couple's illnesses continued to persist up to four weeks after the initial symptoms began. After consulting with their GP on return home, it was confirmed they had both contracted gastroenteritis – an inflammation of the intestines commonly caused by viral, bacterial or parasitic infections. The couple were diagnosed with gastroenteritis on their return from the Al Diwan Resort in Sharm El Sheikh . Mr Lawton claims he 'repeatedly saw staff walking into the kitchen while smoking and chefs' uniforms were dirty and stained'. He said: 'The barbeque area was covered with food and fat that then attracted flies and had not been cleaned since the previous night.' Following their complaints, Mr Lawton and Miss O'Brien, who live in Upper Gillingham, Kent, were later moved to a three-star hotel nearby. Mr Lawton added: 'When we arrived at the Falcon Nama Star, I thought I had walked into a five-star hotel and not a three-star.

"Singer FKA twigs has proven just what a lucky man her boyfriend Robert Pattinson is, posing topless in a tasteful, yet risque, cover shoot for fashion favorite V Magazine. The British-born musician, real name Tahliah Barnett, showcases her enviable figure in the striking images, while wearing nothing other than a pair of nude panties and a selection of chunky silver necklaces. And while the 26-year-old does not discuss her relationship with Pattinson, 28, who she has been dating for four months, in the accompanying interview with The New Yorker's Sasha-Frere Jones, she does touch on the way in which she feels she has grown as a woman in recent months. Bold and beautiful: Singer FKA twigs appears on the cover of V Magazine's New Music Issue this month . 'I feel more like a woman': The 26-year-old revealed in the interview that she has felt more able to embrace her own femininity after seeing men who are comfortable with their own . Speaking about her background as a ballet dancer, FKA explains that she feels she has only really been able to grow as a woman after seeing male dancers embrace their own femininity. 'I wrote a song, a month ago,' she says. 'I can't remember the lyrics. It was something like ""boys growing boys growing girls into women"". 'I've felt more like a woman since I've met these men so in touch with their femininity. They teach me how to be a woman, how to feel, how to have class and poise, and how to feel good about myself. 'I'll dance for them and I'll dance for myself, as thanks.' But while she doesn't mention 28-year-old Pattinson in the piece, it is clear that the couple's relationship is growing more serious. So in love: FKA has been dating Twilight star Robert Pattinson for four months . According to a recent report in the Mail on Sunday, the pair spent Christmas at the home of Pattinson's parents in Barnes, West London, with a source close to the actor claiming Mr and Mrs Pattinson made it very clear that they prefer FKA to their son's ex-girlfriend and former Twilight co-star Kristen Stewart. 'FKA is not as clean-cut,' said a family friend. 'But that makes her more fun, and Robert can get very serious.' While her relationship with her actor beau has seen her launched into the public spotlight in recent months, the former ballerina has been careful to distance herself from Pattinson in a professional sense - and has done everything she can to make a name for herself within the music industry in her own right. Indeed, when it comes to her own unique style of music and performance, FKA is very clear about the way in which she wants her music to be seen and even hit out at the people who insist on labeling her music 'alternative' during her V Magazine interview. 'If I say ""alternative red"" to you, it's not red, is it?' she explains. '""Alternative R&B is patronizing to R&B. Baring all: American musician Tinashe also posed topless for her own V Magazine cover . In good company: FKA's fellow Brits Sam Smith (L) and Jessie Ware (R) were also chosen to appear on the cover of this month's New Music Issue . 'R&B is R&B - it doesn't need an alternative. There are plenty of artists now experimenting with electronic music, manipulating sounds.' Despite her confident cover shoot the musician, whose critically-acclaimed debut album LP1 reached number one in both the US and UK, revealed to Vogue last month that she doesn't enjoy having her photo taken. 'Sometimes I really struggle having my picture taken,' she told the publication, after being named their next Style Breakout Star. Luckily, her shoot in V Magazine's New Music Issue saw her joined by three other successful chart-toppers: Sam Smith, Tinashe, and Jessie Ware, all of whom shot their own covers for the publication, with American musician Tinashe also opting to pose topless.","The 26-year-old took part in one of four different cover shoots for the publication's New Music Issue .

"Hospital chiefs have told staff not to allow deliveries from a new Pizza Hut - despite it being built in their own multi-storey car park. The move was revealed a month after the chain opened just 100 yards from the walls of Derriford Hospital in Plymouth, Devon. Staff were instructed to tell patients they could not order from the fast food restaurant, with bosses steering them towards 'healthier' sandwiches in the hospital's smoothie bar instead. Baffling: Chiefs at Plymouth's Derriford Hospital have told patients and staff not to order from a new Pizza Hut - in its own car park 100 yards away. The shop's Simon Wright (pictured) slammed the advice . But the advice in a weekly staff newsletter has baffled the shop's franchisee Simon Wright. He insisted there had never been a similar problem elsewhere in Britain and 'a large part of our business comes from the hospital'. The outlet had its grand opening last month on land which the Plymouth Hospitals Trust sold to regeneration firm Wharfside in 2006. The developer built a 600-space multi-storey car park, which the hospital now pays an annual fee to lease back, and included units for several shops on the same site. Wharfside's deal with Pizza Hut for one of the units - the first food shop to open - was agreed last year, and a Subway is soon due to open on the same site. The hospital's 'ban' was revealed in a staff newsletter. It said: 'The Trust has agreed with Pizza Hut and Wharfside that deliveries by Pizza Hut into the hospital will not be allowed. 'Please ensure this message is passed on to both staff and patients.' Stuffed Trust: The hospital authority which runs Derriford (pictured) sold the 16-acre parcel of land in 2006, and now cannot control which shops open there despite it being used for the hospital's own car park . Despite the objections of Mr Wright, a hospital spokesman stood by the edict. She said: 'As part of our work around food hygiene and the control of visitors into clinical areas, delivery of takeaway food is not encouraged. 'The Trust maintains its commitment to improving healthy eating options for staff, patients and visitors. 'The hospital opened a Juice Bar in the main entrance of the hospital in March this year, which serves a range of smoothies and fresh juices alongside a healthier range of sandwiches, salads and pre-prepared fresh fruit pots. 'The Trust's main restaurant on Level 7 serves a variety of wholesome meals such as carvery, fish dishes, vegetarian options and has a daily salad bar. A hospital in Surrey came under heavy fire when it emerged it had paid £24,000 to close a Burger King branch inside its own walls. Croydon University Hospital had hosted the fast food chain in its entrance for 14 years, sparking the ire of health campaigners. It finally managed to close the outlet - which was next to posters promoting healthy eating - in 2011 and replace it with a Costa Coffee branch. But in order to terminate the contract it had to pay £24,000 to Compass UK, the company operating the fast food franchise. Croydon Health Service admitted the 'world had changed' since it signed the original deal in 1997. 'The League of Friends shop, located in the main entrance at the hospital stocks a full range of fresh fruit and pre-packed healthy snacks such as nuts and raisins. 'Warren's Bakery Cafe in the main entrance also has a range of healthy soups, sandwiches, salads and fresh fruit on its menu. 'The proposed M&S Simply Food unit planned for outside the Trust's main entrance will further expand the range of healthier choices available to staff, patients and visitors.' She added: 'The retail units are separately leased by Wharfside and the hospital has no say who leases these spaces.' The new shop is run by Simon Wright, who has worked in the business since 2001. 'I don't know if this has come from the trust or someone internally off their own back,' he said. 'Maybe someone is not happy with us delivering within the hospital? 'In other parts of the UK it is no problem whatsoever and the business is essential. 'A large part of our business comes from the hospital and I don't know where this has come from.' He added he had never agreed to restrict deliveries to the hospital and any such claims had been 'fabricated'. 'We have been trying to contact the lady who wrote the newsletter with no success and find out what it's all about,' he added. 'There is definitely no agreement and I believe somebody at the hospital has been misled.' Plymouth Hospitals NHS Trust, which runs Derriford, is facing a £13million financial black hole this year. It received a boost to its finances when it sold the 16-acre site to Wharfside for £12.8million in 2006, and hopes to pocket about £100,000 a year for ten years when M&S opens in its entrance.","Memo written a month after chain opened at Derriford Hospital, Plymouth .

"A mob that killed a bull with machetes, rocks, knives and sticks during a festival in a northern Colombian town has incited a new debate about animal rights in the country. Dozens of people in Turbaco, near Colombia's northern coast, chased the bull, taunting and harrying the animal until it was exhausted, then slowly beat it to death. Amid calls for a fresh debate on traditions involving animal cruelty, activists and even some government officials are demanding legal action after footage of the killing emerged. Death in the afternoon: Youths stomp and beat an exhausted bull during a festival in the northern Colombian town of Turbaco, an incident which has sparked calls in the country for a new debate on animal cruelty . Sport or tragedy? The bull was killed during a 'corraleja', a kind of anything-goes amateur bullfight held in some parts of Colombia, in which anyone is allowed to take part . One-sided: The video footage, shot from the stands of a large bullring, shows dozens of have-a-go toreros who pelt the bull with stones and bottles, kick it and even, reports claim, cut it with machetes . The killing took place during a 'corraleja', a kind of amateur bullfight held in some towns in the South American country. Anyone is allowed to take part. The video footage, shot from the stands of a large bullring, shows dozens of have-a-go toreros taunting and chasing the bull, flashing makeshift capes in front of its face to confuse and infuriate it. Soon it is exhausted and injured and unable to move any longer. But unlike the traditional bullfight, here there is no swift kill with a sword aimed directly at the heart. Instead the animal is surrounded by dozens of baying youths who pelt it with stones and bottles, kick it and even, according to reports, cut it with machetes. Some even jump on its body. Public Defender Jorge Otarola called the images 'Dante-esque, painful and inhumane'. 'The state’s intervention is needed because, even though traditions should be respected, they must be updated to reduce the suffering of animals,' he told The Associated Press. Colombia's Environment Minister Gabriel Vallejo also intervened. He told Colombia's Blu Radio: 'I have to say it is totally barbaric, where people with sticks, stones and knives, and with utter cruelty, kill the bull.' The Ministry of Culture released a statement calling for severe punishments for the 'barbaric' incident and demanding a public debate about whether such festivals should be allowed to continue. Free for all: Dozens of people fill the bullring as the frightened animal runs around in confusion . Tradition: Colombian law bans mistreatment of animals, but exempts traditions like bullfighting . The justice ministry said it was starting an investigation to identify those responsible. But Turbaco Mayor Myron Martinez defended the festival, saying it was a local tradition. 'In ""corraleja"" festivals there are always injuries, there are always animals beaten and horses killed,' Martinez told AP. 'These are the kinds of incidents that form part of the traditions and customs of such festivals.' The bull’s death has reopened the debate over bullfighting in Colombia. In the capital, Bogota, bullfighting has been banned, but such events remain popular in other parts of the country. And it may be a long time before a lasting change. Although Colombian law bans the mistreatment of animals, it exempts rodeos, bullfights and corraleja-type events which are deeply rooted in folk tradition.","Incident sparks fresh debate about animal rights and cruelty in Colombia .

"The recreation of one of the most famous moments from the First World War by Sainsbury's helped the supermarket's 2014 Christmas advert be named the most viewed in the UK. Britain's third biggest supermarket beat John Lewis's Monty the penguin, with its 'creative interpretation' of Christmas Day 1914 when British and German soldiers laid down their weapons and met in no man's land. The supermarket chain reconstructed the trenches scene to celebrate their 20 years of support for the Royal British Legion, which runs the annual poppy campaign. Magic moment: A British and a German soldier meet in No Man's Land on Christmas Day in Sainsbury's festive advert. The controversial advert was named the most watched in the UK . But the advert was marred with some controversy, while some called it moving and brilliant others branded it an 'exploitive way for big business to advertise itself. The Sainsbury's commercial had 16.6 million views globally on YouTube by the end of 2014 and John Lewis had 22.1 million, the Guardian reported. However, the video sharing website ranked Sainsbury's Christmas the most views in the UK, but did not give the figures to support this. The John Lewis advert, featuring Monty the Penguin, was the second most watched commercial in the UK, despite having the most global views . The supermarket's winning ad followed a British soldier as he hears enemy troops singing Silent Night in German and ventures into 'no man's land' before soldiers from both sides join him and shake hands. 1.Sainsbury’s – Christmas Day Truce 1914 . 2.John Lewis – Monty the Penguin . 3.Nike Football – Winner Stays . 4.Nike Football - The Last Game . 5.Always – Like A Girl . 6.Three – Sing It Kitty . 7.Marks & Spencer – Follow The Fairies . 8.Save The Children – Most Shocking Second a Day . 9.Guinness – Sapeurs . 10.Pepsi Max – Human Loop the Loop .

Marks and Spencer Christmas offering came in at the number seven spot, with just 3.2million views. Two playful fairies, named Magic and Sparkle, were the stars of the retailer's advertising campaign. A spokesman for Sainsbury's said: ‘We’ve been delighted with the overwhelmingly positive response we’ve had from customers and colleagues to our portrayal of the 1914 Christmas Day Truce, and that it has been so popular on YouTube. 'As you probably know, we partnered with The Royal British Legion, in the 20th year of our relationship with them, to ensure we told the story with authenticity and respect and to help raise awareness and additional funds for the important work they do.

"A knife throwing troupe has discovered the hard way that live television may not be the best way to broadcast their act after a blundering performance on a Lithuanian reality TV show. Performing on Lithuania's Got Talent, a studio audience, judges and viewers at home watched on in horror as a knife thrower first cut open his partner's left hand, narrowly avoided cutting his right, then hit him in the head during the dangerous performance. The knife thrower's assistant, who appears calm but utterly terrified, was required to stand in front of a wooden board as the knife thrower threw blades at him with varying degrees of success. The knife thrower's assistant grimaces moments after a knife - which was supposed to hit the watermelon - hit him in the head and became stuck in the wooden board . Here he is pictured earlier in the performance when the knife sliced open his left hand as he held up a playing card . It was during the second part of the act that the stunt began to go awry. The knife thrower's assistant, dressed in a ceremonial military costume, holds playing cards to the left and right of his head while his partner attempts to pin them to the board with the knives. First, a blade is flung into the card at the perfect spot, lodging itself in the board inches above the assistant's hand. But with wildly inconsistent accuracy, his second attempt lands inches too low - at the exact spot the card is being held by the assistant -  slicing open his fingers. Ever the professional, the assistant grimaces and remains standing in place. Despite the  potential for serious injury, the act continues and the knife thrower comes perilously close to repeating the blunder with his assistant's right hand. But the closest shave comes during the show's finale, for which a watermelon is placed inches above the assistant's head. After several near misses, the knife thrower's assistant looked increasingly concerned . After the first knife lands too high and misses the fruit completely, the thrower over adjusts. The crowd gasps when his second shot hits his assistant in the head - centimeters away from lodging itself in his eye or the top of his head. The performance then ends, and while the group stand together to listen to the judges' verdict, the knife thrower can be seen trying to inconspicuously wipe blood off the stage with his shoe.","The knife throwing group was performing on a Lithuanian reality TV show .

"Mother Trudy Collins, 44, stole her daughter's £20,000 inheritance after convincing her that she would keep her bank card and pin number safe . She had been saving it to pay for her wedding and a deposit on her first home. Denvar Bathie, 23, had put aside £20,000, inherited from her late father, for her big day and resolved not to use a penny of it until then. So she was devastated a year later when she discovered her mother had stolen the money and spent it on herself. Trudy Collins, 44, had persuaded her daughter to hand over her bank card and PIN – claiming she was helping Miss Bathie avoid any temptation of using it. But she embarked on a spending spree, using the inheritance to pay for luxury holidays, shopping trips and hotels. Over a year, Collins accessed Miss Bathie’s account 173 times, spending almost £20,000. She was caught out during a trip to Egypt in June last year when her daughter’s bank became suspicious and queried the high number of withdrawals. Miss Bathie told Preston Crown Court how she ‘collapsed in tears’ when she realised the extent of her mother’s betrayal. ‘I trusted my mother more than anyone else and I believed her every word,’ she said in a statement. ‘But the trust disappeared there and then. I was betrayed and heartbroken. ‘She went behind my back spending my savings which was my future … my mother came up with the idea [of keeping the bank card] so I wouldn’t be tempted to spend it. Knowing how useless I was at saving, I handed it to her.’ Miss Bathie’s father Michael, who had split from Collins, died aged 45 in 2013, the court heard. He left a legacy of £90,000 to be shared between his three children. Miss Bathie opened a savings account for £20,000 of her £30,000 inheritance and then handed over her bank card to her mother for safekeeping in her attic. The bride-to-be added: ‘Sadly the card never went into the attic. It had its own place in Trudy’s purse the whole time and she had been using it for herself.’ Miss Bathie intended to use the money for a mortgage and her wedding in the Lake District. Bride-to-be Miss Bathie, 23, pictured above, was saving her inheritance to fund her wedding and to save up for a deposit on a  house . Emma Keogh, prosecuting, said: ‘Her mother suggested that she gave her the card, even saying “you will spend it”. Miss Bathie thought it was a good idea. She trusted her implicitly.’ But in June last year Miss Bathie got a call from the fraud department at NatWest bank, querying a payment to a cinema and an Amazon transaction. She confronted her mother who admitted she had taken the money but insisted she had every intention of paying it back. Miss Keogh added: ‘Denvar was completely shocked … As time progressed it is clear her mother was using the account as her own … to pay for whatever she needed.’ Collins, of Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria, claimed she had taken £8,000, saying she was ‘too embarrassed’ to ask for the money. Miss Bathie, pictured left outside Preston Crown Court and right taking a selfie, suspected nothing until she received a call from the bank . Collins was given a 12 month jail term suspended for two years by Recorder John Corless at Preston Crown Court (pictured above), who branded the theft a 'serious breach of trust' But police revealed she had stolen £19,310.06. Among the transactions were £890 to Monarch Air, £263 to On The Beach holidays, £448 in Selfridges and £179 on the Hilton International Hotel. Defence counsel Rosalind Emsley-Smith said Collins ‘lost the plot’ when her home was repossessed after the breakdown of her marriage and her ex-husband’s death. Collins was given a 12-month jail term suspended for two years with 150 hours of unpaid work and ordered to pay Miss Bathie £100. Recorder John Corless said: ‘This is indeed a tragic case and a serious breach of trust. Your daughter trusted you implicitly but you were using an account which was simply not yours.’","Denvar Bathie, 23, inherited £30,000 when her father died in 2013 .

"Jeremy Hunt and David Cameron tonight denied that the NHS was in crisis in a huge political row over the meltdown in A&E departments. The Tories accused Labour of ‘hypocrisy’ and ‘making capital’ out of today’s figures on emergency admissions, after shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said ‘crisis’ was the only appropriate way to describe the situation. Government MPs said the problems in the health service had their roots in Labour’s botched 2003 contract which allowed GPs to opt out of out-of-hours care, meaning people often have no choice but to go to A&E. Prime Minister David Cameron (pictured) said the problems in the NHS were short-term as he accused unions of trying to ‘scaremonger’ Government MPs said problems in the NHS had their roots in Labour’s botched 2003 contract which allowed GPs to opt out of out-of-hours care, meaning people often have no choice but to go to A&E (file picture) And the Liberal Democrats pointed out that A&E waiting times were much longer in Wales, where Labour is in control of the health service. Health Secretary Mr Hunt said that while hospitals were clearly under pressure, there was ‘hope’ behind the ‘disappointing figures’. And the Prime Minister said the problems were short-term as he accused unions of trying to ‘scaremonger’ after claiming the NHS was on the ‘brink of disaster’. Andrew Percy, a Conservative member of the Commons health select committee, said: ‘Labour are complete hypocrites to be making capital about this for three reasons. ‘First, they allowed GPs to opt out of responsibility for their patients out-of-hours, leading to an instant jump in people turning up at A&E. ‘Second, they cut 50,000 hospital beds while they were in power, meaning there is not enough capacity. And finally they failed to predict and plan for the demographic expansion, particularly of older, frailer people. ‘This triple whammy has had a huge effect on A&E services which Labour hasn’t apologised for.’ Health professionals warned of a crisis in the English NHS after figures yesterday showed just 92.6 per cent of patients were seen within four hours – notably below the 95 per cent target. The situation in the Labour-run Welsh NHS is even worse – with only 83.3 per cent meeting the target in November. Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham (pictured) said ‘crisis’ was the only appropriate way to describe the situation . Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt (pictured) said that while hospitals were clearly under pressure, there was ‘hope’ behind the ‘disappointing figures’ Mr Hunt said: ‘The NHS always has a difficult winter period but I think it’s very important to say that even despite all the pressures that we’re hearing about this morning, nine out of ten people who go to English A&Es are being seen and treated within four hours. 'That is a better performance than anywhere else in the United Kingdom.’ He added: ‘I think there is a bit more hope behind the disappointing figures – and they are disappointing – than perhaps some of the headlines today are suggesting.’ Mr Cameron admitted the NHS was under ‘pressure’, but insisted 2,500 more patients were being seen within four hours every day than four years ago. He added: ‘We’ve got a longer-term issue which is making sure there are named GPs in your local area which are responsible for every single frail, elderly person. 'A lot of the pressure on A&E is coming from frail, elderly people, often with many different health conditions, and the best place for them, frankly, is not A&E.

The Prime Minister accused Unison general secretary Dave Prentis of trying to ‘scaremonger’ after the union claimed the NHS was ‘on the brink of disaster’. Mr Cameron also attacked Labour’s stewardship of the Welsh NHS, telling Heart Wales radio: ‘Wales is performing worse than the rest of the United Kingdom. That’s not the fault of the doctors and nurses – they do a fabulous job. It’s the politicians in Cardiff that have let them down.’ Mr Burnham said: ‘I think in parts of the country, it is a crisis. We have ambulances taking hours to arrive; we’ve got record numbers of people on trolleys, record numbers of emergency admissions through A&E. ‘And hospitals in six places saying they simply can’t accept people any more. I’d say when the health service can’t function and it has to make a declaration of that kind, that is a crisis.’","Jeremy Hunt and David Cameron deny NHS is in crisis amid political row .

"Naseeb Ellahi (pictured) has admitted killing Jasmyn Chan who was fatally injured after being struck by his car . A man has admitted killing a 14-year-girl who was fatally injured after being struck by his car in a horrific hit-and-run road smash. Jasmyn Chan pushed her friend - who cannot be named - out of the way of an oncoming vehicle driven by Naseeb Ellahi, before being struck herself. Despite desperate attempts by paramedics to save her, the teenager died in hospital after the incident, which happened just yards from her home on Friday, May 9 in Sheffield, South Yorkshire. Ellahi left the scene and was arrested almost a week after the schoolgirl was hit by his car. Today, 32-year-old Ellahi pleaded guilty to causing death by dangerous driving, causing serious injury by dangerous driving, failing to stop at the scene and failing to report. He pleaded not guilty to two further charges of causing death by driving while uninsured and causing death by driving while unlicensed. Members of Jasmyn’s family watched from the public gallery at the court as an emotional Ellahi entered his pleas. Some of her family were in tears after the shock plea. Ellahi, who lives in Birmingham but formerly lived in Sheffield, was arrested on May 15, nearly a week after the fatal smash. More than a thousand mourners attended Jasmyn’s funeral earlier this year. Family, friends and well-wishers stood in complete silence as Jasmyn's white coffin arrived in a horse-drawn hearse. The hearse was followed by family and friends being driven in two limousines and a vintage motorised hearse carrying floral tributes. The coffin was carried into the crematorium to the Enrique Iglesias song 'Hero', followed by her family - each carrying a white rose. Mourners who had been patiently waiting outside began to file in, but the huge crowd meant many stood in the sun and listened to the short service on loudspeakers.

A petition signed by more than 12,000 people called for road safety improvements at the spot where  the youngster lost her life. The road safety campaign prompted Sheffield Council to promise to invest in improvements which will include ‘Jazzy’s Crossing’. The family of Jasmyn, who was from Sheffield, have also set up a new charity foundation in her memory. Ellahi was granted bail and will be sentenced at the end of the month.

"Britain's economic recovery has put David Cameron on course to remain Prime Minister after the General Election, investment bank Goldman Sachs has told clients. In a note to investors, Goldman analyst Kevin Daly said strong economic growth and an improvement in household incomes would help the Tory cause. But he cautioned that the political situation in the UK was unpredictable, with no party looking like securing an overall majority. Keeping the crown: Goldman Sachs predicts that David Cameron, pictured at the first Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, will win the election thanks to strong economic growth and an improvement in household incomes . ‘It is not an exaggeration to say that the outcome to this election is more uncertain than any in a hundred years,’ he said. ‘The likelihood of any party gaining an overall majority appears low, but we think the Conservative Party is marginally more likely than Labour to win the most seats and lead the next government.’ Mr Daly said the ‘unusually wide gap between the Conservatives and Labour in terms of perceived economic competence’ echoed the situation in 1992, when the Tories defied the polls to claim victory. He went on: ‘Our economic forecasts – relatively strong growth, with a significant improvement in household disposable income – provide a backdrop that is likely to be favourable for the incumbent parties.’ Unsure: Goldman Sachs' analyst told clients that the outcome to the 2015 General Election is 'more uncertain than any in a hundred years' The investment bank prides itself on the accuracy of its predictions, but Tory strategists are taking no chances and are said to be making contingency plans to fight a second general election this year. Danny Alexander, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, will be confirmed tomorrow as the Lib Dems’ main economics spokesman in a major snub to Business Secretary Vince Cable, who filled the role during the last election campaign. Senior figures warn that another coalition with the Liberal Democrats could be torpedoed by backbench MPs and, with polls pointing to a hung parliament, party sources say a unit has secretly begun work on a second election campaign for a vote that could take place within months of the one in May. Even some senior ministers are known to be privately of the view that Mr Cameron should attempt to run a minority government, with a quick second general election, if the Conservatives again miss a majority but end up as the largest party.","Goldman Sachs predicts a Conservative win in 2015 General Election .

"The population of London is on the verge of reaching an all-time high, finally exceeding the pre-Second World War peak of just over 8.615m. The Greater London Authority estimates that the city will soon welcome its 8,615,246th inhabitant, the highest population since the eve of the war in 1939. As the population figure is based on GLA forecasts, experts do not when the exact peak will be - but some say it could even be today. Population peak: The number of people living in London is on the verge of reaching an all-time high, finally exceeding the pre-Second World War peak of just over 8.615m . The last peak in London's population was on the eve of the Second World War in 1939. Pictured: People enjoying lunch at the open air restaurant at Lincoln's Inn's Fields in 1939 . Statisticians say the record-breaking Londoner is likely to be born in the first few weeks of 2015, in one of the capital's outer boroughs where population growth rates are highest. The news represents an extraordinary turnaround for London, which lost more than 2million people in the world war and once had a population of just 6.6 million. The population is now forecast to continue at an annual rate of around 100,000 - the equivalent of a new borough every three years - with the population set to hit 10m by 2030. Experts have warned that this could add massive strains to already stressed infrastructure, particularly housing and transport. The biggest pressure is expected to be on housing, with an estimated 42,000 new homes needed every year to keep pace with population growth. Professor Tony Travers, director of research group LSE London, told the Evening Standard: 'This is both good news and bad. On the one hand it is far better to be living in a city that people want to come to rather than a declining city. How London has changed: This map shows how London has expanded since 1939 . Age: This graph shows how the age of London's population has remained rather steady since 1939, but that we now have fewer teenagers and more pensioners . 'But there is always the risk that people will feel there is not enough space, not enough transport, too much congestion. 'Such a large population inevitably means substantial investment in roads, railway, hospitals and all the elements that make a city work. 'Clearly, there is not enough investment going into London at the moment.' Barney Stringer, director of planning consultancy Quod, said the peak comes after the city lost a quarter of its population - the equivalent of the inhabitants of Birmingham, Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast all leaving. Writing about it on his blog, he said: 'London is back to its peak, and while it has changed in so many ways, it faces some of the same challenges. Country of birth: This graph shows how many more people from other countries now live in London, compared to 1939 . The tenure of London homes has also changed, with many more owning homes, despite the increase in housing prices . 'Just like 75 years ago we have extraordinarily fast population growth with commuting patterns and housing pressure spilling way beyond the city’s boundaries.' The last population peak came after two decades of massive growth. But it began to fall almost immediately after the outbreak of war in September. This was largely due to evacuations and conscription. Even after the war, the population continued to decline, amid encouragement from planners for families to relocate. The last time London's population peaked was in 1939, on the eve of the Second World War. But how different was the UK's capital city back then? Currently, 13 per cent of people living in the UK are London inhabitants, whereas the London population accounted for 18 per cent of the UK in 1939. At that time, London was overwhelmingly white - only 2.7 per cent had been born abroad. Today, around 37 per cent of Londoners were born abroad. This shows pre-war areas in blue and post-war areas in red - the shape of London has not really changed . In 1939, with no NHS and heavy smog, life expectancy was 62. Today, Londoners can expect to live to 82. The population pyramid shows London now has fewer teenagers and more pensioners than in 1939. There are also have more adult men, due to a 'missing generation' in 1939, after the First World War. In 1939, statutory education only went up to age 14, so most of London's  secondary schools had yet to be built. Before the war, only 2 per cent of people went to university and almost all of them were men. In London today, 43 per cent of people go onto university and the majority of them are women. Although the number of people working in London has not changed greatly, the industries which cater for those jobs have. The newly-built areas of London in 1939 in blue, with the newly-built areas of London today in red . In 1939, around one in three people worked in manufacturing. Now 90 per cent of these manufacturing jobs have gone and most people now work in industries that barely existed in 1939. These include 250,000 jobs in IT, with another 250,000 working in hotels and restaurants. St Paul's was the tallest building in the capital In 1939. Now St Paul's is only the 41st tallest building in the London. The tallest building is The Shard. House prices have also grown extraordinarily. In 1939, the average cost of a home was the equivalent of three years' salary; now it is around 16 years.

"She might be an Olympic silver medallist with high hopes for Rio 2016, but even Zara Phillips struggles to mount her horse sometimes. The Queen's granddaughter ran into difficulties as she attempted to pull herself into the saddle of a horse lent to her during the Magic Millions Barrier Draw event on Queensland's Gold Coast. Ever the professional, the 33-year-old not only managed to mount up but went on to put on a stellar show for the excited crowd that had gathered round to watch. Scroll down for video . Up she goes: Zara Phillips seemingly struggled to pull herself onto her horse as she prepared to participate in the opening of the Magic Millions On the Gold Coast, Australia, on Tuesday . Dressed in a pale blue shirt and grey leggings, the royal was taking part in a gallop down the beach during the prestigious Magic Millions race meeting which began on Monday.

Along with racing, the event also hosts one of the country’s most popular thoroughbred horse sales, although unlike her husband, who owns a racehorse of his own, she didn't appear tempted to buy. Zara will also present the winner of the Racing Women prize, which aims to encourage more women into the sport, with a sizeable cheque and trophy. According to sources, Zara herself was offered a ‘small fortune’ to become an ambassador for the event, while her trip has been bankrolled by Magic Millions co-founder Gerry Harvey.

"This is a good-looking city - even in chilly, thickly grey December. Copenhagen's cyclists are out in stylish force, despite the icy temperature. There is not a Lycra-clad limb in sight and barely a helmet. Women pedal in heeled boots and snug woollen hats. No one locks their parked bikes. I haven't a clue how they find them outside the Central Station, where there are hundreds to choose from. All is bright on the harbourfront: Copenhagen's Nyhavn district is a popular corner of the city . 'It is Danish culture,' says my non-Danish taxi driver, shrugging his shoulders. This must be why many of the men maintain beards, and stalls by smart Nyhavn canal do a brisk trade selling knitted accessories. I am exploring on foot, with frequent stops for potent gluhwein or piping coffee and those delicious open sandwiches on chewy brod everyone eats in The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo. Copenhagen is expensive, especially in winter, when you can't help but be drawn into a cosy cafe, glowing restaurant, bustling pub or twinkly shop. The city is decked out prettily - most famously at the Tivoli Gardens (billions of lights, whooshing rides, wooden chalets and fireworks on a Friday). A place for reflection: The city's Tivoli Gardens have a magical quality once the dusk descends . But it is not warm, so we only glimpse it through the glittery gates. Meanwhile, our hotel, the eco-friendly (don't let that put you off - it is comfortable, except for the dishcloth-like bath towels) Axel Guldsmeden, is around the corner offering complimentary tea, cake and hot wine in the sheepskin-swagged lobby. Staying here, it is difficult to muster your get-up-and-go - particularly after the healthy but hearty breakfast buffet, where you can opt for raw fennel salad with scrambled eggs. But peel yourself away, because there is much to see and do. In the evening you needn't venture far. Fiskebaren, an industrial looking fish bar, is in the nearby meatpacking district and serves freshest fish with a twist - cauliflower, moss and granola sauce anyone? You can combine culture with shopping at the Danish Design Museum, where Furniture For The People! is on until January 11, celebrating the centenary of the birth of furniture designer Borge Mogensen, who believed design could help to 'frame' a good life. Best wheels forward: Copenhagen is a city of cyclists - if you can remember where you left your bike . The sleek 2213 sofa he made for his own home is known as the 'embassy sofa' because it is said to be found in almost every Danish consulate around the world. There is plenty on show by another world-renowned Dane, Hans Wegner. His design philosophy 'we shall play - serious play' is evident in his chairs: they are universally beautiful while being practical. Take the famous Peacock chair with its flattened spindles, which are far more comfortable than the traditionally rounded versions. The shop sells design books and geometric paper decorations by the Copenhagen company Livingly. Look in on the Russian Orthodox Church on the same street, Bredgade. Its sleet-grey marble interior is magnificent, and itsdome rivals Rome's Pantheon. For further inspiration, there are plenty of desirable design shops in streets around the King's Garden (also known as the Rosenborg Castle Gardens). Lighting up our lives: Copenhagen is fabulous during high summer, but has a twinkling quality in the winter . Gubi has an artistically curated collection of Sixties-style pieces and an elegant Grand Piano sofa in a deep bottle green (please, Father Christmas). Cross King's Garden and you'll arrive at the neat Rosenborg Castle, a 17th-century palace. This is also a good spot from which to admire the surrounding streets, their houses painted in brick reds and warm greys. In the nearby Ostre Anlaeg Park you will find six museums (including the castle, where you can gaze at the crown jewels) and - I am thrilled to report - at least one red squirrel. The Hirschsprung Museum houses the Danish art collection of tobacco manufacturer Heinrich Hirschsprung. It is a compact gallery with some lovely pieces. The works from Skagen, Denmark's northernmost beachside town, where artists such as Kroyer congregated to paint outdoors, capture the long summer days and light dancing off the water. There are antique shops and tempting jewellers Signen Just on Stockholmsgade, next to the Hirschsprung. Come in: Copenhagen's shops - especially on the commercial drag of Amagertorv - have a year-round allure . And the tastiest sandwich of my trip in Aamanns Smorrebrod on Oster Farimagsgade, nearby. With toppings such as salmon and pickled fennel or Danish blue cheese with plum gel and roasted hazelnuts, you can almost forgive the price tag (around £6 a slice). They offer punchy home-brewed schnapps, which will send you back into the cold with a swing. The interior is quietly elegant, with pearly marble pendant lights and dainty porcelain tea cups by Anne Black. Like the rest of Copenhagen, it looks effortless. Or perhaps that's the trick. Rooms at the Axel Guldsmeden start from £105 a night room only (www.guldsmedenhotels.com).

"Just months ago she was scratching out a living singing and dancing on trains for a few rupees from commuters. But now Madhu Bai Kinnar is leading her community as India's first transgender mayor - a dramatic election result that upends cultural mores in the traditionally conservative country. Kinnar won the election in Raigarh in the central state of Chhattisgarh on Sunday, beating her rival from Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) by more than 4,500 votes. Scroll down for video . Ground breaking: Madhu Bai Kinnar, centre, has become India's first-ever transgender mayor after abandoning her life of singing and dancing for change to put herself forward to represent her community . 'People have shown faith in me': Kinnar, who is a member of the Dalit caste previously known as the 'untouchables', put herself forward for election when she was asked to represent her community . Third gender: Often known as 'hijras' in South Asia, transgenders are classified as people who have had sex change operations or who regard themselves as the opposite of their born gender . Television pictures showed the 35-year-old draped in a saree and with a large red bindi on her forehead, folding her hands and greeting supporters who placed marigold garlands around her neck amid strobing camera flashes.

I consider this win as love and blessings of people for me. I’ll put in my best efforts to accomplish their dreams,' Kinnar said. 'It was the public support that encouraged me to enter the poll fray for the first time and because of their support only, I emerged as the winner.' Kinnar's win comes nine months after India's top court ruled that transgenders be legally recognised as gender-neutral. Often known as 'hijras' in South Asia, transgenders are classified as people who have had sex change operations or who regard themselves as the opposite of their born gender. Convincing win: Kinnar won the election in Raigarh in the central state of Chhattisgarh on Sunday, beating her rival from Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) by more than 4,500 votes . Activists say there are hundreds of thousands of transgender people in India, but because they were not legally recognized, they faced ostracism, discrimination, abuse and forced prostitution. Just last month India's first transgender newsreader said she thought all transgenders in the country should be helped to have gender realignment surgery. Padmini Prakash, 30, appears on TV every evening to present a news show on the Tamil-language Lotus TV Channel, in the city of Coimbatore, southern India. ‘We’re born into the wrong body, it’s not our fault,’ she said. ‘I know so many transgenders who are struggling to pay for surgery. Their lives are frozen in time because of the costs involved. 'This is not our fault; free surgery should be available for all. It should be our right, along with counselling and guidance classes and education on sexual diseases.

"Resplendent in a red and blue sari with her hair twisted into an elaborate plait, Bakul looks like any other teenage girl at first glance. But while she might have similar tastes to other teens, her life in the Bangladeshi capital, Dhaka, is very different. For Bakul, although just 17 years old, has already been married for two years after being forced to wed a rickshaw driver named Romy when he threatened to end his own life if she didn't. Child: Although illegal in Bangladesh, Bakul was married when she was just 15 and now has a daughter, Jui . 'They said he’d commit suicide if I didn’t run away with him,' she explains, as she sits with her eight-month-old daughter, Jui, who fidgets in her arms. Since the wedding, life has been hard with Bakul forced to swap going to school for days spent doing chores and taking care of her child. Worse, Romy, 21, has proved to be a less than stellar husband, frequently leaving his wife and child to survive on the pittance he gives them from his wages of 400 taka (£38) a month. 'He . spends more than he earns, and usually doesn’t give me money,' explains Bakul, who has lost weight since her wedding thanks to Romy's reluctance to provide adequate funds for food. 'Most of . our money goes on food,' she adds. 'I really regret getting married so young. I had so much freedom . before and didn’t have to care about my family and responsibilities.' Family: Bakul, pictured with her younger brother and sister, lives in Dhaka with husband Romy and baby Jui . The 20 countries where child weddings are most common and the percentage of girls involved . And she's not the only member of her family to marry young. Her mother Nashima was married off at just 13 years old and gave birth to Bakul as a 16-year-old. 'I was so young and I didn’t know my . husband, so I was afraid of him,' says Nashima. 'I didn’t know what it meant to have a . husband.' Shocking though they are, Bakul and Nashima's stories are far from unusual. 20 per cent of Bangladeshi girls marry before the age of 15, while 66 per cent wed before the age of 18 - even though both scenarios are illegal. Worldwide, one in nine girls are married off before the age of 15, with those that do running a significantly higher risk of dying in childbirth than women in their 20s. 'I have some friends who are going to . college now and I feel bad that I can’t go with them,' adds Bakul.

My teacher used to call me a singing . bird because I would always sing and dance.' Instead of school, Bakul's day is now dominated by chores and caring for her daughter, as well as trying to keep her husband happy. 'I . get up at 5am for morning prayers,' she explains. 'I start cooking and go to fetch . water from the tube well nearby. 'I look after the baby and make food and . then think about what food to make for lunch. By 7pm I try to finish . all of my cooking and household chores and then watch TV and watch soap . operas.' For Bakul, like many married girls, . watching soap operas is the most exciting part of her day. 'One . show I watch is Tapur Tupur,' she reveals. 'It’s the story of two sisters. I aspire to . be like Tupur, she’s the good one, the responsible wife and . daughter-in-law who helps everyone when they are in a bad situation.' Sadly, for Bakul and others like her, the chances of escaping her own 'bad situation' are vanishingly small. Global problem: India is the country with the highest number of child brides, this little girl among them . With more than 14 million child marriages each year, underage weddings are becoming an increasingly common problem worldwide but are seen more frequently in very religious countries such as Bangladesh. 'The causes of child marriage in Bangladesh are complex, and vary from context to context,' explains Kanwal Ahluwalia, a gender adviser at children's charity Plan UK. 'However, the practice is driven by boys being valued over girls and poverty, because poorer families try and marry their daughters off early due to economic pressures within the household and also because a dowry is cheaper if the girl is younger. 'Other factors include using child marriage as a way to control girls’ sexuality and prevent them marrying outside the arranged marriage system and weak enforcement of laws.' Currently, 20 per cent of Bangladeshi girls are married by the age of 15 while another 66 per cent have wed by the age of 18, even though both are illegal. 'National laws are not implemented,' adds Ahluwalia, 'possibly because of negative views and the influence of religious and traditional leaders.'

"A doctor who worked at the hospital at the centre of the Jimmy Savile scandal drugged and gang-raped a seriously ill girl of 12, a court heard yesterday. Michael Salmon assaulted the patient with two other men in a hospital bed as part of a string of attacks on young girls in the 70s and 80s. One former patient came to Salmon when she became pregnant aged 16 – and was raped at his home moments after he gave her an illegal backstreet abortion, it was said. Accused: Michael Salmon (pictured) denies 11 counts of indecent assault, three counts of rape and two counts of procuring an abortion . Others were allegedly molested as their parents sat unaware on the other side of a hospital screen in his consulting room. The 79-year-old appeared at Reading Crown Court yesterday where a judge heard how he abused his position as consultant paediatrician at Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Buckinghamshire – where disgraced DJ Savile is said to have abused scores of patients while carrying out charity work. Patients claimed Salmon also had a picture of his son with the Jim’ll Fix It star on his office wall. Jurors were told that although Salmon did not abuse victims ‘in concert’ with Savile, the sex attacks between 1973 and 1988 occurred at the same time as other offences. Prosecutor Miranda Moore QC, said the children’s doctor thought he was ‘bomb-proof’ after abusing at least eight teenage girls aged 11 to 18 at Stoke Mandeville and other hospitals in Buckinghamshire. She described how married Salmon took a naked photo of one patient, who was told to call him ‘Uncle Mike’. On another occasion the girl, who suffered from a genetic condition which causes tumours, was allegedly gang-raped when she was aged between 12 and 14. After slipping something in her drink that left her ‘woozy’ one night, Salmon and two other men raped her in a hospital room before taking her by wheelchair back to the ward, the court heard. Another 16-year-old seen by Salmon for digestive problems was allegedly assaulted during intimate medical examinations a number of times. Disgraced presenter: Stoke Mandeville Hospital, where Salmon worked, has been in the spotlight since the disclosures about the activities of Jimmy Savile (pictured) When she fell pregnant, Salmon is said to have lured her to his home where he carried out a painful abortion in his bedroom. Minutes later, he allegedly held her down on the bed and raped her, telling the teen ‘one favour deserves another’ as she wept and screamed in pain. A fortnight later, Salmon tried to rape her again after claiming she needed a further procedure, jurors were told. Miss Moore said: ‘He abused his position to undertake these assaults and got his own way, one by telling his victims he is doing her a favour, he clearly thought he was bomb-proof.’ His career at the hospital came to an end when he was convicted of three indecent assaults in 1990 and struck off the medical register, jurors were told. New alleged victims came forward after recent allegations emerged that Savile had abused children at Stoke Mandeville. Some told how they were fondled in a consulting room while he pretended to listen to their heart or carried out intimate examinations when there was no need, said Miss Moore. Many were also forced to kiss and hug the ‘creepy’ doctor at the end of each appointment, she added. One victim suffering severe migraines remembers a photo on the wall of the doctor’s son appearing on Jim’ll Fix it with Savile. ‘He told her there was a special button between her legs which she could touch to stop the migraines,’ said Miss Moore. Salmon also offered his patients the contraceptive pill and claimed he could check for breast cancer, it was said. When he was arrested, the retired doctor denied the offences, describing his victims as ‘gold diggers’, Miss Moore added. Salmon, who lives with his wife in Salisbury, Wiltshire, denies three rapes, 11 counts of indecent assault and two counts of using an instrument to procure a miscarriage. The trial continues.

"A problem that couldn't be solved with a bucket, a printer or even a trusty cardboard box led two US college students to create The Foot Hammock, a comfortable under-the-desk cradle for your feet. Matt Hulme and his housemate Brent Murray, both 21, launch a Kickstarter fundraising campaign on January 6 to raise $100,000, their first target, to launch full-scale production of their product. The Foot Hammock attaches to the underside of any desk, the place the designers argue we spend more time at than we sleep. Matt says we spend at least six hours a day at a desk, and gamers such as he and Brent can add an average of seven hours a week. A fleece version of The Foot Hammock, created by US college students Matt Hulme and Brent Murray . 'I tried a bunch of different solutions,' says Matt, who studies at Brigham Young University in Utah. 'I tried a cardboard box, that wasn't very comfortable. I tried my printer, and ended up breaking that.' He also tried a bucket under the desk to rest his feet on, pushing his feet against the wall and sitting on them - but none of those instinctive solutions cut it. So after testing 50 fabrics and 20 methods to attach the hammock to the desk, they came up with the final product. The hammock also comes in a mesh version intended for using while wearing shoes . The product attaches to the underside of any desk, says the designers . It's 'easy to take up and down' and 'totally adjustable', says Brent, who goes to Salt Lake Community College. There's a mesh version for shoes on, a fleece one intended to make bare feet feel snug and a heated version, just like a mini electric blanket for your feet. While there's not mention of the egonomics involved in their means of sitting, but they do say it's 'The most comfortable way to sit at your desk.'","Matt Hulme and Brent Murray, both 21, are launching Kickstarter campaign .

"Activists have hit out at Beyonce for 'supporting' animal cruelty after the superstar posed for a picture with a baby tiger while travelling with husband Jay Z and daughter Blue Ivy. The Drunk In Love singer has been sharing holiday snaps of her family's trip around Southeast Asia in recent days, but she has come under fire for riding an elephant and appearing in an image featuring a tiger being fed by a bottle. World Animal Protection's Dr Jan Schmidt-Burbach said tigers used for these photos are often crammed into tiny cages or chained to the floor for long periods. Scroll down for video . Animal activists have hit out at Beyonce after the superstar and her family posed for a photo with a baby tiger . Intrepid Travel slammed Beyonce on Twitter after she was pictured riding on an elephant in late December . 'Their health and well-being should not be sacrificed for a photo opportunity,' Dr Schmidt-Burbach said. 'When you look behind the scenes, holiday snaps like these support an industry that relies on animal cruelty.' Dr Schmidt-Burbach added that tigers are forcibly removed from their mothers to be fed artificially by tourists. 'All in all a far cry from their natural lives in the wild. But this sordid side of tourism is conveniently hidden from public view,' he said. This comes after tourism company Intrepid Travel slammed Beyonce on Twitter after she was pictured riding on an elephant in late December. 'Hi @Beyonce! We don't want to ruin your vacay, but elephant rides are not fun for elephants,' the company tweeted, and linked out to a blog post. World Animal Protection said tigers used for tourist photos are often crammed into tiny cages . Dr Jan Schmidt-Burbach said tigers' health and well-being should not be sacrificed for a photo opportunity . She added that holiday snaps support 'an industry that relies on animal cruelty' In the post Intrepid outlined its decision to stop offering elephant rides on any of its holidays. 'People often think that an elephant in captivity is domesticated, and so somehow it's OK to have them under human command,' the company wrote. 'But the reality is that [elephants] never have been domesticated like dogs or horses. Even if born in captivity, they are still a wild animal, and need to be ""broken"" to accept human control. 'There is much evidence that this process is exceptionally cruel.' Daily Mail Australia has contacted Beyonce for comment. A fan picture of Beyonce, Jay Z and Blue in Phuket shows Blue Ivy clad in traditional Thai attire and sitting next to a tiger as it is fed a bottle. Beyonce, 33, can be seen reaching over to stroke the cub while wearing a blue and gold outfit with an ornate bejeweled crown on her head.

"Boris Johnson today attacked the ‘multi-culti balkanisation’ of British society which means thousands of people do not speak English. The London Mayor insisted people who come to the UK should learn the language, stressing it is ‘is unbelievably easy to get the hang of’. He condemned the ‘disastrous approach’ of teaching children in other languages and the ‘nonsense’ of offering translated versions of official documents. London Mayor Boris Johnson insisted people who come to the UK should learn the language, stressing it is ‘is unbelievably easy to get the hang of’ Census figures from 2011 show there were 138,000 people in England and Wales who could not speak any English. Mr Johnson said it was ‘huge wasted opportunity’ for those people who are not able to ‘participate’ in the UK economy. Speaking on LBC radio, he said: ‘I think everybody in London, everybody who comes to work in our economy should be able to speak English.’ In an apparent attack on the last Labour government he went on: ‘We went through a long period in Britain of having kind of multi-culti balkanisation of our society and we thought it was a very good idea to teach kids in their own language in primary school classes in London. ‘I think that’s a disastrous approach, they should be in English. ‘As far as the mayoralty is concerned, we have dropped a lot of those ‘we’ll offer to translate our document into umpteen languages’. I think its complete nonsense.’ He said it was a ‘great shame’ that the last Labour government cut funding for teaching English. ‘We whacked some dosh back in from city hall because I think it’s an absolute priority.’ He said that in many parts of the capital whole communities do not speak English. ‘You go out into Tower Hamlets, places like that, you can find people who have been then there several generations who still don’t speak English. ‘One of the reasons is the media is so massive now but so disparate, so diffuse, that people can be tuned to their own communities and not fell the need to learn the common language of this city, of this country. ‘I think that is a great, great shame, it’s a huge wasted opportunity for them. ‘I think everybody in this country, particularly people working in our public services, should speak English.’ Boris Johnson insisted learning English was easy. He told LBC: 'It is not a difficult language. The great thing about English is it has so many, very short simple words. 'Our grammar is unbelievably simple, we have about twice as many words as French or German. 'English is unbelievably easy to get the hang of. Look at the way I can string these sentences together with barely a verb...' His remarks come after Ukip leader Nigel Farage suggested doctors who cannot speak 'very good English' should be banned from practising in the UK. The Ukip leader said it was 'scandalous' that not enough doctors and nurses were being trained in Britain, meaning thousands are brought in from overseas. However, he appeared unaware that two years ago the General Medical Council announced new checks to be carried out on the language skills of medical staff. All NHS doctors have to pass a language test. Mr Johnson added: ‘I’m amazed by reports that people cannot make themselves understood in English in this country to people working in the NHS. That is completely wrong. ‘I’m sure that the NHS will be taking steps to sort it out. I think that we should have a culture in this country that if you come here, you do as the Romans do and you learn English, you speak English. ‘I don’t mean this by the way in a sort of punitive sense. I’m not saying that everybody should be punished if they fail, this is a wasted opportunity for these companies. They are not able to participate. ‘This is a country where English has been spoken for many centuries. ‘I don’t want to be hostile towards speakers of other languages, other languages are beautiful things, but this is a country that happens to speak English and the way to participate in the London economy, to make a success of your life, my message to everybody whose English is a bit rusty, is go out, find a course for English speakers of another language, they are available. ‘I think that it is completely right that as part of the citizenship test that we have now in British is you should have a pretty good mastery of English. ‘I think everybody should be trying to get up to that standard.’","London Mayor insists people who come to the UK should learn language .

"John W Henry is fond of talking about The Liverpool Way. But in one respect, the owner is moving away from the club’s traditional blueprint for success this summer by buying players in bulk order. When Liverpool dominated the football landscape, they used to tweak their squad with one or two quality acquisitions each summer. Now, with Luis Suarez gone and Champions League due to return, manager Brendan Rodgers has been given the green light to go for quantity – understandable in one way, but risky in another. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Emre can and Lazar Markovic dazzling before linking up with Liverpool . New boy: Belgium centre forward Divock Origi has become Liverpool's sixth signing of the summer . Big spenders: Brendan Rodgers is busy using the money from the £75million sale of Luis Suarez to Barcelona . Settling in: Lazar Markovic (right), pictured in action against Olympiacos, arrived from Benfica for £20m . VIDEO New Liverpool signing eyes Premier League trophy . No Liverpool fan needs reminding that the last time one of their managers went on a trolley-dash, Graeme Souness ended up getting the sack after bringing in the likes of Paul Stewart, Julian Dicks, Neil Ruddock, Stig-Inge Bjornebye, David James, Nigel Clough and Torben Piechnik. Liverpool have already signed six new players this summer; Rickie Lambert, Adam Lallana, Emre Can and Lazar Markovic, Dejan Lovren and Divock Origi (who is heading back out on loan) from Lille. Manchester City made five purchases last summer to make the leap from second to first that Liverpool are trying to emulate, but only two of them became first-team regulars. Tottenham were more radical and signed seven first XI players to replace Gareth Bale. It didn’t work. Rodgers will argue a deeper squad is necessary with Liverpool back playing Champions League football for the first time since 2009. He has tried to minimise the risk of upheaval by ensuring some of his new players have Premier League experience. Lallana, Lambert and Lovren helped Southampton finish in the top half last. Even so, nobody knows how Benfica’s Lazar Markovic and Emre Can of Bayer Leverkusen – both aged 20 – will fare in their first season in the Premier League. Been there, done that: Dejan Lovren is one of only three new signings with Premier League experience . Good enough? Summer signing Emre Can (right), pictured in action against Olympiacos, is hoping to force his way into Liverpool's midfield next season . Gamble: Brendan Rodgers has opted to revamp his squad with a number of new additions this summer . RICKIE LAMBERT (£4million from Southampton) Premier League experience: Two seasons with Southampton, scoring 28 goals. Had turned 30 by the time he reached the top flight. ADAM LALLANA (£25miliion from Southampton) Premier League experience: Two seasons with Southampton where he played well enough to get an England call up. LAZAR MARKOVIC (£20million from Benfica) Premier League experience: None. EMRE CAN (£10million from Bayer Leverkusen) Premier League experience: None. DEJAN LOVREN (£20million from Southampton) Premier League experience: One season in England but did well at Southampton to earn a World Cup place for Croatia. DIVOCK ORIGI (£10million from Lille) Premier League experience: None. Last season, Liverpool’s thrilling form was based on an almost telepathic understanding between Daniel Sturridge, Raheem Sterling and Suarez. How can Lallana, for example, be on the same attacking wavelength when he returns from an injury lay-off? At 32, can Lambert adapt to the expectation at Anfield having spent the majority of his career in the lower leagues. In a sense, Rodgers has had no choice but to deal. Suarez wanted to go and Liverpool will have more games to play next season. But it would be foolish to say this isn’t a gamble. Mark Hughes struggled at Manchester City and QPR when he was backed by a wealthy owner who wanted lots of new players. Even when his successor at City, Roberto Mancini, bought in quality stars like Yaya Toure and David Silva in 2010 they didn’t challenge for the title, only hitting form at the end of the season to win the FA Cup. Chelsea’s manager at the time Carlo Ancelotti noted at the start of that season that City ‘didn’t have a clear identity’ as they shuffled the new signings about. City did add five new signings last summer and won the title; Fernandinho, Jesus Navas, Stevan Jovetic, Alvaro Negredo and Martin Demichelis. But only Fernandinho and Demichelis were regular players at the business end of the season. Expectation: Some fans have questioned whether 32-year-old Rickie Lambert can step up in the absence of Suarez next season . Tough start: Adam Lallana will need to bounce back from a six-week injury lay-off after joining for £25million . Rodgers’ biggest task will be to make sure last season’s successful players Sturridge, Sterling, Philippe Coutinho, Jordan Henderson, Jon Flanagan, Martin Skrtel and others don’t lose their mojo and have their form disrupted by an army of new signings. Last season’s biggest turnover happened at Sunderland. They signed 14 players and Paolo Di Canio got the sack after admitting: ‘There are many players and many different languages - it is difficult to speak to each other.’ Nobody is suggesting Rodgers will be as unprepared as the maverick Italian. But Liverpool fans who think more is naturally better may be in for a shock.","Liverpool have signed six players already this summer .

"Britain is still paying child benefit for 34,000 children who live elsewhere in the European Union, despite every major political party wanting to stop the handouts. David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg have repeatedly called for end to money being sent abroad by EU migrants working in the UK who leave their children in their home country, two-thirds of which are in Poland. But with any deal on scrapping the rules which force Britain to export benefits far from certain, it will continue to cost taxpayers up to £30million every year until an agreement can be reached with all of the 27 other EU member states. Scroll down for video . New figures show two-thirds of child benefit sent abroad go to Poland, where ministers have rejected British suggestions that the payments should end . Mr Cameron is due to hold talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel tomorrow when she visits London. They will tour the British Museum before meeting in Downing Street, when the Tory plan for a renegotiation of Britain's membership of the EU will be on the agenda. The Prime Minister has made clear that tackling benefits for migrants, especially those exported to families in other countries, will be a key demand. Under EU rules, the benefit has to be paid to European nationals who are working in Britain and paying National Insurance – even if their families are based abroad. Latest figures obtained by MailOnline reveals that child benefit is paid to 20,660 families with 34,199 children living outside Britain. Child benefit is paid at £20.30 a week for the first child and £13.40 for every other child, regardless of parental income. It means the total bill for children living overseas could be up to £30million-a-year, although under the EU rules not all awards are made at the full UK rates. According to figures for September 2014 obtained by MailOnline under a Freedom of Information request, the total number of claims has risen slightly since December 2013. However, the numbers down down by around a sixth since the general election in 2010. Amazingly, two-thirds of all claims are made for children in Poland. Claims from Romania and Bulgaria have risen sharply in the past four years, as work curbs were lifted at the start of 2014. David Cameron is due to hold talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel tomorrow when she visits London . Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron:  'We need are changes that are good for Britain and good for Europe, they do involve treaty change and proper, full-on treaty change for that matter. 'Crucially, you don't get child benefit in respect to children that you leave at home with your, your family in other countries.' Lib Dem Deputy PM Nick Clegg: 'There’s this thing about us paying child benefit to people who are working here but have got children elsewhere. 'Obviously that’s absurd. I would like to deal with that overnight, but you have to wait for the treaties to change. Labour's shadow work and pensions secretary Rachel Reeves: 'We will work with European countries to end the absurdity of child benefit and child tax credits being claimed for children living in other countries.' There were 213 claims for 279 children in Bulgaria in September, up from just 79 claims for 113 children in July 2010. Similarly, the number of claims from Romania rose from 75 to 236, covering 404 children. Mr Cameron has made tackling the problem a central aim of his plans to renegotiate Britain's membership of the EU if he remains as Prime Minister after May's election. But his promised in-out referendum is not due to take place until the end of 2017, meaning any breakthrough on stopping the payments remains years off. Speaking on Sunday, Mr Cameron he told BBC One's Andrew Marr show: 'We need are changes that are good for Britain and good for Europe, they do involve treaty change and proper, full-on treaty change for that matter.' He added: 'Crucially, you don't get child benefit in respect to children that you leave at home with your, your family in other countries.' The comments came almost a year to the day since he made the same argument on the same programme. In January 2014 Mr Cameron said it was 'wrong' that Britain paid child benefit for Polish workers for their 'family back at home in Poland'. The comments attracted a furious response from Polish foreign minister Radoslaw Sikorski who tweeted: 'If Britain gets our taxpayers, shouldn't it also pay their benefits? Why should Polish taxpayers subsidise British taxpayers' children?' He added: 'UK social security rules apply to all resident EU citizens. No need to stigmatise Poles. What about British children abroad?' Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg has suggested Polish parents who claim child benefit for their families in their home country should not receive the same amount as British workers while Labour leader Ed Miliband also wants the child benefit payments to be stopped . In November last year, Labour's Rachel Reeves used an article on MailOnline to set out her party's approach to curbing benefits for migrants. It included 'ending child benefit and child tax credits from being sent abroad'. Lib Dem leader Mr Clegg also backs the idea, and has gone further, suggesting that until the payments can be stopped, Polish parents who claim child benefit for their families in their home country should not receive the same amount as British workers. The Deputy Prime Minister has ordered officials to find a legal way to slash the ‘absurd’ payments made for children who do not live in the UK. He said it was not fair that Britain pays £80-a-month per child, but in Poland child benefit is worth only £18.","Child benefit paid to 20,660 families with 34,199 children outside the UK .

"Driver error is likely the cause of a crash involving a school bus and an empty freight train that killed two people and injured 12 more in northeastern North Dakota, police said Tuesday. Evidence at the snow-covered scene indicates the 62-year-old bus driver braked but didn't stop in time to prevent the crash Monday afternoon near Larimore, Highway Patrol Lt. Troy Hischer said. The bus driver and a 17-year-old girl, who have not been named, were killed. 'There's no indication that the brakes didn't work properly. The driver was on the brakes - you could see that he was trying to stop. We believe the brakes worked properly,' Hischer said. Tragic: A 17-year-old student and 62-year-old bus driver were killed when a BNSF train hit their vehicle . 'We believe it was driver error at this point - he became complacent, or something else was going on,' he said. Authorities were examining the bus for mechanical problems and planned to interview passengers to determine if the driver was distracted. The Larimore Public School District bus was heading north on a county road when it was struck by a westbound BNSF Railway freight train at a crossing with no crossing arms. The train struck the bus on the passenger side, near the doors. On impact, the bus driver and a 17-year-old student were ejected from the vehicle and killed. Larimore is about 100 miles north of Fargo. The ages of the students on the bus ranged from five to 17. Some of the injured suffered broken bones and three were said to be in 'very serious condition'. Emergency: A further 12 people were injured in the crash at 3.45pm near Larimore, North Dakota . Investigation: Driver error is likely the cause of the crash police said Tuesday . Officials with Altru Health System in Grand Forks confirmed Monday night that they had received ten patients, six of whom were admitted and three of whom were transferred. One patient was released. The hospital did not immediately have an update early Tuesday. Hischer said he has responded to numerous fatal crashes in his 21 years in law enforcement but was still shaken by Monday's incident. 'It's difficult,' he said. 'I have four children. It definitely hits home, when you see children [injured] like that.' Roger Abbe, superintendent of schools for the district, declined to comment Monday evening. BNSF spokeswoman Amy McBeth said BNSF has sent investigators to the scene. McBeth said the train was not carrying any cargo and that neither of the two crew members on the train was injured. U.S. Sen. John Hoeven from North Dakota sent his condolences. 'We pray for the speedy recovery of all who were injured, and that everyone involved finds solace in the love of their families and friends,' Hoeven said in a statement.","Police say driver error is likely the cause of a crash involving a school bus and an empty freight train on Monday afternoon in  North Dakota .

The extra second is needed because the Earth's rotation is gradually slowing down by around two thousandths of a second per day and needs to catch up with atomic time. The Paris Observatory says 30 June 2015 will be a second longer. An extra second will be added at 11:59:60pm UTC to sync up clocks (stock image shown). This is to account for discrepancy between Earth time and atomic time. It is the 26th leap second to be added since 1972 . The extra unit will be added at 11:59:60pm UTC on 30 June, bringing the total number of seconds for 2015 up to 31,536,001. In it is the 26th time in history since 1972 that a leap second will have been added. The decision to add an extra second year was announced by the Paris Observatory and the International Earth Rotation Service (IERS). Leap seconds are occasionally used to help ‘Earth time’ catch up to ‘atomic time’. The latter is constant but the former is slower by about two thousands of a second per day. Of the daily sum of 86,400 seconds measured by atomic clocks, Earth rotates about 0.002 seconds slower. This is due to the discrepancy between atomic time and the mathematically calculated time of Earth's date. However, Earth's rotation is also getting slower, on the order of a millisecond or so every century. It's thought that, four billion years ago, a day on the planet lasted just 22 hours. This is mostly due to the tidal pull from the moon, which is very slightly slowing the rotation of Earth. To keep them in sync, it is necessary to occasionally jump Earth’s time back  - for mathematical reasons similar to adding leap years. The decision to do so is made every time Earth time is slower by about half a second, making it about half a second quicker instead. However, adding a second can have rather disastrous effects on various internet systems. In 2012 a problem was caused when subsystems got confused by the time change and caused hyperactivity on certain servers. Many companies including Reddit, Yelp and LinkedIn reported crashes as their systems struggled to cope with the change. While precautions have been taken to cope with the change this time, it is often a lesser known subsystem that succumbs to the changed time. This time around some websites could go offline if a glitch in their systems is unearthed. To alleviate the problem some companies, such as Google, add fractions of a second over the preceding year so that they don’t need to make a sudden jump - known as a 'leap smear'. It might be the last leap second added, as some countries want to scrap the practice. The last leap second in 2012 caused problems for some companies when their systems failed to cope with the change. The second is added because Earth's rotation (image from space shown) does not match up with atomic time . Leap seconds are added on one of two dates each year, either 30 June or 31 December. The first was added on the former date in 1972, and 25 have since been added in the subsequent 42 years. ‘Earth is slowing down a little bit,’ said Nick Stamatakos, the chief of Earth Orientation Parameters at the US Naval Observatory. ‘They add an extra second to something called UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) in order to make sure the rate of UTC is the same as atomic time,’ he said. ‘For that day [June 30] there'll be 86,401 seconds, instead of 86,400 seconds. The length of the day for you and I and everyone on the Earth will have an extra second.' The discrepancies between Earth time as calculated by its rotation (UTC) and atomic time (UT1) is shown here. Atomic time can be taken to be the line at zero, while the 'slowing' Earth time (and the extra seconds added) can be seen by the spikes on the green line. A second is added when it lags by about 0.6 seconds . However, some nations including the US have supported a change to get rid of leap seconds. They instead simply want to let the clocks run out of sync. Were such a decision to be made, though, it's unlikely we could ever go back to a leap second system and keep the clocks in sync. This is because the clocks would be out of sync by several minutes, or maybe hours eventually, which would be virtually impossible to add to systems without disastrous consequences. Without leap seconds, there would be a slip of two to three minutes by the year 2100, and half an hour by 2700. Other countries, like Britain, wanted to keep leap seconds to preserve certain regularities - such as Greenwich Mean Time, which is the time when the sun crosses the Greenwich Meridian. A vote is due to take place by the Radiocommunication Assembly and the World Radiocommunication Conference later in the year to decide the fate of the leap second. And if its opponents get their way, this might be the last time the number of seconds in a year reaches 31,536,001.","The Paris Observatory says 30 June 2015 will be a second longer .

"The Tories have refused to rule out cutting the education budget by billions of pounds after the next election, private briefing notes have revealed. Documents photographed being held by Conservative veteran William Hague during a press conference yesterday showed ministers were urged not to answer questions about whether school funding would be slashed. It comes after the Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg accused the Tories of planning a 25 per cent reduction to the education budget to pay for ‘remorseless’ spending cuts. A close up of William Hague's briefing notes revealed that the Tories are refusing to rule out cutting the schools budgets . In response to the question ‘Will you cut the schools budget in the next Parliament’, the document said: ‘Of course there will be difficult decisions in the next Education budget in the next Parliament' He said: ‘Tory plans mean education will have to be cut by a quarter by 2020. And that's just one unprotected department.’ Mr Clegg said the schools budget had only been protected since 2010, ‘because the Lib Dems fought for it’. In the Autumn Statement last year, George Osborne revealed public spending cuts would continue for at least three years after the election to eliminate the deficit. The Office of Budget Responsibility said the cuts would take state spending to a level not seen since the 1930s. During a press conference yesterday, five Conservative ministers lined up to attack Labour spending plans. George Osborne, Nicky Morgan, Theresa May, Sajid Javid and William Hague claimed Ed Miliband had committed Labour to £20billion of unfunded spending commitments. During the press conference Mr Hague was photographed looking at a briefing document for the event – including a passage informing ministers what to say if questioned about Conservative school spending proposals. Chancellor George Osborne (centre) speaks during the Conservative press conference with (from left) Sajid Javid, Culture Secretary, Nicky Morgan, Education Secretary,  Theresa May, Home Secretary, and William Hague, Commons Leader . In response to the question ‘Will you cut the schools budget in the next Parliament’, the document said: ‘Of course there will be difficult decisions in the next Education budget in the next Parliament. ‘In this Parliament, we've shown that we can protect the front line by making the Education budget more efficient and effective. ‘We can only have strong schools by staying on the road to a stronger economy. But putting the economy at risk because Ed Miliband doesn't have an economic plan, Labour would put our schools at risk. However it added: ‘If pressed: There will be decisions for future spending reviews.’ Liberal Democrat Schools Minister David Laws said the document exposed the scale of the Conservative cuts programme. He said: ''The Tories have now revealed their true colours for all to see. 'They want to slash spending on education that’s desperately needed to provide children a fair and equal opportunity to succeed. 'A Tory-shaped £13.3bn black hole in education spending will jeopardise future job prospects for our country’s children, and jeopardise our long term economic stability.'","The Tories have refused to rule out cutting the education budget after May .

"A group of determined holidaymakers camped out for 24 hours in chilly conditions in order to secure a sought-after beach hut for the summer. People started queuing at 10am for one of the small wooden chalets at Avon Beach in Christchurch, Dorset, and the crowd swelled throughout the day and into the cold night. The would-be holidaymakers set up makeshift camps using deckchairs, sleeping bags and tents to bag their spot and endured overnight temperatures of just 4C. Scroll down for video . Hardy would-be holidaymakers set up camp to queue for one of 31 6ft by 4ft wooden beachfront  huts . By the time the administration office opened at 8.30am on Monday there were 30 people waiting to book one of the 6ft by 4ft huts, which were only available on a seasonal let, meaning they will have to be given back at the end of the summer. At the front of the queue were Martin and Sandra Church from New Milton, Hants. Sandra and their two children and pet dog arrived at 10am on Sunday to make sure they were first to secure one of the huts - and Martin even took on the overnight shift after he finished work. He borrowed a fisherman's bed - a sleeping bag connected to a bed - to brave the elements for the second year in a row to ensure they kept the same hut they had last summer. Martin and Sandra Church were at the front of the line, having arrived over 24 hours early for sign-ups . The couple arrived at 10am on Sunday to ensure that they were first when the office opened on Monday . Martin, 37, said: 'The huts are so close to the beach and it's a nice beach to take the kids to. 'We queued up for one last year and we spent pretty much every day down there in the summer. 'Holidays are expensive, the hut costs about £600 for the whole eight weeks of the summer holidays so it's worth it if you use it a lot. 'We wanted to keep the one we had last year so my wife went down early with the kids and the dog and I took over after I finished work. 'It was alright, at least it wasn't raining. The weather was much better than last year.' Avon Beach has 130 huts lining it, though 50 were destroyed by storms in February last year .

'Normally if they are going to queue the day before they get here about 4pm, but we had people queuing from 10am and by midday on Sunday we had about seven. 'We always offer them the covered area by our ice cream shop to provide them with a bit of shelter and people set up tents and brought Thermos flasks.

"New York police have cut back on arrests and reduced the amount of summonses they normally issue at this time of year, as relations continue to sour with Mayor Bill de Blasio. In the week to last Sunday, officers made half as many arrests as they normally do and issued just 347 summonses. During the same period a year ago, police issued 4,077. Parking and traffic tickets also dropped by 90 per cent. It is the second straight week, officers have reduced their weekly tallies. Scroll down for video . New York police have cut back on arrests and reduced the amount of summonses they normally issue at this time of year as relations continue to sour with Mayor Bill de Blasio . Hundreds of officers turned their backs on de Blasio at the funeral of slain officer Wenjian Liu which he later said was 'disrespectful' Across the city, officers made a total of 2,401 arrests, compared with 5,448 for the same week the year before - a 56 per cent reduction. The declines came after a drastic drop in activity that began shortly after the murders of officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu on December 20. However, police union leaders have denied that the declines represent any work action. But they have acknowledged that they've told staff to put their safety first. Liu and Ramos were assassinated as they sat in their patrol car by Ismaaiyl Brinsley, who later shot himself in a subway station. Hundreds of officers turned their backs on de Blasio at the officers' funerals, something he later labelled as being 'disrespectful'. Officers had also earlier booed the mayor when he spoke at a police graduation ceremony. The unions have blamed de Blasio for fostering an anti-NYPD atmosphere which they believe contributed to the murders of the officers. The tensions also follow weeks of protests over the death of Eric Garner, whose last words 'I can't breathe' have become a rallying cry against over-zealous policing. Garner died after being placed in a chokehold by officer Daniel Pantaleo. Most New York police precincts' crime tallies were close to zero, the New York Times reported. Coney Island didn't record a single parking ticket, traffic summons or ticket for a low-level crime. De Blasio at a news conference yesterday along with police commissioner William J Batton, second from right; the pair put forward a number of theories for the decline in arrests and summonses issued . Officers had earlier booed the mayor when he spoke at a police graduation ceremony; the police unions have blamed de Blasio for fostering an anti-NYPD atmosphere which they believe contributed to the murders of Liu and his partner Rafael Ramos on December 20 . Officers are reportedly now using their own discretion to largely ignore less serious offences. At a news conference yesterday police commissioner William J. Bratton, stood with de Basio, and tried to explain away the statistical drop.  He cited the officer's funerals and the holiday season, among other theories. He said that police bosses would look very closely, 'precinct by precinct' to see what caused the drop, and suggested that things may turn to normal 'on their own volition'. According to crime statistics, during the first week of reductions, crime was actually down. In the second week, however, it increased. Robberies increase by 13.5 per cent and murders were up 11 per cent. Batton and de Blasio had called the news conference to celebrate the city's success in reducing crime. Robberies and murders had dropped to the lowest levels since 1963, they claimed. Batton did however acknowledge falling morale among officers. Before Liu's funeral he had called on officers to put their grievances aside and to demonstrate outside City Hall, rather than at the ceremony. The tensions also follow weeks of protests over the death of Eric Garner, whose last words 'I can't breathe' have become a rallying cry against over-zealous policing. Garner died after being placed in a chokehold by officer Daniel Pantaleo. His mother, Gwen Carr is pictured center wearing a top printed with 'I can't breathe' The crimes figures showed  parking violations were down by 93 per cent, traffic infractions fell 92 per cent and other low-level crime dropped by 91 per cent. Officers also made 56 per cent fewer arrests. Richard Aborn, the leader of the Citizens Crime Commission of New York City, told the newspaper he expected the drop to correct itself. He said: 'The only thing more critical to the cops right now than their outrage is their sense of duty, and they're not going to abandon that for a long period.' The reduction in infringements may come at a significant cost to New York, which earns about $10.5 million a week in parking fine revenue. The head of the union for police traffic agents, Robert Cassar, has reportedly said his uniformed staff are now doubling up on their rounds and were being 'very cautious' not to 'enrage the public'.","2,401 arrests were made compared to 5,448 during the same period .

"A couple of decades ago, turning 60 meant a free carriage clock on retirement and joining the local bridge club.

Sharon Garner, 60, took up Thai-boxing after trying it out on holiday and claims the sport has helped to rid her of arthritis.

Since then, she has lost almost two stone and claims that many of her health problems have disappeared. She said: 'I live, eat and breathe it - all I think about is my kickboxing. 'I know it sounds silly at my age but I absolutely adore it. 'It works every exercise from your head to your toes and you do become a better person - I just wish I'd done it years ago.'

Sharon, who rents out property for a living with her husband Alwyn, took up the sport to lose weight and beat depression. But she said it had also helped her tackle the arthritis that affects her spine and neck too. She said: 'It's really helped me in a lot of ways. 'I was two stone overweight and suffering with depression when I started kickboxing in April 2014. 'Since then, I've lost weight, my arthritis has improved and I feel lots better.

"His dorky haircut, sweater-vest, puffy smile, squint and braces made him an unexpected online phenomenon - but the real-life 'Bad Luck Brian' is actually a church builder named Kyle. While his image is re-purposed constantly online by anyone wanting to illustrate the depths of incompetence or sheer misfortune, Kyle Craven, 25, quietly works away for the family construction business in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio. His high school photo, taken when he was 16, is the visual accompaniment to jokes such as 'Wears bullet-proof vest... gets shot in the face', 'Has a pet rock... it runs away' and 'Hires life coach... benched'. Behind the meme: Kyle Craven, left in his normal life, found a joke yearbook photo (right) turned into a vision of incompetence and misfortune after it found its way online . It has also personally earned its star $20,000 in royalties from big-money ad campaigns in the United States and across the world, the Washington Post reported. The snap shot to fame after a friend uploaded it to the Reddit forum in 2012 and is struck a chord with the other users, and he joined the ranks of others whose images became inexplicably famous and repeated millions of times. Craven explained that he was a class clown and made the photo ridiculous on purpose - he bought the sweater from a thrift store, rubbed his cheeks red before posing then pulled a stupid face. Indeed, the picture was so obviously silly that the school principal wouldn't let it in the final cut of the yearbook. But Craven and a school pal, Ian Davies, took a digital copy of the picture that would eventually secure his fame - though it would take six years for Davies to eventually share it with the world. Lucrative: Exposing himself to mockery worldwide has brought in as much as $20,000 for Craven . 'Famous': Craven, seen here wearing a t-shirt of himself, has found himself less in demand of late - but still gets the occasional call . It made its way to t-shirts, stuffed animals and novelty items sold bu the likes of Wal-Mart and Hot Topic, while companies like Volkswagen, and others as far away as Chile and Poland paid up to use his pictures in their ad campaigns. The deals, which he negotiated himself, made him an estimated $20,000, and Craven tried to capitalize on his internet kudos even further by filming videos about his character. He even traveled to Los Angeles for a 'date' with another meme character - Laina Morris, or Overly Attached Girlfriend. While the two didn't fall in love, the resulting video was watched more than 2million times. But, he told the Post, his fame and profitability had an expiry date. While he first video was viewed 350,000 times, interest waned fast. His latest effort, from December old, has attracted an audience of fewer than 10,000, and his monthly Youtube earnings now rarely breach $100. Now that the internet has turned its attention elsewhere, Craven is left with his job as a project manager for church construction. He recently adopted a dog. He considers the picture 'something to show my grandkids one day' - and in the meantime does everything he can to give Brian one last outing whenever another fan comes calling.","Kyle Craven, 25, posed for purposefully ridiculous yearbook photo aged 16 .

"Islamic State fighters may be taking cocaine to boost morale as Coalition planes bomb them from above, and Kurds advance on their territory. Kurdish fighters uncovered a bag of cocaine at the home of IS leader, Emir Abu Zahra, after killing him in a military operation deep inside the war-torn city of Kobane in Syria. The discovery in the Botan neighbourhood suggests widespread drug use within ISIS which is very much against the doctrines and principles of Islam. They believe Zahra distributed the drug among his fighters to boost morale - as ground assaults by Iraqi Peshmerga and bombing raids by the US Air Force begin to take their toll. Discovery: Kurdish fighters found a bag of cocaine (pictured) from the home of an IS leader, Abu Zahra . Drugged: The Kurdish soldiers believe Zahra was distributing the drug to up to 40 of his fighters . Forbidden: The use of narcotics goes against the doctrines and principles of Islam . Raid: Abu Zahra was killed in the military operation which uncovered the bag of cocaine and an armoured laptop (pictured) Islamic State's propaganda videos have previously shown the extremist group whipping three drug addicts near the Syrian city of Damascus. The captions on the video being circulated suggested the men were being punished for taking illegal substances, in accordance with Sharia Law. Islamic State's religious police, known as the Hesbah, have previously been pictured burning a large supply of cigarettes near the IS-controlled city of Raqqa. While amateur footage online shows its soldiers burning fields of what appears to be a marijuana farm. Despite the image they portray, there have been constant rumours of drug use within Islamic State ranks. The group's leaders are believed to drug their fighters so they fight more bravely, although their enemies suggest this inspires reckless and ineffective attacks. Kurdish fighters have reportedly found mysterious pills, capsules and syringes on both dead and alive IS fighters. High-tech: An armoured laptop worth over £2,000 was also recovered from Abu Zahra's house . Operation: A dozen Kurdish fighters from the People's Protection Units (YPG) carried out the raid on Zahra's home . Destruction: The city of Kobane (pictured) has been reduced to rubble after continuous fighting between Kurdish, regime, and ISIS forces .

Kobane, on the northern border between Syria and Turkey, has been the scene of intense fighting between Kurdish and IS forces. Kurdish fighters have made great advances into IS territory in Kobane sine the new year, thanks to aerial support from the US Air Force and artillery fire from Iraqi Pehmerga soldiers. ISIS were pushed back in the south and south-east, and retreated from both the Cultural Centre and the governmental square.

HSI has been working with local groups in China, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam to raise public awareness of the dog meat trade. It works with farmers who want to get out of the industry, by helping them to set up a more humane way of making a living. But O'Meara said South Korea was unique because it farms dogs to supply demand. Most other countries target feral dog as food.

She added that it was the first time that dogs from South Korea intended for human consumption had been rescued and brought into the U.S. All 23 dogs will undergo veterinarian checks in Alexandria, before being distributed among five other shelters in the Mid-Atlantic states for adoption. Megan Webb, executive director of the Animal Welfare League of Alexandria, which finds homes for about 1,000 dogs a year, said: 'By helping these 23 dogs, we'll be helping a lot of other dogs in South Korea by raising public awareness of the dog meat trade.'","23 dogs were rescued from dog-breeding farm in Ilsan, northwest of Seoul .

"Six teenage girls have sparked anger after taking a photo of themselves dressed in white hats and white shirts - similar to the outfits worn by Klu Klux Klan members - and posting it online. The unidentified students, who attend Nash Central High School in North Carolina, captured the image in November amid protests over the grand jury's verdict in the Michael Brown shooting case. In the controversial picture - taken out of school hours and off campus - they can be seen donning white cone-shaped hats and white shirts, while pointing their fingers at the camera like guns. The girls later posted the photo to Instagram, prompting outrage from residents, parents and other students, with many claiming the teenagers were deliberately dressed like KKK members.

Controversial: Six teenage girls have sparked anger after taking this photo (pictured) of themselves dressed in white hats and white shirts - similar to the outfits worn by Klu Klux Klan members - and posting it online . Others deemed the image 'threatening' in a state which has established KKK groups, while some highlighted the fact that it was posted online at a time when racial tensions were high across America. All claimed Nash Central's school board had repeatedly ignored their concerns over the picture - which was uploaded to the social networking platform on November 26 - for the past two months. On Monday evening, Rocky Mount residents and parents crowded into the Nash Rocky Mount School System auditorium to complain about the 'KKK-inspired' photo to the board, ABC 7 reported. The turnout  was so high that some people were even forced to stand outside, in the hallway. Addressing the board, Rocky Mount parent Monica Gilmore said: 'The incident of the young women posing as KKK members was a threat to our children and community.'

However, Nash County Sheriff Keith Stone, who also attended the meeting, emphasized that the photo was taken after school hours and at an off-campus site. 'In my opinion, I saw no laws that were violated,' he said, adding that his department had carried out an investigation and questioned both the girls and their parents. The school board also confirmed that an international investigation had taken place, but refused to say how or if the students were disciplined for 'privacy' reasons.

"Jason Polanco, 23, is charged with attempted murder and robbery . Long before he allegedly opened fire in a wild shootout that left a pair of NYPD cops injured, 23-year-old Jason Polanco was already one to promote anti-cop violence. Polanco, who was arrested on attempted murder charges Tuesday, routinely posted messages with political or social commentary on his Instagram. In one of those posts, a few months ago, he added a picture captioned 'stop police brutality' — complete with a shocking call for violence against cops. 'Maybe there should be a stand your ground law for civilian against abusive & [corrupt] authorities,' the suspect wrote. 'Same way they empty a full mag on us, empty a couple on them.' He signed his message with a reference to Michael Brown, the unarmed black Missouri teenager whose shooting death by a white police officer sparked months of protests and riots nationwide. Security video showed Polanco blasting away at the officers with a powerful .44 Magnum pistol as they pursued him Monday night following the robbery in a Bronx grocery store, police said.

The second man, 28-year-old Joshua Kemp, was charged with robbery. The names of their attorneys were not immediately available. At a news conference, New York Police Department officials praised five officers for choosing to respond to the robbery report even though their shifts had ended and they were about to head home. The two wounded officers, Andrew Dossi and Aliro Pellerano, were hospitalized in stable condition. 'I commend them for their courage,' Chief of Department James O'Neill said. 'They were going home ... and they ended up getting into a fierce firefight.' The shooting came about two weeks after two officers were fatally shot while sitting in their patrol car in Brooklyn, and on the same day that the city touted record low crime levels.

Monday night's violence unfolded as officers who are part of an anti-crime unit spotted Kemp outside a Chinese restaurant and Polanco inside it. When the officers got out of their car and approached Kemp, Polanco shot one round through the window of the restaurant, striking Kemp and one officer, police said. He went outside and fired two more shots and wounded the second officer; one officer returned three shots but missed. Polanco ran away and carjacked a white Camaro that he crashed a few blocks away, police said. He jumped out, ditched his gun and fled on foot, they said.

"Two women and a man were shot and killed in broad daylight Monday in what California investigators are calling a murder-suicide. Officers in Selma, southeast of Fresno, responded to reports of shots fired at around 2.15pm Monday, only to discover a woman lying mortally wounded in the street. Another fatally shot woman was found inside a home located near the intersection of Jasper and Peach streets. Both women died at the scene. Scroll down for video . Gunned down: Johana Loza, 36, a mother of seven, was shot dead by her boyfriend, Eduardo Escobar (right), along with her cousin before the man turned the gun on himself in Selma, California . First victim: Witnesses said Jessica Cervantes, pictured here with her husband, was gunned down in the street after getting into an argument with Johana Loza's boyfriend . Selma Police Chief Greg Garner says the suspected gunman was also found in the house with a self-inflicted gunshot wound. He was taken to Community Regional Medical Center, where he died a short time later. Garner says a motive hasn't been determined, but there may have been a conversation about money. The chief says there were a number of witnesses at the scene and half a dozen people in the house at the time of the shooting, among them children. While police have not officially named the two victims and the gunman, Felipe Loza told the Fresno Bee that his 36-year-old sister, Johana Loza, was shot dead by her boyfriend of 19 years, Eduardo Escobar, who also killed the woman's cousin, Jessica Cervantes. In broad daylight: Police say Eduardo Escobar entered this home belonging to his girlfriend's family filled with children and shot her . Motive: Police say there may have been a conversation about money between one of the victims and the shooter before gunfire erupted . Mr Loza said his sister, a mother of seven originally from Michoacán, Mexico, had left Escobar about a week ago and went to live with her parents and grandparents in Selma. An eyewitness described how just after 2pm, a Cadillac Escalade pulled up in front to the Loza family's home and Eduardo Escobar emerged from the vehicle. Jessica Cervantes, who happened to be outside at the time, confronted Escobar and had a heated exchange with him, prompting the man to open fire on her, leaving the woman dead in the middle of the street. Escobar then allegedly entered the house and shot his estranged girlfriend before turning the murder weapon on himself. The neighbor who witnessed the shooting and called 911 peered inside the Escalade and found Escobar and Loza's young child, who was unharmed. Young mother: Cervantes is survived by her husband, Diego, and their young child, pictured here . Escobar and Loza’s teenage daughter took to Facebook Monday night to mourn her mother, expressing her love for the matriarch and promising the deceased woman to help take care of her siblings, including a baby brother. In an earlier post, the girl confirmed that her mother did not make it, adding, 'I hope my dad doesn't make it either.'

"The BBC has spent £43,000 of licence fee payers' money on alcohol in the past year, new figures show. The Corporation allows staff to buy alcohol with licence fee funds in order to treat presenters and guests. Drinks may also be bought for awards shows and to celebrate the completion of a series. But the BBC insists that it aims to get value for money, mindful that it is public money being spent. Hospitality: BBC allows production staff to, on occasion, provide hospitality for guests and presenters. Above, Nicole Kidman, Julie Walters and Hugh Bonneville on The Graham Norton Show on BBC One . Best deals: The BBC insists that it aims to get value for money, mindful that it is public money being spent . The £43,000 covers the 12 months to the end of October and is £1,000 higher than the previous year. It was all spent at Majestic Wine, the Corporation's favoured supplier. The amount is equal to the cost of nearly 300 colour television licence fees, priced at £145.50. A BBC spokesman said: 'The BBC has clear policies to ensure spend on hospitality is proportionate and we are always mindful that we are spending public money. 'Production teams do on occasion provide hospitality for guests and presenters.' The £43,000 was all spent at Majestic Wine, the BBC's single preferred supplier . They added: 'Drinks may be purchased where there is an appropriate business purpose, for example at award ceremonies or to celebrate the successful completion of a series. 'The BBC has a rigorous expenses policy, which has been progressively tightening and we are careful to ensure value for money.' The spending has been disclosed by the BBC in response to a Freedom Of Information Request. The Corporation stated that the figure related to 'non-production related and production related spend'. It added: 'The total spent on alcohol for the period 1st October 2013 to 26th October 2014 with the BBC's single preferred supplier Majestic Wine PLC was £43,000.' It comes as up to 50 MPs called for the licence fee to be scrapped and replaced with a voluntary subscription service in its place. The Tory politicians have written to Culture Secretary Sajid Javid arguing the licence fee is 'becoming unsustainable and out of keeping with the modern media environment.","BBC allows staff to spend licence fee funds to treat presenters and guests .

"Most girlfriends receive perfume or jewellery for Christmas. However, Suzanne Davies was given something a little more personal – her boyfriend's kidney. Devoted Neil Parry saved his partner's life by donating his organ to the 36-year-old, from Merthyr Tydfil, Wales, after discovering he was a million-to-one match. Devoted: Neil Parry donated his kidney to his long-term partner Suzanne Davies - both pictured in the University Hospital of Wales after the operation in December last year . Suzanne underwent the lifesaving kidney transplant in the University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff, in December after her partner of 10 years proved a near-perfect match. The mother to two children was told she was in renal failure by doctors and either needed to go on dialysis or have her kidney replaced. Despite finding it a daunting prospect, businessman Neil stepped up to help the love of his life. 'He is my hero and my saviour,' Suzanne said. 'I'm so lucky to have him in my life. For the last 10 years we have been together he has seen me suffer with my health. He could have walked away but he didn't. 'He has stuck with me through thick and thin and now he has given me a new lease of life. I can't thank him enough.' Suzanne has suffered with a rare disorder of the adrenal glands, called Addison's disease, since she was just eight years old. She has needed regular medication for nearly three decades to replace two essential hormones she lacks in her body called cortisol and aldosterone. 'My hero': Suzanne says she has a new lease of life after her partner Neil donated his kidney to her . But her health took a turn for the worse two years ago when her kidney function began to deteriorate. She said: 'I was being sick quite a lot and for the past 18 months I've been suffering with gout and getting lots of infections. 'When I went to see a consultant in September and he said I either needed a transplant or dialysis. 'Both my mum and Neil were a match but it was best to go with Neil as he's younger and more healthy. It was a big step for him.' Addison's disease is a condition in which the body does not make enough of the hormone cortisol. When the body's cortisol levels drop too low, this can cause a range of symptoms. These include weakness, dizziness, fatigue and abdominal pain. A very low cortisol level can be life-threatening. This is because cortisol is vital as it helps regulate blood pressure and the immune system and it helps the body respond to stress. Addison's disease is treated with hormone replacement tablets. It is thought about 8,000 people in the UK have the illness and most cases first develop in people aged between 30 and 50. About 70 per cent of cases are thought to be caused by an autoimmune disease but it can also be triggered by TB. Source: patient.co.uk . The pair met 10 years ago on a night out in Swansea and have been inseparable ever since. They have two children together, nine-year-old Cole and five-year-old Isla, and also lost a daughter at just a day old in 2008. Suzanne said: 'Neil is my best friend and we've been through so much together. 'He has changed my life for the better so our two beautiful children can have a healthy mum. 'We might get married at some stage, but I don't need a piece of paper to prove how much we belong together. 'I'd rather hand over all the wedding money to charity.' Suzanne, who is still in hospital after she suffered a minor infection in her ureteric stent following the transplant on December 8, said she now has plans to study to become a nurse or criminologist. 'I've never been healthy in my life, so for him to give me this chance is amazing,' she said. Neil said the entire family managed to spend Christmas Day at their Merthyr home. He said: 'If she'd gone on dialysis she'd need three visits a week to the hospital - and people on dialysis get very poorly. 'Having the operation meant we were both out of action for a just couple of months, rather than anything long-term. We are a strong couple.' The chances of receiving a good match from a non-related living donor, such as a friend or spouse, are around one in a million. Professor Neil Turner, ex-Chairman of Kidney Research UK, said: 'For kidney patients in need of a transplant, there’s a strong chance that their parents or children will be a good match, because they are directly related. And one in four siblings may be a near-perfect match. 'However, the chances of receiving a perfect match from a non-related living donor, such as a friend or spouse, are around one in a million. 'With 5,500 people in the UK currently awaiting a kidney transplant, we really need more people to join the organ donor register. 'We also need more research aimed at improving the lifespan of transplanted kidneys. This has got much better, but on average they last a bit less than 15 years before needing to be replaced.'","Suzanne Davies was told she needed transplant or face life on dialysis .

It also features LG's Smart Diagnosis technology, which is designed to help LG's call centre staff to identify any problems that arise with the fridge remotely. An Android smartphone app also allows users to 'record and analyse signals from the refrigerator'. The fridge was unveiled at CES in Las Vegas this week, and will be available later this year. There is currently no information on its cost. The South Korean company also unveiled a washing machine with two washers that lets people save time and energy by cleaning double the amount of clothes simultaneously. David VanderWaal, US marketing lead at LG Electronics reveals the company's latest design in Las Vegas . LG Electronic's David VanderWall introduces the LG front loading washing machine with the new Twin Load System allowing the consumer to do two separate washington loads at the same time and the LG Multi Door Regferator with 'Double Door in Door' The South Korean tech giant also used the event to announce its next-generation flexible phone, called G Flex 2. It has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 64-bit octa-core processor, with 2GB of RAM. The 5.5-inch full HD curved display has a 1080 x 1920 pixel resolution and a 403 Pixel Per Inch density. It runs Android Lollipop and the whole device is said to be 30 per cent more durable than the original model. Homeowners can control the temperature and length of cycles, and set them to start, while they're out of the house using an app. It is powered by the mini washer, which LG calls the 'world's first compact washer in a hide-away pedestal, generating a whole new set of washing options.' For example, muddy gym wear can be separated from whites, or silk underwear can be washed at the same time as towels on a hot wash. When not in use, the mini washer acts simply as the pedestal for the main washer, but it can also be combined with any of LG's front loading washers. The system is Wi-Fi and NFC enabled and is fitted with LG's SmartThinQ technology. This means users can program cycles using an app, including the temperature and length, while they're at work, or on their way home. LG's latest washing machine uses a Twin Wash system to clean two loads simultaneously. The machine has a main washer above a smaller washer in the pedestal beneath (pictured). LG said the the mini washer is perfect for items that need specific settings, and it can also be fitted to any of LG's front loading machines . While the NFC tagging technology, means users can download pre-programmed wash cycles to their smartphones, and start them by touching the phone on the machine. It also has a Smart Diagnosis feature that helps users to quickly identify issues and faults.

"Arrest: Reggie Hardy allegedly punched a man and cut off his dreadlocks after finding him in his home . A father punched a 19-year-old in the face and chopped off his dreadlocks after he found him sneaking around his apartment with his teenage daughter, police have said. Reginald Hardy has said he is sorry for attacking the unnamed man after he found him inside his Reading, Pennsylvania home on Friday night. Hardy, whose daughter only moved in with him a few weeks ago, said he saw people running through his apartment and into his bathroom. 'Then we got into a little scuffle,' he told WFMZ.

As the man attempted to leave, Hardy told him not to run because he had a gun and would shoot him in the back, according to documents. 'That might have been the maddest I ever got because I literally just seen red,' he said. After the attack, he was charged with aggravated assault, terroristic threats and other offenses.

"Eight new planets have been discovered in the 'Goldilocks' zone of their stars, orbiting at a distance where oceans and life could exist. The discovery doubles the number of small planets less than twice the diameter of Earth which are believed to be in the habitable zone of their parent stars. Among these eight, astronomers say there are two that are the most similar to Earth of any known exoplanets to date. Scroll down for video . Eight new planets have been discovered in the 'Goldilocks' zone of their stars, orbiting at a distance where water oceans and life could exist. Pictured is an artist's impression of what one of these planets may look like . The eight new planets have been discovered in the 'Goldilocks' zone of their stars, orbiting at a distance where oceans and life could exist. 'Most of these planets have a good chance of being rocky, like Earth,' said lead scientist Dr Guillermo Torres, from the Harvard-Smithsonian Centre for Astrophysics in Cambridge, US. The two most Earth-like planets, known as Kepler-438b and Kepler-442b, both orbit red dwarf stars that are smaller and cooler than the sun. With a diameter just 12 per cent bigger than Earth, Kepler-438b has a 70 per cent chance of being rocky, the scientists have calculated. Kepler-442b is about one-third larger than Earth, and the likelihood of it being rocky is around 60 per cent. The two most Earth-like planets, known as Kepler-438b and Kepler-442b, both orbit red dwarf stars that are smaller and cooler than the sun. An artist's impression is pictured . The Goldilocks zone is the belt around a star where temperatures are ideal for liquid water to pool on a planet . To be in the habitable zone, also known as the 'Goldilocks zone', a planet must be not too hot or too cold and receive roughly as much sunlight as Earth. Too much heat from its star, and any water would boil away as steam. Too little, and the water would freeze solid. The Goldilocks zone is the belt around a star where temperatures are ideal for liquid water to pool on a planet's surface. To determine the location of a star's habitable zone, scientists have to first learn how much total radiation it emits. Knowing precisely how far away a habitable zone needs to be from a star also depends on chemistry. For example, molecules in a planet's atmosphere will absorb a certain amount of energy from starlight and radiate the rest back out. How much of this energy is trapped can mean the difference between a turquoise sea and erupting volcanoes. Researchers in Scotland now claim that Earth-sized planets could support life at least 10 times further away from stars than first thought. 'For our calculations we chose to adopt the broadest possible limits that can plausibly lead to suitable conditions for life,' Dr Torres added. Kepler-438b receives about 40 per cent more light than the Earth giving it a 70 per cent probability of having a habitable zone orbit. In comparison, baking hot Venus has twice as much. The other star gets about two-thirds as much light as Earth and is 97 per cent likely to be in the habitable zone. Co-author Dr David Kipping, also from the Centre for Astrophysics, said: 'We don't know for sure whether any of the planets in our sample are truly habitable. All we can say is that they're promising candidates.' Neither of the planets are our close neighbours. Kepler-438b is located 470 light-years from Earth while the more distant Kepler-442b is 1,100 light-years away. The team, whose findings were presented at the American Astronomical Society's annual meeting in Washington DC, studied planetary candidates first identified by Nasa's Kepler space telescope. All the planets were too small to confirm by measuring their masses. Instead, they were validated using a computer program that determined they were statistically likely to be planets. After the analysis, follow-up observations showed that four of the planets were in multiple star systems. The research is also published in the Astrophysical Journal.

He also had a painkilling injection after suffering a protruding disc in his spine. Mr Cameron said at the time that his ‘phenomenally bad back’ had been a ‘bore’.","David Cameron, 48, sported support bandages on both legs in recent race .

"An arsonist tried to burn down the San Francisco house used in the Robin Williams comedy Mrs Doubtfire over a perceived grudge with the current owner. The house is owned by eminent plastic surgeon Dr. Douglas K. Ousterhout who  told police that he is having problems with a former client, but is not sure who is responsible for the fire. The house, which is on the junction of Steiner and Broadway in Pacific Heights, suffered scorch marks following Monday night's attack. The house in Pacific Heights, San Francisco was used in the 1993 Robin Williams film Mrs Doubtfire . The garage at the front of the property suffered scorch marks after Monday night's attack . Robin William fans laid floral tributes outside the property after the star took his own life last year. The property is now owned by plastic surgeon Dr. Douglas K. Ousterhout, pictured right . Police believe the attacker, who they believe used to be a former client of the owner, used petrol to start the fire. The front door also suffered damage. San Francisco Fire Department said the home owner was able to douse the flames after smelling smoke from inside the property. Police sealed-off an area surrounding the iconic building while they searched for forensic clues to link the attacker to the crime. The 2,378 square foot house was built and 1906 and was bought in April 2000 for $1,395,000. The property is a popular tourist destination in San Francisco with fans of Robin Williams regularly stopping off to have their photograph taken outside the film's location.

"A social experiment centred around mobile dating app Tinder has attempted to expose online predators in Melbourne seeking to groom underage girls. Creators of The Tinder Experiment established a fake account for 'Imogen' who initially registers herself as an 18-year-old but explains in her profile that she is in fact 15. What the three anonymous creators then claim is that many older men aren't deterred by Imogen's age. In one video, the group say they secretly filmed two men - believed to be aged 31 and 43 - who allegedly met up with Imogen when she told them she was home alone. The trio - who only wanted to be known as their pseudonyms 'Imogen', 'Blake and 'Jack' - told Daily Mail Australia they conducted the experiment after noticing 'an alarming amount of inappropriate content in the app' which they claim to be 'underage girls, prostitution and trafficking of illicit drugs'. Scroll down for video . Creators of The Tinder Experiment established a fake account for 'Imogen' who initially registers herself as an 18-year-old but explains in her profile that she is in fact 15 . The social experiment centred around mobile dating app Tinder has attempted to expose online predators in Melbourne seeking to groom underage girls . The series of videos, which were posted online over the last couple of weeks, allegedly document the conversations and following meetings between Imogen and older men on Tinder. The video shows some men being shocked when they were told by Imogen they were chatting to an underage girl. But others didn't appear to be fazed. And even after being confronted and caught by 'Blake' who pretended to be Imogen's older brother in the video before any serious harm could be done, some allegedly kept coming back for more. It was an experiment which shocked all those involved, including the 21-year-old actress who posed as Imogen. 'I felt vulnerable and disgusted that they thought it was okay to basically throw themselves at a 15-year-old girl,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'They thought it was completely normal and it just makes me worried for other young girls.' Actors, 'Blake' and 'Jack' who are both 25, says they originally orchestrated the experiment to raise awareness on 'how easy it is for illegal behavior to take place on mobile dating apps'. But instead, they were sickened by what unfolded. 'We couldn't believe some of the things that the men said,' Blake told Daily Mail Australia. 'There's a lot we couldn't include in the videos because it was too graphic such as nude pictures. We also couldn't believe that some men came back a second time after being confronted we've had three so far but not all will be shown in the series. You'd think they would learn their lesson after being caught once. Their stupidity was astounding.' The series of videos, which were posted online over the last couple of weeks, allegedly document the conversations and following meetings between Imogen and older men on Tinder . The three anonymous creators claim that many older men aren't deterred by Imogen's young age . The idea for the project was sparked last year. 'As Tinder users ourselves, we noticed an alarming amount of inappropriate content in the app - underage girls, prostitution, trafficking of illicit drugs - and wanted to gain a greater understanding of the mindset of people participating in such things,' Blake said. 'I've been on Tinder for over a year now and I've got around 2000 matches on my personal account so I've seen a lot of interesting stuff. 'Girls do some questionable things too... but that's a topic for another day.' The group started filming the videos in late November and recorded their latest footage on Tuesday night. Although they fear their cover may be revealed soon and despite receiving some backlash for their risky methods, the group say it was 'worth it'. 'We expected this and honestly, we knew it was dangerous,' Blake said. 'We were all aware of the risk but mutually agreed that it was worth it. Having said that, we had a lot of measures in place in case something went wrong.' The group say they orchestrated the experiment after noticing 'an alarming amount of inappropriate content in the app' Imogen says she was 'a little nervous at first but I felt safe knowing that I had the other guys on standby'. 'I took part because I wanted to see what would happen and how far they [the Tinder matches] were willing to go with someone that they thought was 15,' she said. 'The guys I worked with were great. I trusted them and was confident that if something went wrong, we could handle it. 'Plus I'm strong and confident in my abilities to handle situations on my own if I need to.' A spokeswoman for Victoria Police told Daily Mail Australia they have been made aware of the video and an investigation will proceed. 'We do not condone the actions shown in this clip and urge anyone with information regarding child exploitation activity to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000,' the spokeswoman said. Daily Mail Australia has contacted Tinder for comment.","Two young men and an actress conducted the experiment in Melbourne .

"Another British jihadi is believed to have died while fighting for ISIS, bringing the known total number of Brits killed in Iraq and Syria to 36. The fighter, known among extremists as Abu Qudama Al-Britani, has been the subject of tributes among jihadists on social media in recent days. Very few details are known about him aside from his name and that he was British, according to Shiraz Maher, a senior fellow at the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation and Political Violence (ICSR). Shiraz Maher from the ICSR tweeted this picture and confirmed the fighter's death, but was unable to clarify which of the two men pictured was the British national who died . While he confirmed the fighter had been killed, Mr Maher said he had no biographical data on Abu Qudama, including where in Britain he was originally from. In a series of tweets, he also said it was unclear which of the two men featured in an photo circulating online was the deceased fighter. A spokesman for the Foreign Office told MailOnline it could not confirm if the reports were correct. Abu Qudama's death follows that of British man Abu Abdel Malik al-Britani, who was killed fighting for ISIS last month in the Syrian desert town of Dabiq. November  remains the deadliest month on record for British nationals fighting for the terror group after the figure swelled as American-led airstrikes targeted the group's strongholds. News of another British death in the region comes as a suicide blast and  clashes with ISIS extremists killed at least 23 troops and pro-government fighters in Iraq's embattled western province of Anbar, officials said. The day's heavy toll for the Iraqi forces came as they battled ISIS to try and claw back territory lost to the extremists during the militants' blitz last year. Police officials said a suicide bomber first struck a gathering of pro-government Sunni fighters near the town of al-Baghdadi, about 110miles (80km) north west of Baghdad, in the morning hours.

Right, a solider loads rocket launcher during the skirmish . Soon after, ISIS militants attacked nearby army and police positions, setting off hours-long clashes. Police and hospital officials said 23 were killed and 28 were wounded in all on the government side. They did not give the death toll on the militants' side, saying only that the attackers 'sustained some casualties' and declining to provide further details. In Baghdad, prime minister Haider Abadi pledged that Iraq's forces would retake all areas that fell to ISIS during last summer's stunning blitz. 'We will emerge as victorious and the day our lands are liberated is nearing,' Mr Abadi told a group of newly graduated army officers, speaking at the Military Academy as Iraq marked Army Day. 'Our goal ... is that peace and prosperity prevail in Iraq and end this dark period in Iraqi history.'","Expert confirms another British national has been killed fighting for ISIS .

"A man and six children have suffered horrific burns when their boat caught fire on a lake in northern Victoria. The man, 45, and the children, aged between four and 13, were on a Gilflite ski boat at a Lake Nagambie holiday park when it caught fire just before 1pm on Tuesday. Ambulance Victoria acting region manager Michael Whelan said all seven were in a stable condition, but the scene was chaotic. Scroll down for video . Seven people were injured when a boat caught alight at a Lake Nagambie holiday park at around 1pm . Water police are inspecting the ski boat (pictured) to determine why the explosion occurred . The boat was just pulling away from the shore when it caught alight. Family, friends and bystanders quickly came to their aid and extinguished the fire . 'On arrival you could hear the children screaming - they were in severe pain,' he said. 'A number of bystanders, family and friends rushed to help comfort them. 'Thankfully, bystanders had started first aid by cooling the burns before ambulance resources arrived.' The children received burns to areas including their lower legs, arms and faces. Two were flown to the Royal Children's Hospital, while the man, who had the most serious injuries, was flown to the Alfred Hospital. The 45-year-old remains in a serious but stable condition with burns to much of his body. Three children, aged nine, 11 and 13, were taken to Goulburn Valley Base Hospital and a 14-year-old girl was taken by road ambulance to the Royal Children's Hospital. Mr Whelan said the fire sparked after the boat was started, causing fuel to ignite - 'a fuel vapour explosion'. Three of the victims, including the only adult, were flown to hospital. One was transported via ambulance and the remaining three children with burns were driven to hospital where they will stay for observation . The 45-year-old man remains in a serious but stable condition at Alfred Hospital in Melbourne . 'They were all in the boat, ready to go out for a joy ride. As they were pushed away from the shore the explosion occured,' explained Sergeant Mark Crossley. The victims are understood to be from Melbourne and were enjoying a holiday together before the accident. Luckily, the victims were offered assistance almost immediately. 'Fortunately, the boat was near shore where they were starting up,' said Mr Whelan. 'That meant they were able to escape the burning boat quite quickly and get into the water which helped stop the burning process almost immediately. 'A number of bystanders, family and friends rushed to help comfort them. It happened in a holiday park and that community and family atmosphere these parks have is fantastic.' There was a fire extinguisher on hand to quickly control the fire. The victims are understood to be from Melbourne and were enjoying a holiday together before the accident . 'It was frightening to see it all unfold. I'm a little shaken up,' wrote witness Jordo Hamilton. 'Didn't see or hear explosion but the whole atmosphere at park changed. Everybody felt sickened. Very very sad news for the family and friends,' added another witness, Holly Meikle. Water police are investigating the vehicle to determine why the explosion occurred. Sgt Crossley emphasised how important it is for all members of the public to routinely maintain their vehicles and to have safety equipment, including fire extinguishers, stored on their boats - particularly before travelling with children. 'That meant they were able to escape the burning boat quite quickly and get into the water which helped stop the burning process almost immediately.","There were chaotic scenes when an explosion caused a boat fire in Victoria .

"New images show the moment Jeremy Kyle was pepper-sprayed by a nightclub bouncer who said he was 'making Magaluf look s***'. Footage of the incident is due to be broadcast for the first time since the infamous chat show host was attacked while filming an exposé of the island resort. Today he described his bodyguard-flanked escape from the scene  as 'the longest 100-yard walk of my life' and told how jeering onlookers shouted obscenities at him. Scroll down for video . Attack: New images show the moment divisive TV host Jeremy Kyle was left coughing and spluttering on the streets of Magaluf after being pepper-sprayed by a bouncer - who said he was making the resort 'look s***' The presenter escaped flanked by bodyguards as jeering onlookers shouted at him, he said . The attack features in a new series by the controversial presenter, whose ITV show was described by a judge in 2007 as 'human bear-baiting', which sees him leave the sofa and hit the streets. Embarking on a half-hour exposé of youth drinking culture, Kyle sent undercover stooges into shops to see if they could buy alcohol underage and visited the Spanish party resort of Magaluf. It was on the resort's famous strip of bars that the attack happened last July. Until today, images from his own crew's cameras had never been released. Recalling the incident, Kyle said tension had built when 'thousands' of onlookers started chanting  at him. 'Then all of a sudden I couldn't breathe, my eyes were streaming and my lungs were burning,' he told The Sun. Exposé: The images are from a new documentary by the chat show host on Britain's binge drinking culture . Speaking to The Sun, Kyle described his escape (pictured) as 'the longest 100-yard walk of my life' 'My security guard grabbed me and marched me through the shouting crowds to the van. 'It was the longest 100-yard walk of my life. I didn't even have time to feel frightened. I just had no idea what was going on.' The 40-year-old Romanian bouncer named Leon who attacked Kyle stood his ground after the attack last year, saying the ITV show gave his resort bad press. Leon - who said he would happily spray Kyle again - said at the time: 'He was walking down the strip with camera making it look s***. He wasn't showing the good side of Magaluf. 'It's actually a nice place to live which is why you find lots of families here with their kids being raised here.' Escort: The TV presenter was heavily flanked by security in much the same way as on his chat show . Cheery: The bouncer, a man named Leon (left), said he would happily spray Kyle (right) all over again . Asked what he thought of the bouncer's claims, Kyle called him a 'stupid man'. He added the resort on the island of Majorca is 'obviously dangerous' because of the high number of British teenagers who drink to excess on their first holiday with friends. The TV host, whose Jeremy Kyle Show will mark its tenth anniversary in July, said the bouncer's approach had backfired because it had prompted far more coverage of Magaluf in the media. The documentary airing the footage will also see the TV host conduct interviews with police and ambulance services who have to deal with the aftermath of alcohol abuse on British shores. Named the Kyle Files, it begins with an exposé of legal highs this week before moving on to the topics of knife crime on January 15 and binge drinking on January 22. Kyle visited Magaluf after a string of shocking stories of binge drinking, including an 18-year-old woman who was filmed performing a sex act on 24 men for a cocktail. The clip spread online and prompted a national outcry over the resort's culture, as well as complaints that the girl had been used and put in a vulnerable position. The Kyle Files airs on ITV at 7.30pm on Thursday.","New footage of incident to air in documentary on resort's drinking culture .

"It was claimed to be the most expensive house in Texas worth an estimated $20 million when it went on the market around 2008 following the divorce of media moguls Doug and Melanie Johnson. With little interest in the 24,000 square foot house, which has eight bedrooms and 14 bathrooms, the seller was forced to cut $10 million off the price. Despite this, potential buyers failed to meet the asking price, so Mrs Johnson has cut the price down to $4,999,999 in a final bid to sell the property. Scroll down for video . The 'European style house' is 24,000 square foot and was built by TV moguls Doug and Melanie Johnson in 1997 . The house was initially put on the market for $20 million but after it failed to sell, $10 million was cut from the asking price . Despite the massive price reduction, nobody bought the luxurious property, which has marble floors and counter tops . Local media reports in Texas claim that Beyonce, who is from Houston, and several oil barons have all expressed an interest in buying the palatial house. The massive property is located in Piney Point, a wooded area to the west of Houston. The Johnsons divorced in 2008 and the Channel 51 TV station founded by Mr Johnson filed for bankruptcy as a result of the divorce. According the estate agents handling the sale the property is 'a magnificent estates in prestigious Shady Point sub-division.' The house is described as being 'European designed' and features 'hand painted gold leaf, vaulted ceilings, marble columns and dual spiral staircase.' Outside the property, there is a pool, outdoor kitchen as well as 'waterfall and lush gardens'. It is understood that the house cost more than $16 million to build and sits on about 40,000 square foot of land. As well as marble, many of the surfaces in the property are made from hardwood and is fully centrally heated and air conditioned . Among one of the main features of the property is the 1920s-style theme bar, with marble counter, hardwood floors and recessed lighting . The opulent property is in the prestigious 'Shady Point' sub-division area of west Houston in a mature wooded area . Across the house, there are floor-to-ceiling windows allowing in plenty of light and allowing the new owner to see their gardens . The first floor features a balcony and landing with access to the home's eight bedrooms and several of the bathrooms . Despite having eight bedrooms, the house has 14 bathrooms, many of them such as this with their own balcony offering views of the gardens . This bathroom features marble columns, marble floor and an area surrounding the bath made of marble . The property also features large rooms which seem able to host a small wedding or other type of family celebration . With the mature palm trees in the garden and luscious green grass, it does not look like your average house in Houston, Texas . The selling agent claims that the property has a 'European' design, with an Italian-style terrace overlooking the gardens . A small river flows to the edge of the property, near the massive patio area which can be used for entertaining . Unsurprisingly for a house which initially cost $20 million, it features its own swimming pool, which is not overlooked by any other property . According to the agents, there is also a waterfall area, games room and even a cinema on the third floor . The garden also features two sculptures of elephants and a gazebo at the edge of the property beside a petal fence marking the boundary . It is understood that the Johnsons' paid $16 million to build their dream home before they divorced .

"A student who piled on the pounds at university has dropped six stone after giving up her party animal ways and 385 calorie pints of snakebite and black. Charlotte DeAbreau, 24, tipped the scales at 15st 11lb and was struggling to fit into a size 18 when she finished her degree at Bangor University, North Wales. The substance misuse worker from Walsall, West Midlands, put on weight after nights out drinking her favourite 'snakebite and black' which is equal parts cider and lager, diluted with blackcurrant  cordial and has a staggering 385 calories a pint. Charlotte DeAbreau, 24, from Walsall, piled on weight while at university, eating Indian takeaway for dinner and pizza late at night. She also downed beer, wine and alcopops several times a week. After graduating, she started dieting and lost six stone in a year . Party girl Charlotte would often tuck into a whole pizza or cheesy garlic bread after a night out, and after hitting the clubs at least three evenings a week, her lifestyle took a massive toll on her figure. But after she photographs of herself in a graduation gown, Charlotte ditched the junk food and booze and has now shed a massive SIX stone and can now wear size 10 dresses. She said: 'I would pre-drink in our student flat with housemates before we went out and would usually drink wine, lager and some apple Sourz shots with lemonade. 'We would often play drinking games like Ring of Fire  - a card game that  involves a dirty pint of all of our drinks mixed together. 'When I was out I would drink snakebites and black and would always get takeaway on the way home, which was often a whole pizza.' Party girl Charlotte would often tuck into a whole pizza or cheesy garlic bread after a night out, and after hitting the clubs at least three evenings a week, her lifestyle took a massive toll on her figure . After she saw photographs of herself in a graduation gown, Charlotte signed up for Slimming World and has now shed a massive six stone and can now wear size 10 dresses . Charlotte continued: 'I was bigger as a child but I really piled on the weight when I went to uni due to the cycle of late nights, drinking and snacking on junk. 'When I went to uni, I suddenly had a new sense of freedom and I was in charge on my own finances. 'I would eat a lot of convenience foods like pizzas, takeaways and McDonalds, not to mention all of the drinking. 'As I gained weight, I became really self-conscious of my arms. I would even wear long sleeves in the summer because I felt so uncomfortable.' When Charlotte finished university, she embarked on a healthy eating plan with Slimming World and was amazed to lose seven pounds in her first week. Charlotte put on weight as a student after nights out drinking her favourite 'snakebite and black' which is equal parts cider and lager, diluted with blackcurrant cordial. It is also 385 calories a pint. Since leaving university she has curbed her drinking . Charlotte said: 'It was such a great achievement to lose the weight and as I could see my body changing, I was so determined to keep going. 'I changed my eating habits and learnt to cook healthy meals, but I also ditched the booze. 'It was such a thrill to see the weight dropping off me.' Just over a year later and Charlotte passed her goal weight of 10st 5lbs, she carried on dieting and now weighs just 10 stone. When Charlotte finished university, she embarked on a healthy eating plan with Slimming World and was amazed to lose seven pounds in her first week . After losing the weight, Charlotte decided to use her experience in a work capacity and took up a job as a substance misuse worker, where she helps others who are struggling with alcohol and drug abuse .

"A woman escaped losing her leg by inches after she toppled onto the tracks in front of a moving train. Had the train moved just a foot more the woman, who is in her 20s, would probably have lost her leg in the incident at Birmingham New Street station and could have been killed. She was found laid on her back between the tracks and the wall of the platform, with her left leg bent up behind her. Police and paramedics rushed to the scene after a woman fell on the tracks in front of an oncoming train . Commuters screamed when they realised what had happened and there were later cheers when she was lifted clear from the tracks by paramedics, with no serious injuries after falling at about 6pm yesterday. Paramedics said if the train had rolled even 30 inches further the woman, who has not been identified, could have been very seriously hurt and possibly lost her leg. Ben Bryce, 34, from Kidderminster, Worcestershire, said: 'It was absolutely horrific. All I saw was a crowd of people gathering near the front of the train screaming. 'At first someone said the woman had been on roller blades and had lost control but I think she was actually just standing waiting for a train and lost her footing. 'It's an absolute miracle she wasn't more seriously hurt or even killed. When she was lifted clear of the train by the paramedics there was a huge cheer from people watching.' A West Midlands Ambulance Service spokesman said: 'Ambulance staff managed to get her out of the position and assessed her condition at the scene. The woman, in her 20s, was laid flat on her back between the train and platform and escaped serious injury . 'Astonishingly, she appeared to have no injury from her close shave with the train but was taken to City Hospital for further assessment. 'It is clear that, had the train gone even another foot further forwards, then we could have been looking at a totally different situation, with the potential for very serious injuries. 'She has been more than lucky.' Suggestions that the woman had been on roller skates were dismissed after a woman who had been on the platform said they had been hers and she had put them down when she went to help the stricken commuter. Commuters screamed when they realised the woman fell onto the tracks and cheered when she was freed . The woman fell onto the tracks at about 6pm, as the 5.31pm Walsall to Wolverhampton train arrived at the platform. She was found with her left leg was bent back with her thigh against her body and her calf against the train. Paramedics found she was not seriously injured but she was taken to Birmingham City Hospital for further checks. London Midland is investigating the incident in conjunction with Network Rail.

"A Liberal MP publicly confused the logo of a nightclub event with an Islamic flag popular among jihadists. West Australian backbencher Luke Simpkins spotted several stickers plastered over the Leederville Railway Station footbridge in Perth in November. 'I noticed black disks that appeared to be Shahada symbols,' he wrote on his public Facebook page, referring to the Islamic Flag. But Daily Mail Australia can reveal they were actually logos for Speakeasy, a Perth nightclub event which has hosted popular musicians including Flume and Nina Las Vegas. Pictured: Federal MP Luke Simpkins posted these pictures of stickers on the Leederville Railway Station bridge and said alerted the State Government . The Shahada flag: It features a common Islamic expression but has been co-opted by jihadists . The nightclub logo: The Speakeasy logo also features white cursive writing, but is written in English . 'It's definitely nothing to do with Islamic Anything,' event manager Pierce Ericson said in an interview. The black Shahada flag is a common expression of Islamic faith but has been co-opted by jihadists. The Speakeasy logo features white, cursive writing on a black background. After noticing the stickers, Mr Simpkins called the office of Transport Minister Dean Nalder and requested they be removed. He later congratulated Mr Nalder and an adviser for 'getting them painted over quickly after my call'. Mr Simpkins was not available for comment, however his Facebook post was taken down following Daily Mail Australia's questions. Mr Ericson, from Metric Promotions, said the stickers had been placed on the bridge 'two or three years ago'. 'We're trying not to take it seriously but it's certainly pretty ridiculous,' said Mr Ericson, who laughed after hearing about the incident. Several punters responded to Mr Simpkins' post with social media mockery. Seat of power: Liberal backbencher Luke Simpkins has been vocal about the threat posed by Islamic State militants . Mr Simpkins, pictured right, was not available for comment for Daily Mail Australia on Tuesday . '""Speakeasy"" the club where all radical muslims attend to discuss how they're going to take over Perth,' wrote Pat Stevenson. 'I tried going there to organise a jihad but I couldn't hear anyone over that very new age definition of prayer music that constantly plays at a loud volume,' quipped Rob Grimsey. Last year, Mr Simpkins spoke about Australian militants embracing the Islamic State terror group under the Shahada flag in a speech to Federal Parliament. 'These people make a personal decision to betray their country and follow the black flag of Shahada and the Islamic State,' he said. The white writing on the Shahada flag reads: 'There is no god but Allah; Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah.' Islamic community leader Keysar Trad told Daily Mail Australia: 'The words themselves are very significant for Muslims. 'Unfortunately anybody who thinks they can gain more following by using this banner they end up using it.' A spokeswoman for WA Transport Minister Dean Nalder said Mr Simpkins contacted his office after spotting 'illegal graffiti'. 'Main Roads WA appropriately investigated and acted on the concern, concealing and then repainting the section of the bridge that was illegally defaced,' she said. daniel.piotrowski@mailonline.com .","He confused Speakeasy nightclub stickers for the Islamic Shahada flag .

"It may already be the most anticipated product in Apple's history - and for fans eagerly awaiting Apple's $349 Watch, there could be some good news on the way. Apple is 'finishing up' work on the Apple Watch’s software, according to 9to5mac. It says sources familiar with the product’s development say that the device is currently on track to ship in the United States by the end of March, . Scroll down for video . Apple anticipates a total of 24 million watches will be shipped during 2015, according to claims - and mass production will start in January . The Apple Watch will use three types of app. Notifications allow users to take action or respond right from their wrist such as turning the lights off after they've left the house, quickly accessing flight details at the airport, and rerouting their transit when a train or bus is late. Glances, which quickly show users information they care about most, such as the latest news and sports scores, alarm system status or the next step of a favorite recipe. Full apps can use a developer's own interface. So far Apple has refused to reveal exactly when it will be released, although a statement made to Apple employees suggests the release will be in 'the spring.' It has previously been claimed that suppliers were struggling to make enough screens and processors. However, breakthroughs have been made in the number of successful yields for the watch's display and processor, according to Taiwan's United Daily News late last year. Now 9to5Mac's Mark Gurman says Apple Store employees are set to be trained in February. 'One or two representatives from many Apple Stores in the United States, depending on store and market size, will be sent to Apple offices in either Cupertino, California or Austin, Texas to learn first-hand about the Watch,' he claims. 'These training programs will take place between February 9th and February 16th.' The employees will then train the rest of their store's staff, it is believed. Unveiled on September 9 at Apple's iPhone 6 launch event, the Apple Watch is the company's foray into wearable computers. Samsung, LG, Motorola and Microsoft have already launched their own smartwatches, but Apple is expected to face unprecedented demand for its watch. Quanta, which is building the watch, has upped its number of workers from 2,000 to 10,000 and is ultimately aiming for 20,000. The initial round of shipments will be 3 to 5 million watches. Apple anticipates a total of 24 million watches to be shipped during 2015, G for Games said. According to 9to5Mac, Angela Ahrendts, Apple's senior vice president of retail and online stores hinted at the release date when she told staff: 'We’re going into the holidays, we’ll go into Chinese New Year, and then we’ve got a new watch launch coming in the spring.' Apple's chief executive Tim Cook unveiled the watch at a launch event in September. He didn't announce exactly when the watch would be available, but said it would go on sale 'early next year.' Built-in is a 'taptic engine' that responds to a subtle vibrations users feel on their wrist for notifications . The watch has a completely new user interface, different from the iPhone, and the 'crown' on the Apple Watch is a dial called the 'digital crown.' Users can turn the crown to zoom in and out on a map, or scroll a list. The crown can also be pressed to take the user back to the home screen. Different areas on the watch face can be customised with taps and swipes, and force touches. The Glances feature shows info users would like to see, similar to Google Now, and is accessed by swiping the screen up from the bottom. Music can also be controlled on an iPhone through the Apple Watch. Built-in is a 'taptic engine' that responds to a subtle vibrations users feel on their wrist for notifications. It understands questions in messages and then offers pre-selected answers, and messages can be dictated to the iPhone. Users can also talk to the watch and send a voice reply, or have it transcribed to them. There is no keyboard on the watch, and messages can only be sent through dictation, or emoji. Siri also is built into the Apple Watch. A 'source close to Apple' told The Information last month that the firm 'would be lucky to ship [the watch] before Valentine's Day'. Chinese New Year falls on 19 February next year, so Ms Ahrendts comments push it at least beyond this date. Despite the range of impressive features unveiled by Mr Cook, there was something he failed to mention: battery life. The telling omission suggests the watch’s battery life will be the Achilles Heel of the device when it eventually does go on sale. Apple is said to be unhappy with the watch's battery life, and the long lead time before the $349 (£216) product ships could mean the device will be more functional once it's released early next year. Apple's chief executive Tim Cook (pictured) unveiled the watch at a launch event in September. Although he didn't reveal battery life details, Mr Cook did spend some time talking about the Watch's charging system, which combines Apple’s MagSafe technology with inductive charging . Most existing smartwatches on the market, such as Pebble and MetaWatch, tend to last up to a week on a single charge. The closest Cook came to talking about the battery life for the Watch was saying that users would ‘charge it at night.’ During an interview in Bloomberg Business Week, Apple's senior vice president of operations Jeff WIlliams said: 'We want to make the best product in the world. 'One of our competitors is on their fourth or fifth attempt, but nobody is wearing them.' The company's chief executive added that the Apple Watch ‘can be worn all day, for any occasion,’ but hourly figures were notably absent. A source said Apple is unhappy with the watch's battery life, according to Re/Code. Another source confirmed to the technology site that that the battery life ‘is about a day now.’ The watch has a completely new user interface (left), different from the iPhone, and the 'crown' on the Apple Watch is a dial called the 'digital crown' (right) presented by chief executive Tim Cook . The company's chief executive added the Apple Watch ‘can be worn all day, for any occasion,’ but hourly figures were notably absent. The long lead time before the $349 (£216) product ships could mean the device will be more functional once it's released early next year . A spokesperson for Apple declined to provide battery details to MailOnline and said they will be revealed closer to launch next year. Like many of Apple’s other products, the Apple Watch appears to have a sealed back, which means the battery cannot be replaced. This suggests that the entire $349 (£216) device will have to be replaced, once the battery eventually deteriorates from constant charging and use. Another concern is the launch of the health and activity-tracking apps on the Apple Watch, which will rely on adequate battery life for round-the-clock monitoring. Companies including Fitbit and Withings have health trackers that are designed to be worn at night too, monitoring sleep patterns through movements. However, if the Watch has to be charged at night, vital health signs could be missed . Companies including Fitbit and Withings have health trackers that are designed to be worn at night too, monitoring sleep patterns through movements. However, if the Watch has to be charged at night, vital health signs could be missed by the gadget which Apple says will ‘motivate people to be more active and more healthy.’ Apple did, however, spend some time talking about the Watch's charging system, which combines Apple’s MagSafe technology with inductive charging. Apple’s silence on battery life suggests the company is still working to improve the feature. The success of the device could hang on whether or not it manages to do it in time.","Apple Retail staff expected to undergo training in February .

Shyamal Mukherjee, the state forest ranger, said: 'Immediately after devouring the biscuits, 14 of them died on the spot and two were admitted to a veterinary hospital.' He added that autopsies were also being conducted.

"Sarah Palin today defended a photo she shared of her six-year-old son Trig standing on his service dog as she accused PETA of a 'hypocritical double standard' for criticizing her for the image. The former Alaska governor spoke about the controversy on the Today show on Tuesday after the photo was met with outrage on social media and by PETA, who described her as a 'callous woman'. She said that she thought it was appropriate to share the photo, which showed her son Trig, who has Down syndrome, standing on his dog, Jill Hadassah, so that he could reach the sink. 'Trig's service dog is a strong, trained dog that does really, really love his best buddy Trig, and they put up with each other and there was no harm at all to this dog,' she said on Tuesday. Scroll down for video . Refusing to back down: Sarah Palin appeared on the Today show on Tuesday morning to defend a photograph she had shared to Facebook showing her son standing on his service dog . She had shared the photo to her Facebook page on January 1 with a message for the new year. 'May 2015 see every stumbling block turned into a stepping stone on the path forward,' she wrote. 'Trig just reminded me. He, determined to help wash dishes with an oblivious mama not acknowledging his signs for 'up!', found me and a lazy dog blocking his way. He made his stepping stone.' PETA released a statement saying; 'It's odd that anyone — let alone a mother — would find it appropriate to post such a thing, with no apparent sympathy for the dog in the photo.' On the Today show, she slammed the organization. 'I thought, absolutely hypocritical double standard, as usual, applied to, I don't know, perhaps a constitutional conservative,' she told Savannah Guthrie. In another Facebook message, Palin had asked why PETA has never objected to the actions of other celebrities - including Ellen DeGeneres, who previously shared a similar picture, and President Obama, who admitted to eating dog when he was a child. Outrage: PETA was upset over this photo of six-year-old Trig Palin (above) standing on the family dog, Jill . Inspiring: The intial post was meant to inspire people at the start of 2015 by showing Trig's resilience . 'At least Trig didn't eat the dog,' she wrote. On the Today show on Tuesday, she defended the line when Guthrie asked if it was a cheap shot. 'Oh heck no, that was the best line in the post that I wrote,' she said. 'It was the kickoff line.' The comment was in reference to Obama's admission years ago that as a child in Indonesia he did once eat dog meat, and he later mocked Palin at the 2012 White House Correspondents' Dinner saying: 'What's the difference between a hockey mom and a pit bull? A pit bull is delicious.' She added on the Today show that left wing radicals 'look at him as their messiah but he as a child, probably the same age as Trig, did much worse than use the dog as a stepping stool'. In her post, Palin also asked why PETA never attacked Ellen DeGeneres - PETA's Woman of the Year in 2009 - for a photo on her Instagram page showing of a child standing on her dog to brush her teeth. That child, a little girl, does appear to be much younger and smaller thanTrig. She admitted she and the organization agree on one thing - 'respecting God's creation and critters' - but added that they probably weren't too happy that she enjoyed hunting her food. Old news: Palin says that at least her son 'didn't eat the dog,' and then goes on to say that President Obama (above) 'enjoys eating dog meat'. He once admitted he had eaten dog as a child in Indonesia . Loved: Palin insisted that the family loves all of their pets and called Trig Jill's 'best buddy' Still, she gushed about the animals the family keep in the house. 'Our pets, including Trig's best buddy Jill Hadassah, are loved, spoiled and cared for more than some people care for their fellow man whose politics may not mesh with nonsensical liberally failed ways or don't fit your flighty standards,' she wrote. On the Today show, she also explained the dog's odd name, Jill Hadassah. 'I had a roommate in college named Jill, loved her, always wanted a Jill, and then Hadassah, that's a Jewish name for Esther,' she said. 'I love in the Bible, the Book of Esther. I didn't have a sixth kid, but had a dog, and finally I got to use those names.' Dear PETA, . Chill. At least Trig didn't eat the dog. Hey, by the way, remember your 'Woman of the Year', Ellen DeGeneres? Did you get all wee-wee'd up when she posted this sweet picture? Hypocritical, much? Did you go as crazy when your heroic Man-of-Your-Lifetime, Barack Obama, revealed he actually enjoyed eating dead dog meat? Aren't you the double-standard radicals always opposing Alaska's Iditarod – the Last Great Race honoring dogs who are born to run in wide open spaces, while some of your pets 'thrive' in a concrete jungle where they're allowed outdoors to breathe and pee maybe once a day? Aren't you the same herd that opposes our commercial fishing jobs, claiming I encourage slaying and consuming wild, organic healthy protein sources called 'fish'? (I do.) Aren't you the same anti-beef screamers blogging hate from your comfy leather office chairs, wrapped in your fashionable leather belts above your kickin' new leather pumps you bought because your celebrity idols (who sport fur and crocodile purses) grinned in a tabloid wearing the exact same Louboutins exiting sleek cowhide covered limo seats on their way to some liberal fundraiser shindig at some sushi bar that features poor dead smelly roe (that I used to strip from our Bristol Bay-caught fish, and in a Dillingham cannery I packed those castoff fish eggs for you while laughing with co-workers about the suckers paying absurdly high prices to party with the throw away parts of our wild seafood)? I believe you call those discarded funky eggs 'caviar'. Yeah, you're real credible on this, PETA. A shame, because I'll bet we agree on what I hope is the true meaning of your mission – respecting God's creation and critters. Our pets, including Trig's best buddy Jill Hadassah, are loved, spoiled and cared for more than some people care for their fellow man whose politics may not mesh with nonsensical liberally failed ways or don't fit your flighty standards.

"There are only 15 minutes of daylight left when we arrive at our lodge deep in the heart of Brazil's Pantanal. 'Are you ready for a little walk?' asks our handsome young guide, Diogo. A few squirts of insect repellent later, and we're heading down a reddish dirt track - and suddenly it's like a fly-past and a fashion show and a circus performance all at once. But there is nothing contrived about any of it. Wet and wonderful: The Pantanal region is a version of Brazil far removed from the beaches of Rio . Diogo points out two hyacinth macaws canoodling in a palm tree, their astonishing blue feathers occasionally wafting in the softest of breezes. Two burrowing owls stand to attention on the ground near their nest. A great brown hawk glides above us, and a dozen or so chirping parakeets whizz over our heads. A motley crew of wild pigs scamper about, and near the lake we can see several capybara, the world's biggest rodent, emerging from the lagoon. Click, click, job done. But this is only the amuse-bouche of a feast of birds, animals, fauna and flora, sunsets, lakes and much-needed education that awaits us in this unique marshy wetland, the world's biggest floodplain (greater than the size of Britain), where you'll find the largest macaws, the tallest storks, the biggest collection of caimans and gagarin and some species of birds and creepy crawlies that look like they've been dreamed up by boffins on psychedelic drugs. Now you see me, now you don't: The jaguar is one of the Pantanal's most exciting and elusive residents . The Pantanal is pretty much in the centre of South America. We are staying on a farm belonging to Roberto Klabin, a paper baron from Sao Paulo. It is about a four-hour drive from Campo Grande. You take a straight road out of town, and after some three hours you are on a track. For the last hour, we see only one other vehicle before arriving in the Caiman Ecological Refuge. There are 53,000 hectares and 35,000 Brahma cattle on Klabin's land. And, by the sounds of it, this is a labour of love. A place of mists and fruitfulness: The Pantanal is at its most beautiful when the morning fog rises . Climate change sceptics might scoff, but I can sense the anxiety in Diogo's demeanour when he tells us how the four defining seasons in the Pantanal are nothing like as defined as they once were. We are here in March, but the rains have not yet arrived and this could be catastrophic if it becomes a trend. The flooding is essential. In a single day, the Pantanal can get 178 billion litres of rain water - which is equal to the volume of all bottled water sold every day worldwide. Two big projects are ongoing in this remarkable wilderness. Waiting for the rains to fall: Miniature lagoons appear in the surface of the Pantanal during the dry season . One is all about saving the macaws - and the results are spectacular. Twenty years ago there were only 1,500 of these wonderful birds in the whole of the Pantanal, today there are 6,000. But there's not much margin for error. The macaws nest in only one kind of tree and eat only one kind of nut. As chicks they have many predators, and they produce only one chick per year. They are partners for life, often together for more than 35 years. The other main project is to do with the jaguar. Diogo and his colleagues speak about these beautiful animals with such reverence that we long to see one but, alas, we are unlucky - the best time to see them is during the dry season from June to October, during the Brazilian winter. Saddle up: Cattle rearing is an important and visible profession in this most spectacular of regions . Our room is simple, with a small balcony where a hammock has pride of place looking out across the lagoon. One evening, as dusk falls, we go on a canoe safari, after being seen off by a giant motionless caiman with his jaws locked open. I am convinced he's made of plastic and is put there whenever there are visitors. But then I get within a couple of yards and he swishes his tail, raises his head and disappears into the water. After 24 hours alone in the lodge we get a rare sighting: two elderly Germans. We find it hard not to ask what on earth they are doing here but they turn out to be enthusiastic, valuable additions to our team. Up before the beak: Fabulous feathered creatures - including the toucan - are on show in the Pantanal . They come with us on a night drive when we see giant anteaters (they are almost deaf and blind — the anteaters that is, not the Germans), hoovering up food as if they haven't eaten for days, when we know that pretty much all they do is eat. 'This is the most peaceful place I have ever been,' says my wife one morning. She's right. This is communing with nature like nowhere else on Earth.

"She may never become a princess after splitting with Prince Harry, but Cressida Bonas has a none-too-shabby back-up plan: Hollywood stardom. That's according to a man who knows Hollywood better than any - mega film producer Harvey Weinstein. The movie mogul called Cressida a 'fantastic' actress and said he believes she has a long Hollywood career ahead of her, in a report in the Evening Standard newspaper. Scroll down for video . Cressida Bonas, left, at the screening of Big Eyes hosted by Harvey Weinstein (with Cressida, right) in London last night. The film producer called the aristocratic beauty a 'fantastic' acting talent . The 25-year-old beauty is making her debut film appearance in a Weinstein production, Tulip Fever, which also stars Cara Delevingne, Daisy Lowe and Dame Judi Dench and is due out later in the year. 'Cressida is great in Tulip Fever and people will see what a fantastic actress she is... it will be the first of many roles for her,' said Weinstein, according to the paper. He also praised her for not using her famous name to propel her acting career. 'She is not taking advantage if any media profile,' he said, speaking at the screening of one of his new films, Big Eyes, in London last night, which Cressida also attended. The 25-year-old  (left, and with Prince Harry while they were dating, right) will make her debut film appearance . Society girl Cressida has been cast as merchant's wife Mrs Steen for her debut role in Tulip Fever. The film is an adaptation of the the novel by Deborah Moggach about a 17th century romance in which an artist falls for a married young woman while he's commissioned to paint her portrait. A thumbs-up for her from the big man on Hollywood is a great start to her career. Weinstein who won an Oscar for Shakespeare in Love, has produced huge hits including Pulp Fiction and Gangs Of New York, as well as critically acclaimed films like The King's Speech and My Week With Marilyn. Appearing in a Harvey Weinstein film, certainly did no harm for Gwyneth Paltrow, who the producer is said to have championed. Gwynnie went on to win an Oscar for her role and has been cast in eight of Harvey's other movie successes. In fact in Hollywood, Harvey Weinstein ranks somewhere close to God. A 2013 study of Oscars speeches over the last 60 years  revealed that the producer has been thanked a total of 12 times - more than the Almighty himself. Will Cressida be clutching a little golden man and thanking Harvey Weinstein in the future? Watch this space.

"With no leads and no motive, California investigators have turned to the public for help in finding the person who killed a 3-week-old baby girl found in a dumpster after shooting her family. Long Beach Police Chief Robert Luna said the lack of direction in the investigation and the dearth of information from the injured victims was frustrating. 'If you're talking about a crime that occurred at 6pm on a Saturday in a highly dense, congested residential area, somebody had to have seen or heard something,' Luna said at a Monday news conference. Scroll down for video . Mystery death: Three-week-old Eliza Delacruz was found dead inside a dumpster near the Mexican border after her parents and uncle were wounded in a shooting. Three days later, police still have no clues . Ignoble resting place: A plumber goes about his business Monday Jan. 5, 2015 behind a pizza restaurant where baby Eliza was found dead Sunday in Imperial Beach, California . Road trip: The gunman drove for 120 miles from Long Beach, where the three people were shot, to Imperial Beach on the Mexican border, where Eliza's body was found in a dumpster . The baby's parents and uncle have spoken with police but it was too early to know if the family was withholding clues, Luna said. Detectives do not believe the crime was a random act, and the FBI is assisting in the investigation, Luna said. The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors today offered a $25,000 reward for information leading to an arrest and conviction. 'Every homicide is important, but when you have a homicide that deals with a 3-week-old baby, that just takes it to a different level,' Luna told reporters. Long Beach detectives have only a limited description of the culprit and are looking for a man who is either black or Hispanic. They don't have a description of a car or a license plate number, so they were unable to issue an Amber Alert over the weekend for the missing newborn, Eliza Delacruz. Luna said nothing is being ruled out at this point, including that the gunman has fled to Mexico, or that family members or a drug cartel are involved. The mother and uncle remained hospitalized in critical condition Monday. The father was released Sunday and is now staying at an undisclosed location. Sad sight: Memorial flowers and balloons are placed outside the home of three-week-old Eliza Delacruz Monday in Long Beach . Plea for help: With Long Beach Mayor Robert Garcia standing next to him at left, police Chief Robert Luna pleads with the public for information in the death of baby Eliza Monday . 'We don't have the complete picture yet, but we're going to get there,' Luna said. A transient found the body of the 10-pound baby girl Sunday in a trash bin behind a strip mall in the 600 block of Palm Drive in Imperial Beach, a two-hour drive south of the Long Beach neighborhood where her father, mother and uncle were shot. Mourners erected a makeshift memorial of candles, flowers, teddy bears and pink balloons outside a pizza shop at the mall. 'To take a precious child from home, throw her in a dumpster like a piece of trash, is something only a very heartless person would do,' Luna said. 'We need to get the coward who committed this violent, senseless act off the street, but we absolutely need the public’s help to do this.' Long Beach police Lt. Lloyd Cox said the deceased child's family are keeping mum for fear of retaliation. The San Diego County medical examiner's office said it was unknown where or when the infant died. An autopsy had not yet been performed, and no cause of death was released. Horrifying find: A transient found the body of the 10-pound baby girl Sunday in a trash bin behind a strip mall in the 600 block of Palm Drive in Imperial Beach .

A lock holds closed the gate to the alley where the body of three-week-old Eliza was found in the blue dumpster . Long Beach Police Chief Robert Luna said the crime took place in a densely populated residential area in early evening, which means that somebody had to have seen or heard something . Aaron Cruz, who lives next door to the victims' two-story stucco house in the 100 block of West 51st Street, said the baby's father is a veterinary technician who works six days a week and was thrilled to be a dad. Cruz, who described himself as the man's best friend, said the family often hosted large barbecues on their front lawn after moving in a few years ago. The baby's parents and uncle lived there with another uncle and the baby's grandparents, but no one else was there when the shooting happened, Cruz said. 'He had just gotten off work, and this happened to him. It was a normal day for him,' he said. 'This was out of nowhere.' Cruz recalled a large baby shower with dancing that the family threw in November. 'It was his first and only daughter,' Cruz said, as he relit candles that had fizzled out in the breeze. 'He was robbed of fatherhood.'","Eliza Delacruz was abducted from her home in Long Beach Saturday after shooting .

"A warning over the growing use of CCTV and its sinister potential was issued yesterday by Britain’s surveillance tsar. Independent commissioner Tony Porter said he was troubled by the public’s lack of concern about how much they were being watched and monitored. He also warned that the proliferation of spy cameras and their increasing sophistication raised issues of privacy and ‘what sort of society we want to live in’. Scroll down for video . Independent surveillance commissioner Tony Porter has said he was troubled by the growing use of CCTV cameras . Mr Porter said he was nervous about the growing use of technology such as body-worn video, drones and number plate recognition systems, or ANPR, to monitor our movements. Police, housing and environmental health officers, landlords, door supervisors, university security staff and even supermarket workers are now wearing state-of-the-art cameras to capture anti-social behaviour on film. In his first full interview in his role as surveillance commissioner, Mr Porter said: ‘The lack of public awareness about the nature of surveillance troubles me. ‘When people say “the public love CCTV”, do they really know what it does and its capability? Do they know with advancing technology, and algorithms, it starts to predict behaviour? 'If people are going round with surveillance equipment attached to them, there should be a genuinely good and compelling reason for that. ‘It changes the nature of society and raises moral and ethical issues about what sort of society we want to live in.’ Mr Porter urged public bodies, including the police, to be more transparent about how they are increasingly using smart cameras to monitor people . Fears of yobbish behaviour at an Asda supermarket in Dundee led to security staff being issued with body worn cameras. Meanwhile, guards at universities, including Newcastle, Essex, Bath and Bangor, have started wearing body cameras and microphones in a bid to reduce crime and fights on campuses. Mr Porter, a former senior counter-terrorism officer at the London Olympics, told the Guardian: ‘There’s a security argument, but there’s also a personal freedom argument. Have universities been transparent with students and parents?’ He was appointed in March and is responsible for overseeing around 100,000 publicly-operated CCTV cameras out of total of up to 6million surveillance cameras nationwide. Public authorities and commercial CCTV systems have to comply with a code of practice setting out transparency requirements and a number of measures about how recordings can be stored and used. But the code does not apply to householders who have installed CCTV on properties to deter burglars and other crime – leading to a 200 per cent surge in complaints about spying neighbours. Mr Porter urged public bodies, including the police, to be more transparent about how they are increasingly using smart cameras to monitor people. He warned that spiralling levels of surveillance technology, especially lightweight cameras worn on uniforms, could harm community policing by making the public reluctant to talk if they were confronted with ‘a million pixels up their nostrils’. He said: ‘It is wrong not to be transparent because it impacts… on the whole psyche of the community. It is very dangerous to walk into a datafied society, where everybody is a number and everybody can be linked via ANPR to facial recognition, to another thing.’ Discussing drones, Mr Porter said: ‘Every time a drone is operating with a surveillance camera attached to it, then the risk of a privacy impact in a public space rises exponentially.’ He also urged who received the hi-tech machines to use them responsibly. He said: ‘You might say “it’s just a toy” but used repeatedly, hovering over a neighbour’s house, is going to cause an issue. You should use it with a great deal of sensitivity.’","Tony Porter said he was troubled by public's lack of concern over CCTV .

"Four people including a toddler were killed Tuesday and two more people were taken to hospitals after an early morning trailer home fire in southeast Ohio. Neighbors calling 911 reported hearing an explosion just after 4 a.m. Fairfield County Sheriff Dave Phalen said those reports were under investigation, and the cause of the fire was unknown. 'Oh my God! ... The trailer across the road just blew up,' reported the first caller, whose name wasn't included in an audio recording released by the sheriff's office. ' I'm going to say they're probably all there. Oh my Lord! Something just blew up over there. Holy crap!' The trailer fire was the third multiple-death home fire in Ohio in less than four weeks (library image) Phalen said authorities were searching for a possible seventh person who might have been inside the trailer home, which collapsed. No identities or information about the relationships of those inside were immediately available. 'It's completely gutted,' Phalen said. 'There are partial walls that are up, but the inside is completely gone.' He said a woman who appeared to be badly injured was taken to Ohio State University's medical center, some 40 miles northwest of the rural lot where the trailer stood, outside the village of Sugar Grove. A man was transported to nearby Fairfield Medical Center. The sheriff didn't have information on their conditions. Phalen said firefighters from seven departments responded, hindered on hilly two-lane roads by overnight snowfall. Fairfield County was under a Level 1 snow emergency, meaning motorists were urged to be very cautious because of hazardous conditions. The Ohio State Fire Marshal's office sent investigators to the site, which Phalen said was still smoldering several hours later. The trailer fire was the third multiple-death home fire in Ohio in less than four weeks. Three children were killed in a Dec. 12 house fire in Hamilton, in southwest Ohio, and a woman and three grandchildren were killed Dec. 26 in a fire near Washington Court House, about 40 miles southwest of Columbus. Fire Marshal's spokeswoman Lindsey Burnworth said Tuesday that investigations of those fires were continuing.","Neighbors reported hearing an explosion and called 911 .

"Police believe that a great grandmother with no known enemies or criminal links was deliberately targeted by a killer who shot her at point-blank range in the doorway of her western Sydney home. Despite this, detectives are still yet to identify who was responsible for the execution-style murder in November. Helen Dawson Key, 75, was found dead in her home in Toongabie on November 20, around 16 hours after her death. She had been shot in the head just prior to 6pm on November 19, with forensics ruling that the bullet passed through the screen door before striking her. Family, friends and neighbours cannot understand how a 'very well-liked' and 'lovely lady' met such a grim end almost two months ago. Great Grandmother Helen Dawson Key, 75, was shot in the head at the front door of her home in Sydney's western suburbs. Police are baffled by her killing two months later . Many had come to the conclusion that it must have been a random attack or a case of mistaken identity. However, police have confirmed that the killer had intended to murder Ms Dawson Key before the crime, according to news.com.au. It's alleged that investigators are yet to definitively determine a motive. Police are still trying to identify a man who was captured on CCTV footage near the crime scene. They believe the man will be able to help police with their investigations. In the vision, the unknown male wears dark clothing and walks with a ‘very recognisable’ limp near the scene of the crime, according to The Daily Telegraph. Police have appealed to the public on several occasions but are yet to make contact with the man, who was filmed in a neighbouring suburb, McCoy Park. The public is also encouraged to come forward with any information pertaining to the case. At the time of Ms Dawson Key's death, Homicide Squad Commander, Detective Superintendent Michael Willing said it was a struggle to understand why she had been the victimo of such a disturbing crime. Even the dog was not barking: The ordinarily quite Paris Place in Sydney's Toongabie where Helen Dawson Key was shot through the screen of her front door last week . 'Mrs Dawson Key had no known links with crime, no known enemies, and by all accounts was a well-liked and highly-regarded member of the local community,' Det Supt Willing said. 'Mrs Dawson Key’s front door was open, but her screen door was shut, so we think she might have answered a knock at the door. 'She had lived at this address for more than 30 years and had strong links with her neighbours and a local bowling club. 'We are, frankly, at a loss as to why someone would want to target her.' Helen Dawson Key was a respected member of her close-knit community, a long-time member of the Toongabbie Sports and Bowling Club and was Vice President of the Ladies Bowling Club for the last fourteen years. Friend and lawn bowls partner Mary Gibson said she couldn't understand how this could happen to  'a very, very nice lady.' 'I've only been here 12 months but Helen was a very well-liked lady, played bowls, we still don't know why,' Ms Gibson told Daily Mail Australia.'What I do know is she was a lovely person and I really loved playing bowls with her. Each week we'd have a different partner but I loved playing with her.' 'I loved playing bowls with her': Helen Dawson Keys developed 'many strong friendships' as Vice President of the Toongabbie Ladies Bowling Club for the past 14 years . Mrs Dawson Key's next-door neighbour of 14 years, Zhu Kayw, says she called the police after hearing a shot on the day that the 75-year-old was killed. 'We just heard the shot, bang that's it, just one that's all,' she said. 'There was no trouble before that - very quiet, even the dog was not barking,' he said. 'She lived alone, her partner passed away a few years ago. 'We would just meet and say hello when we collect the rubbish bins and bills - we would say ""hello, how are you? She was very friendly, yes.' When the 75-year-old was found dead, another resident on the street, Paris Place, said neighbours were in shock. 'Yes it's terribly sad but as residents we're not really speaking about it out of respect for Helen,' she said. 'Not that we know anything really anyway, to offer anything new.' It's understood that Mrs Dawson Key, who has lived alone for several years, could have been dead for up to 16 hours before she was found behind her front door. Helen Dawson Key was found by a friend and member the Toongabbie Bowling Club, where she had been a member for more than 20 years . A week after her death, the Toongabbie Sports and Bowling Club released a statement to confirm that Mrs Dawson Key was found by a concerned friend and club member who noted her absence at a recent event. They said this was 'reflective of the friendships Helen had formed at the club, and the tight knit friendships within the community'. 'Helen Dawson was a valued and respected part of the Toongabbie community having been involved with the clubs Lady Bowlers for some 20 years. She was a committed member volunteering her time to co-ordinate the ladies activities and formed many strong friendships within the club,' the statement read. 'The club's community is shocked and dismayed at the circumstances surrounding Helen’s death and cannot understand how a respected senior citizen and friend could come to harm in her own home.' Strike Force Elermore has been established to investigate Mrs Dawson Key’s death and needed the community’s help. 'What we’re asking is for anyone who was in the area around the time of Mrs Dawson Key’s death, or has information about her movements that day, to come forward.' People are asked to speak with police if they have any information regarding the victim’s life, her movements that day, or if they were in the area on November 19.

"It may look like a Portacabin that has been involved in a nasty accident, but this slanting roofed building is actually the ultimate ecohome. The house, which was designed by Norway's Research Centre on Zero Emission Buildings and architecture firm Snøhetta, produces more than three times more energy than it needs. Built in Larvick, Norway, this prototype for what could become the homes of the future, has a roof covered in 1,614 square feet (150 square metres) of solar panels to produce electricity. The roof of the Zero Energy Pilot House has been angled to the southeast to capture as much sun as possible . The roof has been slanted at exactly 19 degrees and is angled towards the south east to ensure that it can capture as much sunlight as possible and also incorporates thermal solar panels for heating water and uses rainwater collectors for use in the toilet and in the garden. The windows are also designed to capture as much sunlight as possible to help keep the home warm while heat exchangers warm incoming air and tap water. The designers claim that the house should produce 19,200kWh of electricity from its solar panels each year while solar collectors used for heating water gather a further 4,000 kWh annually. In total is produces enough energy to boil a kettle 185,600 times. However, the building needs just 7,272 kWh per year - the equivalent of boiling a kettle 58,000 times. Perhaps surprisingly for an energy efficient home, it also includes a swimming pool and a sauna. The water for the pool and shower is heated using surplus heat from inside the building while the sauna is heated using firewood. The house also features an outdoor dining area made from recycled timber and has a vegetable garden to enable small scale food production. Each floor has a single radiator that is capable of heating the entire house. Each room also has sensors to ensure that air and light is directed to those that are being used. Snøhetta, which also designed the National September 11 Memorial Museum & Pavilion at the World Trade Center site, claims that the house can also use energy from geothermal wells - drawing heat up from underground. They claim it should produce enough surplus energy to run an electric family car. Norwegian researchers and architects have designed the house to meet the needs of an average family without connecting to the grid . The house has been constructed from materials to make as little impact on the environment as possible . Many of the materials used to construct the house have been chosen to make as little impact on the house's carbon emissions as possible. Snøhetta said: 'The volume of the house describes a single family house, however, the building is intended for use as a demonstration platform. 'The house has a characteristic tilt towards southeast and a sloping roof surface clad with solar panels and collectors. The outdoor dining area (left) has been built with recycled wood and timber to give the house a cabin-like feel . The outdoor pool is heated using excess heat drawn from inside the house while the sauna (left) uses firewood . 'These elements, together with geothermal energy from energy wells in the ground, will serve the energy needs of the family house and generate enough surplus to power an electric car year-round. 'The project has a strong focus on retaining home-like qualities through non-quantifiable properties. 'Emotive comfort and sense of well-being have governed the design process to the same extent as energy demands. 'The grounds employ a variety of spaces that can be enjoyed year-round.' The roof is covered in photovoltaic panels to produce electricity and thermal solar cells to heat a water boiler .

"This is the emotional moment a man who was wrongly imprisoned for nearly four decades for murder met and forgave the young witness whose false testimony put him behind bars. Ricky Jackson, 57, was exonerated in November after spending a staggering 39 years in prison for a crime he did not commit - the robbing and shooting murder of a money-order salesman in 1975. His conviction at the age of 18 - which led to him being placed on death row, with his sentence later commuted to life  - was largely based on the testimony of a 12-year-old boy named Edward Vernon. At the time, Vernon claimed under oath that he saw Jackson pull the trigger - even though he was actually several blocks away on a school bus. But in 2013, he went back on his testimony. Scroll down for video . Emotional: This is the moment Ricky Jackson - who was wrongly imprisoned for nearly four decades for murder - met and forgave Edward Vernon (right), whose false testimony put him behind bars in 1975 . Embrace: Jackson, 57, was exonerated in November after spending a staggering 39 years in prison for a crime he did not commit. His conviction at the age of 18 was largely based on Vernon's testimony as a 12-year-od . A lesson in forgiveness: At the time, Vernon claimed under oath that he saw Jackson pull the trigger - even though he was actually several blocks away on a school bus. But in 2013, he went back on his testimony . Dramatically changing his account, he said: 'All the information was fed to me - I don't have any knowledge about what happened at the scene of the crime.' Now, following Jackson's release on November 21, the pair have finally met outside of court for the first time in a heart-wrenching encounter that was captured on video by CBS. In the footage, Jackson beams and holds his hand out as he approaches Vernon, now 52, in a church. Incredibly, he tells him: 'It took a lot of courage to do what you did. Thank you man.' The pair then warmly embrace and Vernon starts sobbing, telling the former detainee: 'I'm sorry.' Jackson, dressed in a long blue coat, replies: 'It's all right brother. We were both victims man. It's alright. I do forgive you man. I wanted to be here personally to tell you that.' Speaking to the broadcaster after their meeting, Vernon, who claims police encouraged him to lie in his testimony, said: 'Wow, how could this man hug and embrace me after all these years?.' Free at least: Jackson, pictured speaking to CBS this month, nearly seven weeks after his exoneration, told Vernon: 'We were both victims man. It's alright. I do forgive you. I wanted to be here personally to tell you that' Wrongful conviction: Jackson (pictured, left, in his police mugshot) was convicted of the murder of Harry Franks in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1975. Right, Vernon, now aged 52, later admitted his testimony was 'all lies' Crime scene: This photograph shows the aftermath of the murder for which Jackson was convicted . Jackson was convicted of the murder of Harry Franks in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1975, alongside two other men who have both since been exonerated: Wiley Bridgeman, 60, and Kwame Ajamu. Although at the time, police had no physical evidence to link the trio to the killing, they had testimony from Vernon, who claimed to have seen Jackson shoot Franks with the help of the other two. The trio were initially sentenced to death, but their sentences were commuted to life in 1978 after a Supreme Court ruling. They all spent years behind bars at Cuyahoga County Jail. Indeed, Jackson's sentence was the longest served for a wrongful conviction in U.S history. Thankful: Although at the time, police had no physical evidence to link Jackson to the killing, they had testimony from Vernon, who claimed to have seen him shoot Franks. Above, Jackson finds out he has been exonerated . Ecstatic: When he exited the courthouse, Jackson said: 'The English language doesn't even fit what I'm feeling' However, in 2013, Vernon recanted his testimony, saying that police officers coerced him into testifying and gave him details of the case, Cleveland.com reported. 'They knew that I didn't see anything,' he said. 'Everybody knew it was a lie. All these years I've been holding this shame and guilt inside, wanting to come forward and do the right thing.' Vernon - whose unreliable testimony was highlighted in an article by Cleveland Scene magazine in 2011 - eventually confided in his pastor, Anthony Singleton. He said he had initially fingered Jackson because he had seen him around the neighborhood. In good spirits: Jackson is pictured shaking hands with well-wishers following his exoneration in November . Also free: Kwame Ajamu (pictured) and Wiley Bridgeman (left) were also exonerated for the killing of Franks . When he dismissed Jackson's case in November, Judge Richard McMonagle said, 'Life is filled with small victories, and this is a big one.' Meanwhile, Jackson said when he exited the courthouse: 'The English language doesn't even fit what I'm feeling. I'm on an emotional high.' Jackson is now looking forward to his new life as a free man. He has so far applied for a library card and started studying for his driving theory test. He has also moved into a new home without bars and set mealtimes.","Ricky Jackson, 57, sentenced to death in 1975 for 'murdering salesman'

The London Mayor hailed the Duke of York for doing a 'huge amount of unsung, unheralded work for this country'. It follows four days of torrid headlines for the prince after the allegations emerged in court papers on Friday. Scroll down for video . London Mayor Boris Johnson expressed sympathy for Prince Andrew over the sex allegations in a US court. The two men are pictured at an event in London in 2013 . Andrew has been accused of abusing a girl 'procured' for him by his close friend and convicted paedophile, Jeffrey Epstein. The extraordinary allegation was made by Virginia Roberts as part of a US civil case against shamed billionaire Epstein. She claims Prince Andrew had sex with her when she was 17 - a minor under US law - and employed as a 'sex slave' by Epstein. Buckingham Palace has strenuously denied the allegations in three statements. Today, Mr Johnson expressed his support for the Prince. Speaking on LBC radio, he said: 'Prince Andrew, let’s be very clear, is a guy who does a huge amount of unsung, unheralded work for this country and people, they go on and on about air miles and so on – actually, I’ve seen that guy get out there and sell this country, try and help British firms to get business around the world. 'He does a huge amount of good and a huge amount of hard work. So if you ask me whether I have sympathy for him, of course I do.' He added that the prince is a 'familiar and welcome figure in governments and countries around the world, because he helps to open doors'. Mr Johnson went on: 'We may think it's bizarre, but somebody who is the second son of the Queen is felt, in many parts of the world, to be an interesting and significant figure, and they want to receive him cordially. 'And people who come with him are...they want to hear what business suggestions they have. And so I think that, you know, people should respect that side of his work.' David Cameron, meanwhile, failed to offer his public support to the Prince over the allegations. In an interview by the radio station LBC for Heart FM Wales, the Prime Minister said: ‘I’m not going to make any comment on it. Obviously, the Prince has made his own views very, very clear, and I think I’ll leave it at that.’ Andrew, who spent last week holidaying in a chalet in Verbier the chalet, flew back to the UK by private jet on Sunday afternoon with Eugenie. Sources say there are no immediate plans for him to travel to Norfolk, where the Queen is in residence until early February, although it was indicated they had spoken by phone. Sarah Ferguson has launched an extraordinary defence of her former husband Prince Andrew, describing him as 'the greatest man there is'. The Duchess of York has kept a low profile at the luxury Swiss ski chalet where she has been holidaying with Andrew and their younger daughter Eugenie. The Duke of York leaves his chalet with his daughter Eugenie and boyfriend Jack Brooksbank after holidaying in Verbier in the  Swiss alps . Sarah Ferguson has come out in defence of her ex-husband, Prince Andrew, insisting: 'He is the greatest man there is.' The Duchess of York has stayed on at the ski resort where she and the Duke were staying with family and friends when the sex scandal broke last week . But she emerged from the £22,000-a-week chalet and went for a mountain walk dressed in black sportswear. Choosing her words carefully, she declined to comment directly on the scandal engulfing her former husband. Asked by the Daily Mail if she was sticking by the Duke, she replied: ‘The York family is a tight unit. We’ve always been a tight unit. ‘He is the greatest man there is. It was the finest moment of my life in 1986 when I married him. He is a great man, the best man in the world.’ It is understood that the prince has been fashioning a battle plan with his private secretary, Amanda Thirsk, a former banker who has been trying to rebuild his public image as an unofficial champion for British business. Royal lawyers Harbottle and Lewis have also been on speed-dial and have written to the British media reminding them of Andrew’s categorical denials of the allegations against him. Privately, aides continue to insist it is ‘business as usual’ for the prince, whose next public appearance is likely to be at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on January 21. It is believed that he will also host a reception there in his personal capacity on behalf of business leaders, as he has done in previous years. A source said: ‘The duke is nothing if not resilient and will not go to ground.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","London Mayor has seen the Duke 'get out there and sell this country'

"A grieving mother has defended her heartbreaking decision to spend thousands of pounds on presents for her baby, despite the fact he died before birth. Sabrina McKenna, 34, says shopping for gifts for her son helps her cope  with her loss and pay tribute to  Jamie, who died aged 32 weeks in June, 2012. But her decision to post images of what would have been her son's nursery crammed with gifts and toys has led to her being abused online. Sabrina McKenna, 34, says shopping for gifts for her baby son Jamie helps her cope with her loss . Sabrina has now decided to speak out about her experience to make people understand why she enjoys buying toys for her son. She said: 'Buying presents for Jamie helps me cope with my loss, so who has the right to judge or attack me for that? 'I'm sick of people's cruel comments about me. I've been through enough already without receiving vile messages from strangers.' She continued: 'Buying toys for him is my way of feeling close to him. 'There are so many things that he never got to do and I never got to do for him, so this small act helps me - we all cope in different ways. 'If it offends people, they shouldn't look. If placing toys in his room gives me the strength to carry on, who has got the right to tell me to stop?' Sabrina cradles her baby son Jamie, who died in the womb eight weeks before her due date . Miss McKenna was 31 when she finally conceived with her partner after convincing herself she might never be able to fall pregnant. She explained: 'I'd had a long term relationship in the past and we had tried unsuccessfully for many years with no joy.' So she was ecstatic when her dream came true and at 20 weeks, she learned she was carrying a son. She said: 'I had always loved the name Jamie and told anyone who would listen that I couldn't wait to spoil him rotten after waiting for so long to have him.' The only time Sabrina McKenna felt any peace was in Jamie's nursery, surrounded by all his things . Miss McKenna, a former office worker from Omagh, Co. Tyrone, decorated the nursery and awaited her son's arrival. But at 32 weeks a routine scan failed to pick up a heartbeat. She said: 'He was due in eight weeks. I kept saying there must be a mistake and praying they were wrong. I just could not believe what was happening.' But consultants confirmed Jamie had died and Miss McKenna was to be induced. After a 12-hour labour, her baby was born and Miss McKenna recalled desperately hoping to hear a cry. Back home she planned her son's funeral and the night before it took place, she brought him home. She said: 'It gave me a tiny comfort to have him home, just for one night. It meant that he was in the nursery I had prepared for him.' The stress of Jamie's death led to Sabrina's split with her partner, making her  spend more time in the nursery . Buying toys for Jamie is Sabrina's way of saying, 'you are gone but I am still thinking of you,' she said . Over the coming months she was engulfed by depression and despair as she struggled to come to terms with her loss. She said: 'The only time I felt any peace at all was sitting in his nursery among all his things - the clothes and toys I had bought for him when he was alive.' A postmortem found that her placenta had stopped working and Jamie had not been growing, but did not confirm why. The stress of the death lead her to split with her partner and Miss McKenna says she started to spend even more time in her son's nursery. Then one day, she decided to buy a few more toys. She said: 'I had been so happy when I was getting ready for Jamie's arrival so I thought why not keep buying for him? He is still my son. Sabrina says her methods of coping with the death of her  baby son help give her the strength to carry on . Sabrina survived her first Christmas after Jamie's stillbirth by buying a present and taking it to his grave . 'I went shopping and picked up a few bits and for those few hours I felt some peace and then joy when I took them home and placed them on his shelf. 'It was just my way of saying to him 'you are gone but I am still thinking of you.' Six months later, the first Christmas she had been dreading arrived and Miss McKenna said spending £200 on a remote control toy and cuddly characters eased her pain. She said: 'I took them to his grave to show him. It got me through the day, so I was grateful.' She now runs half marathons to raise money for neonatal death charity SANDS . Sabrina's family and close friends supported her decision but others failed to understand. A year after the birth, she decided to arrange a 'birthday party' to mark Jamie's anniversary. She booked a bouncy castle and invited family and friends who also brought presents for Jamie. Miss McKenna said: 'I was so moved that people understood and it turned what could have been the most horrific day into a happy one. How can anyone say this is wrong?' But several people started to make nasty comments after Miss McKenna began posting images of her son's toys online. She reveals that she has been labelled a freak and a weirdo and told to 'forget and move on'. She said: 'It's heartbreaking because people don't have to look. 'Why shouldn't I do something that makes that pain just a little easier.' The former factory worker, who runs half marathons to raise money for neonatal death charity Sands, has not been able to work since losing her son and pays for his gifts using money saved from her benefits. This year, she spent £300 on toys and a bike for Christmas – her third without him. She said: 'I will never get the chance to do all the things I wanted to do for Jamie. This is the only way I can express my love. 'I hope that one day I will feel strong enough to donate all of his wonderful toys to charity. 'I love the idea of other children getting pleasure from the things I have bought for Jamie. But until then they will stay in his room. 'I wish he was there too but nothing can change that. 'All I can do is continue in the way I have found that makes life easier and if you don't want to try and least to understand then please just look the other way instead of posting nasty messages. 'I just hope the people that are ridiculing me never have to understand what it feels like to lose a much wanted baby.' According to the neonatal death charity Sands, each year in the UK over 6,500 babies die just before, during or soon after birth. That’s 17 babies every day. Stillbirth rates in the UK haven't changed since the late 1990s, with one in every 200 births ending in stillbirth. One in every 300 babies dies within the first four weeks of life. More than 90 per cent of babies who are stillborn have no congenital abnormality. Around a third of stillbirths are unexplained and occur with perfectly formed, normal-sized babies. One in three stillbirths happen at near term when babies could survive if they were delivered. Visit uk-sands.org for more information.","Sabrina McKenna, from Omagh, Co.

"A mysterious glowing orb has been filmed breaking away from an unidentified meteorite-like object as it streaked across the sky above California. The unusual object can be seen moving through the sky leaving a long tail behind that is characteristic of space debris or a meteorite burning up in the atmosphere. But after a few seconds a second round object separates from the main fireball and moves off in the opposite direction. Mystery balls: The orb broke apart and two pieces moved in opposite directions above southern California . UFO hunters have claimed the bright orb may have been some sort of escape pod from a crashing ship. However, others have said it is more likely to have been a meteorite breaking apart in the atmosphere. There have been several sightings of meteorite fireballs in the US over the past week, with many reports coming from California. There have been some suggestions that this may be a meteorite passing through Earth's atmosphere - especially considering the Quadrantids meteorite shower is currently at its peak. However, most experts think it is travelling too slow to be a meteorite - they usually travel much faster. It could also be a man-made spacecraft re-entering Earth's atmosphere but, as Ben Biggs of All About Space points out, if it was a large spacecraft then we'd probably know about it. California is also near Nevada, home of the top secret base Area 51, so it could be some sort of military project. The predominant theory at the moment, though, is that it is simply a hoax - all the more likely as there are no other videos of the event. If it had been real, it is likely that it would have been seen and captured on video by many people, not just one. The past couple of days have also seen astronomers enjoying the peak of the annual Quadrantids meteor shower. The fireball was spotted by Ken Roberts while he was driving home from work in southern California. He said: 'I was driving home after work when this UFO or whatever you call it caught my eye. 'I pulled over in front of somebody's house to film it. I would have got a better shot but I didn't want to jump these people's fence. 'Anyway I don't know what the hell to make of it. Couldn't have been a plane cause there was no noise. And I never heard a crash after either. 'The Orb thing flew straight up into the sky and disappeared.' He posted the video on YouTube on Monday evening but did not say when or where the footage had been filmed, other than the general area of California. ‘I think it could be something re-entering and bits coming off it,’ said Ben Biggs, editor of All About Space magazine. ‘However, if it was a big spacecraft then we’d probably know about it. ‘Could it be a meteorite? It’s a bit slow to be one as they normally travel much faster through the atmosphere, although we are at the peak of the Quadrantids meteor shower. ‘It could also simply be some clever photoshop, especially considering there don’t seem to be any other videos of the event which would surely have been seen by many people. 'Also, California is right next to Nevada, home of the top secret base inside Area 51. There's always a chance that this is some military project gone awry.' Reports of a fireball above California were received by the American Meteor Society on 3 January 2015 . The video shows around 30 seconds of footage of the UFO before cutting off abruptly and showing a black screen for the final two minutes. According to the UFO news site OpenMinds, the smaller orb breaking away from the main fireball is 'peculiar'. It said: 'The smaller orb UFO in this video behaves differently than typical meteorite debris.' According to the American Meteor Society, there have been several reports of meteorites across the US over the past week. It received more than 1,500 eyewitness accounts - mainly in New York but some as far away as Maine and California - of a bright fireball passing through the sky on 29 December. The society also said it has also received 17 reports from eyewitnesses in northern California of a fireball in the sky on 3 January. The Central Intelligence Agency has said that they are responsible for at least half of the UFO sightings reported in the 1950s and 60s. The US agency explained that many UFO sightings over that period were directly correlated to tests on the U-2 spy plane. The plane was being flown at altitudes of more than 60,000 feet, once thought an impossible height to fly at. Analysts at the CIA soon realized that UFO sightings lined up with the place and time the U-2 planes were flying. The CIA admitted that many UFO sightings in the 1950s and 60s were tests on its U-2 spy plane (shown) However, they purposefully chose not to let people know that what they were seeing were not aliens but spies. Now U-2 planes are flown by the United States Air Force and 104 have been built in total. In 2013 the CIA officially acknowledged the existence of Area 51. The site, a badly kept secret for decades, has fueled the imaginations of conspiracy theorists and UFO hunters around the world. Documents released by the CIA confirmed the mysterious airbase existed and revealed its exact location in Nevada. Official maps usually only show a disused mine at the site or a large area of restricted airspace, however it does feature on Google Maps and in satellite images. The documents also revealed some strange goings on at the secret base - but not the kind that UFO hunters have believed. They revealed that among the jobs staff at the site had to perform during the 1960s was a routine of vacuuming the runway to allow the experimental U-2 aircraft to take off without damaging their engines. Eyewitnesses reported briefly seeing a fireball (top right) in the skies above New York on 29 December 2014 . Mike Hankey, from the American Meteor Society, said: 'This video looks fake. It was published on Jan 5th and we had no reports of fireballs in southern california on Jan 5th or Jan 4th.' One eyewitness calling themselves Subramanian N described the fireball as having a green colour. They said: 'I saw a secondary little fireball (very light) at the time of maximum brightness of the first fireball.' Others reported seeing a small flash as the fireball faded from view. One said: 'Some fragments seemed to emanate from the tail as it fell.' One man from Eagen, Minnesota, reported seeing what he thought was a satellite in the sky that appeared to break into two objects. Writing on UFO website Mutual UFO Network (MUFON), he said: 'As the object came next to the moon there was an extremely brief flash from its right side and a momentary trail and secondary object, that looked like a yellow/green fireball slightly larger than the first object, as if shot out or ejected, was observed for less than a second. 'The primary light continued on its straight path for another second or two and then disappeared. 'I am unsure if what I observed and laid out in my narrative is what happened or if some light phenomenon caused by the satellite passing by the brilliantly lit half moon created an effect that I saw.' However, some commentators have have questioned whether the latest video is genuine and may have been digitally edited after filming. The annual Quandratid Meteor Shower (seen here above Banff National Park, Canada) reached its peak on Monday and may be responsible for the increase in sightings of fireballs and meteorites in recent days . Mr Roberts did not respond to questions put to him by the MailOnline. His YouTube account contains only one other video that was uploaded on the same day as the UFO video and claims to be a film of seagulls in New York. Nigel Watson, author of the UFO Investigation Manual, said regardless of what it was, the video has got UFO believers excited. He said: 'This could be a meteor or space junk crashing back to Earth, but what the so-called 'white orb' leaving it has certainly got UFO believers excited. 'They wonder if it is an escape pod being ejected from a crashing UFO. 'At first it just looks like something falling out of the trail of the object, but it carries on under its own power rather than falling away as you might expect. 'It makes me wonder if it is a completely different object that just looks as if it is coming out of this fireball trail. 'Whatever these events are, they are very unusual even if they are not flying saucers occupied by little green men plunging to Earth in a spectacular fashion.' Giles Sparrow, a space and astronomy journalist, said that while unusual, the orb was probably part of a meteorite fireball breaking apart as it entered the atmosphere. He said: 'It's almost certainly a fireball breaking apart in the upper atmosphere. 'These things have been floating about in space for billion of years, and their interiors are very, very cold. 'They formed from dust grains clumping together in the solar system, and often have cracks and weak spots that can break them apart when their surfaces suddenly heat up - it just so happens that in this case, the crack was in the right place enough to send a large fragment flying off in the other direction.' He added that the fireball appears to be moving slowly across the sky due to perspective it is filmed from and because of the time of day it was filmed. He said: 'Meteoroids approaching Earth's 'trailing' hemisphere as it moves through space have to 'catch up' with our planet before they enter the atmosphere.' Nick Howes, Pro-Am  coordinator at the Faulkes Telescope Project, added: 'I'd guess a re-entry of some space junk if I were a betting man. 'It's burning up in the upper atmosphere, indicating a high velocity, it does appear to be moving ""slowly"" which may be due to the angle from which footage was taken.'","Strange fireball was spotted by commuter Ken Roberts as he drove home .

"Brian McIlhagga (pictured) died after being attacked by men who forced their way into his friend's house . A father of five has died after being dragged out of a house before being beaten and shot in the leg by at least three masked men. Brian McIlhagga, 42, died after being attacked by the men who forced their way into his friend's house in Ballymoney in County Antrim, Northern Ireland, last night. Mr McIlhagga, a plasterer, was dragged out of the property - in a quiet cul-de-sac - beaten and shot once in the leg in the front garden. Despite frantic resuscitation efforts by neighbours, he died at the scene. His friend, a 32-year-old woman, who he was visiting when he was attacked, was also beaten by the masked men and forced to lie on the kitchen floor while the shooting took place outside. She was taken to hospital where she is said to be recovering from non life-threatening injuries. The women's four children, all aged 13 or under, were in the house when the gang burst in but it is understand that they didn't witness the killing. Chief inspector Michael Harvey, of Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) who is leading the investigation, said: 'Brian McIlhagga was dragged from the kitchen, down the hallway and out through the front door of the house. 'He was beaten and then shot once in the leg outside the house. 'Tragically, he died at the scene as a result of the injuries inflicted during the attack. 'We are waiting for a post mortem examination to take place to determine the exact cause of death. 'This was a vicious, brutal and sustained attack on a man who was visiting his friend. 'It is unusual for a town like Ballymoney and I understand how the community is shocked by what has happened. 'Mr McIlhagga was a friend of the woman who lived in the house at Riverview Park and had been a visitor in recent months. Brian McIlhagga, 42, died after being attacked by three masked men who forced their way into his friend's house in Ballymoney in County Antrim, Northern Ireland (pictured). He was beaten up and shot in the leg . Forensic experts were collecting evidence at the scene today as police confirmed the father of five's death was being treated as a murder enquiry. His friend, a 32-year-old woman, was also injured in last night's attack . 'The woman has four children, all under 13, and they were in the house last night.' A motive has yet to be established and the PSNI has not ruled out the involvement of paramilitaries. Mr Harvey added: 'I have no information to rule in or rule out paramilitaries or any other motives for this attack.' Police have not yet disclosed what type of weapon was used or whether other instruments were used during the beatings. However, they confirmed a full murder investigation was underway. Officers have set up a dedicated incident room at Ballymoney Police Station and are urging members of the public to come forward with information. Chief inspector Michael Harvey (right) urged members of the public to contact police with any information . Police and forensic experts could be seen at the scene of the murder today, collecting evidence (pictured) Mr Harvey said: 'I would appeal for anyone who was in the area of 10 Riverview Park between 10 and 11pm [last night] who saw any persons or any vehicles to contact detectives. 'Enquiries are at a very early stage. But, I would appeal to the local community to contact detectives. 'The victim has a minor criminal record but, he is certainly not a major criminal.' Detective chief inspector Richard Campbell added:  'I would appeal to anyone who was in the area at the time and witnessed this murder, saw any suspicious activity in the area or has any information to contact detectives at Ballymoney on 101 or crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.'","Brian McIlhagga, 42, was beaten and shot in the leg by three masked men .

"Imagine ever time you took a plane journey, the aircraft was scrapped and a new one was built for your next flight. That's the scenario facing space travel at the moment, with every part of a modern rocket that is sent to space either burning up in the atmosphere or being scrapped in an ocean on Earth. But now that could be set to change, as after launching at 11.20am GMT (6.20am EST) today SpaceX will attempt to return part of a rocket to a floating barge, ushering in an age of reusability. At least, that was the plan - but a fault with the second stage of the rocket meant the launch had to be cancelled during the countdown, and they will have to try again on Friday at 10.09am GMT (5.09am EST). Scroll down for video . SpaceX was planning to land a Falcon 9 rocket on a barge (shown) at Cape Canaveral today. The rocket would have attempted to land nine minutes after launching a Dragon capsule at 11.20am GMT (6.20am EST), but the launch had to be postponed due to an unknown issue . In their live feed for the launch Nasa said the failure was due to an 'actuator drift issue' with the second stage of the rocket. It is thought to have been an in issue with the thrust vector control for the rocket, which controls the direction of the thrust. This meant that during the countdown to launch, the fault was flagged up in the system and the countdown could not proceed. Communications Director for SpaceX John Taylor told MailOnline: ‘During the terminal count engineers observed drift on one of the two thrust vector actuators on the second stage that would likely have caused an automatic abort. The Falcon 9 rocket carrying Dragon will take off from Florida’s Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. After launch, at a height of about 56 miles (90km), the first stage of the rocket will separate from the second stage. While the latter continues its mission into orbit, the former would usually be left to fall back into the ocean - as is the case on all other rocket launches. This is a costly operation causing the price of launches to top £280 million ($440 million). SpaceX, however, is attempting to develop rockets that can make soft landings back on Earth so they can be recovered and recycled. This could bring the cost of launching to space down by at least a factor of ten - making it much more accessible. Eventually they also plan to return the second stage from orbit, allowing them to reassemble the rocket on the ground for another launch. ‘Engineers called a hold in order to take a closer look. SpaceX is scrubbed for today and we are now targeting launch on 9 January at 5:09am EST (10.09am GMT).’ The launch of the Falcon 9 rocket will take place from Cape Canaveral in Florida. It will be carrying the unmanned Dragon capsule on its fifth scheduled cargo mission (CRS-5) to the ISS - and sixth flight to the station overall - under contract with Nasa. But while that is an achievement in itself, of more interest is SpaceX’s plan after the launch. The attempted landing of the first stage of the rocket is expected about nine minutes after take-off. It will attempt to land on the Autonomous Spaceport Drone Ship (ASDS), which is essentially a barge, in the Pacific Ocean. While there are cameras on the ASDS, it’s unlikely SpaceX will stream the landing attempt live, as they are unsure how successful the attempt will be. CEO Elon Musk has said previously he thinks there is only a 50 per cent chance of success. However, successful or not, the test will be hugely important for the age of reusability. The various stages of rockets are normally left to fall into the ocean or burn up in the atmosphere after reaching space. SpaceX, though, wants to eventually make entire rockets reusable - like an airplane - allowing them to launch, land and then launch again. This mission will be a crucial step in that endeavour. The company has already tested the technology to land a rocket in a series of tests using the Grasshopper concept vehicle. This was a rocket attached with landing legs that performed short ‘hops’ on Earth, to a height of a few hundred metres, to test the technology needed to land. And this time that same technology will be used to bring the rocket back from the edge of space. The incredible attempt will occur during the launch of the latest cargo-carrying Dragon capsule to the ISS, called the CRS-5 mission, from Florida’s Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. Pictured is a previous Falcon 9 launch on 14 July 2014 - when SpaceX tested the ability of the rocket to land, but over the ocean . For now SpaceX is attempting to return only the first stage - the lower portion - of a rocket after launching. In future, they are hoping to return the entire rocket to ground. One of the key technologies in returning rockets will be 'grid fins', which are four small aerodynamical wings that extend from the rocket as it descends. On a previous launch to space on 14 July this year, the company employed grid fins on a Falcon 9 rocket for the first time. They were able to bring the first stage of the rocket back to Earth and they performed a practice landing over the ocean without a floating barge. Shortly before hitting the ocean it reignited its thrusters, proving that the rocket could successfully turn itself back on and perform a landing. On this occasion the rocket, after performing this test, simply fell into the ocean. But this next test will be a huge step towards reusability . ‘Returning anything from space is a challenge, but returning a Falcon 9 first stage for a precision landing presents a number of additional hurdles,’ the company said in a statement. ‘At 14 stories tall and traveling upwards of 1,300 metres (nearly one mile) per second, stabilising the Falcon 9 first stage for re-entry is like trying to balance a rubber broomstick on your hand in the middle of a wind storm.’ The first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket will attempt to touch down on a barge (illustration shown) after launching a Dragon capsule into space. It is the first ever attempt at landing a rocket on solid ground after launch, and could herald a new era of cheaper spaceflight . The barge measures about 300 feet (90 metres) long by 100 feet (30 metres) wide, and also has wings that extend out to another 170 feet (50 metres). According to SpaceX chief Elon Musk, it also has ‘thrusters repurposed from deep sea oil rigs’ that can hold it in position within 10 feet (three metres) even in a storm. To control the rocket as it lands, the grid fins on its side control its pitch, yaw and roll. These are ‘stowed on ascent and then deploy on re-entry for “X-Wing” [from Star Wars] style control,’ according to Musk. And to slow it down as it descends it will save 15 per cent of its original fuel, allowing it to lower itself towards the ocean without the use of a parachute. Grid fins (seen here) on the side of the first stage of the rocket will keep it steady as it descends to Earth, while it will save 15 per cent of its initial fuel in order to lower itself slowly to the ground . Whatever the outcome, SpaceX will use the data they glean to improve their technique and one day plan to perform this manoeuvre during every launch. Cameras on board the barge will capture the entire descent, although it’s unclear how much - if any - of this footage SpaceX will make public. Eventually, they will start bringing the upper - or second - stage of the rocket back as well. The ultimate goal is to make the entire rocket reusable - which will drastically reduce the cost of going to space. SpaceX has a £1billion ($1.6 billion) contract with Nasa to resupply the ISS. This launch of the Dragon capsule will be the fifth of 12 scheduled missions. Elon Musk (pictured) said the ambitious attempt has a 50 per cent chance of working. SpaceX ultimately wants all of its rockets to be reusable in order to reduce the cost of going to space . The launch of the Falcon 9 rocket had originally been scheduled for late december. However, the launch was delayed then when some issues arose during a static fire test - which involves a brief ignition of the rocket’s nine engines on the launchpad to test they work. The reason the delay was so long, until January, is that the ISS moved into a period of increased sunlight. For 10 days from 28 December to 7 January, the station was in almost constant light. This prohibited Dragon from berthing with the station, as temperatures were too high. If all goes to plan after the launch, Dragon will then rendezvous with the ISS at 11am GMT (6am EST) on Thursday 8 January. ‘Nasa and SpaceX announced today the launch of SpaceX’s fifth commercial resupply services mission to the International Space Station now will occur no earlier than Tuesday 6 January,’ Nasa said previously in a statement. ‘This will provide SpaceX engineers time to investigate further some of the issues that arose from the static fire test of the Falcon 9 rocket on 16 December.’ They added: 'The new launch date also will allow the teams to enjoy the holidays.' The barge (shown) measures about 300 feet (90 metres) long by 100 feet (30 metres) wide, and also has wings that extend out to another 170 feet (50 metres) This launch of the Falcon 9 will be carrying SpaceX’s unmanned Dragon capsule on its fifth scheduled cargo mission to the ISS - and sixth flight to the station overall - under contract with Nasa.

"Google might have set the ball rolling with their prototype self-driving car, but it doesn’t exactly set the pulse racing with its looks. So step in Mercedes, who have unveiled a sleek and stylish vehicle that they say could be the future of autonomous cars. Revealed in a presentation at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, the F015 concept boasts rotating pedestal seats, carriage style doors - and of course, self-driving capability. Scroll down for video . German company Mercedes has unveiled their concept self-driving car (shown). Called the F015 it has wide wheels to maximise passenger space. They revealed the new vehicle at CES 2015 in Las Vegas. A single pane of glass covers the top of the car . The car aims to provide a look at what the future of autonomous cars might look like when the roads are populated by ‘exclusive cocoons on wheels,’ said Dieter Zetsche, chairman of Daimler AG and head of Mercedes-Benz cars. For CES 2015 Audi delivered its latest hi-tech innovation in a unique way. The German car maker sent its self driving car on a 550-mile (885km) journey from San Francisco to Las Vegas. The German auto-giant calls its self-driving technology ‘Piloted Driving’, and insists the sensors and equipment demonstrated in the vehicle are ‘production ready’. As a result, the company claims it is on course to put driverless cars into commercial production as soon as next year. Mercedes said they wanted to focus on some of the other aspects aside from just the technology that drives it, though. And that led them to design a concept that might more resemble what self-driving cars of the future will look like. ‘Anyone who focuses solely on the technology has not yet grasped how autonomous driving will change our society,’ said Mr Zetsche. ‘The car is growing beyond its role as a mere means of transport and will ultimately become a mobile living space.' The luxury sedan, which seats four, measures 17ft (5.2 metres) in length and 5ft (1.5 metres) high. It is made of carbon-fibre, aluminium and high-strength steel. It’s designed to be able to use an electric motor and a hydrogen fuel cell. Using its hybrid system it can travel 685 miles (1,100 km) on a single charge. A single pane of glass covers the top of the car, extending from its long windshield to its sunroof. In December 2014 Google unveiled the final design for its own self-driving car (shown), but it doesn't exactly have much of an aesthetic appeal. The first version came under fire for looking like a toy car - and a new rooftop sensor means the second now looks like a toy police car . Mercedes' car, meanwhile, has space for four and uses 'swivel chairs' that rotate 30 degrees (shown) so that the passengers can talk to each other easily. A driver can also take manual control of the car, or just let it drive them autonomously . The luxury sedan, which seats four, measures 17ft (5.2 metres) in length and 5ft (1.5 metres) high.

"Big Wall Street firms are handing out pay raises, shortening hours and doling out perks to junior bankers fresh out of college in an attempt to stop them from defecting to startups and convince them to stay in finance. The big banks used to take it for granted that every year, top graduates would flock to Lower Manhattan and work long, grueling hours for the chance at high-power, high-paying jobs in finance. But the 2008 financial crisis, cuts in bonuses and huge financial success of tech startups mean that many top graduates are shunning Wall Street for Silicon Valley. To compete, most of the big banks have raised starting salaries 20 to 25percent. Goldman Sachs and other big banks have realized that they can't take it for granted any longer that they'll get the best young talent . Goldman Sachs raised its starting salary for financial analysts from $70,000 a year to $85,000 a year. An entry-level banker for the firm can now expect to make $120,000 to $140,000 in the first year with bonuses, Bloomberg reports. '$120,000 a year is cheap labor for them,' Patrick Curtis, a former investment banker who now coaches students on how to break into finance, told CNBC. Goldman, long the most envied firm on Wall Street, once accepted that droves of Ivy Leaguers would flock to its ranks, willing to wok slavishly for long hours and on weekends. Now, Goldman is hiring more junior bankers in an effort to lighten the load so that young employees don't have to work as long. And the firm has also added 'protected weekends' that are aimed at preventing new employees from checking email or worrying about the office from Friday night until Monday morning. Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase have also raised starting salaries for junior bankers. Big banks are also lowering the emphasis on junior bankers leaving  to get an MBA. A graduate degree used to be all-but a requirement for advancement after two years on Wall Street. Now, some banks are discouraging junior bankers from going to school for fear that they'll never come back. Instead, they've begun handing out promotions to junior bankers with just an undergraduate degree. 'They realized, why not keep them and promote them? Keep the organic talent,' Wall Street recruiter Andrea Baker told CNBC.","Big banks have raised salaries for junior bankers by 20 to 25percent .

"A Scottish student has launched a worldwide holidaymaker hunt after he found a camera memory card packed with pictures of a trip across Scotland. Barry Carruthers, 22, a drama student, found a grimy memory card in front of a multi-storey car park in Glasgow. The card still worked and was filled with pictures of a family taken at Scotland's most iconic sights. Mr Carruthers has launched a campaign on several social media sites and hopes to reunite the family with their memory card. The family snaps include the travellers at iconic locations across Scotland, including the capital . The message has gone global with big-hearted social media users from Shetland to Hong Kong banding together to help find the family. US TV host Ellen DeGeneres has even been contacted on Twitter by eager fans hoping she will spread the word. Mr Carruthers uploaded the images onto his laptop and kick-started a global search for the mystery holidaymakers to Scotland. Mr Carruthers is appealing to anyone who recognises the family to help him reunite them with their snaps . He said: 'This family had been everywhere, and done it all. 'They went to the Military Tattoo at Edinburgh Castle, the Fringe, the Royal Mile, Knockhill Circuit, Ayr - you name it. 'I've lived in Scotland all my life, and there were a few places I couldn't even identify.' After trawling through the family-of-four's all-encompassing epic Scottish trip, Mr Carruthers said he felt compelled to reunite the tourists with their photos. The pictures seem to feature a family of four, two parents and their son and daughter . He said: 'I'm quite a sentimental person myself, and I just hated the idea of this family losing their entire trip on the street. 'When people pick up cameras or phones, all they are thinking of is the monetary value - but I don't think people ever stop to realise how powerful and important photographs are to people. 'I just really wanted to help.' A keen photographer, Mr Carruthers was able to identify that the family had used a Nikon camera for their shots and had travelled to Scotland in August. Mr Carruthers has been tireless in his efforts - contacting Nikon to see if the camera was registered in order to trace the family, as well as emailing the hotels seen in the photos. He added: 'Thank you to every single one of you for sharing.' The campaign has spread around the world to America and even Hong Kong . Posting on Facebook several photos of the family in front of Edinburgh locations such as North Bridge, his plea for help to find the family has now racked up more 23,000 shares in a matter of days. His cause was also taken up on BBC radio and national tourist board VisitScotland. A spokesman for VisitScotland said: 'When we saw that this family had lost all of their photographs, we had to help. 'World-famous for our incredible scenery, vibrant culture and spectacular heritage, Scotland is one of the finest tourism destinations in the world, and a holiday here provides memories that will last a lifetime. 'However, to lose your photographs of this beautiful country would be devastating and we hope that the family in this case will be reunited with their memory card very soon.' Mr Carruthers added: 'This family clearly had an amazing time in Scotland. They saw it all. 'I just don't want them to lose those memories.'","Barry Carruthers, 22, found the memory card in a city centre car park .

"A gay couple claim they were chucked out of a taxi operated by Uber because they were kissing and cuddling. Jordan Sloat said the driver told them he usually took gay couples but 'they don't usually do that sort of thing' after he ordered them out of the taxi in London. Mr Sloat and his partner Corey Watts, 23, had been in the car just minutes when the driver pulled over in Covent Garden and told them to get out at about 8pm on New Year's Day. Corey Watts (left) and his partner Jordan Sloat (right) were ordered to get out of an Uber taxi in London by their driver after they started kissing and cuddling in the back seat of the car on New Year's Day . 'I felt shocked - you don't expect that sort of homophobic reaction in London,' Mr Sloat told ITV News. The couple, who had been on their way to a friend's house, were forced to get another taxi. Uber confirmed the driver had been suspended since the incident and they were investigating. Mr Sloat added: 'We were kissing and cuddled next to each other when a minute or two after picking us up he pulled over and told us to get out. He said he was shocked by the reaction and asked the driver if it was because they were gay. He allegedly told them he picked up gay couples all the time but they 'don't normally do this.' Mr Sloat, who comes from Toronto, said he was shocked to witness this kind of behaviour in London and said his partner became angry - accusing the driver of 'disgusting homophobia.' They claim they asked the driver, who has now been suspended by Uber, if they were being asked to leave because they were gay and he said he did take gay couples but 'they didn't usually do that sort of thing' After the incident Mr Watts, a hair stylist from Cardiff, wrote on Twitter: 'Just got asked to get out of an @Uber cab for kissing my boyfriend. Flipped my s***.' The couple were initially charged for the journey but this was later refunded. Uber runs a taxi service in cities across the world and allows people to use an app to get a quote for a journey and order a car through their smartphones. Mr Watts posted a message on Twitter after the incident and said it has provoked unexpected reaction . In a statement Uber said: 'Uber does not tolerate any form of discrimination either by our partner drivers or towards our partner drivers. 'We opened an investigation from the moment we learned of this unacceptable incident and have been in contact with the rider to extended our sincere apologies and get further information. 'The driver concerned has been suspended from the Uber platform.' Mr Watts accused the taxi firm of homophobia after they were ordered out of the taxi in Covent Garden . In November the taxi firm was criticised after a driver refused to pick up a blind woman in Conneticut, apparently because she was with her guide dog. In London the launch of the firm has led to gridlocks after black cab drivers staged a 'go slow' protest because they claimed Uber was putting them out of business. It has already been banned in New Delhi after a driver allegedly raped a customer, and in Madrid because of claims that drivers carry out activities which constitute unfair competition. Uber was launched in 2009 in California. It operates through a smartphone app which allows customers to get a quote for a journey and order a car. The app works by locating the nearest suitable vehicle for the ride using GPS. Customers are then charged for the journey through their mobile phone bills and can even split the cost with friends. It is also possible to track the journey on mobile phones. When a journey is complete customers can rate the driver out of five stars. In December the company was valued at £25.5billion ($40 billion). The firm currently operates in 70 cities of 35 countries across the world. Uber has been banned in New Delhi after a driver allegedly raped a customer. Spain has also banned use of the app over claims drivers use unfair competition.","Jordan Sloat and partner Corey Watts travelled in an Uber taxi in London .

"Two million years ago, a massive eruption in the Milky Way caused gases to bubble out into the universe at two million miles per hour (3.2km/h). Now, astronomers are beginning to see the aftermath of the explosion: billowing clouds of gas towering 30,000 light-years above and below the plane of our galaxy. Dubbed 'Fermi Bubbles', these mysterious structures shouldn't exist according to current astronomical theory – and scientists are still unable what caused their outburst. Hubble probed the light from a distant quasar to study the so-called Fermi Bubbles,  The quasar's light passed through one of the bubbles. Imprinted on that light was information about the bubble's speed, composition, and mass. The outflow was produced by a violent event that happened 2 million years ago in our galaxy's core . The enormous structure was discovered five years ago as a gamma-ray glow on the sky in the direction of the galactic centre. Using the Hubble telescope, Nasa is attempting to find the mass of the material being blown out of our galaxy, which could help determine the cause of the outburst. 'The outflowing clouds we're seeing are only 25,000 light-years away in our galaxy. We have a front-row seat,' said Andrew Fox of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore. The giant lobes of Fermi Bubbles glow in nearly uniform gamma rays and appear like two 30,000-light-year-tall incandescent bulbs screwed into the centre of the galaxy . 'We can study the details of these structures. We can look at how big the bubbles are and can measure how much of the sky they are covering.' There are a number of theories attempting to explain why the Milky Way is blowing these enormous bubbles. Some scientists believe they could have been created by huge jets of accelerated matter blasting out from the supermassive black hole at the centre of our galaxy. Or they could have been formed by a population of giant stars, born from the plentiful gas surrounding the black hole, all exploding as supernovae at roughly the same time. Another theory is that they are the result of collisions between dark matter particles that result in their annihilation, emitting charged particles in the process. 'There are several models that explain them, but none of the models is perfect,' said Dmitry Malyshev, a postdoctoral researcher at the Kavli Institute. The giant lobes of Fermi Bubbles glow in nearly uniform gamma rays and appear like two 30,000-light-year-tall incandescent bulbs screwed into the centre of the galaxy. The detection of their high-energy gamma rays suggested that a violent event in the galaxy's core violently launched energised gas into space. To provide more information about the outflows, Professor Fox looked at the ultraviolet light from a distant quasar - a galaxy with a bright active nucleus - that lies behind the northern bubble. Imprinted on that light as it travels through the lobe is unique information about the velocity, composition, and temperature of the expanding gas inside the bubble. The study found silicon, carbon, and aluminium, indicating that the gas is enriched in the heavy elements produced inside stars and represents the ancient remnants of star formation. It measured the temperature of the gas at approximately 9,700°C (17,500°C), which is much cooler than expected. 'We are seeing cooler gas, perhaps interstellar gas in our galaxy's disk, being swept up into that hot outflow,' Professor Fox explained. A giant gamma-ray structure was discovered by processing Fermi all-sky data at energies from 1 to 10 billion electron volts, shown here. The dumbbell-shaped feature (centre) emerges from the galactic core and extends 50 degrees north and south from the plane of the Milky Way, in the sky from the constellation Virgo . There are a number of theories attempting to explain why the Milky Way is blowing these enormous bubbles. Some scientists believe they could have been created by huge jets of accelerated matter blasting out from the supermassive black hole at the centre of our galaxy. Or they could have been formed by a population of giant stars, born from the plentiful gas surrounding the black hole, all exploding as supernovae at roughly the same time. Another theory is that they are the result of collisions between dark matter particles that result in their annihilation, emitting charged particles in the process. Because the bubbles are young compared to the age of the galaxy, and believed to be a short-lived phenomenon, they may be evidence for a repeating event in the Milky Way's history. Whatever the trigger is, it likely occurs episodically, perhaps only when the black hole gobbles up a concentration of material. 'It looks like the outflows are a hiccup,' Professor Fox said. 'There may have been repeated ejections of material that have blown up, and we're catching the latest one.' The bubbles extend 30,000 light-years across. Hints of the bubbles' edges were first seen in X-rays (blue). The gamma rays mapped by Fermi (shown in magenta) extend much farther from the galaxy's plane .","The 'Fermi Bubbles' look like 30,000-light-year-tall incandescent bulbs .

"A Jamaican-born lollipop man who was sacked for calling a black colleague 'King Kong' during a row over a parking meter has questioned how he can be a racist at an employment tribunal. Jon Seymour, 46, claims he was unfairly dismissed following a row with a council official in which he allegedly used 'threatening, racist and abusive' behaviour at Camden Town Hall in London. But now Mr Seymour, who has worked as a lollipop man in Kentish Town for 20 years, is seeking thousands of pounds in compensation saying he was not being overly aggressive. Jon Seymour, 46, says he was unfairly dismissed after he got in a row with a fellow black council worker . The Central London Employment Tribunal heard the incident in July 2013 erupted after Mr Seymour was speaking loudly on his phone in the town hall's reception area ahead of a meeting. He claimed he had been trying to arrange a refund because a parking meter had swallowed £4 of his change when council worker Johnson Akinmoyede 'interrupted his conversation'. The court heard that when Mr Akinmoyede asked him to keep his voice down, Mr Seymour replied: 'Who are you, King Kong? I will break you, move away from me,' reports the Evening Standard. Mr Seymour, from Kentish Town in north London, was escorted from the building by two security officers for the alleged 'racially abusive and threatening behaviour'. Mr Seymour was a lollipop man outside Carlton Primary School in Camden, North London, for 20 years . However, he claims the term 'King Kong' was not racist and in a statement by Christopher Nicola, manager of the council's Smarter Travel Team, it was a 'Caribbean thing'. 'He [Mr Seymour] asked how could it be racially abusive if you say something to someone of the same complexion, and that the way they were speaking was a Caribbean thing and they talk like that to each other all the time and that he did not mean any offence,' said Mr Nicola. Mr Seymour claims the term 'King Kong' was not racist and that the way they were speaking was a 'Caribbean thing' Speaking at the time, Mr Seymour said: 'It was not racial. He was getting all angry so it was like he was acting like he was a big strong gorilla, so that's why I called him King Kong. 'My mum is black, I'm black. It is not being racist. It was nothing to do with his colour. No one looks like King Kong.' Amjad Khan, a security guard who witnessed the incident, told the court Mr Akinmoyede had also been 'intimidating' and 'inappropriate', but admitted Mr Seymour's behaviour was also unacceptable. He said both men apologised to each other after the row and shook hands on the steps of the town hall. The council's head of transport strategy, Louise McBride, who chaired last year's disciplinary meeting which dismissed him, said CCTV footage showed his behaviour was 'aggressive physically'. However, Judge David Pearl, who was shown the CCTV disagreed his body language was aggressive saying 'the claimant does nothing [physically] aggressive here.' Speaking outside the court today, Mr Seymour, who was born in London but of Trinidadian heritage, told the Standard: 'It's made my life hell and until now I have never been unemployed in my life. 'It was about being part of the community and helping all the mums and children, that's what I used to love, and that has been taken away. 'The best result would be getting back the job that I love and to feel part of the community again. I just want to serve the people and community I love.' The paper reports that Mr Seymour was also said to be in breach of the council's code of conduct for giving an interview to a local newspaper after his immediate suspension. The hearing continues.","Jon Seymour, 46, claims he was unfairly dismissed from Camden Council .

"Parents have taken to social media to express their outrage over a local council ordering a cafe to take down its cubby house after receiving complaints from neighbours that the children playing on it were making too much noise. Naremburn's Sprout Wholefood Cafe and Grocer - in Sydney's north - made the announcement on Facebook on Monday it had been sadly asked by Willoughby Council to take it down. 'It is with much regret that due to neighbouring complaints about ""children's noise (laughter/fun!!!)"" that Sprout have been ordered by council to remove the kids cubby house,' the post read. Scroll down for video . Naremburn's Sprout Wholefood Cafe and Grocer - in Sydney's north - made the announcement on Facebook on Monday it had been sadly asked by Willoughby Council to take the cubby house down . 'Anyone who would like to dismantle and take the cubby please personal message us as by Sunday we sadly will be removing the cubby. 'We would like to see this go to another home where children enjoying playtime is not classified as a noise disturbance.' But the news caused a backlash against the council, with angry patrons labelling the move was 'outrageous'. 'Serious? Can we still come and have a play on the lawn? This is so sad. Shame on you, sour residents of Naremburn!' one woman wrote on the cafe's Facebook page. The cubby house is a popular feature at the cafe for parents to relax and eat while their children play . Cafe owner Joe Melham said at first he was taken aback by the council's order, but knew where they were coming from . Another said: 'I am absolutely gobsmacked! Sprout is such a perfect (and yummy) spot for families BECAUSE of the back section and this adorable cubby. Council shouldn't even listen to such fickle complaints.' 'This is terrible! We love this cubby house. It's not like kids are running around at 10pm at night. What a shame. I doubt it's the cubby *specifically* that is making kids laugh anyway #funpolice,' a parent posted. Cafe owner Joe Melham said at first he was taken aback by the council's order. 'We were a little bit shocked because we didn't realise we needed to get a DA [development approval] for a cubby house,' he told Channel 9's Today. Mr Melham has met with Willoughby Council mayor Gail Giles-Gidney about the cubby house . 'We understood the reason they gave us but at the end of the day it's not a fixed structure. It's just a little small cubby house.' Mr Melham has met with Willoughby Council mayor Gail Giles-Gidney and said it was going to take a lot of money to keep the cubby house but it was something they were willing to do. But there were no guarantees from Ms Giles-Gidney that the cubby house could stay. 'After the overwhelming response we've gotten from the community and the broader community... we're more than happy to spend the money to actually keep the cubby house,' he said. Willoughby Council said initially permission for the use of the concrete area at the back of the cafe was not sought by the cafe. 'By adding additional seating on the deck area as well as to the concrete area plus providing the cubby house they are intensifying their use of the space which is resulting in noise spill to residential properties on surrounding streets,' a statement to Daily Mail Australia from the council said. 'As no formal council approval was sought to use this additional space in this way, [the] council was unable to assess the overall impact or consult with neighbours. '[The] council has requested the owners seek approval to increase the businesses use of the property.' According to the council, Mr Melham has indicated he will lodge an application in February so residents and patrons to formally give their comment. In the mean time, the cafe and the council have reached a compromise. 'While they are preparing their application, [the] council and the café have agreed to keep the cubby house in place, and remove the additional seating located on the lower concrete area,' the statement went on further to say. Ms Giles-Gidney said she understood the community's concern over the cubby house issue. 'Our objective is to strike a balance for all stakeholders in this situation including the operator, the patrons and neighbouring residents,' she said.","Sprout Wholefood Cafe and Grocer is in Naremburn in Sydney's north .

"It was the moment millions of Broadchurch fans had waited almost two years for. But the much-anticipated return of the ITV crime drama left many baffled – and not just by the plot. Some who tuned in for the start of the second series on Monday night complained they struggled to understand actor David Tennant’s Scottish accent to the extent that they were forced to turn on the TV subtitles. Scroll down for video . Viewers complained about David Tennant mumbling during the second series of Broadchurch on ITV last night and said they had to use subtitles on their televisions to understand the actor who plays DI Alec Hardy . And first-time viewers were left baffled by the complex storyline as producers did not begin with a summary of what had happened in the first series – which ended in April 2013 – even though the new series picks up where that left off. While the opening episode, which had an audience of 7.2million, drew widespread praise and was quickly being talked about on Twitter, many viewers said they had difficulty deciphering some of the dialogue. One wrote: ‘Still couldn’t understand a word they were saying in Broadchurch tonight – I need someone to translate the heavily accented mumbling.’ Another added: ‘Challenge: try to watch Broadchurch without subtitles. FAILED.’ Others singled out Tennant, who plays dour Detective Inspector Alec Hardy, saying: ‘David Tennant needs subtitles, with that accent don’t understand a word he says.’ Many viewers complained about having to use subtitles to understand Tennant's mumbling on the show . Tennant and Coleman, who plays DS Ellie Miller, were in court as DS Miller's husband denied murder . This is not the first time Tennant’s voice has caused problems. He also starred in Gracepoint, the US remake of Broadchurch, with his American accent failing to impress both critics and audiences. On Monday night, many Broadchurch viewers were left scratching their heads – and not in the way the programme makers intended. Fans said the show was confusing and complained that there had been no recap of the first series at the start. This left new viewers lost, while many who were avid watchers of the old series nearly two years ago were unable to remember the details needed to follow the plot. One tweeted: ‘May as well have not watched the last series of Broadchurch, not a clue who’s who or what’s happening.’ Viewers complained about the accents of many of the cast members as well as the loud background noise . Joe Miller pleaded not guilty to the murder of Danny Latimer, 11, despite his confession in the last show . Another added: ‘Anyone else watching Broadchurch and can’t remember who everyone is or what went on last series?’ One Broadchurch mystery was instantly seized on by the gloomy drama’s more light-hearted fans – why are there so many former Doctor Who stars in the cast? They pointed out that seven had previously appeared in the BBC sci-fi series. David Tennant played The Doctor for five years while Arthur Darvill – the Rev Paul Coates in Broadchurch – had a long-running role as one of the time-traveller’s companions. Olivia Colman has been a guest star, as has Jonathan Bailey, who plays journalist Olly Stevens in the ITV drama. Three others in the new series appeared in Doctor Who, including Eve Myles, who was also in the spin-off, Torchwood. Many fans used social media to highlight this crossover. One wrote: ‘Do Broadchurch only cast actors who’ve appeared in Doctor Who/Doctor Who spin-offs?’ Another added: ‘Broadchurch, where Dr Who actors go on leaving the Tardis, apparently.’ Others joked that Broadchurch had become a ‘retirement home’ for Doctor Who stars and wrote ‘I reckon Dr Who did it’. The first series, set in a fictional Dorset seaside town, involved the hunt for the killer of 11-year-old Danny Latimer. Detective Sergeant Ellie Miller, played by Olivia Colman, and DI Hardy – who moved to the area from another force after his previous investigation fell apart in court – investigated numerous suspects before the killer was exposed, in a shocking twist, to be DS Miller’s husband Joe. Monday’s episode began in court with Miller surprising everyone by entering a not guilty plea. Some viewers said the programme was unrealistic as retired barrister Jocelyn Knight, played by Charlotte Rampling, was given the job of prosecuting Miller. One lawyer said: ‘Completely unrealistic court scenes and how counsel are appointed in murder cases – can’t ITV afford researchers?’ ITV said it had received ‘fewer than five’ complaints about mumbled dialogue. It added that although no recap of the first series was broadcast on Monday, a four-minute clip recounting the plot had been circulated via social media and was available on the ITV website. Of alleged legal inaccuracies in the plot, an ITV spokesman said: ‘We consult extensively with advisers, but also have to balance what we consider to be the best creative decision for the drama – and the audience. ‘We’re thrilled that we’ve had such a positive response.’","Return of Broadchurch, starring David Tennant, was widely anticipated .

"It's a dilemma we all face – do you give money to a homeless person or not? For Ed Miliband, the awkwardness of that predicament was all too clear to see as he passed a beggar in Manchester yesterday. On his way to deliver a speech, the Labour leader first passed the woman in a green headscarf. Realising photographers were present, he doubled back. But in a toe-curling encounter, he failed even to make eye contact as he leant towards her... and appeared to drop just 2p into a cup. In the awkward encounter, Ed Miliband failed even to make eye-contact with the beggar in Manchester . Mr Miliband walked past the beggar but then doubled back and hastily dropped a 2p coin in the cup . Despite the intended act of kindness, Mr Miliband’s ham-fisted attempt sparked criticism on Twitter last night. One tweeted about the politician, who earns more than £130,000 a year: ‘Real man of the people eh!’ Another wrote: ‘He looks terrified stiff that she might touch him’ and a third said: ‘The Party of the less well off? Ed wants to keep it that way.’ Witnesses said Mr Miliband appeared to change his mind when he realised photographers were present. One said: ‘Mr Miliband half walked past and then seemed to realise he was going to be photographed walking past a beggar and kind of doubled back.’ Despite the intended act of kindness, Mr Miliband’s ham-fisted attempt sparked criticism on Twitter . It is the latest embarrassing incident for Mr Miliband following his clumsy attempt to eat a bacon sandwich . Aides could not say how much he had given – saying it was a ‘handful of coins’. Last night a homeless man even claimed the beggar was not homeless but part of a gang of Romanian women who make up to £50 a day. It is another embarrassing incident for Mr Miliband following his attempt to eat a bacon sandwich earlier this year and his omission of the national deficit in his conference speech. Yesterday’s incident also prompted debate over donations to beggars. Charity Crisis said it was a ‘personal decision’, but some groups urge donations of food instead of cash. Labour-run Manchester City Council even asks residents to report begging to the police, so officers can give advice. The Manchester Evening News said police later tweeted: ‘It’s a crime under Vagrancy Act & we always urge public to donate to charities not beggars.’ Labour yesterday claimed a comfortable victory in the South Yorkshire police and crime commissioner by-election, despite high hopes from Ukip. Nigel Farage had insisted his party could build on the momentum of its recent successes. But Labour’s Alan Billings won with just over 50 per cent of the vote, while Ukip’s Jack Clarkson came second with 32 per cent. The Tories finished third and the English Democrats fourth. Thursday’s vote was triggered by the resignation of Labour’s Shaun Wright, who quit over the Rotherham abuse scandal.","Ed Miliband dropped just 2p into a beggar's cup in Manchester .

"Golfing ace Rory McIlroy is rumoured to have found himself a new leading lady in 27-year-old PGA employee Erica Stoll. The 25-year-old World no. 1  has been dating stunning Ms Stoll for three months and the pair spent New Years Eve together, according to Irish Media. The Northern Irish golfer shared a picture on Instagram of two glasses of champagne at a luxury hotel in Ireland, just 12 months after he used the photosharing app to tell the world of his engagement to Caroline Wozniacki. Scroll down for video . Golf's world No 1 Rory McIlroy has a new girlfriend, Erica Stoll (right), according to reports in Ireland . McIlroy shared this picture on New Year's Eve of a champagne bottle and two glasses at a luxury hotel in Ireland . McIlroy and Ms Stoll, from Naples, Florida, met in September 2012 when he nearly nearly scuppered the Ryder Cup Miracle at Medinah before it had even started by oversleeping. Ms Stoll, who is manager of Championship Volunteer Operations at the PGA of America, came to his rescue before police rushed him to the course. The new couple have apparently been dating for around three months and, according to several Irish newspapers, saw in the New Year together at a luxury hotel in the 13th-century Ashford Castle in Co. Mayo. McIlroy shared a picture on Instagram that night of a champagne bottle with two glasses resting on napkins bearing the hotel's logo. Just 12 months previously, Wozniacki had been showing off a shiny engagement ring after McIlroy had popped the question on New Year's Eve. Stoll came to McIlroy's rescue at the 2012 Ryder Cup when he nearly missed his Sunday tee time . The Northern Irishman overslept and was rushed to the course by police at Medinah just in time . Rory McIlroy proposed to Caroline Wozniacki last New Years Eve, but called off the wedding days after the wedding invitations were issued in May . He also had only two majors to his name and the world was wondering why his form on the course was so bad. Since then the 25-year-old world No 1 has had rumoured romances with Irish model Nadia Forde, who went on to appear in I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here, receptionist Sasha Gale, South African model Shashi Naidoo and now Stoll. Mclroy is back to work in preparation for his return to the course at the Abu Dhabi HSBC Golf Championship in the Emirate on January 15. His major aim this year will be to complete a career Grand Slam by winning the Masters in April. Should the Ulsterman claim the green jacket at Augusta National he would then have a shot at becoming the first golfer since Tiger Woods in 2001 to hold all the major titles at once when he competes in the US Open at Chambers Bay in June. But it appears McIlroy could have found a birdie he cherishes even more than those he earns on the course in the form of his Ryder Cup heroine. Since the break-up McIlroy has been romantically linked with Nadia Forde (left) and Sasha Gale (right) Shashi Naidoo (third left) joined McIlroy's family at the Ryder Cup last September to spark more rumours .","Rory McIlroy has reportedly been dating Erica Stoll for three months .

"Participants in a new study of the use of police deadly force were more willing pull the trigger on armed white suspects than on blacks, researchers have found. The surprising results challenge previous findings about racial bias - and, one the researchers says, helps combat the stereotype that cops are more eager to open fire on black suspects. The authors of the study say the reaction delay is because officers fear that there will be greater repercussions from shooting a black suspect than a white one. The study, conducted at Washington State University-Spokane's Sleep and Performance Research Center, used a realistic simulator that showed video images of black, white and Hispanic suspects - both armed and unarmed. Participants were given a real Glock pistol equipped with a laser and told to shoot armed attackers. The study tested more than 30 cops, as well as 60 civilians and a half-dozen members of the military. About 85percent of the study participants were white. Realistic: A study that put participants in a simulator and had them shoot at armed suspects found that they were more hesitant to pull the trigger on blacks than on whites . The study armed participants with a real Glock pistol that fired lasers instead of bullets - and measured the reaction times and accuracy . When confronted with an armed white suspect, participants took an average of 1.37 seconds to pull the trigger. But, they took 1.61 seconds to open fire on armed black suspects - and were less likely to shoot unarmed targets. That split-second pause could be deadly in a real life situation, researchers say. Moreover, the study also monitored physiological responses to the shooting scenarios and found that shooters paused - despite participants perceiving the black suspects as being a bigger threat than the white suspects. The study contradicts previous findings that people were more likely to pull the trigger on black suspects . Lois James, a Washington State University-Spokane professor, was lead author on the study . The results were consistent for police officers, as well as civilians and members of the military, Lois James, assistant research professor at Washington State University-Spokane, told Daily Mail Online. 'What it suggests that when faced with black suspects, there is something going on that is making some kind of pause or hesitation. What we think it might be is the fear of consequence,' Dr James said. Dr James said those consequences could be moral - or they could be fear of backlash, either public brouhaha, criminal charges or departmental discipline. 'There's a history systemic racism in the US and there are still irrefutable facts about the treatment of some groups of people in the criminal justice system that I'm sure weigh very heavily on a lot of officers,' she said. Dr James conceded that it is possible that the participants in the study knew that they were being watched by researchers and delayed opening fire on black suspects as a result. However, she says researchers worked to minimize that bias. The study was initially designed to test how fatigue, experience and other factors impact in decision-making in deadly force scenarios and so race was never mentioned with participants before they went through the course. Additionally - Dr James says - the simulator offers realistic scenarios that show life-size videos of police traffic stops and other incidents. The set-up means that most participants have very real physiological and psychological reactions to what's unfolding in front of them, she says. Previous studies that showed a people had a bias toward using force against black suspects used much less immersive techniques - having participants sit in front of a computer screen and push a 'shoot' or 'don't shoot' button in response to pictures of armed suspects. The findings, co-authored by David Klinger, a criminal justice professor at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, and Washington State University-Spokane professor Bryan Vila, were published in May  in the Journal of Experimental Criminology.","When confronted with an armed white suspect, participants took an average of 1.37 seconds to pull the trigger .

A woman claiming to be a teacher was arrested after becoming drunk and slapping the backsides of cabin crew on an easyJet flight . The pair were arrested for endangering the lives of fellow passengers after they were removed from the plane, which had been delayed for seven hours by technical problems. The drunk woman from Harwich and a 42-year-old man from Redbridge, East London, were hauled off the plane as it touched down at Southend Airport at 7.30pm on Saturday and were later given police cautions. A fellow passenger, who asked not to be named, said: 'Not only did we have to suffer a seven hour delay due to technical difficulties, but we had to endure two drunk passengers, who were loud, using abusive language and causing a disturbance to other passengers. 'The woman kept repeating that she was a school teacher, which was quite unbelievable at the language she was using in front of my primary school age children.

"The mayor of a small town in Nottinghamshire is facing calls to quit after he moved 4,000 miles away to Saudi Arabia. Kevin Thomas landed a new job just a month after he was chosen as mayor of Stapleford last May - a post for which he receives a £400-a-year allowance. Since then he has been returning for one week a month and conducting  his civil duties over the phone, attending just 15 out of 41 events and sending his deputy to the rest. Spinning plates: Kevin Thomas is still serving as the mayor of Stapleford, a town in Nottinghamshire, despite taking a new job 4,000 miles away in Saudi Arabia. He insisted he returns for one week every month . The Liberal Democrat mayor moved to the oil-rich Arab state's capital Riyadh with Working Links, a welfare-to-work firm with which he was an operations manager in the Midlands for five years. Since then his deputy Ray Darby has been standing in at cheque presentations and school visits, as well as chairing council meetings in the town of 17,000 people. Mr Thomas, 57, said he was planning to move back to England later this month. He told the Nottingham Post he received 'daily e-mails' from the council's clerk with agendas, minutes and other council business. 'At the time I was elected mayor, I did not know I was going to be working abroad,' he said. 'I was elected to represent the town and I can still do that from Saudi Arabia over the phone and via email. 'There are some months, especially in the summer, when nothing happens at the council. We also have a very good deputy mayor who attends events in my absence.' But news of the long-distance arrangement  sparked a row with residents calling for him to step down from his mayoral role, which ends in May. Gulf: The huge distance between Mr Thomas' home and Saudi Arabia, where he is with a welfare-to-work firm . One voter, 40-year-old nurse Lisa Clarke, said: 'We want to be represented by people who live and work in the area. You want your town mayor to have a hands-on approach.' Now the council is considering having to pay an extra allowance to his deputy, who would normally receive £100 for the year. Mr Darby admitted the situation was 'unfortunate'. Yet town council leader Jackie Williams, also a Liberal Democrat, defended the mayor and said the criticism came from 'political meddling'. 'Of the 15 events he's attended they've been major events,' she told MailOnline. 'Whilst some of the 26 may have been significant a number of them will have been turning up to somebody's 90th birthday and giving them flowers. Attack: One of Mr Thomas' colleagues said he had shown 'contempt for the people of Stapleford' 'A significant event would be something like the Hemlock Happening or the Stapleford Carnival, both of which he attended. 'He was chosen to be the mayor in May and the job opportunity came in June. It came out of the blue, these things happen sometimes and his company thought he was the best person for this particular job because it was something he's very good at. 'It's about to finish. My understanding was it would happen before Christmas but I believe he still has some loose ends to tie up.' Ms Williams insisted the £400 allowance was crucial for  the high number of drinks and raffle tickets the mayor is expected to buy at town events. 'It's a non-story,' she said. 'We know who's raised this and it's political meddling because there's an election in May'. An independent councillor told MailOnline the situation was only revealed at a meeting after Mr Thomas had been in Saudi Arabia for several months. Richard MacRae said: 'It's ridiculous. It's showing contempt for the people of Stapleford. 'He's a brilliant bloke when he's chairing meetings but the people of Stapleford deserve a mayor that's actually there for them. 'I brought the question up at the town council before, saying ""why doesn't the mayor turn up to anything"", and they just ummed and aahed. 'Recently we had a load of soldiers come back from fighting in Afghanistan and they marched through Beeston, a town just next to ours, and the mayor didn't turn up to that. 'We had the Christmas lights being turned on and the deputy stood in his place for that.' Mr MacRae said the mayor should step down and give the £400 allowance to his deputy. 'People want a councillor they can talk to face to face,' he added. 'If they have issues like a leaning lamp post or a mouldy flat they can't always do these things over the phone.' Spot the difference: The mayor's tranquil home town of Stapleford, which has 17,000 inhabitants... ... And the mayor's new home Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia which has a population of almost 6million . A former serviceman, Liberal Democrat Mr Thomas joined the council in 2007 and stood for the larger Broxtowe Borough Council in 2011, but was beaten by two Labour candidates. Town councils, including Stapleford, are similar in size and set-up to parish councils. Unlike the larger Broxtowe Borough Council which pays members more than £3,000 a year, councillors generally do not receive an allowance. A Working Links spokesman said Mr Thomas was based in its Riyadh office and often travelled to the firm's other four Saudi offices in Jeddah, Dammam, Tabuk and Jizan. A Stapleford Town Council spokesman said: 'It was agreed, following discussion with the Leader of the Town Council and the Deputy Town Mayor that should the need arise, the Deputy Town Mayor and/or Past Town Mayors would be able to attend Civic Events as requested. 'Stapleford Town Council has been appropriately represented throughout the current Civic Year and no invitations have been refused. Councillor Thomas has returned to the UK during this period and completed all his Council duties as required. 'Councillor Thomas will continue to serve as Town Mayor and attend Civic Engagements until the conclusion of his Civic Year.' Despite the small scale of the council, Mr Thomas is not its first member to make headlines for moving away. Husband and wife town councillors Brian and Christine Wombwell tried to continue their posts despite moving more than 100 miles away to Somerset in 2013. Mrs Wombwell later stepped down, but her husband still represents the ward of Stapleton North. Average January temperature: 5C .

"An officer who used a Taser twice on a 76-year-old man has been fired, but his family say it's too late and their father is 'not the same'. In December a video emerged of Nathanial Robinson, 23, pulling over Victoria resident Pete Vasquez for a suspected traffic violation and violently cuffing him before Tasering him twice. 'I'm really afraid to get out on the street now because I don't know what's going to happen,' Mr Vasquez said at a Tuesday press conference, reports Click2Houston. 'I don't trust people.' An officer who used a Taser twice on Pete Vasquez, 76, (pictured)  has been fired, but his family say it's too late and their father is 'not the same' 'It's unfortunate but what it comes down to is that my dad is not the same as he was before this happened,' said his son, Albert Vasquez to the station. 'We're confused as to why this happened. We're saddened. We've been brought together by a senseless tragedy that didn't have to happen.' Following the incident, Robinson was placed on administrative leave as investigations were conducted. On Monday, Craig announced Robinson had violated the department's conduct policy, use of force policy and arrest without a warrant policy. 'This is a very unfortunate incident for everyone involved. The Victoria Police Department places a high value in public trust. The men and women of the Victoria Police Department work hard each and every day to provide professional service with pride and respect to the community,' Craig said, reports KHOU. The clip from the dashboard camera shows officer, Nathanial Robinson, 23, pulling over Victoria resident Pete Vasquez in December . After Robinson pulled up behind him, Vasquez got out of the car, and walked around to the back of the car to show Robinson the dealer tags, which would make it exempt from having an inspection . Robinson arrested Vasquez for the expired sticker and grabbed his arm in a forceful manner . The incident comes at a time when police brutality is being closed watched in the US following a spate high-profile cases such as that of Michael Brown, Eric Garner and Trayvon Martin. It happened after Robinson saw an expired inspection sticker on the car Vasquez was driving back to a garage where he helps with mechanical work, reports the Victoria Advocate. After Robinson pulled up behind him, Vasquez got out of the car, which is owned by the car lot, attempting to get the manager. He walked around to the back of the car to show Robinson the dealer tags, which would make the vehicle legally exempt from having an inspection. But Robinson arrested Vasquez for the expired sticker and grabbed his arm, to which the pensioner pulled away and raised his other arm to swat him away. Robinson then pushed Vasquez down on the hood of the police cruiser and wrapped both arms under his shoulders so the pair fell to the ground. When the cop is next seen in frame, he was yelling and holding up a stun gun. Vasquez pulled away and raised his other arm to swat him away as they moved towards the police car . Robinson then pushed Vasquez down on the hood of the police cruise . Robinson  wrapped both arms under the pensioner's shoulders so the pair fell to the ground . When the cop is next seen in frame, he's yelling and holding up a stun gun . Police said the officer used the Taser on Vasquez twice while he was on the ground. 'He just acted like a pit bull, and that was it,' Vasquez said. 'For a while, I thought he was going to pull his gun and shoot me.' When other officers arrive on the scene, they ask Vasquez for his side of the story and check to see if he is injured. 'Are you hurting anywhere?' the unidentified officer can be heard asking on the video. 'Not yet,' Vasquez replies. 'Probably later on. I'm 76 years old.' Vasquez was taken to a hospital, then released without being cited. Larry Urich, a 62-year-old sales manager at the car lot who watched the incident unfold, said he wanted the officer fired and prosecuted for excessive use of force and causing bodily harm to an elderly person. 'I told the officer, 'What in the hell are you doing?' This gentleman is 76 years old,' Urich said. 'The cop told me to stand back, but I didn't shut up. I told him he was a god damn Nazi Stormtrooper.' Chief J.J. Craig admitted the footage 'raises some concerns.' He decided to open the investigation after viewing the footage and has personally apologized to Vasquez for the incident. Robinson could face a range of punishment from a letter of reprimand to suspension without pay or termination, Craig told the Advocate. The investigation will also examine the details of the arrest. Vasquez said his body still hurts and added: 'I feel like my rights were violated.' 'The police department is supposed to train their police officers to be more conscientious and use common sense. I don't think he had any.'","In December a video emerged of Nathanial Robinson, 23, pulling over Victoria resident Pete Vasquez for a suspected traffic violation .

"Two men are  halfway up what has been called the hardest rock climb in the world - a free climb up a half-mile section of exposed granite in California's Yosemite National Park. Tommy Caldwell, 36, of Estes Park, Colorado, and Keven Jorgeson, 30, of Santa Rosa, California, have been scaling their way up the face of the 3,000 feet granite monolith of El Capitan in Yosemite using only their hands and feet. Most ascents up the imposing rock face use an approach known as aid climbing, where ropes and metal pins are used to assist the climbers. Don't look down: Jorgeson calculates his next move up the mountain in this photo posted on Instagram on Sunday . However, the Caldwell and Jorgeson are instead attempting to cleanly free climb a route that has never before been climbed without aid. Their progress up the 32 sections, or pitches, of climbing is being chronicled by climber and photographer Tom Evans and filmmaker Brett Lowell. The two men eat, stretch and sleep in hanging tents suspended to El Capitan's Dawn Wall. They don't have the creature comforts of home, but they have kept in touch with the outside world thanks to social media - tweeting, posting on Facebook, feeding information for blogs and keeping in touch with a bevy of supporters on the ground. Time to relax: On Monday, the pair took a rest day to heal their hands in preparation for another day on the rock face on Tuesday. Above, Kevin Jorgeson relaxes in his portaledge tent, which is attached to the rock face and hangs above the Yosemite Valley floor far below . Daring: Free climbing involves using ropes to protect the men should they fall while climbing but it does not actually aid their ascent. Above, Caldwell makes his way up one of the thin cracks that work their way up the route on El Capitan using a headlamp on Sunday night . Up they go: Kevin Jorgeson, 30 (left), and Tommy Caldwell, 36 (right), have reached the halfway point on their attempt to free climb Yosemite's El Capitan . Record breakers: If they are successful, Jorgeson and Caldwell will be the first team to free climb El Capitan's imposing Dawn Wall . Rock face life: On the left, Caldwell is seen on Day 9 of the climb, attempting to remove damaged skin on his hands. The razor-sharp rock on the wall tears up the climber's fingertips  and they use sanding blocks to keep them smooth. On the right, one of the meals the climbers have eaten on El Capitan. The pair keep fueled with sandwiches like this and in the cold conditions their food is practically refrigerated . 'The guys are doing great,' said Josh Lowell with Big Up Productions, which has been filming the pair as they have battled with the route over the past six years. '(Monday) they are resting and trying to grow skin back on their fingertips so they can continue to do battle with the hardest climbing sections, which involve grabbing tiny, razor-sharp edges of rock.' If all goes as planned, the duo could be at the top as soon as Friday or Saturday, Lowell said. 'But that's best-case scenario. It could take several more days just to get through the difficult section where they currently are. If any weather moves in, that could also delay things, but the forecast is looking good for now,' he said. It will be the culmination of a six year project to conquer the route that they have called the Dawn Wall. Until now the pair have been gradually edging their way up the route one pitch at a time, practicing each move until they have been able to climb freely up the holds without falling or the need for assistance from aid climbing equipment. Previous attempts to climb the route cleanly have been beset with problems. Caldwell and Jorgeson tried to climb it all in 2010, but storms halted their progress about a third of the way up while in 2011 Jorgeson broke an ankle after falling during an attempt. Just after Christmas 2014 the pair began their latest attempt to finally climb the entire route without stopping. Progress: If all goes well, the pair could reach the summit of El Capitan as early as Friday or Saturday. Above, Caldwell makes his way up the rock face on Sunday . Daunting: At 3,000-feet-tall, El Capitan is the largest monolith of granite in the world and one of the most difficult climbs . Many have climbed Dawn Wall but the pair would be the first to 'free climb' the section using ropes only as a safeguard against falls. Previous ascensionist have used ropes and metal pitons to help pull themselves upwards, as well as to stop them plummeting to the ground if they fall. Caldwell and Jorgenson are pulling themselves up the route using only the tiny holds they can find on the rock. For Caldwell this has meant overcoming a DIY accident where he cut off much of his left index finger with a table saw in 2001. He has trained with his remaining figures to build up their strength. But the razor sharp granite holds on Dawn Wall has now led both Caldwell and Jorgeson to tape their finger tips as the rock has shredded their skin. The first climber reached El Capitan's summit in 1958, and there are roughly 100 routes up to the top. Evans said the two have a cellphone on their ascent, but they weren not taking calls Monday because they were resting and 'want no distractions while on the cliff.' The two also were not answering emails from roughly 1,500 feet above the ground. Not out of the loop: The pair keep in touch with the outside world using a cellphone they brought with them on the climb, using it to tweet and post updates to the social networking site Facebook. However, on Monday they stayed off the device to focus on resting . These practices may not seem unusual, but the climbers have relied heavily on social media to document their adventure. Both update their Facebook pages regularly and tweet from the Dawn Wall, which has been called 'as smooth as alabaster, as steep as the bedroom wall.' Last Friday, Jorgeson hosted a live question-and-answer session from the wall. Mountaineers: The first climber reached El Capitan's summit in 1958, and there are roughly 100 routes up the steep rock faces to the top . Live from El Capitan: On Friday, Jorgeson hosted a question and  answer session from the wall. Seen climbing El Capitan, above . Worst is over: There are 32 sections of El Capitan to climb, but the pair have already finished the three hardest sections of the route . Caldwell's wife', Becca, has also been blogging about their trip daily and wrote this post last weekend. 'Being up on the wall for over a week and the hard climbing Tommy and Kevin have done up until now adds an element of difficulty on top of the hard climbing they have to do,' she wrote. 'Imagine performing your very best after not walking for one week.  I know Tommy has made an effort to try and do stretching, pushups, (and) yoga in the (hanging tent) hoping this might combat the unusual circumstances of living like veal between their climbing.  So let's hope for big things today. This climb definitely won't be over until it's over, but I believe it's possible. Let's go boys!!!' Jorgeson tweeted late Saturday about his difficulty scaling one section: 'Battling. #dawnwall.' On December 30 the pair managed to compete the hardest section of the wall - the first traverse at around pitch 14. Writing on Facebook later that evening, Jorgeson said: 'Tonight, I sent the hardest pitch of my life and the hardest on the Dawn Wall! Best of all, Tommy sent right after me! Pitch 14 (the first traverse) is in the bag!' Caldwell added: 'The hardest pitch got sent by both of us tonight. I might be in a little shock right now. The route is taking a toll on our fingertips as we are now both climbing with taped up fingertips, but it doesn't seem to be slowing us down too much.' There are 32 sections of the climb. On Sunday night, Lowell said Caldwell, climbing in the dark, completed the last of the three hardest sections of climbing, which was a major breakthrough, Lowell said. 'He still has 1,500 feet of hard, scary climbing ahead, but mentally he is feeling really confident right now, and incredibly excited. (Jorgeson) is extremely close to completing pitch 15, one of the hardest. (Tuesday) he will try to complete it and catch up to Tommy so they can continue forging ahead.' In 1970, Warren Harding and Dean Caldwell (no relation to Tommy Caldwell) climbed Dawn Wall using ropes and countless rivets over 27 days. The duo prepared for at least six years for the climb, according to friends and their personal websites. John Long, the first person to climb El Capitan in one day in 1975, said he speaks to the climbers several times a day. 'It's almost inconceivable that anyone could do something that continuously difficult,' he said Monday, adding that he believes they spent the equivalent of a year's time on the wall in preparation for the climb. To follow Jorgeson and Caldwell on their journey, follow them on Instagram. Big UP Productions and photographer Corey Rich are also capturing the two as they ascend the monolith, and both have been posting pictures of the monumental climb on Instagram as well.","Climbers Kevin Jorgeson, 30, and Tommy Caldwell, 36, are making their way up El Capitan - the largest monolith of granite in the world - in a single push without pulling on any  equipment to aid their ascent .

"It sounds like a tough sell - water created from human waste. However, Bill Gates has backed a new hi-tech water plant than could bring clean water to Africa - and has even drunk it. The Microsoft founder has backed a Seattle firm's radical machine that uses a combination of steam and filters to convert human waste into water the firm says it indistinguishable from bottled water. Scroll down for video . 'I watched the piles of feces go up the conveyer belt and drop into a large bin,' said Bill Gates on his Blog, before declating the final product 'as good as anything I've drunk out of a bottle.' At least 2 billion, use latrines that aren’t properly drained, while others simply defecate out in the open. The waste contaminates drinking water for millions of people, with horrific consequences: . Diseases caused by poor sanitation kill some 700,000 children every year, and they prevent many more from fully developing mentally and physically. Called the OmniProcessor, the new kind of low-cost waste treatment plant has been backed by the Gates Foundation, and is about to be tested in Senegal for the first time. 'I watched the piles of feces go up the conveyer belt and drop into a large bin,' said Bill Gates on his Blog. 'They made their way through the machine, getting boiled and treated. 'A few minutes later I took a long taste of the end result: a glass of delicious drinking water.' In the video showing the moment Gates drinks the water, he does look slightly concerned. However, after a taste, he laughs. 'It tastes as good as anything I've drunk out of a bottle,' he said. 'And having studied the engineering behind it, I would happily drink it every day. It’s that safe.' Each roughly $1.5-million plant can process sewage for a community of about 100,000 people, the firm behind it says. The machine runs at such a high temperature (1000 degrees Celsius) that there’s no nasty smell; in fact it meets all the emissions standards set by the U.S. government. Each roughly $1.5-million plant can process sewage for a community of about 100,000 people, the firm behind it says. 'It’s the ultimate example of that old expression: one man’s trash is another man’s treasure,' said Gates. Gates says Western toilets aren’t the answer, 'because they require a massive infrastructure of sewer lines and treatment plants that just isn’t feasible in many poor countries. So a few years ago our foundation put out a call for new solution.' The plan is for the Omniprocessor to act as a safe repository for human waste. In many places without modern sewage systems, truckers take the waste from latrines and dump it into the nearest river or the ocean—or at a treatment facility that doesn’t actually treat the sewage. 'If we get it right, it will be a good example of how philanthropy can provide seed money that draws bright people to work on big problems, eventually creating a self-supporting industry,' says Gates. 'Our foundation is funding Janicki to do the development. 'It’s really amazing to see how they’ve embraced the work; founder Peter Janicki and his family have traveled to Africa and India multiple times so they can see the scope of the problem.' The machines heats the sludge until it boils, and water exits the dryer as steam. At this temperature, pathogens cannot survive. While the water is in the vapour phase, it is filtered to remove particles. The contraption then take this bio-safe steam and condense it to water before putting it through water treatment. The machine's water treatment adjusts the pH, and uses multiple filters to ensure safe, clear, great tasting water. The water is indistinguishable from bottled water. The foundation now plans to set up an Omniprocessor in Dakar, Senegal, where they’ll study everything from how you connect with the local community (the team is already working with leaders there) to how you pick the most convenient location. They will also test a system of sensors and webcams that will let Janicki’s engineers control the processor remotely and communicate with the team in Dakar so they can diagnose any problems that come up.","OmniProcessor uses steam, incineration and filtration to create water .

"A teenage mother is fighting for her life after her 32-year-old lover beat her in the head with an axe, severing her tongue and badly damaging her eye. Evangelino Olivas Colon ambushed 17-year-old Filis Elizondo Orellana at the makeshift hut where they live in Baia Mare, northern Romania, three days after she'd moved out because he beat her. As their six-month-old and two-and-a-half-year-old daughters watched, Colon picked up the axe and swung it repeatedly into her head and face. Brutal: The axe used in a savage attack on a 17-year-old mother-of-two by her partner after they rowed . He then reportedly called police and calmly waited for them to arrive and arrest him. Paramedics found Miss Orellana unconscious and lying in a pool of blood. She was rushed to intensive care where she is now fighting for her life. While the immediate motive for the attack is unknown, it is understood that Miss Orellana had moved out of the home she shared with Colon three days earlier after he had beaten her. She had been staying with their children at her parents house, but was apparently lured back to what local media described as their 'makeshift hut' by Colon to discuss their relationship problems. After emergency crews arrived, dozens of people gathered at the scene demanding the swift punishment of Colon, forcing police to call in reinforcements. Neighbour Alina Medrea, 59, was quoted as saying by Central European News: 'When I went inside it was like something out of a horror film. 'The girl was lying on the floor unconscious in a pool of blood, one of her eyes was missing and the children despite their young age were terrified and crying. It was just horrific.' Injuries: Paramedics found Filis Elizondo Orellana unconscious and lying in a pool of blood. She was rushed to intensive care where she is now fighting for her life . Treatment: Miss Orellana was expected to undergo surgery today but doctors said there was little chance of saving her eye.

"South Korea has accused Kim Jong-Un of using a 6,000-strong cyber army to launch attacks on its military and government, as well as targeting organisations overseas. North Korea may now be able to hit the U.S. mainland with nuclear warheads thanks to advances in rocket technology and efforts to minimise the radioactive bombs, Seoul's defence ministry said. The warning comes after days of rising tensions on the Korena peninsula after Kim said he was open to 'high level' talks with the South during his New Year speech. Scroll down for video . Kim Jong-Un has twice the number of hackers as previously estimated, and may be able to hit the U.S. mainland with nuclear bombs thanks to advances in rocket technology, according to South Korea . The South's defence ministry said Kim Jong-Un was attempting to minituarise nuclear warheads so that they could be used in a possible strike against America (file image) South Korean officials had previously estimated that North Korea had 3,000 hackers at its disposal, but in a report published today they doubled that number to 6,000. The revised estimate comes after Kim's regime was blamed for hacking movie producer Sony Pictures in retaliation for making film The Interview, depicting the assassination of Kim Jong-Un. In the days following the leaking of confidential Sony information, the South said it had foiled an attempt to hack its nuclear reactors, again blaming the attack on the North. Last week South Korean IT experts said they had removed a 'worm' - a type of virus spread via email or file-sharing that is able to replicate itself - from one of their systems. Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power Co said that a 'small amount' of non-critical data was stolen, but that no threat was found in the computer network controlling its reactors. In his New Year address, Kim Jong-Un said he was willing to engage in talks with the South at the 'highest level', but only if conditions were met. Among those conditions were agreements for the South to stop undermining his regime, and to cease all joint military exercises with the U.S. in the waters around North Korea. The report is likely to raise tensions on the already fraught Korean peninsula, even after South Korean President Park Geun-Hye said she was open to 'high level' talks with the North . While South Korean President Park Geun-Hye has come out in favour of talks, she has refused to end the military drills, and this new report could scupper any hopes of restarting diplomacy. South Korean campaigners are also trying their best to prevent any talks from taking place, launching balloons over the border carrying messages which are critical of Kim's leadership. The letters were enough to derail the peace process last time, and prompted a short exchange of heavy machine gun fire as troops from the North attempted to shoot them down. The North, which has described the activists as 'human scum', has repeatedly asked for the balloons to be banned. The South has refused, but urged protesters to 'show restraint' instead. Fresh U.S. sanctions, which came into force at the start of the year following the Sony Pictures hack, have also meant that relations between the two Koreas have been strained. While the asset freezes, which target 10 North Korean government officials and three organizations, will likely have little direct impact on the regime, they are a very public rebuke for an attack that the North has consistently denied.","South Korea says Kim has twice as many hackers as previously thought .

Just three days after the fire in Sagaponack, New York, Gilbert Jr. was arrested for violating a protective order taken out by Smith Jr. Gilbert Jr. was arraigned on Monday on murder and weapons possession charges in the death of his father, 70-year-old Thomas Gilbert Sr., who was found shot in the head in his Manhattan apartment on Sunday. Gilbert Jr.'s ex, meanwhile, insisted in an interview with ABC News that he is a 'sweet man' who is tortured by his relationship with his demanding father. Twice-divorced Upper East Side socialite Anna Rothschild, 49, dated Gilbert Jr. for several months until he broke it off in May when Gilbert Jr. met someone new. Miss Rothschild, 49, says she was shocked and surprised to hear her ex-boyfriend was implicated in his father's death, since Tommy seemed happy and 'totally fine' when she saw him at a dinner just two weeks ago. Pattern of violence? Tommy was arrested and accused in September of harassing a Peter Smith Jr. in Southampton, Long Island. A law enforcement official told the Associated Press that Tommy was suspected of burning down Smith's father's mansion there three days before his arrest . Love rival? Sources told the New York Post that Gilbert Jr. set fire to the family home of Peter Smith Jr. (left) because he believed Smith was sleeping with his girlfriend.

Social: Tommy Gilbert, pictured with friend Monika Plocienniczak, at the Young New Yorkers Summer Party in the Hamptons . However, she she was frank when she described his 'strained' and 'stressful' relationship with his father. 'His father was never happy with anything he did or nothing was ever good enough,' she said. Miss Rothschild first met Tommy at a mutual friend's dinner party in December 2013, and soon after started dating. She says they broke up last May when she started dating someone new. At the time, Miss Rothschild says Tommy was unemployed but working to start his own hedge fund, just like his father. In a separate interview with the New York Post, Miss Rothschild revealed that Tommy complained about his father not giving him the seed money to start the investment venture. Still, money never seemed to be too much of an issue during their courtship since Tommy always paid the bill when they went out and seemed to enjoy his life of leisure. Miss Rothschild says Tommy appeared not to be too bothered about his lack of a job, spending most of his time in the Hamptons, going to the gym, practicing yoga and surfing. She describes Tommy as sweet but a bit of an introverted loner who had few friends. In fact, Tommy's mother was about the only person who ever called him, Miss Rothschild says. Still, she finds it hard to believe her former flame capable of carrying out such a heinous act. 'How could a guy be that gorgeous, that wealthy, that fit and kill his dad? This is the last thing in a million years that I thought he could do,' Miss Rothschild said. Tommy Gilbert was part of the trust-fund-baby crowd, a handsome Princeton grad who flitted between his Manhattan home and the Hamptons and attended society parties at museums and symphonies while living off an allowance from his parents. Behind bars: Tommy seen being escorted into Manhattan Central booking by a police officer . No bail: The 30-year-old was arraigned Monday on murder charges and jailed without bail. His attorney had no comment . On the surface, it was a charmed life. But he was in debt, with no job or recent work history. He was a suspect in a fire that destroyed a mansion on Long Island, a law enforcement official told the Associated Press. He was accused of harassing a friend. And his mother told police he had a tense relationship with his Wall Street father and a history of mental illness, authorities said. On Sunday afternoon, police say, it all erupted in violence over a small amount of money. Threatened with a cut of a few hundred dollars in his monthly allowance, Gilbert went to his parents' apartment on wealthy Beekman Place on Manhattan's East Side and shot his father to death, authorities said. The 30-year-old was arraigned Monday on murder charges and jailed without bail. His attorney had no comment. Gilbert had gone to his parents' home saying he wanted to have a word alone with his father, hedge fund founder Thomas Gilbert Sr. His mother went out to get him some food and was gone about 15 minutes when she got a ""bad feeling"" and went back, said Robert Boyce, chief of detectives. She found her 70-year-old husband on the bedroom floor, a bullet hole in his head, Boyce said. A .40-caliber Glock was resting on his chest, his left hand on the gun. Boyce said it was a staged to look like suicide, but the gun wasn't in the right position for a self-inflicted wound. Detectives waited outside Gilbert Jr.'s $3,000-a-month apartment in a six-floor walkup in Chelsea. When they saw a light go on, they went in and found bullets and empty shell casings along with 21 blank credit cards and a device for stealing card numbers, police said. ""He was on a stipend from the family. Looks like he was in debt,"" Boyce said. Gilbert was taken in for questioning but he refused to speak to detectives and asked for an attorney. His father, a graduate of Princeton University and Harvard Business School, worked on Wall Street for more than 40 years and founded Wainscott Capital Partners Fund in 2011. The fund has $200 million in assets. The shooting was a rare act of violence in the well-to-do neighborhood near the United Nations. Neighbor Pierre Gazarian remembered Gilbert as ""incredibly courteous, elegant,"" and praised his ""civility."" Gilbert Jr. graduated from Princeton in 2009 with a degree in economics and was trying to follow in his father's footsteps: He had filed papers with the Securities and Exchange Commission to start a hedge fund of his own, Mameluke Capital. He attended galas and fundraisers with the city's wealthy. In many society photos, some taken at such places as the Frick Collection and the New York Philharmonic, he was seen posing with smiling young women and looking tan at the beach. But he was arrested and accused in September of harassing Peter N. Smith in the town of Southampton, on Long Island, and had a Feb. 2 court date. And a law enforcement official, who was not authorized to discuss the investigation and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity, said Gilbert is a suspect in a blaze that burned down Smith's father's mansion three days before his arrest.","Tommy Gilbert Jr was arrested after his father Thomas Gilbert Sr was found shot to death in his Upper East Side apartment on Sunday .

"Timothy DeFoggi, pictured, was downloading child abuse imagery the very moment his  house in Maryland was raided by the FBI . A former federal cyber-security expert who used his professional skills to hide his membership of a 'dark web' child pornography ring called PedoBook has been jailed for 25 years. Timothy DeFoggi, 56, of Germantown, Maryland, joined a Tor-based website which featured images of child sex abuse believing that his activity would be completely anonymous. However, federal investigators discovered DeFoggi, who was the former acting director of cyber-security at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, joined the Tor-network-based website on March 2, 2012 until the site was taken down by the FBI on December 8, 2012. According to court documents, DeFoggi wanted to meet up with a fellow PedoBook member to fulfil his fantasy of raping and murdering a small child. Five other members of the PedoBook network have been jailed for between 12 and 20 years after they pleaded guilty and in some cases testified against DeFoggi during his trial in August 2014. Assistant Attorney General Leslie R. Caldwell of the Justice Department's Criminal Division said: 'Using the same technological expertise he employed as Acting Director of Cyber Security at HHS, DeFoggi attempted to sexually exploit children and traffic in child pornography through an anonymous computer network of child predators. 'But dangerous criminals cannot be allowed to operate on-line with impunity. Today's sentence shows that the Department of Justice will bring criminals and child predators to justice, even when they employ anonymous networks like Tor.' DeFoggi was found guilty on August 26, 2014 following a four day trial of 'engaging in a child exploitation exercise', which carried a minimum jail term of 20 years and a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. According to the Government's sentencing memorandum: 'Trial evidence demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant, acting through his online aliases ""PT***eater"" and ""****christ"" joined and participated actively in the Tor-network-based ""PedoBook"" online social networking community. 'During the course of his membership in that community the defendant repeatedly accessed child pornography depicting infant and toddler-aged children being raped by adults or engaging in other sexually explicit activity; joined public and private groups such as ""Boys Hardcore,"" ""Kids with dog & other animals,"" ""Toddler Girls Forced"" and ""0-2 Year Little Girls Private Sharing Group 2012"".' Assistant Attorney General Leslie R. Caldwell, left, said DeFoggi used the skills he had developed while working as a cyber-security expert with the Department of Health to try and avoid detection . Federal prosecutors discovered that DeFoggi encouraged 'others to interact with him in order to further his particular interest in violent child pornography and child sexual abuse'. He also solicited child abuse images from fellow members and 'discussed his desires to commit the violent rape and murder of children; and south to meet at least one fellow member to share in and facilitate that desire.' According to federal prosecutors the PedoBook social network routed all communication through several computers before reaching their final destination in a bid to prevent them being intercepted by the authorities. 'The defendant deployed multiple software programs, including Eraser and CCleaner, to delete evidence of his computer and web browsing activity. And when finally confronted by law enforcement agents executing a search warrant in his home, he immediately ran for his laptop computer (which was in the process of downloading a child pornography video from a Tor-network-based child pornography archive) and had to be physically removed from it by an FBI agent.' US Attorney for the District of Nebraska Deborah R. Gilg said: 'Today's sentence and the others imposed earlier demonstrate that those who exploit children will be aggressively pursued and prosecuted to the full extent of the law . 'Those who think they are acting anonymously on the Internet will be found and held accountable.' FBI Special Agent in charge Thomas Metz said: 'The production and distribution of child pornography is one of the most saddening, tragic crimes the FBI investigates . 'Today's sentencing sends a message to those who advertise, distribute, possess, and trade child pornography that the FBI will look for you, will find you and will make sure you are prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.' Timothy DeFoggi, 56, formerly of Germantown, Maryland, was convicted on Aug. 26, 2014, following a four-day jury trial before Chief U.S. District Judge Laurie Smith Camp in the District of Nebraska of engaging in a child exploitation enterprise, conspiracy to advertise and distribute child pornography and accessing a computer with intent to view child pornography. The PedoBook network was run by a single administrator Aaron McGrath, who was jailed for 20 years on January 31, 2014. He received a 10-year reduction in his sentence for providing 'substantial' assistance ot the government. Jason Flanary, 43, formerly of Chicago, Illinois but living in the Philippines and Guam received a 20 year jail term in June 2013. Wesley Cameron 23, of Ashford, Alabama was jailed for 15 years in October 2014. Charles MacMillan, 29, of Rockville, Maryland and Zackary Austin, 28, of Reno, Nevada received 12 and 16 years respectively, when they were jailed in November 2014.","Timothy DeFoggi, 56, was a member of the PedoBook social network .

He was pronounced dead at the scene. All of the eight students traveling with DeJesus and a female adult supervisor were taken to Strong Memorial Hospital with some suffering serious but not life-threatening injuries. Head-on collision: A 30-year-old New York bus driver was killed Tuesday morning after suffering a suspected heart attack behind the wheel . As of 2pm six of the eight children, ranging from eight to 11 years old, had been discharged and allowed to return home. The students in the other bus DeJesus hit were not hurt. Noe Gonzalez, an early morning commuter who stopped to investigate the crash scene, told Time Warner Cable News he heard children screaming before spotting the unresponsive driver. He helped the passengers exit the bus by opening the emergency exit.

"Hollywood actress Ellen Page has tweeted her fury about the Queen giving an MBE to a Northern Irish politician who blamed Hurricane Katrina and Aids on homosexuals. The appearance of Maurice Mills, a Democratic Unionist Party councillor for Ballymena, on the New Year Honours list prompted a foul-mouthed reaction from the Inception star. Her message on twitter, retweeted over 2,000 times, was accompanied by a picture of the Queen. Scroll down for video . Hollywood actress Ellen Page has tweeted her fury about the Queen giving an MBE to a Northern Irish politician who blamed Hurricane Katrina and Aids on homosexuals . The appearance of Maurice Mills, a Democratic Unionist Party councillor for Ballymena, on the New Year Honours list prompted a foul-mouthed reaction from the Inception star (pictured) It read: 'The Queen honored a politician who blamed Hurricane Katrina & AIDS on LGBT people – f*** that.' The 27-year-old Canadian actress was referencing two quotes from Mr Mills. In 2005, in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, which killed 1,300 people in the US, he said: 'The media failed to report that the hurricane occurred just two days prior to the annual homosexual event called the Southern Decadence festival [in New Orleans] which the previous year had attracted an estimated 125,000 people. Surely this is a warning to nations where such wickedness is increasingly promoted and practised.' Mills, who is receiving his MBE for services to local government, also made an incendiary remark about Aids. He said: 'This abominable and filthy practice of sodomy has resulted in the great continent of Africa being riddled with Aids.' Controversial: Maurice Mills (pictured) said 'the filthy practice of sodomy has resulted in Africa being riddled with Aids' Maurice Mills said that Hurricane Katrina was a warning against practising homosexuality. Pictured is New Orleans in the aftermath of the disaster . Mr Mills has never retracted these views and MailOnline is awaiting a response to a request for a comment from him. John O’Doherty, director of Northern Ireland's largest LGBT organisation, The Rainbow Project, described Mr Mills' comments as ludicrous and his MBE as evidence that homophobia in Northern Ireland is acceptable. He said: 'I am disappointed Maurice Mills has been awarded an MBE despite his insistence that natural disasters and an epidemic impacting on the poorest and most vulnerable in the world were caused by Gods hatred of same sex relationships. 'These comments would be insulting if they weren’t so ludicrous. The decision to award Mr Mills an MBE in spite of the comments he made in 2005 is an indication of how little things have changed in Northern Ireland. Homophobia remains an acceptable prejudice in public life and society. The Rainbow Project has reaffirmed its commitment to work with all faith groups in Northern Ireland to engage, learn and address the issues that exist between our communities. 'We hope that political and faith leaders choose to engage in this conversation and show true leadership rather than cowardly insulting our community from the side-lines.' TV doctor Christian Jessen also posted an angry tweet about Mr Mills' award, urging his followers to complain about it. Page came out last year while giving a speech at a Las Vegas conference for LGBT teenagers, telling the audience that she was 'tired of hiding'. She admitted she suffered for years because she was afraid to come out. She told the audience, 'I'm standing here today, with all of you, on the other side of all that pain.'","Maurice Mills is receiving an MBE in 2015 for services to local government .

"Nicholas Sparks, known for penning powerful novels about enduring love, is splitting from his wife of 25 years - the woman who inspired many of his books. The author, who has written 17 romantic novels including Hollywood hit 'The Notebook', revealed the decision to People magazine, but insisted that he remains close friends with his wife Cathy. 'This is, of course, not a decision we've made lightly,' he told the magazine. 'We remain close friends with deep respect for each other and love for our children. For our children's sake, we regard this as a private matter.' The couple has three sons and twin daughters, ranging in age from 12 to 23. Scroll down for video .

"When it comes to being healthy, the world’s priority is getting more sleep rather than eating healthy food, exercising or taking vitamins, a poll has found. Worldwide, 66 per cent of people  get enough sleep, compared to 59 per cent who eat healthy food and 57 per cent who regularly exercise. Indonesians and Indians are the most well-rested, with 85 and 77 per cent respectively reporting they get enough sleep. Meanwhile the Polish and Russians get by with the least shut-eye, with only 51 per cent and 52 per cent getting enough rest to maintain health. The poll, by market research organisation GfK, questioned more than 28,000 in 23 countries on which activities they regularly do to maintain their physical health. Graphic shows the percentage of people in each country (arranged alphabetically, going from Argentina, clockwise, to the USA) who get enough sleep (red), eat healthy food  (green) or exercise (blue). These were the top activities people worldwide report they carry out to maintain physical health . Globally, people focus more on sleep than on regular oral care, and more on exercise than spending time with friends, family or pets. The graph shows the top five activities people around the world say they carry out in order to maintain their physical health. It also breaks down each category by gender, showing more women take part in health promoting behaviours than men - except when it comes to exercise . It found only that while sushi may be touted as a diet option, only 29 per cent of people in Japan say they eat healthy food. And while curry is billed as a high-calorie Friday night treat, 79 per cent of people in India say they eat healthily. Mexico and China have the highest number of people who exercise on a regular basis (68 per cent and 67 per cent), while Japan and Russia have fewer fitness fanatics (39 per cent and 40 per cent). For the survey, GfK interviewed  people aged 15 or older in 23 countries either online or face-to-face in summer 2014. The countries included Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Poland, Russia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, UK, Ukraine and the USA. They were asked which activity they were most likely to carry out in order to maintain their physical health, from a list of 14 activities from sleep and exercise to unplugging from technology and meditating. Their questioning revealed having a cosmetic procedure - whether surgical or non-surgical - was the least popular way of maintaining health, with only 6 per cent of people globally choosing to do this. The study found stark differences between the sexes, especially when it comes to sun safety. Globally, women are over twice as likely than men to use sunscreen than men, it found. People in Brazil slather on the most suncream, at 46 per cent, while Australia and Spain both trail at 42 per cent. And having children seems to make people more healthy. Parents get 2 per cent more sleep than non-parents and lead on eating healthy food by 8 per cent. You might think running around after children would put parents in the lead on exercise, but in fact non-parents edged in front by 3 per cent. Graph shows, from top to bottom, the activities the majority of people worldwide carried out to maintain their physical health. Sleep and eating healthily topped the list, while using herbal, holistic or alternative remedies, massages or spa treatments or undergoing a cosmetic procedure were bottom of the list . The activities people in the UK said they carried out to be healthy (light blue) compared to the global average (dark blue). More people in the UK used skin care, beauty or personal grooming products than the global average (44 per cent compared with 38 per cent) but Britons are less likely to use meditation or relaxation techniques than the global average (9 per cent compared with 17 per cent) The activities people in the US said they carried out to be healthy (light blue) compared to the global average (dark blue). In the US, spending time with family and friends topped the list of health-promoting activities, with a whopping 71 per cent carrying out this activity, compared to a global average of 53 per cent. But Americans lagged behind the worldwide average when it comes to following a specific diet (17 per cent compared with 18 per cent) The activities people in the Australia said they carried out to be healthy (light blue) compared to the global average (dark blue). More Australians took vitamins and supplements than the global average (45 per cent compared to 32 per cent) but they were not so prolific in getting massages or spa treatments (12 per cent compared to a global average of 14 per cent) There will be differences across countries in what people think of as being 'healthy, nutritious food', a GfK analyst said . Mexico topped the global list for exercise, but are they really the fittest? A spokesperson for GfK explained that cultural differences could explain the results... He told MailOnline: 'The study reports what people are consciously doing regularly to maintain their physical health, so the findings reflect not only what activities people are doing, but also what activities they associate with being specifically for physical health. 'There is also the question of cultural background – for example, the normal level of work-life balance within each country will impact amount of sleep and perceptions of how much sleep is necessary for physical health. 'There will also be differences across countries in exactly what people think of as being ‘exercise’ or ‘healthy, nutritious food’. 'For example – Mexico is known as having a growing level of obesity since the 1980s, but it also reports the highest number of consumers who claim to exercise on a regular basis to maintain their physical health. 'An explanation for this is not necessarily that Mexico is full of hard-core gym fanatics; it’s more likely to be that health focus has gone from widespread malnutrition before 1980s to growing levels of obesity now, so this is very much in the national focus and higher levels of the population have this issue ""front of mind"". 'They will therefore be more broadly aware than other countries of the need for exercise and are therefore likely to assign lower levels of activity (e.g. walking to the shops) into the category of ‘exercising’ than, for example, populations in UK or Germany who might only assign going to the gym or playing sport as ‘exercising’.'","Poll reveals activities people worldwide carry out to be healthy: Sleep, eating healthily and exercising top the list .

"Jury selection began Monday in the New York murder trial of a six-year-old boy who disappeared 35 years ago in one of America's most famous missing child cases. Etan Patz vanished after leaving his parents' Manhattan townhouse to walk alone for the first time to the bus stop to go to school on May 25, 1979. His parents only realized he was missing when he failed to return home at the end of the day. His body has never been found. Missing: Etan Patz vanished after leaving his parents' Manhattan townhouse to walk alone for the first time to the bus stop to go to school on May 25, 1979 . Chilling memory: People walk past a street shrine to six-year-old Etan Patz, in front of the building where suspect Pedro Hernandez confessed to having strangled the boy . The case became a national cause celebre and awakened millions of Americans to the dangers of child abduction, fueling a generation of vigilant child rearing by parents frightened to let their offspring out of sight. Pedro Hernandez, 53, who worked in a nearby grocery store at the time, is on trial for the murder and kidnapping of Etan. He confessed to police in 2012 to killing the boy, but has since recanted his confession and pleads not guilty. He sat quietly in the New York state supreme court in Manhattan on Monday, dressed smartly in grey trousers, and a pin-stripped shirt and tie. When instructed by Judge Maxwell Wiley, he stood without a word and turned to peer blankly at the room of prospective jurors. Criminal defense attorney Harvey Fishbein says his client suffers from mental illness and has 'borderline-to-mild mental retardation.' Legal experts say the prosecutors will have a hard time to prove their case, in a trial which is expected to last into March and possibly April. Fishbein said 80 witnesses could take the stand, but police are understood to have struggled to find supporting evidence against Hernandez. Jury selection begins: Pedro Hernandez, who confessed to the 1979 killing of 6-year-old Etan Patz, appears in Manhattan Criminal Court in New York in a November 15, 2012 file photo . Will go on trial: An NYPD mugshot of Pedro Hernandez, accused killer of Etan Patz who will go on trial . Few clues were ever found to Etan's disappearance in the SoHo neighborhood where he lived with his parents and disappeared. His father was a photographer and the boy was the first missing child to be featured on milk cartons as part of a national search. - Two to three month trial - . In 1983, then US president Ronald Reagan declared the anniversary of his disappearance National Missing Children Day. Wiley advised the first batch of prospective jurors of the ""unprecedented"" publicity surrounding the case and warned that the trial would be lengthy.

Accused of murder: Pedro Hernandez appears with his lawyer Harvey Fishbein in Manhattan Criminal Court in New York, in this file photo taken on  November 15, 2012 . 'This trial is going to be long. We anticipate that the case is going to take anywhere from two to three months to try,' Wiley told the packed court room. Would-be jurors took an oath and were then dismissed to fill out a questionnaire in the first part of a selection process. On Thursday, the court will begin the next stage of whittling down hundreds of potential jurors to the 12 who will hear the case. No body has ever been found and Etan was declared legally dead in 2001. Hernandez initially appeared to settle the mystery over Patz's disappearance when he came forward and confessed in May 2012. He told police on video tape that he lured the boy to the basement of the store where he worked and strangled him, before stuffing him into a plastic bag and then a box. Hernandez would have been 19 at the time of the murder. His initial confession came as a shock. Jose Ramos, a 71-year-old convicted sex offender, was never indicted but long suspected of involvement with the case. He was jailed in Pennsylvania for more than 20 years for child molestation. Etan's parents sued him and he was declared responsible in a civil action and ordered to pay $2 million.

"Angela Merkel has urged Germans not to attend protest by the newly established campaign group PEGIDA, or Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamisation of the West, saying they have 'hatred in their hearts' Anglea Merkel has today urged Germans to shun protests calling for an end to the 'Islamisation of Europe' saying  that religious intolerance has no place in modern Germany. Speaking after last night's march in Dresden drew 18,000 people on to the streets, the German Chancellor accused activists of having hatred in their hearts, while a campaign by daily newspaper Bild called for an end to 'xenophobia' in society. The front page of today's Bild newspaper was covered in statements from 50 prominent Germans, including Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble, rockstar Udo Lindenberg, and former German soccer captain Oliver Bierhoff, denouncing the political movement. As demonstrators from grassroots movement PEGIDA, or Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamisation of the West, waved German flags and shouted slogans yesterday the lights around Cologne Cathedral and the Brandenberg Gate in Berlin were extinguished in a symbolic gesture of opposition. PEGIDA marches have become a weekly event in the eastern city of Dresden, but have recently spread to Cologne and Berlin, though yesterday the number of protesters were vastly outnumbered by pro-immigration activists. Last night in Cologne the square around Cologne Cathedral - one of Germany's most famous landmarks - was plunged into darkness as part of a symbolic gesture against the demonstrations. In Berlin, the floodlights at the Brandenburg Gate were switched off, while the lights were also extinguished at the city's iconic TV Tower. Lights on the bridges which cross the Rhine were also switched off. Cologne Cathedral provost Norbert Feldhoff, said that shutting down the lights was an attempt to make the demonstrators think twice about their protest. 'You're taking part in an action that, from its roots and also from speeches, one can see is Nazi-ist, racist and extremist,' he told n-tv. 'And you're supporting people you really don't want to support.' Other buildings, including several other churches and a museum, joined the Cologne Cathedral in shutting off their lights. In the eastern city Dresden - which has been at the centre of the weekly rallies since they began in October -  Volkswagen decided to keep its glass-walled manufacturing plant dark, to demonstrate that the company 'stands for an open, free and democratic society.' The latest wave of protests came just days after German Chancellor Angela Merkel used her New Year's Day message to spurn the rallies which she views as racist. In defiance of her words, some 18,000 people turned out in Dresden, carrying signs with slogans such as 'wake up'. The crowd also chanted 'we are the people' and 'lying press' as they passed television cameras and waved Germany's black, red and gold flag. They also brandished posters bearing slogans such as 'Against religious fanaticism and every kind of radicalism'. Around 18,000 people gathered in Dresden last night for one of the group's weekly marches as protests also spread to Berlin and Cologne (pictured) where the lights were turned out on the city's cathedral as a symbolic gesture of opposition . The blanket of darkness which descended across Germany was designed to be a sign of solidarity against protests by the group Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamisation of the West . Despite the Dresden march drawing a record crowd of 18,000, in Cologne there were only a few hundred marchers who were easily outnumbered by pro-immigration campaigners . One poster  called for 'potatoes rather than doner kebabs', a swipe at ethnic Turks who at around three million represent Germany's largest immigrant community. But similar rallies in Berlin and the western city of Cologne were heavily outnumbered by counter-protesters who accuse PEGIDA of fanning racism and intolerance. Only about 250 PEGIDA supporters showed up in Cologne - home to a large Muslim population - compared to about ten times that number of counter-demonstrators. PEGIDA was even forced to call off its demonstration early, after organisers reported being blocked from marching along their planned route, police said. Similarly in Berlin, police said some 5,000 counter-demonstrators blocked about 300 PEGIDA supporters from marching along their planned route from city hall to the Brandenburg Gate. Some 18,000 anti-immigrant protesters marched through the streets of Dresden in the lastest round of demonstrations about what they say is the growing influence of Islam . The rallies, attended by opponents of Germany's immigration and asylum policies, have become an almost weekly event in the east German city of Dresden in recent months . Justice Minister Heiko Maas said at the Berlin counter-demonstration: ''Germany is a country where refugees are welcome and the silent majority must not remain silent but rather go out onto the streets and show itself,.' In Stuttgart, where there were not even a planned protest, there were reports of 8,000 people demonstrating against the movement. The increase in counter-protests came following Mrs Merkel's New Year's address, in which she urged Germans to stay away from the Dresden rallies. 'We need to ... say that right-wing extremism, hostility towards foreigners and anti-Semitism should not be allowed any place in our society,' Merkel said on Monday in the eastern town of Neustrelitz. But some of the protestors, including in Berlin (pictured), were heavily outnumbered by counter-protesters, including these from the Alliance against Racism, who accuse PEGIDA of fanning racism and intolerance . Members of the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) also joined the counter protest in Berlin, where police said just 300 anti-immigration protesters turned up . One person in Cologne - where just 250 anti-immigrant demonstrators turned up - waved a flag saying 'I love immigration' German Justice Minister Heiko Maas (centre) and Berlin's Integration Senator Dilek Kolat (right) also joined the demonstration in Berlin to protest against a rally by the mounting right-wing populist movement . But, at Monday's rally, PEGIDA organizer Kathrin Oertel slammed the speech, telling the crowd 'in Germany we have political repression again.' 'Or how would you see it when we are insulted or called racists or Nazis openly by all the political mainstream parties and media for our justified criticism of Germany's asylum seeker policies and the non-existent immigration policy,' she asked the cheering crowd. Germany has some of the world's most liberal asylum rules, partly due to its Nazi past. The number of asylum seekers arriving in Germany, many from the Middle East, jumped to around 200,000 last year -- four times as many as in 2012. But PEGIDA has unsettled Germany's political establishment. The first protest in October was attended by just a few hundred people, but the movement quickly snowballed. Since then, PEGIDA has sought to distance itself from the far-right, saying in its position paper posted on Facebook that it is against 'preachers of hate, regardless of what religion' and 'radicalism, regardless of whether religiously or politically motivated.' Supports of the left-wing group 'Die Linke' held up a poster reading 'Refugees welcome! Against racism and right-wing violence' in Berlin . In Rostock, north east Germany, hundreds turned out in a show of solidarity against the anti-immigrant campaigns . In Berlin, police said some 5,000 counter-demonstrators blocked about 300 PEGIDA supporters from marching along their planned route . The protestors were planning on marching from city hall to the Brandenburg Gate but were blocked by those campaigning against the protest . 'PEGIDA is for resistance against an anti-woman political ideology that emphasizes violence, but not against integrated Muslims living here,' the group said. It has also banned any neo-Nazi symbols and slogans at its rallies, though critics have noted the praise and support it has received from known neo-Nazi groups. Their leaders have singled out Muslim immigrants in their speeches, but the movement has broadened into one against immigrants from all backgrounds. A particular target has been 'economic refugees', or asylum seekers who they say are seeking a better standard of living in Germany. PEGIDA supporters, pictured last night in Dresden, has unsettled Germany's political establishment since its first protest in October . PEGIDA organizer Kathrin Oertel slammed Angela Merkel's speech at Monday's rally, telling the crowd 'in Germany we have political repression again' The highest number yet of participants took part in a demonstration called by anti-immigration group PEGIDA in Dresden, seen as the birthplace of the movement . PEGIDA has sought to distance itself from the far-right, saying in its position paper posted on Facebook that it is against 'preachers of hate, regardless of what religion' and 'radicalism, regardless of whether religiously or politically motivated' It has also banned any neo-Nazi symbols and slogans at its rallies, though critics have noted the praise and support it has received from known neo-Nazi groups.

"Jeffrey Epstein,  the billionaire child abuser friend of Prince Andrew , cultivated an extraordinary range of contacts - from President Bill Clinton to Mick Jagger - it is revealed today. Court documents obtained by MailOnline disclose how Epstein kept multiple phone numbers, email and home addresses for the great and the good on both sides of the Atlantic. The document was presented as an exhibit as lawyers sought a court's permission to take evidence from Bill Clinton and his staff, for whom Epstein had 21 numbers, all under the name of his former advisor Doug Band. Epstein also had multiple contact details for a string of celebrities, including the Rolling Stones frontman Sir Mick Jagger; Donald Trump's ex-wife Ivana and their daughter Ivanka; and a series of women recorded under 'massage' in the document, nicknamed 'The Holy Grail' by a former employee. The contents of the document are disclosed by MailOnline as Prince Andrew, the Queen's second son, fights back against allegations that he had sex with Virginia Roberts - who claims she was kept by Epstein as a 'sex slave' - when she was a 17-year-old minor. Scroll down for video . High powered: Convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein had 21 numbers for President Bill Clinton and his staff in his book - all under the name  of his former adviser Doug Band . Friends in high places: The page from the records which shows the extent of his records for Bill Clinton. DailyMail.com is obscuring the actual details . There is no suggestion the presence of the names means that they are accused of any form of wrongdoing. The document's existence was disclosed in a series of papers marked Epstein v Edwards at the Federal Court for Southern Florida. The case was first filed in 2010 and in April 2011 supplementary documents disclosed the existence of 'The Journal'. The list of names and addresses points to the vast reach of Epstein's social circle and takes on new light in the wake of the accusation leveled at Prince Andrew. It includes a series of politicians in the USA, the UK, and Israel. There are numbers for Bill Clinton's office in New York, a Washington number, and a number marked 'do not use', . There are also home and car phone numbers for senior members of Clinton's staff, including Doug Band, his former White House 'body man' who was incorrectly named as Bands , and a number marked as 'do not use' Former Israeli prime minister Ehud Olmert has three separate telephone numbers. He is now serving a prison sentence for corruption. Ex-British Prime Minister Tony Blair is recorded once, while his former cabinet minister Lord Peter Mandelson has ten numbers recorded, including one marked 'direct line' one marked 'home' and one marked 'country home'. George Mitchell, the former American senator who was a key figure in the Northern Ireland peace process is also listed. In total there are 97 pages of records, five of which appear to be notes made by lawyers or investigators before the records were entered into court records. The list was cited as an exhibit - and therefore entered into court records -  as lawyers for women who alleged they were abused by Epstein brought a damages claim against him. They wanted to convince a judge to have Mr Clinton deposed. Their attempt did not succeed. In the case, the lawyers wrote: 'Epstein's personal phone directory from his computer contains e-mail addresses for Clinton along with 21 phone numbers for him, including those for his assistant (Doug Band), his schedulers, and what appear to be Clinton's personal numbers. This information certainly leads one to believe that Clinton might well be a source of relevant information and efforts to obtain discovery from him were reasonably calculated to lead to admissible evidence. See exhibits ""B"", ""F"", ""AA"", ""DD"".' Questions: Prince Andrew is photographed with Virginia Roberts in 2001, left,  and she is also pictured with her father, right, when she was seven. Roberts accused the prince of having sex with her . Claims: Virginia Roberts, pictured with her father Sky Roberts, claims she was kept as a sex slave by Jeffrey Epstein and forced to sleep with Prince Andrew, claims Buckingham Palace firmly deny . The extent of Epstein's contacts with Prince Andrew are also suggested. There are 16 separate phone numbers for the Prince, including a mobile phone number, one marked Palace ex-directory, one for Balmoral, the Queen's private retreat in Scotland where Epstein was invited by the Prince and one marked Sand. which appears to be Sandringham, the other royal retreat where he spent time. Epstein also recorded 18 numbers for Sarah Ferguson, Prince Andrew's ex-wife who today stood by him and said he was 'a great man, the best in the world'. The extent of Prince Andrew's friendship came with Epstein was made public when it was revealed his ex-wife was once given $22,880 (£15,000) from the pedophile billionaire  to pay off her debts. The deal was struck in December 2010 after months of negotiations with the disgraced tycoon who insisted on helping with her financial troubles. 'Holy grial' : Epstein kept the names of numbers of the great and the powerful, including ex-British Prime Minister Tony Blair (left) and Rolling Stones frontman Sir Mick Jagger (right) Beauties: Model Angie Everhart (left) and actress Liz Hurley are also in Epstein's book . It came within days of the Duke of York flying out to visit Epstein in New York, fueling speculation he had smoothed the path for Sarah to take the money just 18 months after Epstein was released from jail for soliciting prostitution from under-age girls. The Duchess of York later claimed her judgment had been 'clouded' by her desperation to get out of her £5million debt and vowed to repay the money. Former friends: Prince Andrew is embroiled in fresh claims over his friendship with convicted child abuser Jeffrey Epstein . But when asked today whether she had paid back the cash, her spokesman said: 'No comment'. Other royal connections in the list include 'Charles Althorp', meaning Charles, Earl Spencer, Princess Diana's brother, and Rosa Monckton, the late princess's best friend. Eptein's contacts book is further referred to in court papers filed in court in Florida in September 2010. Royal connection: Epstein kept the details of Sarah Ferguson (left) and Princess Diana's brother,Earl Spencer . Familar faces: Alec Baldwin (left) and Barbara Walters, New York elite, are also in Eptein's journal . It is stated that Alfredo Rodriguez, one of Epstein's household employees, took a journal that he referred to as the 'Holy Grail' from Epstein's computer 'that reflected many of the names of underage females Epstein abused across the country and the world, including locations such as Michigan, California, West Palm Beach, New York, New Mexico, and Paris, France.' It claimed the journal identified 'among other Epstein acquaintances, females that Rodriguez believes were underage under the heading 'Massages'.' Exes: Epstein admitted he had the addresses and phone numbers of magnate Donald Trump and his ex-wife Ivana . Famous: Ivanka Trump (left) and Minnie Driver also included in Epstein's book . Other contacts include Barbara Walters, Alec Baldwin, Virgin boss Sir Richard Branson, Liz Hurley, designer Tom Ford, John Cleese, Minnie Driver, Dustin Hoffman, Bobby Kennedy Jr., Senator Edward Kennedy and Henry Kissinger and Maria Shriver. Rupert Murdoch and models Janice Dickinson, Marie Helvin and Angie Everhart are also listed as well as Courtney Love - as are listings for five-star haunts such as Claridges Hotel in London, Beverley Hills Hotel and the Beverly Wiltshire as well The Plaza in New  York, Cipriani restaurant in Manhattan. Rodriguez was later charged in a criminal complaint with obstruction of justice in connection with trying to obtain $50,000 from civil attorneys pursuing civil sexual assault cases against Epstein as payment for producing the book to the attorneys. Famous haunts: Jeffrey Epstein had the numbers and addresses of five star hotels such as The Plaza and The Beverly Hills in his journal . Do you want to call Barbara? News queen Barbara Walters is in Epstein's journal . Court papers state that Rodriguez argued he needed the money because the journal was his insurance property - as he feared that Epstein would make him 'disappear'.  Because of the importance of the information in the journal to the civil cases, Rodriguez called it 'The Holy Grail'. Rodriguez was later found guilty of obstruction of justice and served 18 months in prison.

"As Prince Andrew tries to salvage his scandal-hit reputation in the 'sex slave' case  -  the man who knows all of his pedophile pal Jeffrey Epstein's secrets has died before he could tell all in an upcoming court battle. Alfredo Rodriguez, who was Epstein's houseman for many years, passed away last week after a six-month battle with cancer, his widow Patricia Dunn told DailyMail.com. 'Of course he knew all about Prince Andrew,' Dunn said on the doorstep of the home she shared with Alfredo in southwest Miami. Buried secrets: Alfredo Rodriguez, who was Epstein's houseman for many years, passed away last week after a six-month battle with cancer, his widow Patricia Dunn told DailyMail.com. He carried many secrets of Epstein's scandalous activities to his grave . Cold comfort: Prince Andrew (right) has become embroiled in the scandal as new court papers claim Epstein (left) supplied him with underage women for sex. He says he found Epstein's friendship comforting . Home sweet home: Rodriguez saw a lot when he worked at Epstein's Palm Beach mansion . 'We weren't expecting the case to come back into the news again,' she added. DailyMail.com revealed that Rodriguez kept a black book of Epstein's contacts — which he referred to as 'The Holy Grail.' or 'Golden Nugget.' The dozens of entries included contact details for A-list names including former President Bill Clinton, Mick Jagger, Donald Trump, Earl Spencer, Barbara Walters, Henry Kissinger and at least three members of the Kennedy clan. Court papers state that Rodriguez argued that he needed to keep the journal as insurance — as he feared Epstein would make him 'disappear'. Court papers also reveal that Rodriguez witnessed nude girls whom he believed were underage at the pool area of the home and knew that his former employer was engaging in sexual contact with underage girls and had viewed pornographic images of underage girls on his home computers. The sensational case has blown up again following court papers filed by two women last week. In them, Andrew, Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz — a key member of O.J. Simpson's legal dream team — and French modeling scout Jean Luc Brunel were accused of taking advantage of the girls when they were under 18. Rodriguez kept a detailed 'black book' of dozens of young women that Epstein abused. The houseman was sentenced to 18 months jail — the same term as his boss — in 2011 for failing to hand the journal to prosecutors. Instead he tried to sell it to defense lawyers for $50,000. The book 'detailed the full scope and the extent of Epstein's involvement with underage girls,' said lawyers. The book also had extensive contact details for Epstein's celebrity friends who included former President Bill Clinton, actors Kevin Spacey and Chris Rock and Celebrity Apprentice host, property mogul Donald Trump. Dunn, a real estate agent, told DailyMail.com that she did not personally know the details and had never met any of the men. 'But I heard a lot of stories,' she added. 'It was a terrible case and Alfredo wasn't really involved' she added. Rodriguez, who was 60, died on December 28 of mesothelioma. On her Facebook page, his Bolivian-born wife wrote in Spanish: 'Though our lives were together for 21 years, the last six months (since I learned of your illness) were a rollercoaster of emotions, feelings and harsh experiences. 'I learned again to love, to appreciate you, to meet you again, and have patience, which is something I did not know and I learned with pleasure.' Stories: Rodriguez' wife,  a real estate agent, told DailyMail.com that she did not personally know the details and had never met any of the men involved with Epstein. 'But I heard a lot of stories,' she added . Rodriguez took Epstein's book without disclosing it to prosecutors, who claim that if they had known of it at the time of Epstein's court case he would have received a much stiffer sentence. But rather than the details of what was in the book, it is what Rodriguez witnessed that could have confirmed whether Prince Andrew had indeed abused the teens. Court papers say Rodriguez 'saw numerous underage girls coming into Epstein’s mansion for purported ""massages"".' A detailed 2007 account of the Epstein case published in New York magazine claimed one of Rodriguez's duties was to wash sex toys that he would find scattered on the floor of Epstein's many houses. Never-married Epstein, 61, was a physics and calculus teacher at the private Dalton School in New York in 1976 when he caught the eye of one of his student's fathers who offered him a job as an options trader with the investment bank Bear Stearns. He later founded his own wealth management company, becoming hugely wealthy in the process. He is said to own the largest private residence in New York along with the private 78-acre Little St. James Island in the Virgin Islands, a mansion in Palm Beach, Florida, a huge ranch in New Mexico and properties in London and Paris. One of the Jane Doe's claimed Epstein forced her to have sex with Harvard lawyer Alan Dershowitz . He has helped fund many science research projects and is a firm believer in the power of massage — he gave $100,000 to Ballet Florida to allow dancers to have daily rubdowns. But his reputation came crashing down in 2007 when the sordid details of his penchant for young girls was laid bare in a sensational court case. In the end he was sentenced to 18 months in jail on a single charge of soliciting an under-age girl for prostitution. He is now a registered sex offender. He had known Andrew for years — they vacationed together in Thailand and the prince even stayed at his New York mansion after Epstein had completed 13 months of his 18-month jail sentence. According to Vanity Fair, Andrew liked Epstein because he taught him how to relax. When the prince was warned by an advisor after the court case that he should distance himself from Epstein, Andrew allegedly screamed: 'Leave me alone. Jeffrey’s my friend. Being loyal to your friends is a virtue. And I’m going to be loyal to him.’ The women who recently joined the lawsuit against Epstein were referred to in court papers as Jane Doe #3 and Jane Doe #4. Jane Doe #3, who makes the claims about Prince Andrew, Dershowitz and Brunel, has since been identified as blonde Virginia Roberts, now 30. The two women joined a lawsuit filed by two other women, Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2. All four claim they were enticed into giving sexually explicit nude massages to Epstein when they were under age. Jane Doe #3 — Roberts — says Epstein forced her to have sex with Andrew, Dershowitz and Brunel. She says Epstein knew Andrew through their mutual friendship with Ghislaine Maxwell, the daughter of the late crooked publisher Robert Maxwell. 'Perhaps even more important to her role in Epstein's sexual abuse ring, Maxwell had direct connections to other powerful individuals with whom she could connect Epstein,' the suit says. 'For instance, one such powerful individual Epstein forced Jane Doe #3 to have sexual relations with was a member of the British Royal Family, Prince Andrew (a/k/a Duke of York). 'Jane Doe #3 was forced to have sexual relations with this Prince when she was a minor in three separate geographical locations: in London (at Ghislaine Maxwell's apartment), in New York, and on Epstein's private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands (in an orgy with numerous other under-aged girls),' the suit continues. Off duty: A detailed 2007 account of the Epstein case  claimed one of Rodriguez's duties was to wash sex toys that he would find scattered on the floor of Epstein's many houses . The papers, prepared by lawyers Bradley Edwards and Paul Cassell, also claim Epstein 'trafficked Jane Doe #3 for sexual purposes to many other powerful men, including numerous prominent American politicians, powerful business executives, foreign presidents, a well-known Prime Minister, and other world leaders. 'Epstein required Jane Doe #3 to describe the events that she had with these men so that he could potentially blackmail them,' say the attorneys . 'Epstein instructed Jane Doe #3 that she was to give the Prince whatever he demanded and required Jane Doe #3 to report back to him on the details of the sexual abuse. Maxwell facilitated Prince Andrew's acts of sexual abuse by acting as a ""madame"" for Epstein, thereby assisting in internationally trafficking Jane Doe #3 (and numerous other young girls) for sexual purposes.' Andrew was photographed with his arm around Roberts in 2001, with Ghislaine Maxwell standing next to them. Both Andrew and Dershowitz have strenuously denied the allegations and Rodriguez, who went to jail for refusing to hand over a book of Epstein's sexual escapades to prosecutors, could have shed more light on whether the two men were really involved.

"This map reveals the damage alcohol is causing around the country. With soaring rates of hospital admissions - and alcohol-related liver disease - a new study has mapped how much Britons in each region are drinking – and how many are dying as a result. It found Central Scotland is the booze capital of Britain, with residents drinking 20.9 units a week, the equivalent of almost two bottles of wine and a shot. The alcohol consumption for this area of Scotland – which includes Glasgow and Dundee  - is 18 per cent higher than the national average. Scroll down for video . This map shows the alcohol hotspots of Great Britain. The boxes reveal how many units of alcohol per week are drunk by residents in the area, and how many alcohol related deaths per 100,000 adults in the area. The study found Scotland and the South West drank the most units, while London and the East of England drank the least . More people die of alcohol related deaths than in any other region, with 24.5 deaths per 100,000 population. This is more than double the rate for London, which had the lowest rate of 9.4 alcohol-related deaths per 100,000 population. The study, by NHS Health Scotland, was the first to analyse alcohol sales data, an indicator of alcohol consumption, as well as alcohol-related deaths. It found people in the South West, Central Scotland, North East, North West and Yorkshire were the biggest boozers, with higher levels of alcohol sales per adult than the average for Great Britain. There were lower sales of alcohol in London, Central England and the East of England, the study found. The high volume of sales in South West England (19 per cent higher than the national average) was mostly due to spirits and cider sold through pubs and restaurants, but sales of wine through supermarkets and other off-licences were also high. However while the South West region had the joint highest consumption level, it had one of the lowest alcohol death rates. Researchers at NHS Health Scotland and the Glasgow Centre for Population Health suggested that this could be due to tourism. The South West, which was defined by the study as mainly Devon and Cornwall, had one of the smallest populations but also one of the highest rates of second homes. People who visit this area but do not live there would increase the sales figures for alcohol and would not show up for alcohol-related deaths. With soaring rates of hospital admissions - and alcohol-related liver disease - the study mapped how much Britons in each region are drinking – and how many are dying as a result. The high levels of alcohol consumption in the South West were attributed to tourism. People who visit this area but do not live there would increase the sales figures for alcohol, but not show up for alcohol-related deaths . And the stereotype about Scots and their love of whisky rang true, as both Scottish regions, but particularly Central Scotland, had substantially higher spirits sales than any other region, especially through off-licenses. In Yorkshire and the northern English regions, more beer was sold per adult than in any other region, with the drink accounting for 46 per cent of the market share for alcohol here. The biggest wine drinkers reside in the South and in South West England, with 35 per cent of the market share of wine sold here. The low volume of sales in London was because of lower sales through off-licences. It was also found that regions with higher sales per adult typically had higher rates of alcohol-related deaths. NHS officials warn death rates linked to alcohol-related liver disease have risen 'considerably' over the last few decades. Liver disease kills 11,000 people a year in England, despite the fact that major causes such as alcohol misuse and obesity are preventable. The lower limits for safe drinking recommended by doctors are set at 21 units for men and 14 for women. A small 125ml glass of 13 per cent wine contains 1.6 units, while a regular 4 per cent pint of lager contains 2.3 units. A 25ml single 40 per cent spirit and mixer contains one unit, while a 275ml bottle of 5.5 per cent alcopop contains 1.5 units. All previous studies have looked at alcohol consumption for regions in Great Britain based on self-reported data, which can be biased because of low response rates, the sample taken not being representative, and because people do not accurately report how much they drank. The use of alcohol sales data is a more accurate and objective way to estimate how much the country is really drinking. However, researchers warned this data is still subject to its own biases, such as wastage and spillage; consumption by tourists; and unrecorded alcohol, which includes homebrew, smuggled alcohol and alcohol intended for industrial and medical use. The study's lead Mark Robinson, of NHS Health Scotland, said: 'Our study provides support for the relationship between alcohol consumption and alcohol-related mortality across regions in Great Britain, which hasn't always been the case using survey data to estimate consumption. 'Future studies should consider the use of data from a range of different sources to provide a better understanding of alcohol consumption in GB, its relationship with alcohol-related harms, and the impact of different alcohol policy approaches.' The results were published in the journal BMC Public Health.","Study was the first to analyse alcohol sales data.Central Scotland drinks 18% more than the national average .

"Parents may worry that their children aren’t getting enough quality sleep. But now there’s a smart bed  that alerts parents when their child is asleep - as well as if they are venturing out of  bed -  to provide adults with sleep data via a smart app. The SleepIQ bed by Sleep Number in Minneapolis can also be adjusted to make it more comfortable if a child is tossing and turning. The SleepIQ bed (pictured) has built in sensors to alert parents when their child is asleep and out of their bed, providing them with sleep data via a smart app. It automatically adjusts to make the bed more comfortable if a child is tossing and turning . The bed made its debut at the International Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas and claims to be the only one in the world that adjusts with children as they grow. Children don’t need to wear a smartband or alternative wearable gadget in bed. Instead, the quality of their sleep is measured by sensors integrated in the bed, which monitor their presence, average breathing rate, heart rate and movement. It uses a full-body algorithm to assess quality of sleep. They are given a SleepIQ score for each night’s sleep, which parents can see using an accompanying app. An accompanying app has features for parents and children. It shpws their sleep data (pictured centre), including a nightly score called a SleepIQ to document the quality of a night's sleep (left) as well as check-lists for children when they wake up (right) The Bed comes with built-in sensors to measure a child’s average breathing rate and heart rate as well as their presence and movement, by using a full-body algorithm to assess quality of sleep. Data is shown in the accompanying ‘sleep dashboard’ app, which shows how well a child slept. Parents can also receive alerts via the app if their child has got out of bed, or is moving around a lot, perhaps indicating they are having a nightmare. The firmness of the bed can be adjusted to support children as they grow. The mattress can be tilted up for reading. Fun features such as a monster-detecting app and a light to guide children if they have to get up during the night are included. It also allows parents to monitor routines that affect sleep, such as exercise, caffeine and screen time, helping them to develop a routine that promotes a good night’s shut-eye. The bed sends an alert to the app when it detects a child is out of bed or is restless, such as if they are having a nightmare. Its firmness can be adjusted to change the level of comfort and support to suit children as they grow. A ‘head tilt’ feature for reading is built in and parents can remotely turn a light our after reading time using the app. There are also fun features such as a ‘monster scanner’ which uses a mobile phone to check for and fight monsters under the bed. An automatic light guides children if they need to get up in the middle of the night. The bed is available online and at Sleep Number stores in the US from around $1,000 (£659).
